0,"  LONDON/WASHINGTON Jan 7 Britain's BAE Systems Plc chose Jerry DeMuro to head its U.S. business, pinning its hopes on the former General Dynamics  executive to steer the weapons maker through U.S. military cuts that are expected to bite over the next decade.DeMuro, who will begin as president and chief executive of the U.S. unit on Feb. 1, will replace Linda Hudson, who announced her retirement in August last year. BAE, which announced the appointment on Tuesday, generates about 40 percent of its total revenue in the United States.Defense suppliers to the U.S. government face a challenging time over the next decade, given $487 billion in planned cuts to the U.S. military budget and additional sizeable reductions mandated by Congress.DeMuro, age 58, follows Hudson, 63, to BAE from U.S. weapons manufacturer General Dynamics. He was previously executive vice president and corporate vice president at General Dynamics's $11 billion information systems and technology group. DeMuro left General Dynamics in February 2013 after being passed over for company's top position, a job now held by Phebe Novakovic. ""His experience will be of immense benefit as the company strives to maintain its strong performance in the United States core defense market and increase its focus on new international and commercial opportunities,"" BAE Chief Executive Ian King said.At General Dynamics, DeMuro managed the acquisition and integration of 22 companies, as well as 8 divestitures, with a cumulative value of $5 billion, according to a fact sheet compiled by BAE.In its global business, BAE faced investor worries over its growth prospects last year after the United Arab Emirates pulled out of talks to buy 60 Eurofighter Typhoon combat jets in a $9.8 billion deal. Hudson, the first woman to head a major U.S. defense operation, said she worked closely with DeMuro at General Dynamics for many years and called him ""an experienced and compassionate leader.""""Jerry is an excellent choice to take the helm of this company that - thanks to your collective efforts over the past several years - has established itself as a major player in aerospace and national security,"" Hudson said in a blog posting for employees. Hudson, who joined BAE in 2007, said she would remain on the board of the U.S. unit as an outside director until April 2015.""After many decades in this industry I have been through good times and bad, seen spending go up and down, but the very best people and companies adapt, endure and continue to move forward to meet the needs of our customers,"" she said.Shares of BAE ended down 1.2 percent in trading Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.",2014-01-07,GD,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 1:07pm EST",UPDATE 2-BAE picks former General Dynamics exec to head U.S. unit,http://www.reuters.com//article/baesystems-usa-idUSL6N0KH24Y20140107?type=companyNews

15,"  NEW YORK Jan 28 The settlement of a dispute over the cancelled A-12 aircraft calls for Boeing Co to build three more EA-18G electronic attack planes for the U.S. Navy, but those jets won't extend the F/A-18 production line in St. Louis, according to Navy officials and company executives.The U.S. Justice Department announced a $400 million settlement agreement with Boeing and General Dynamics Corp  last week that includes the additional jets, which will be paid for by Boeing.U.S. Navy officials this week said the planes would be built along with 21 Growlers already being funded in fiscal year 2014 and delivered in calendar year 2016.Boeing officials said the additional jets would not extend production of the F/A-18 line beyond the currently planned date of the end of 2016.The company is awaiting details of the Pentagon's budget plan to fiscal 2015 to see if any additional orders for F/A-18s or EA-18Gs will be included, although Pentagon officials have repeatedly said they do not plan additional orders. Loren Thompson, analyst with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said he expected Boeing to launch a massive lobbying campaign to get more F/A-18s, also called Super Hornets, or their electronic attack cousins, added to the 2015 budget.""Boeing is determined to get more Super Hornets into the defense budget because if that doesn't happen they will soon have no fighter production line in the whole company,"" Thompson said.

16,"  * Pentagon arms tester cited issues with jet's radar* New Pentagon report says F/A-18 not effective for certain threatsBy Andrea Shalal-EsaNEW YORK, Jan 28 A settlement of a dispute over the cancelled A-12 aircraft calls for Boeing Co to build three more EA-18G electronic attack planes for the U.S. Navy, but those jets will not extend the F/A-18 production line in St. Louis, according to Navy officials and company executives.A new report by the Pentagon's top arms tester, meanwhile, criticized the Navy for failing to address longstanding deficiencies with the radar used on the F/A-18E/F model of the plane. It said the jet could not be effectively used in certain ""threat environments,"" although details were classified.The EA-18G electronic attack planes, by contrast, were proving operationally effective, the report said.The U.S. Justice Department announced a $400 million settlement agreement with Boeing and General Dynamics Corp  last week that includes providing the additional jets, which will be paid for by Boeing.U.S. Navy officials this week said the planes would be built along with 21 Growlers already being funded in fiscal year 2014 and delivered in calendar year 2016.Boeing officials said the additional jets would not extend production of the F/A-18 line beyond the currently planned date of the end of 2016. The company is awaiting details of the Pentagon's budget plan to fiscal 2015 to see if any additional orders for F/A-18s or EA-18Gs will be included, although Pentagon officials have repeatedly said they do not plan additional orders.Loren Thompson, analyst with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said he expected Boeing to launch a massive lobbying campaign to get more F/A-18s, also called Super Hornets, or electronic attack variants, added to the 2015 budget.""Boeing is determined to get more Super Hornets into the defense budget because if that doesn't happen, they will soon have no fighter production line in the whole company,"" he said.Thompson said the company faced an uphill climb, given continued pressure on military spending. ""In a budget environment where defense spending is capped, any money spent on a new initiative has to come out of some other program, which makes this an Olympic-scale selling job on Capitol Hill,"" Thompson said.REDUCED RELIABILITY The report by Michael Gilmore, chief U.S. weapons tester, said the plane's Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar continued to have software issues that reduced its reliability. Copies of the report circulated in Washington on Tuesday ahead of its formal release on Wednesday. ""Although the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet weapon system continues to be operationally effective and suitable for many threat environments, it has critical shortfalls,"" the report said, citing recent software and radar assessments.It released no details on which environments posed problems, citing a separate classified report.It said operational testing had not yet shown a statistically significant difference between the new radar and older systems used on earlier jets.Boeing had no immediate comment on the Pentagon report.Boeing says it needs to build about two F/A-18s a month to ensure economical production rates, which would require a foreign order, or a new U.S. order valued at just under $2 billion.Canada, which helped fund development of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter, is expected to make decisions in coming months about whether to proceed with F-35 orders or launch a new tender that could result in orders for the F/A-18 or other fighter planes.Boeing's F-15 fighter line, also in St. Louis, is slated to continue through 2018, buoyed by a large Saudi Arabian order.",2014-01-29,GD,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 11:50pm EST",UPDATE 1-A-12 settlement won't extend Boeing's F/A-18 production line,http://www.reuters.com//article/boeing-fighter-idUSL2N0L309C20140129?type=companyNews

20,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK, March 26  NEW YORK, March 26 Former employees of Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc, a major supplier to plane makers Boeing and Airbus, filed charges with federal agencies on Wednesday alleging that Spirit illegally used health care information to target those who were costing the company most for layoffs.Ten former employees claim they were selected when the company cut 360 positions last summer because they or covered family members had costly disabilities or medical conditions.Spirit's health care administrators shared information with high-level managers ""so that Spirit - in its role as employer - could identify the employees associated with the most expensive medical claims and target them for termination,"" according to one of the charges filed on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters.The charges, filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Civil Rights, request class status and also allege age discrimination, disability discrimination and violations of privacy rights, said Diane King, a lawyer with King and Greisen, a Denver law firm that assisted the employees.Ken Evans, a spokesman for Spirit, said the allegations ""are filled with distortions and misstatements. Personal health information is certainly not used to make layoff decisions.""All of the charges relate to the July 2013 layoffs, when Spirit cut the positions at its facilities in Wichita, Kansas, including 221 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), a Seattle-based union that also represents workers at Boeing.Evans said SPEEA had made unfounded allegations before, including several charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board last year related to the job cuts that were either withdrawn or dismissed by the board.""While terminations are always difficult, all such decisions are based on job-related, non-discriminatory criteria, and Spirit has made every effort to carry them out with respect for our employees,"" Evans said in a statement. The job cuts were necessary in a competitive, cost-sensitive industry, Evans said, and Spirit provided the laid-off employees with severance and help finding new jobs.PRESSURE TO CUT COSTS King said circumstantial evidence supports the employees belief that top Spirit managers misused individual employees' health care information, but she declined to provide details.She did not immediately provide any statistical analysis showing that a higher proportion of those with expensive medical costs were among those laid off. Spirit has been under pressure to cut costs and since 2012 has set aside more than $2.2 billion in provisions for future losses on unprofitable contracts.The company was formed in 2005 when Boeing Co spun off some of its facilities. It makes parts for all major Boeing jets, including about 40 fuselages a month for Boeing's top-selling 737 jetliner.Spirit also makes parts for Airbus, Bombardier Inc , Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp  and Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota Motor Corp.The losses at Spirit prompted it to undertake a strategic review last year and consider sale of facilities in Oklahoma. If the employee charges are substantiated, penalties could include back pay, out-of-pocket health care costs, job reinstatement or forward pay through retirement in lieu of employment, plus attorneys fees, according to lawyers with knowledge of these kinds of claims.The case raises questions about possible misuse of health information gathered by companies through self insurance or wellness programs.In interviews, two former Spirit employees said they were singled out by upper management and that their own supervisors didn't know their performance ratings were being cut until just before it happened.""They tried to make it look like it was performance issues,"" said Debra, 54, a former quality analyst, whose husband is in need of two organ transplants.She and other employees and family members who spoke with Reuters declined to have their full names used out of concern for the privacy of their medical and employment information.She said she received a ""B"" retention rating on Spirit's A-C rating scale during a previous review. On July 1, her rating was lowered to a ""C,"" and she was told she was not eligible for recall rights if she was laid off. Her direct supervisor wanted to give her an ""A,"" she said.On July 25, she and the other employees were let go.Scott, 51, a planner, said his rating also was downgraded to C from B at the same time and he was also laid off. He said his daughter requires expensive medical treatment for two conditions.

21,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Navy hopes to save money and time by leveraging industry investments as it replaces its Ohio-class nuclear-armed submarines with the Virginia-class attack submarines now built by General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.Navy chief weapons buyer Sean Stackley told the Senate Armed Services Committee's seapower subcommittee on Thursday that Navy officials were studying ways to drive down the cost of the new submarine, including a combined purchase that would include another batch of Virginia-class submarines.The first Ohio-class ship will be funded in fiscal 2021, with advanced procurement to begin in 2019.The congressional Government Accountability Office estimated last month that it would cost $95 billion to develop and build a dozen new submarines to replace the current fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines as they begin to retire in 2027. The Navy views the Ohio-class replacement as its biggest priority, but is asking Congress to help find funding from elsewhere in the Pentagon budget, given that the program will eat up the lion's share of the Navy's annual shipbuilding budget from 2021 on.Stackley said the Navy was also exploring other ways to drive down the cost of the huge new program and ensure that U.S. companies were ready to take on the increased work.""What we want to do is leverage the volume between the two programs going through the industrial base ... so that we get the affordability we need and hold onto the quality and the schedule performance that we currently enjoy on the Virginia-class program,"" Stackley told reporters after a hearing about the Navy's shipbuilding budget. Stackley said the acquisition strategy for the new submarines was still being worked out, including how the work would be divided between General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls at a time when they will also be building more Virginia-class submarines. He said there was no talk about shifting to just one producer, given the importance of the submarine industrial base.""Nothing has been decided,"" Stackley said. General Dynamics is the prime contractor working on the design of the warships, while Huntington Ingalls is a subcontractor, but that could change when the Navy moves into procurement, Stackley said.Stackley said the need to invest in facilities, tooling and other equipment for construction of the new submarines would help determine a schedule for the Navy's acquisition strategy since the Navy wanted to avoid having the companies duplicate investments.""We'll be engaging with industry at the right time,"" he said.

26,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, April 16  WASHINGTON, April 16 The U.S. Navy on Wednesday said it would delay the commissioning of the North Dakota, a new Virginia-class submarine that was due to enter active service on May 31, to carry out more design work and resolve quality problems with certain components.The submarine, built jointly by General Dynamics Corp  and Huntington Ingalls Industries, is returning to drydock for the additional work, according to the submarine's Facebook site. It said no new commissioning date had been set.Colleen O'Rourke, spokeswoman for Naval Sea Systems Command, said the Navy decided to delay the commissioning because the ship needed additional design and certification work on its redesigned bow, and because of ""material issues"" with certain vendor-assembled and delivered components.""The Navy is committed to ensuring the safety of its crews and ships. High quality standards for submarine components are an important part of the overall effort to ensure safety,"" O'Rourke said. She did not provide details on the faulty parts. It was not immediately clear who would pay for the additional work, or how soon the ship would be commissioned.O'Rourke said the lessons learned from work on the North Dakota were already being applied to the other follow-on ships in the next batch of submarines being built. Bob Hamilton, spokesman for Electric Boat, the General Dynamics unit that serves as the prime contractor for the submarines, said his company still expected to deliver the ship by the original deadline of Aug. 31.Sources familiar with the submarine program said the Navy was taking a second look at 63 different components, including some used in the ship's stern, rudder and hydraulic systems. Typically in weapons manufacturing, if quality problems are found with one component, all other components made by the same supplier are also reviewed carefully.The Congressional Research Service estimates that each Virginia-class submarine costs about $2.7 billion to build. The first of the new class of submarines entered service in 2004.The North Dakota is the first of eight ships in Block III of the Virginia-class submarines, a new design that is about 40 percent different from the previous submarines.That means the ship is essentially the first in a new class, and the first ship often has problems associated with a new design.

27,"  (Adds comments from Northrop, General Dynamics CEOs, updates shares)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, April 23 U.S. arms makers complain regularly that lower Pentagon spending on ships, jets and other hardware will hit their earnings, but a string of better-than-expected results this week show that layoffs and cost-cutting have kept profits flowing, and growing.Defense majors Lockheed Martin Corp, General Dynamics Corp, and Northrop Grumman Corp have all reported higher profits this week and raised their full-year forecasts. In response, the Dow Jones index that tracks the 10 biggest aerospace and defense companies rose 2.2 percent on Wednesday.Weapons makers turned to workforce cuts and other efficiency efforts as early as 2007 to shore up their profits, and have also concentrated on stock buybacks and strong dividends, said defense consultant Loren Thompson.""The gradual decline in military spending has given the companies fewer opportunities to invest in new programs, so they  are returning their cash flow to shareholders,"" said Thompson, who runs the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.He said the crisis in Ukraine and other emerging threats could strengthen demand for military equipment in the United States and overseas, and help stave off an expected decline in defense shares as spending cuts further erode revenues. Company executives say the budget environment remains tough,  since mandatory federal cuts are due to resume in 2016. Still, work on big-ticket items like ships, planes and satellites would shore up revenues since those orders are either already on the books or part of multi-year agreements being negotiated now.Lockheed shares were up 3.3 percent at $161.94 after Australia announced plans to buy 58 more of the company's F-35 fighter jets in coming years.Lockheed, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, had on Tuesday reported a 23 percent jump in first-quarter net profit and raised its 2014 earnings-per-share outlook by 2.5 percent. Lockheed, General Dynamics and Northrop all reported higher operating margins in the latest quarter, and said they would continue efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiency.Northrop, which makes unmanned planes, the B-2 bomber and electronic equipment, on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook by about 2 percent, to a range of $8.90 to $9.15 per share.  Northrop shares rose 1.8 percent to $121.96.CEO Wes Bush attributed the rise in Northrop's EPS in part to share repurchases; the company had about 9 percent fewer shares outstanding during the latest quarter.""While the U.S. budget environment continues to be challenging, particularly for our short-cycle businesses, we have a good long-term set of opportunities that includes ... potential for continued growth in international sales,"" Bush told analysts on an earnings call. He said the sale of Global Hawk unmanned planes now being negotiated with South Korea could lead to additional foreign sales of unmanned systems for the company.General Dynamics, which makes Gulfstream business jets, tanks and U.S. warships, raised its guidance for 2014 earnings per share by nearly 4 percent after posting higher-than-expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter. Its shares were up 3.6 percent at $111.90 in late trading.Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic told analysts that U.S. weapons spending had ""troughed,"" or hit a low point, and that a big rise in backlog showed the company is well-positioned. She said the firm planned to return ""most, if not all"" of its free cash flow to investors via stock repurchases or dividends.Novakovic described ""blocking and tackling"" to lower costs. ""I don't think you can ever get away from the absolute requirement to improve your operating performance quarter over quarter,"" she said.

The Pentagon notified Congress last November that it had waived the prototyping requirement for the Army's Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program due to ""excessive cost,"" triggering a mandatory review by GAO.GAO said that in justifying the lack of prototypes, the Army and Pentagon cited market research that found the requirements for the new vehicle could be met by modifying existing combat vehicles with mission packages that had already been fielded and prototyped.

43,"  * Top weapons buyer says ""No silver bullet""* U.S. Navy names General Dynamics, Lockheed units ""superior suppliers""* Shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls fails to make U.S. Navy listBy Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 13 The U.S. Navy on Friday named units of top arms makers General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co as part of its list of the top-performing nine suppliers for 2014 based on their performance over the last three years.The Pentagon said on Friday it would use such public recognition of ""superior suppliers,"" incentives and competition as key tools in its ongoing drive to end years of cost overruns and schedule delays on key weapons programs. Top U.S. arms buyer Frank Kendall said the Navy developed the list as a pilot project this year, but he had asked the Air Force and Army to compile their own lists this year as part of the continuing effort to improve defense acquisition.""We want to recognize their performance, but we also want to motivate our performers who are not on that list to do better,"" Kendall told reporters as he released a second annual report on the Pentagon's procurement, development and operating budgets, which totalled over $350 billion in fiscal 2015 budget request.The nine companies also included units of General Electric , Northrop Grumman Corp, a venture of Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and Britain's Rolls Royce Holdings Plc. One notable exception was Huntington Ingalls Industries , one of the Navy's largest suppliers, and builder of aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships.Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley said the suppliers that did make the list would be offered the chance to reduce certain contract requirements, including removal of some procedures, inspections or requirements, which could lead to cost savings.Kendall said the Pentagon had imposed affordability targets on 30 of its biggest programs and all but two or three were within those caps. But he said uncertainty about future budget levels continued to hamper more efficient investment decisions. He said the Pentagon remained focused on improving the way it buys hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and services each year, but there was no single ""silver bullet"" to do that.Instead, he said the department needed to work on multiple fronts, including efforts to simplify the overlapping laws that govern defense acquisitions, better training for federal workers that administer contracts, and deeper analysis of past programs.""Defense acquisition is complicated and varying,"" he wrote in the 116-page report. ""We must empower, encourage and train our workforce to think - not dictate a cookbook that workforce members blindly follow.""The report cited good results from contracts with incentive fees, but said incentives were sometimes counterproductive and the Pentagon did not always use such measures as well as it could.Kendall also highlighted the importance of competition, but  said the department needed to get more creative about injecting competition into the process given declining defense budgets and growing consolidation in the industry.

44,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani  U.S. weapons makers General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) raised their 2014 profit forecasts as cost cutting allowed them to improve profitability even as defense spending by the U.S. government remained low.The companies, which reported better-than-expected second-quarter profits on Wednesday, have kept a tight lid on operational costs to overcome the effect of U.S. budget cuts.They have also held their stock prices up by returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and strong dividends.General Dynamics, maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, said on Wednesday it expected to repurchase shares in the second half of 2014. The company has spent about $2.7 billion on share buybacks so far this year.""Such results will continue to build (General Dynamics') investors' confidence in the CEO's focus on profitability and cash deployment,"" RBC Capital Markets' Robert Stallard wrote in a note. The company raised its forecast for full-year earnings to $7.40-$7.45 per share from $7.05-$7.10.General Dynamics said its total potential contract value, the sum of all backlog, rose 29 percent to $99.5 billion in the second quarter ended June 29 - its highest in the past four years.

Qatar Airways, the state-owned flag carrier of Qatar, will order up to 20 Gulfstream aircraft, including the newly launched G500 and the G650ER. Gulfstream said the new G500 and G600 aircraft would be made at its plants in Savannah, Georgia. The company said it would also produce the wings and vertical and horizontal stabilizers for both aircraft.Gulfstream's move to swap out a couple of major suppliers and manufacture wings at its own plants is likely to reduce the company's risk, RBC Capital Markets analysts Robert Stallard wrote in a note. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N) is the wing supplier for Gulfstream's G650 and G280 jets, while Triumph Group Inc (TGI.N) supplies wings for the company's G450 and G550 jets.""Spirit continues to produce wings for Gulfstream products.

Dallas-based Flexjet, a fractional jet ownership and leasing company, will order up to 50 aircraft, including the 16-seat G450, the new G500 and the flagship G650, Gulfstream said.Qatar Airways, the state-owned flag carrier of Qatar, will order up to 20, including the G500 and the G650ER for its Qatar Executive charter service.The G600 has a list price of $54.5 million and is able to fly from London to Singapore at Mach 0.85, Gulfstream said, and the $43.5 million G500 can fly from London to Bangalore at the same speed. The prices are about $10 million less than the G550 and G650 models.Both new jets will have shorter ranges than Gulfstream's longest range G650ER. The G500 cabin will be seven inches wider than the G550, and seven inches narrower than the G650. Both will seat up to 19 passengers. The jets will be made at Gulfstream's plants in Savannah, Georgia.

61,"   By Andrea Shalal and David Alexander | SIMI VALLEY Calif.  SIMI VALLEY Calif. The U.S. military's ability to stay ahead of technology advances by other countries and respond to multiple crises around the world is already in jeopardy and will get worse unless mandatory budget cuts are reversed, top U.S. officials warned on Saturday.Former defense secretary Robert Gates said the budget cuts were eroding confidence in U.S. leadership around the world and that it was time to end the ""incredibly stupid"" reductions.Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert told Reuters the Navy would have to cut forces and reduce its ability to position ships around the world if lawmakers did not ease or reverse the cuts, which are due to resume in fiscal 2016.""Electronic warfare, electronic attack, anti-submarine warfare - all of these higher-end areas - will fall further behind because we’re just not investing in them,"" he said in an interview at a conference at the Reagan Presidential Library. He said the Navy's ability to stay ahead of potential adversaries would ""degrade significantly"" unless the cuts ended. On Saturday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced a push for new weapons, including robotics, autonomous systems, miniaturization, big data and additive manufacturing, to ensure continued U.S. military dominance. Greenert and other U.S. officials are urging Congress to end the cuts known as ""sequestration"", citing growing strains amid increasing threats, including Russia's aggression in the Crimea region, and Islamic State militancy in Iraq and Syria. Executives with Lockheed Martin Corp, Huntington Ingalls Industries and Raytheon Co said they were cutting overheads to drive down weapons costs but budget uncertainty limited their ability to make needed investments.Republican Senator John McCain, who is expected to take over as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee in January, said ending military budget cuts would be his highest priority.Admiral James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the conference that procurement of new weapons had slowed, even as escalating demands around the world made it difficult to restore the military's readiness for new missions. ""We aren’t modernizing as fast as we should in a highly competitive, technical landscape. Almost every element of our forced structure is shrinking while potential threats expand,"" he said.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said half of U.S. combat air forces were not at the needed level of training and maintenance to respond to crises.

64,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON General Dynamics Corp, a key provider of cyber services for the U.S. government, said recent high-profile cyberattacks were boosting demand from government agencies for better protections against breaches by so-called insiders.Nadia Short, vice president and general manager of cyber systems for General Dynamics' Mission Systems business, told Reuters in an interview this week the well-publicized hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment had galvanized interest in the security of U.S. government and industry computer networks.She said the Sony attack, which Washington has blamed on North Korea, was resonating with the American public in a way that earlier attacks on private companies had not, and could boost the prospects for passage of cybersecurity legislation.Short welcomed President Barack Obama's push for cybersecurity legislation and greater sharing of information by industry and government about potential threats.She said continued cyberattacks and the large number of documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden were prompting government agencies to beef up security against outside attackers as well as the so-called insider threat. Four or five government agencies have requested information or proposals over the last six months focused on insider threat detection, Short said. She declined to name the agencies.Short said insider attacks were difficult to eliminate completely, but the company offered services that could detect unusual behaviors that almost always preceded such incidents. The company also does forensic studies when breaches occur and offers network encryption devices, she said. Even tracking printer use at unusual times or thermostat activity could help officials predict abnormal behaviors.While U.S. military spending has declined in recent years, demand for cybersecurity has remained stable and even grown significantly in some areas, Short said. Like other defense contractors, General Dynamics has found it difficult to penetrate the commercial market, but Short said there was growing demand in the government sector. Short said the company's decision last fall to combine its cyber and engineering services units had given her division more breadth, access to more expertise and to new customers, and the ability to engineer more comprehensive security solutions.""Across the board, I see this as still being a growth area for us,"" Short said. She declined to provide details about the amount of revenue generated in the cyber business, but said General Dynamics planned to increase investment in the sector and would likely hire more workers this year.

68,"  (Adds details, further changes)WASHINGTON Feb 2 The U.S. Defense Department's budget request would boost funding for research, development and procurement of weapons by 13 percent to $190 billion in fiscal 2016, including nearly $11 billion for the Lockheed Martin Corp  F-35 fighter jet.Following is a list of key programs and funding levels proposed for the fiscal 2016 year, which begins Oct. 1, the department said Monday. All measures must still be approved by Congress.The budget requested:- $10.6 billion for 57 Lockheed F-35 fighter jets.- $3.4 billion for 16 P-8 maritime surveillance planes built by Boeing Co.- $1.3 billion for five E-2D battle management aircraft built by Northrop Grumman Corp.- $3 billion for continued development of Boeing's KC-46A refueling planes, or tankers.- $1.2 billion for a new bomber for the Air Force, which plans to announce a winner soon in a competition that pits Northrop against a Boeing-Lockheed team. - $1.4 billion for continued work by General Dynamics Corp  and Northrop on a replacement for the aging Ohio-class submarines that carry nuclear weapons.- $11.6 billion for nine new ships, including smaller coastal warships built by Lockheed and Australia's Austal  , an aircraft carrier being built by Huntington Ingalls Industries, and other submarines and ships built by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls.- $1.6 billion to improve the reliability of interceptors in the Ground-based Missile Defense system managed by Boeing.- $1.56 billion for 79 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. - $1.2 billion for CH-47 helicopters built by Boeing.- $1.1 billion for 64 remanufactured Boeing Apache AH-64 helicopters.- $821 million for procurement of more MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aircraft built by privately held General Atomics.- $5.5 billion for cybersecurity programs which could benefit Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrop and Raytheon Co , among others.- Accelerates by two years the development of a new Long Range Stand-Off Weapon to be used on the new bomber. RESEARCH FOCUS The Pentagon budget plan would boost funding for research and development programs by 6.3 percent to $69.8 billion, a move welcomed by industry, which has long urged the Pentagon to keep investing in longer-term projects.It would fund high-speed strike weapons, a new initiative to start work on a sixth-generation fighter, a railgun weapon that fires at seven times the speed of sound, as well as improved navigation and timing equipment, and high-energy lasers.PROGRAM CUTS - The budget again seeks to retire the popular A-10 ""Warthog"" close air support aircraft for savings of $382 million, a move sure to anger Congress, which rejected a similar proposal last year.- It proposes $87 million in additional savings by halting production of the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) built by Raytheon. The Navy said it had sufficient JSOW weapons in inventory and other weapons to handle future needs.

69,"  WASHINGTON Feb 2 The U.S. Air Force's fiscal 2016 budget released on Monday delayed a long-awaited competition for a new air-ground surveillance aircraft to replace the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS).The budget plan said it had restructured the program's acquisition strategy to allow more time for technology development and reduce risk, which delayed the target date for initial combat use by one year to fiscal 2023.The JSTARS program has been delayed repeatedly, although potential bidders had been heartened by statements from Air Force officials in recent months, as they began to talk about the program as a key priority. Northrop Grumman Corp built the current JSTARS based on a Boeing 707 commercial airliner, and is keen to bid to build a replacement. Boeing Co, Bombardier Inc, and General Dynamics Corp's Gulfstream unit are also expected to bid for the work. To fund the new program, the Air Force said it would divest its E-8C test capability, and had drafted a plan to retire all E-8C between fiscal 2025 and 2026. It also said it would delay the retirement of five E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) to fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2016 to help meet the needs of military commanders.

The company said in September it would work more closely with the U.S. Air Force and Navy, which have fared better in recent defense spending cuts than the Army.Harris's products include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems for customers that include the U.S. National Security Agency and the Department of Defense.The company's website cites a 2012 report that ranked it the 11th largest supplier to the U.S. government. U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp  and General Dynamics Corp have cut costs and increased exposure to international markets as the Pentagon tries to reduce spending by $1 trillion over a decade.Harris is offering $16.625 in cash and 0.1025 of its shares for each Exelis share.

82,"  * Mitsubishi testing amphibious assault vehicle prototype* In talks with BAE Systems and General Dynamics on body design* Eyes overseas sales after PM ended ban on arms exports - sources* Prototype was shown to senior U.S. Marine general - sources* Japan forming own marine unit as it shifts defence postureBy Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro KuboTOKYO, June 24 In January, a top U.S. Marine general visited Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan to look at a prototype of an amphibious assault vehicle that could one day be a key pillar in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to sell weapons abroad.Using engines adapted from the main battle tank the company makes for Japan's military and new water jet propulsion technology, the full-size prototype is undergoing pool tests, although it is in the early stages of development and production could be years off.Nevertheless, the maker of the wartime Zero fighter plane is eyeing overseas sales after Abe lifted a decades-old ban on arms exports in April last year as part of his more muscular security agenda, two Japanese defence industry sources said.Mitsubishi designers believe the prototype shown to U.S. Marine Corps Pacific commander Lieutenant General John Toolan will be more maneuverable and faster across the water than the 40-year-old AAV7 amphibious assault vehicle used to carry U.S. marines onto beaches from naval ships anchored offshore, the sources said.The AAV7 is built by the U.S. unit of Britain's BAE Systems .The prototype's engines in particular could be fitted onto other armoured vehicles, the sources added.""It's an opportunity for Mitsubishi Heavy to tap overseas markets for its engine technology,"" said one of the sources, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media. Mitsubishi Heavy wants to build an amphibious armoured vehicle that can move through water at 20 to 25 knots (37 to 46 km per hour) compared to the more than 7 knots (13 km per hour) reached by the AAV7, said the sources.""If the Japanese can get 20 knots in the water without compromising maneuverability on land, we will be very interested,"" said one Marine Corps official who saw the prototype in January but declined to be identified.""Whether that's possible remains to be seen.""A Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman said the prototype had been shown to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, but declined to give details about the vehicle. At a Paris arms show last June, a suitcase-sized model of an eight-wheeled armoured troop carrier was the centerpiece display at the company's exhibition booth.The Ministry of Defense was aware of Mitsubishi Heavy's research into amphibious vehicles but was not involved in the project, a ministry spokesman said.Manny Pacheco, a spokesman for U.S. Marine Corps procurement, declined to comment on the prototype.But he said the Marine Corps was ""always interested in the technological advances of industry"" and encouraged manufacturers to use ""every opportunity to showcase their wares and get their products submitted through our competitive procurement process"". TOUGH TECHNOLOGY Amphibious vehicles are central to marine units around the world, allowing forces to operate on land and sea. But there has been little significant technological advancement in such vehicles in recent decades.A tracked Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle that was being developed for the U.S. Marine Corps by U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp was cancelled in 2011 after big cost increases and technical issues.The Marine Corps last year kicked off a competition for a new wheeled amphibious combat vehicle (ACV) that could operate on shorelines and shallow water.Pacheco said the Marine Corps was reviewing proposals from five manufacturers to build a prototype. He did not identify the companies.A feasibility study by BAE and General Dynamics had recommended against using current technology to build a vehicle in line with Marine Corps requirements, a U.S.-based BAE spokeswoman told Reuters. ""The study concluded that although the technology existed, it would not be fielded at an affordable price,"" she said.BAE was talking to Mitsubishi Heavy about being a potential partner on the body design of the new Japanese vehicle, the BAE spokeswoman added.General Dynamics was in similar talks with Mitsubishi Heavy, said sources in Japan. General Dynamics said it did ""not have any information to provide at this time"".NEED FOR SPEED Mitsubishi Heavy has been making armoured vehicles for Japan's military for around 80 years, beginning with the Imperial forces in the 1930s. It also builds fighter aircraft, naval vessels, submarines and missiles.The company also makes high-speed marine engines and water jet propulsion systems, according to its website.""Japan's technology is good enough that we have to look at it,"" said a U.S. military industrial source familiar with the amphibious vehicle plans.Although a coastal nation, post-war Japan only formed an amphibious military unit in 2012. The 3,000-strong unit will be equipped with more than 50 AAV7s.It was disappointment at the speed of those vehicles over water that spurred Japan to build a new one, Japanese defense officials told Reuters.Japan's military is also concerned about the ability of the caterpillar-tracked vehicles to ride over coral reefs, a common feature in the East China Sea, where Tokyo is embroiled in a territorial dispute with China.The BAE spokeswoman acknowledged the desire of the U.S. Marine Corps to increase water speed, adding there should be ""no operational concern"" with coral reefs.

The announcement comes after years of cuts - Britain has reduced defence spending by about 8 percent in real terms since 2010 to help cut a record budget deficit.

Investors tend to take a cautious stand ahead of such meetings and that's why we aren't seeing too much a rally today,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.At 11:18 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 87.22 points, or 0.49 percent, at 17,717.49, the S&P 500  was up 9.08 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,102.33 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.80 points, or 0.13 percent, at 5,096.00. Eight of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher with the industrials index's 0.92 percent rise leading the advancers.Pledges from Chinese regulators to buy shares to stabilize stocks if needed and hints of more policy easing from the central bank also soothed sentiments.U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Tuesday, breaking a five-day losing streak as attention shifted from trouble in Chinese equities to U.S. corporate earnings.With second-quarter reports well under way, analysts now expect overall earnings of S&P 500 companies to edge up 0.8 percent and revenue to decline 3.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.While earnings are expected to increase this quarter, valuations remain a concern. The S&P 500 is trading near 16.9 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.

94,"  (Recasts lead with both Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics interested in new icebreakers, adds quote from General Dynamics)WASHINGTON, Sept 1 U.S. Navy shipbuilders Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc and General Dynamics Corp on Tuesday said they were keen to build new icebreakers for the Coast Guard, after President Barack Obama pushed for quicker work on the program.Obama on Tuesday proposed buying a heavy icebreaker by 2020 instead of 2022, the previous goal, given that quickly melting sea ice has spurred more maritime traffic in the Arctic and the United States has fallen far behind Russian resources.The initiative faces an uphill battle in Congress, which has been politically divided for years over mandatory budget cuts  and where many Republicans remain skeptical about climate change.Huntington Ingalls built the newest icebreaker in the U.S. fleet, the USCG Healy, which was delivered in November 1999. Huntington Ingalls spokesman Bill Glenn said his company had responded to a request for information from the Coast Guard on icebreaker design and construction in January as the service began developing a formal acquisition plan for the program.""HII has the capability and capacity to build both heavy and medium icebreakers and welcomes the opportunity to expand discussion on that subject with the U.S. Coast Guard or other government agencies supporting an icebreaker requirement,"" Glenn said. General Dynamics also welcomed Obama's announcement.""General Dynamics NASSCO is very interested in supporting a new icebreaker program. We have extensive experience in manufacturing heavy- and medium-weight steel commercial ships, and the manufacturing skills and methods needed to build modern polar icebreakers,"" spokeswoman Lucy Ryan said. She said NASSCO was currently building 10 commercial ships, including the world's first series of energy efficient container ships powered by liquefied natural gas.The Coast Guard, which has long sought funding for a new icebreaker, had no immediate comment.Coast Guard officials argue that increasing commerce and traffic in the Arctic Ocean, including petrochemical exploration and fisheries, require the United States to maintain robust polar icebreaking capability to ensure year-round Coast Guard presence in the region.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Tom Brown and Leslie Adler)",2015-09-02,GD,"Tue Sep 1, 2015 | 9:05pm EDT","UPDATE 1-Huntington Ingalls, GD eager to build U.S. icebreakers",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-icebreakers-idUSL1N11800Y20150902?type=companyNews

The cost of the expected repairs to be carried out by General Dynamics at its NASCCO shipyard was not yet clear, a Navy spokesman said.General Dynamics last year won a contract to perform maintenance of the Navy's two different types of Littoral Combat Ships, including the steel monohull version built by Lockheed. The Navy last month removed Commander Michael Atwell as commander of the Fort Worth after an investigation into the Jan. 12 incident, which has been linked to crew error.The issue occurred during an operational test of the ship's port and starboard main propulsion diesel engines, when a lack of lube oil triggered high-temperature alarms on both sets of gears, a Navy official has said. Combining gears allow the Fort Worth to configure different types and combinations of engines for propulsion at sea. The ship left San Diego in November 2014 and was on a 16-month deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet.The Navy said it decided to complete full repair of the combining gears in San Diego due to maintenance timelines, the efficiency of repairs and available docking space at the shipyard. Doing the repairs during a previously scheduled maintenance period would reduce the overall cost, it said. The Navy's newest class of warships, which were designed to carry out a range of missions, including hunting for mines, submarines and surface warfare, have suffered a series of technical issues in recent years.The accident occurred just weeks after Defense Secretary Ash Carter told Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to end orders of the LCS class ships at 40, instead of ordering 52 ships as previously planned.

133,"   By Mike Stone and Patricia Zengerle | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. defense contractors, which saw international sales rise strongly under President Barack Obama's administration, can expect a continued boom in arms exports under Donald Trump, aided by persistent security risks in the Middle East and rising tensions in Asia and Europe.Shares of major defense contractors, including Raytheon Co.  (RTN.N), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and General Dynamics (GD.N) hit lifetime highs, on Wednesday as investors bet on higher Pentagon spending under  Trump, who has vowed a massive build-up of the U.S. military even as he pledges to reduce foreign entanglements.While Trump has frequently made contradictory statements when it comes to foreign policy, he has repeatedly called on  allies in Europe and East Asia to pay more for their own defense. Defense experts say that could benefit the domestic industry as Trump is expected to keep supporting the supply of U.S. arms exports to allies to help them build up their own defense capabilities.""From the U.S. side it would be us equipping them to do that,"" said Roman Schweizer an analyst at Cowan & Co.That would also fit with Trump's plan to stimulate the domestic economy by boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs.A Trump administration will have ""more openness to selling weapons to our allies and partners. It’s business friendly, it plays to the U.S. manufacturing base,"" said Mark Cancian, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.U.S. arms exports, measured by production costs, grew 54 percent in 2015 from 2008, the year before President Barack Obama took office, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. That represents the highest growth for any administration since the Truman and Eisenhower presidencies following World War Two.The boom was fueled by consistent lobbying by the Obama administration for arms deals, its policy of arming and training proxy groups in conflicts, and by budget constraints at home that prompted arms makers to look abroad for sales. In 2015, the U.S. accounted for 36 percent of worlds arms exports, the Stockholm Institute's data shows, followed by Russia at 12 percent. That marked an increase in the U.S. share from 28 percent in 2008. In fiscal 2015, U.S. arms sales to foreign governments exceeded $47 billion, up 36 percent from around $34 billion a year earlier, according to the Department of Defense. Saudi Arabia, Australia, Iraq, Korea and Taiwan -- all considered U.S. allies -- were the top five recipients of U.S. weapons in the year ended September 2015. GLOBAL CONFLICTS Trump has never spelled out how he would deploy additional manpower for the U.S. military, such as 60,000 more Army troops, as many as 10,000 more Marines, and dozens of new Navy ships and fighter jets.Independent cost estimates for his plan range from $150 billion to $900 billion in additional spending over 10 years, which could be achieved only by raising the federal budget deficit, raising taxes or making large cuts in spending programs such as healthcare benefits for older Americans.None of these is politically popular, and raising the deficit would face fierce resistance from the deficit-fighting Freedom Caucus wing of the Republican Party.Trump's lack of national security credentials and scarce detail about his possible advisors also make it difficult to assess his impact on foreign policy. Nevertheless, analysts say his call for a stronger U.S. military against the backdrop of rising global conflicts, bodes well for strong revenues.“I think that foreign military sales would absolutely go up, or at the very least stay at its current level,” said Franklin Turner, co-leader of law firm McCarter English’s government contracts & export controls practice.""I can't imagine that the world becomes a less violent place.""Raytheon Co, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, said its international business will continue to grow regardless of the change of administration. During the 2008-2015 period, its international sales grew 55 percent to $7.15 billion.""Raytheon has been in business for over 90 years, over the time we have obviously worked with presidents from both parties,"" Chief Financial Officer Toby O’Brien told Reuters in an interview. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the Pentagon's No.1 contractor known for its Hellfire missiles and F-35 fighter jets, increased international sales by 74 percent during Obama's presidency to $9.5 billion in 2015.Boeing Co's (BA.N) international defense sales rose 28 percent in the last five years to $9.4 billion in 2015, while Northrop Grumman Corp's (NOC.N) foreign sales grew 60 percent over the same period to $3.3 billion.There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. companies. Direct commercial sales, negotiated between a government and a company; and foreign military sales, where a foreign government typically contacts a Department of Defense official at the U.S. embassy in their capital. Both require approval by the U.S. government.Some major sales have been held up by members of Congress, who fear U.S. arms could be used to fuel foreign conflicts, quell popular unrest or facilitate human rights violations.Congress has oversight over major weapons sales, including those that are completely or partly financed by the U.S. government, and it is highly unusual for sales to go ahead if there are strong objections from lawmakers.    “Congress has never been a rubber stamp on arms transfers. We exercise close oversight and will continue to do so under the next president,” said Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington, said the government and companies often are not ""paying sufficient attention to the long-term impact of weaponizing key regions"" while trying to sell to ""win friends and allies.""""When several warring states in a region are being amply supplied with new weapons, they are more tempted to use those weapons,"" Kimball said.
