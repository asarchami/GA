0,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Garima Goel  Oilfield service companies Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) said they expect an improvement in North American margins, driven by a modest pickup in onshore activity and strong deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Halliburton and Baker Hughes, No. 2 and No. 3 in the industry, have been expanding outside the United States and Canada, where excess capacity and a drop in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas has eaten into margins.Strong activity in international markets, particularly the Middle East and Africa, helped both companies report stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.Baker Hughes shares rose about 2 percent in morning trade. Shares of Halliburton, which initially rose on the results, fell 3 percent after the company said in a conference call that conditions would remain tough in Latin America.Halliburton said it was targeting an improvement of 200 basis points in North American margins in 2014, while Baker Hughes said it expected margins in the region to recover by at least 105 basis points in the first quarter.Halliburton, which expects 2014 revenue in North America to increase by a mid-single-digit in percentage terms, said the average U.S. land rig count was likely to increase modestly this year.Baker Hughes, which publishes a closely watched tally of active rigs, said it expected the U.S. onshore rig count to be essentially flat this year, but added that the well count would rise by 5 percent due to improved drilling efficiencies.Oilfield service companies are able to secure more business despite no growth in rig count as greater efficiency allows clients to drill more wells with a single rig.Baker Hughes said increased profitability in North America would offset a seasonal decline in its international and industrial businesses in the first quarter.The company said it expected first-quarter earnings to rise ""slightly"" from fourth-quarter adjusted earnings, excluding the impact of disruptions in Iraq.Baker Hughes temporarily suspended operations in southern Iraq in November, following protests over an alleged religious insult by a security adviser working in the area for competitor Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), whose operations were also disrupted. LATIN AMERICA CHALLENGES Halliburton said it expected a seasonal decline in first-quarter revenue in Latin America and that margins there would be more ""severe than normal"" due to higher costs in Brazil and reduced land drilling in Mexico.Falling output from older offshore oil fields in Brazil along with delays in bringing on new areas is weighing on drilling activity in the country.Halliburton expects margins for the Latin American region, which accounted for 13 percent of operating income in the fourth quarter, to stay in the upper single digits until activity begins to recover in the back half of the year.Fourth-quarter operating income from Latin America fell 21 percent, while revenue was flat at $1 billion.""We believe that 2014 will be a very challenging year for Latin America,"" Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Miller said on a conference call with analysts. MIDDLE EAST DRIVES EARNINGS Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes received nearly half of their revenue from outside North America in the fourth quarter.Halliburton forecast double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2014, citing strong international demand.""Halliburton's bullish outlook for 2014 should ease some concerns about the outlook for global E&P (exploration and production) spending in 2014,"" Barclays analysts said in a note to clients.Barclays expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to a report released last month.Baker Hughes said it expected the international rig count to grow by 10 percent this year. Baker Hughes said its revenue from Middle East and Asia Pacific jumped 27 percent in the quarter, while Halliburton's revenue from the same regions climbed 13 percent.Most of their gains in the Middle East are coming from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, which is lining up dozens of rigs this year to make up for supply disruptions in other countries, including Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Yemen.Market leader Schlumberger, which gets almost 70 percent of its revenue from outside North America, posted a better-than-expected profit on Friday thanks to robust drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Baker Hughes said revenue from its operations in Europe, Africa, Russia and the Caspian region combined rose 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Halliburton's revenue from the same areas rose 15 percent.Halliburton's income from continuing operations rose 31 percent to $770 million, or 90 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.64 billion.Adjusted income from continuing operations was 93 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected earnings of 89 cents on revenue of $7.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to Baker Hughes rose 16 percent to $248 million, or 56 cents per share, in the quarter.

6,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The number and size of U.S. securities class-action settlements rose in 2013, a new study shows, but the gains may not last if the U.S. Supreme Court limits investors' ability to band together to bring lawsuits.Sixty-seven settlements worth $4.77 billion, the highest dollar amount in six years, won court approval in 2013, up from 57 settlements worth $3.26 billion a year earlier, according to the study released on Thursday by Cornerstone Research.Large settlements skewed the data, with more than half of the payout attributable to Bank of America Corp's $2.43 billion settlement of claims it misled shareholders when buying Merrill Lynch & Co in late 2008.The peak years remain 2005 and 2006, when accords over WorldCom Inc's and Enron Corp's collapses led to respective overall settlement totals of $10.93 billion and $19.89 billion.But the median settlement - meaning half were larger and half smaller - was just $6.5 million in 2013, down from $10.3 million a year earlier, reflecting the diminishing impact of lawsuits related to the global financial crisis. Settlements over $50 million were three times more likely to have corresponding U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions, and four times more likely to have public pension plans as lead plaintiff, than smaller accords.Cornerstone said the number of settlements is unlikely to decline much soon, reflecting the ""relatively high"" number of recent lawsuits alleging misrepresentations or inadequate disclosures. The number of securities lawsuits seeking class action status rose 9 percent last year to 166. But the Supreme Court could change much of that.In Halliburton Co v. Erica P. John Fund, the court is weighing changes to a 1988 precedent that said shareholders may pursue class actions by relying on a presumption that company stock prices reflect all publicly available information.This ""fraud on the market"" theory frees shareholders from showing individually that they relied on false statements, and underpinned the subsequent boom in securities class actions. At oral argument on March 5, some justices showed sympathy for what Justice Anthony Kennedy called a ""midway position,"" in which the court would not overrule the precedent but instead require investors to show that a particular misrepresentation meaningfully affected a stock's price.""If the ruling in Halliburton severely limits investors' ability to get large-scale class actions certified, the future of such cases is up in the air,"" Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford Law School professor who works with Cornerstone, said in a statement.Grundfest is also a former commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by David Gregorio)",2014-03-27,HAL,"Thu Mar 27, 2014 | 12:11am EDT","U.S. securities class-action settlements rebound, may not last",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-securities-lawsuits-idUSBREA2Q08G20140327?type=companyNews

However, thus far the earnings season has been mixed, with technology names like Google Inc  and IBM struggling to impress investors.* With fewer than one-fifth of S&P 500 companies having reported results so far, about 63 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, exceeding the 56 percent average over the past four quarters. About 52 percent have beaten revenue forecasts, about even with the 54 percent average over the past four quarters.* Hasbro Inc reported adjusted first-quarter earnings that topped forecasts, though revenue was below expectations. Halliburton Co also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. * Advanced Micro Devices rose 9.5 percent to $4.04 in premarket trading. Late Thursday, the last session before the Good Friday trading holiday, the chipmaker posted first-quarter results that beat expectations.* Perhaps the most eagerly awaited name on Monday is Netflix Inc, which will report after the market closes. The online movie renter was recently a trading favorite, soaring 300 percent last year as the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer. The stock, stung by claims it is overvalued, has slumped recently alongside a broader decline in other recently high-flying names. Analysts will look to see whether the results justify its still-elevated price.* S&P 500 futures rose 0.8 point and were slightly above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 7 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 12.25 points. * The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are coming off four-day winning streaks, and investors may look to take profits on any disappointing corporate news.* Dozens of S&P components will report this week, including such closely watched names as Apple Inc, Biogen Idec  and Facebook Inc. A number of Dow components, including McDonald's Corp, AT&T Inc, Procter & Gamble and Caterpillar Inc, also report.* In company news, Britain's Sunday Times reported that Pfizer Inc had approached AstraZeneca to propose a $101 billion takeover, an offer that was reportedly rejected. However, Astra's cancer drug pipeline is still considered a draw for Pfizer. Shares of Pfizer, a Dow component, rose 1.5 percent to $30.70 before the bell while U.S. shares of Astra rose 5.7 percent to $67.11.* Last week the Dow rose 2.4 percent, the S&P 500 added 2.7 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 2.4 percent. The Dow had its best week since December while the S&P 500 closed out its best week since July. The CBOE Volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, fell 21.6 percent over the week, its biggest weekly drop since January 2013.(Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)",2014-04-21,HAL,"Mon Apr 21, 2014 | 8:43am EDT",US STOCKS-Futures flat as investors await earnings onslaught,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL2N0ND0BH20140421?type=companyNews

12,"  * New rules not to impact projects already underway* Could take as long as 5 years to fully implement* Halliburton, McDermott, China Oilfield among firms operating in countryBy Wilda Asmarini and Randy FabiJAKARTA, May 5 Indonesia has introduced new regulations restricting foreign investment in drilling, maintenance and construction in the oil industry, in an effort to give domestic firms an opportunity to better compete, government officials confirmed on Monday.The nationalistic policies were introduced as part of a major overhaul to foreign investment rules, which President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday said was a way to attract overseas investors. In a 100-page document released late on Friday, it eased foreign investment regulations for several industries including pharmaceuticals, large power plants and advertising.But it also introduced limits for foreign ownership of oil platforms, pipelines, maintenance companies, drilling firms and storage.""It is a priority of national interest to increase competitiveness in these industries and to allow national investors (to play a role),"" Farah Indriani, deputy chairwoman of investment climate and development, told Reuters. The mining ministry said the new rules would not impact projects already underway and could take as long as five years to fully implement.Halliburton Co, McDermott International, and China Oilfield Services Limited are among the major oil services companies already operating in Indonesia.""It won't disturb or change any existing contracts,"" Naryanto Wagimin, programme director for the oil and gas directorate in the mines ministry, told Reuters. ""If it was directly implemented today, maybe no (foreign) drilling companies would do business here,"" he added.Under the new rules, foreign ownership of offshore oil and gas drilling services was limited to 75 percent from 95 percent.It also limited foreign ownership in pipeline projects and small power plants between 1-10 megawatts to 49 percent. Previously there was no such limit.Indonesia has steadily imposed regulations to get more control over its natural resources, most recently introducing a mineral ore export ban in January to force miners to process their raw materials in the country.Partly due to the ban, foreign investment growth in the first quarter slowed to its lowest level in nearly five years. The FDI data excludes investment in the oil industry.

13,"  (Adds details on deals, PDVSA's debt to providers)MARACAIBO, Venezuela May 21 Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA on Wednesday said it had been granted a total of $2 billion in credit lines by oilfield services companies Halliburton Co, Schlumberger NV and Weatherford International Ltd.""What we have signed is for the companies to increase activities in our country, in some cases doubling them,"" PDVSA President and Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said at a ceremony in the western city of Maracaibo. By giving credit lines to PDVSA, the companies will be able to increase their service contracts with OPEC member Venezuela. The deal may allow PDVSA, whose cash-flow problems are well known, to postpone payments of accumulated debts to its main service providers. Last year, it signed a similar agreement with Schlumberger after accumulating pending debts of almost $1 billion. PDVSA finances most of the socialist government's spending and does not receive cash for a third of its crude and products exports due to debt agreements and international supply pacts.In 2012, PDVSA had accumulated $16.5 billion in debts to providers, but it has not released updated numbers since. Ramirez did not say when the new $2 billion credit would be effective or give details of the interest rate agreed.

15,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelNew York - Let's state the obvious: Big Business did not get what it wanted Monday from the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused in Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund to overturn Basic v. Levinson, the 25-year-old precedent that permits shareholders to bring classwide claims of securities fraud.The justices didn't even adopt the alternate approach -- suggested by some Halliburton supporters in friend-of-the-court briefs -- of requiring plaintiffs who want to sue as a class to show that supposed corporate misstatements had an impact on share prices. Instead, the court ruled only that defendants may argue against class certification with evidence that share prices didn't drop as a result of the alleged fraud.Halliburton's lawyer, Aaron Streett of Baker Botts, told me that's still a ""significant win,"" especially considering that the justices might have upheld the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and barred defendants from using such price-impact evidence to keep shareholders from banding together.Streett said that the decision will give defendants a chance to fend off class certification with arguments that their share price didn't drop at all, or that the drop was attributable to something other than the disclosure of their alleged fraud.But the cost of this small victory for defendants may turn out to be higher than they realize.According to David Boies of Boies, Schiller & Flexner who argued the Supreme Court case for investors -- and shareholder lawyers Max Berger of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann and Lawrence Sucharow of Labaton Sucharow, the Halliburton ruling not only won't curb securities class action filings but could actually improve plaintiffs' position after class certification. NO NEW RIGHT Here's why. The Supreme Court's decision does not give securities defendants a new right: They've always been able to argue at various turning points in these cases that their supposed fraud didn't affect share prices. The Halliburton opinion just clarifies that defendants can use those arguments to oppose class certification.Realistically, said plaintiffs' lawyer Berger, shareholders in almost all cases will be able to offer their own evidence that corporate misstatements led to drops in stock prices. Even if other factors contributed to the stock drop, Berger said, his side will be able to win class certification if alleged fraud had anything to do with the decline.""This ruling is not going to make our job more difficult,"" he told me. ""The decision says price impact can be considered at any time. Yeah, so what?"" Securities fraud plaintiffs, in other words, are already equipped to counter price impact arguments opposing class certification with evidence from their own economics experts, who will say that share prices fell because of the alleged fraud. (And if investors can't find experts to support their price impact theories, they should not have brought their cases in the first place.)It's true, said plaintiffs' lawyer Sucharow, that if price impact battles take place at the class certification stage rather than in summary judgment briefing, plaintiffs' lawyers will have to spend more time and money on experts earlier than they're used to.But the reward for defeating price impact defenses at the class certification stage, he said, will be a better position in post-certification settlement talks: Defendants won't be able to argue that shareholders can't prove price impact.There will no longer be uncertainty that defendants might succeed in getting the case tossed on a summary judgment motion based on price impact, Sucharow said, so shareholders will have better leverage in mediation or negotiations. ""This decision could mean that the club defendants say I get when I win class certification has become an even bigger club,"" Sucharow said.UNWELCOME DEMANDS Moreover, Boies pointed out, defendants who decide to raise price impact arguments to oppose class certification will have to face shareholders' discovery demands on the merits of their defenses. That's going to expose defendants to depositions and documents requests they won't welcome, he said. ""Plaintiffs are going to get a whole lot more information at the class certification stage,"" Boies said.Boies predicted that when securities class action defendants weigh the costs and benefits of price impact arguments against class certification, few will end up asserting them. ""This could turn out to be a 'be careful what you ask for' decision,"" he said.Of course, as Halliburton lawyer Streett told me, we'll have to wait to assess the impact of the new price impact test for class certification until the lower courts have had a chance to apply it; courts in the 2nd Circuit have been using a version of the test since 2008, Streett said, and have denied ""a decent number"" of class certifications because shareholders couldn't show price impact.One early test of the new ruling will come when the 5th Circuit considers the Halliburton case yet again, on its second remand from the Supreme Court. On Monday, both Streett and Boies said they expect to win at the appeals court.Meanwhile, the ever-resourceful securities class action bar is enjoying its new prognosis, after a near-death experience. ""Believe me, if this is the sacrifice we make for keeping Basic, we made a great trade,"" said Sucharow.

16,"  (Adds Wednesday's Supreme Court rulings)By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON, June 25 With only days remaining in its term, the U.S. Supreme Court is on track to at least partly dispel the impression that it is pro-business.In cases brought by business interests over the last nine months, including an effort to curb shareholder class actions and challenges to environmental regulations, the court has either issued narrow rulings that fell short of what those interests sought or ruled against them outright.By contrast, the court last year issued a string of rulings in favor of business, including several that curbed consumer claims against companies.Lawyers and law professors following the business cases offer various explanations for the losses and narrower victories this year. One theory is that the court under Chief Justice John Roberts is reluctant to overturn longstanding precedents, even when they happen to be anti-business.Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, said the court has shown ""it is more a minimalist status-quo court than a 'pro-business' court.""By one measure the business community has fared reasonably well this year. Its leading representative before the high court, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has so far amassed a record of 11 wins to 4 losses during the nine-month term due to end next Monday. That's a winning percentage just slightly lower than last year's 14-3 record. In the previous year the Chamber went undefeated at 7-0.The Chamber participates mainly by filing friend-of-the-court briefs, but is also directly involved in some cases, such as regulatory challenges. It does not generally participate in business-against-business disputes, such as a case on Wednesday in which the court ruled for TV broadcasters in finding that online startup Aereo Inc had violated copyright law.One remaining case yet to be decided involves the Chamber - a challenge to President Barack Obama's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, which has the potential to be a broad ruling. Even a win in that case, due to be decided as early as Thursday, would mean a year of mixed results. TECHNICAL ISSUES The Chamber's wins have mostly been on technical issues. Even when the court has ruled in favor of business interests this term, the justices have ruled narrowly and rejected arguments that would have led to blockbuster decisions.On Monday, the court did exactly that in cases on securities class actions and environmental regulations.The court stopped short of overturning a precedent that favors plaintiffs in securities class actions and mostly upheld the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases under a long-running air pollution program. The environmental ruling was so mild that the EPA announced it was pleased with the ruling even though it had technically lost.Monday's ruling in the environmental case handed a partial win to industry by exempting smaller pollution sources from the regulation. ""It wasn't a perfect win but we think it was a very positive step in the right direction and a shot across the bows of the EPA,"" Kate Comerford Todd, a lawyer in the Chamber's legal office, said in an interview.Saying that ""overall it's a good term for the business community,"" Todd cited a January win for Daimler AG  in which the court put limits on the ability of plaintiffs to file human rights claims against multinational companies in U.S. courts.In the securities class action case, which was brought to the court by Halliburton Co, the justices were unanimous in reaching a middle ground that could benefit corporate defendants, but the court didn't go as far as the business community hoped.Roberts himself wrote the majority opinion in which the court declined to overturn a precedent that favors shareholders, saying Halliburton had failed to show the ""special justification"" that is required before the court throws out its prior holdings.""We are disappointed,"" said Lily Fu Claffee, the Chamber's chief legal officer. The justices again failed to give the Chamber what it wanted on Wednesday when the high court ruled in a class-action case brought against Fifth Third Bancorp. The court threw out an appeals court ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, giving a technical win to the bank and Chamber. But the court rejected the Chamber's argument, which would have had broader pro-defendant implications if adopted.The bulk of the Chamber's outright wins were on technical legal issues, such as a decision in December in favor of Sprint Corp over a dispute with the utilities regulator in Iowa.SIGNIFICANT LOSSES By contrast, the Chamber lost some higher-stakes cases. Most notably, the court in April upheld a separate environmental regulation proposed by President Barack Obama's administration that was strongly opposed by utilities. The court, on a 6-2 vote, ruled that the EPA had not exceeded its authority in requiring some states to limit pollution that contributes to unhealthy air in neighboring states.The court also found against the Chamber in a 6-3 vote in March that whistleblower protections apply not only to publicly traded companies but also to subcontractors that do business with them. The ruling extends the protections to investment advisers, law firms, accounting firms and other such businesses.Business also didn't fare particularly well in seven other cases involving corporate interests in which the Chamber did not participate and that did not involve a company versus company dispute. Business interests lost four out of seven, including one in which the court said on a 7-2 vote that victims of Allen Stanford's Ponzi scheme could sue lawyers and insurance brokers who worked for him.Doug Kendall, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said the business community's failure this year to reach its goals may stem from its having taken ""very aggressive positions,"" setting its sights too high to garner a majority on the nine-member court.""They didn't get what they asked for, but they are playing offense,"" Kendall said.

18,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON, June 25  WASHINGTON, June 25 With only days remaining in its term, the U.S. Supreme Court is on track to at least partly dispel the impression that it's pro-business.In cases brought by business interests over the last nine months, including an effort to curb shareholder class actions and challenges to environmental regulations, the court has either issued narrow rulings that fell short of what those interests sought or ruled against them outright.By contrast, the court last year issued a string of rulings in favor of business, including several that curbed consumer claims against companies.Lawyers and law professors following the business cases offer various explanations for the losses and narrower victories this year. One theory is that the court under Chief Justice John Roberts is reluctant to overturn longstanding precedents, even when they happen to be anti-business.Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, said the court has shown ""it is more a minimalist status-quo court than a 'pro-business' court.""By one measure the business community has fared reasonably well this year.

SPT has 20 years experience operating in Xinjiang while Halliburton would contribute its expertise in enhancing oil recovery using fracturing technology,"" Sun Xiaogang, SPT's chief financial officer, told Reuters. ""Among the most geographically complicated regions in China, Xinjiang is rich in tight oil and tight gas resources,"" he said, adding that the model could be used in other regions. SPT will hold 51 percent and Halliburton 49 percent of the new entity, which will have registered capital of $34 million and commit to a total investment of $100 million, Sun said.The venture was first announced in April.

20,"  (Adds details from statement, background)July 17 Schlumberger Ltd's, the world's largest oilfield services company, reported better-than-expected second quarter revenue as drilling activity picked up in North America.Revenue from the oversupplied market - where all major oilfield service providers have been competing for fewer contracts - jumped 16 percent to $3.89 billion from a year earlier.Smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc also reported a higher-than-expected profit on strong growth in North America, earlier on Thursday. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes provide several services, including seismic surveys that determine where oil lies under the earth's surface and hydraulic fracturing of wells.Robust drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in onshore drilling in the United States helped offset seasonal weakness in Canada, Schlumberger said in a statement on Thursday. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc.International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger's quarterly revenue, with a 12 percent rise in revenue from the Middle East and Asia and 4 percent rise in Europe. Revenue from Latin America fell 3 percent. Total revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 rose 8 percent to $12.05 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $11.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income fell by nearly a quarter to about $1.60 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $2.10 billion, or $1.57 per share.Earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.37, higher than the analyst average estimate of $1.36 per share.

25,"  (Adds quote from BP, background, separate settlement by Halliburton)HOUSTON, Sept 2 BP Plc asked a U.S. court on Tuesday to fire the court-appointed lawyer tasked with paying out compensation to people affected by the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, saying the lawyer had not disclosed an alleged conflict of interest before taking the job.The motion in U.S. District Court in New Orleans said the lawyer, Patrick Juneau, lacks neutrality because he had advocated for claimants before the court appointed him to run the claims program.It was the latest in a series of legal challenges filed by the London-based oil major, which has complained previously that Juneau has been too generous and liberal when approving claims.""In order to restore the integrity of the claims program, the court should replace him,"" BP said. Juneau has said he is just applying the rules of the 2012 settlement agreement that was approved by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier.BP originally expected the class-action settlement to resolve economic and health claims by more than 100,000 individuals and businesses to cost $7.8 billion. It has since said the uncapped program could cost $9.2 billion and that this amount could grow.The 1,000-page settlement deal was negotiated by BP and a committee of plaintiffs' lawyers to avoid individual lawsuits by compensating a wide class of businesses and individuals in one swoop. BP has sustained more than $42 billion in charges from the April 20, 2010, disaster aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 workers in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.More charges are possible as the trial to determine blame and overall damages from the spill, including those under the federal Clean Water Act, is ongoing. Separately on Tuesday, oilfield services provider Halliburton Co reached a $1.1 billion settlement for claims related to its role in the spill. Halliburton provided cementing services on the blown-out Macondo well.The settlement protects Halliburton from certain punitive damages if the court were to rule later that the company had been ""negligent"" or ""grossly negligent"" for its role in the blowout, Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said.The case can be found under: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig ""Deepwater Horizon"" in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 20, 2010, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, No. 10-md-02179.

29,"  BP Plc (BP.L) was found ""grossly negligent"" on Thursday by a federal judge in connection with its role in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The decision by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, who oversees litigation related to the disaster, is likely to boost the British oil company's costs emerging from the biggest offshore spill in U.S. history. * April 20, 2010 RIG EXPLODES: An explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig at the Macondo exploration well kills 11 workers and releases millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The well is capped in mid-July. BP ultimately sets aside $42 billion to pay for cleanup costs, damages and penalties.* November 2012 CRIMINAL CASE SETTLED: BP agrees to pay $4.5 billion in fines and other penalties and pleads guilty to 14 criminal charges. The U.S. government bans BP from new federal contracts, imperiling the company's role as a top U.S. offshore oil producer and No. 1 military fuel supplier. Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice files criminal charges against three BP employees in connection with the accident.* December 2012 CLASS ACTION SETTLED: Barbier gives final approval to BP's settlement with individuals and businesses  claiming to have lost money and property because of the spill. BP initially estimates it will pay $7.8 billion to settle more than 100,000 claims, but the dollar amount is not capped. The company later says the payout may grow substantially, in part because of payouts to many claimants who suffered no harm, and files numerous legal challenges to the agreement. * February 2013 CIVIL TRIAL BEGINS: Officials from the federal government and several U.S. states begin facing BP in court at a three-phase civil trial over how blame should be apportioned between BP, Transocean Ltd (RIG.N), which owned the drilling rig, and Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which did cement work. Government lawyers urge Barbier to find BP grossly negligent, which could roughly quadruple the amount of fines under the U.S. Clean Water Act.* Sept. 30, 2013 SECOND PHASE OF TRIAL BEGINS: The second phase begins to determine how much oil was spilled.  * Sept. 4, 2014 JUDGE FINDS BP BEARS MOST OF THE BLAME: Barbier finds BP ""grossly negligent"" for its role in the oil spill. He assigns 67 percent of the fault to BP, 30 percent to Transocean and 3 percent to Halliburton.

30,"  Sept 4 BP Plc was found ""grossly negligent"" on Thursday by a federal judge in connection with its role in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The decision by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, who oversees litigation related to the disaster, is likely to boost the British oil company's costs emerging from the biggest offshore spill in U.S. history. :* April 20, 2010 RIG EXPLODES: An explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig at the Macondo exploration well kills 11 workers and releases millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The well is capped in mid-July. BP ultimately sets aside $42 billion to pay for cleanup costs, damages and penalties.* November 2012 CRIMINAL CASE SETTLED: BP agrees to pay $4.5 billion in fines and other penalties and pleads guilty to 14 criminal charges. The U.S. government bans BP from new federal contracts, imperiling the company's role as a top U.S. offshore oil producer and No. 1 military fuel supplier. Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice files criminal charges against three BP employees in connection with the accident. * December 2012 CLASS ACTION SETTLED: Barbier gives final approval to BP's settlement with individuals and businesses  claiming to have lost money and property because of the spill. BP initially estimates it will pay $7.8 billion to settle more than 100,000 claims, but the dollar amount is not capped. The company later says the payout may grow substantially, in part because of payouts to many claimants who suffered no harm, and files numerous legal challenges to the agreement.* February 2013 CIVIL TRIAL BEGINS: Officials from the federal government and several U.S. states begin facing BP in court at a three-phase civil trial over how blame should be apportioned between BP, Transocean Ltd, which owned the drilling rig, and Halliburton Co, which did cement work. Government lawyers urge Barbier to find BP grossly negligent, which could roughly quadruple the amount of fines under the U.S. Clean Water Act. * Sept. 30, 2013 SECOND PHASE OF TRIAL BEGINS: The second phase begins to determine how much oil was spilled. * Sept. 4, 2014 JUDGE FINDS BP BEARS MOST OF THE BLAME: Barbier finds BP ""grossly negligent"" for its role in the oil spill. He assigns 67 percent of the fault to BP, 30 percent to Transocean and 3 percent to Halliburton.

Revenue from the company's international business rose 5 percent to $8.31 billion, as its resilient Middle East and Asia businesses trumped ""significant headwinds"" in Northern Iraq and sanctions against Russia, Schlumberger said.Schlumberger, which drills with Rosneft on the island of Sakhalin, had warned in August that sanctions against Russia would hurt its third-quarter profit by as much as 3 cents per share. [ID:ID:nL4N0QI44G]The company has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co, Baker Hughes Inc and Weatherford International Plc. Baker Hughes reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first time in five quarters earlier on Thursday, as political tensions in Libya and Iraq and a sharp fall in drilling in the Gulf of Mexico hurt margins.Baker Hughes said its clients would reconsider projects if oil prices fell to and remained at $75 per barrel for a few months.Ample supply and weak demand have hit oil prices in recent months. Global benchmark Brent crude futures rose to $84.49 a barrel on Thursday, after falling to $83 earlier, off nearly 28 percent from a June high.U.S. crude prices also rose to $82.83 a barrel after falling to a two-year low of $80 a barrel. Schlumberger's shares have lost over a fifth of their value in the past three months, mirroring a fall in global oil prices, while Baker Hughes' stock has declined 30 percent.""Weakening oil prices really don't have an impact on services companies' results. Outside of sentiment issues that affect the stock, it doesn't influence the companies,"" Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago said.Net income attributable to Houston, Texas-based Schlumberger rose to $1.95 billion, or $1.49 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.72 billion, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier..Total revenue rose 9 percent to $12.65 billion.Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.46 per share on revenue of $12.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Schlumberger shares closed up 1.6 percent at $90.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.

35,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Anannya Pramanick  Oct 21 As fracking accelerates in North American shale fields, oilfield services providers Halliburton Co  and Baker Hughes Inc are stockpiling sand to protect themselves against rising costs and are buying more railcars to transport the haul.Halliburton, the world's largest provider of fracking services, is more than doubling its railcar fleet and capacity for sand terminals - where sand is stored and transferred to truck from rail. It had about 3,500 railcars under management as of June 30.Baker Hughes, the world's No.3 oilfield services provider,  said at the Barclays CEO Energy Power conference last month that it had ""significantly"" increased the number of its railcars and is buying more sand under contract, which helps buffer it against price rises.Companies are pumping in as much as a trainload of frac sand into a single well to coax more oil and gas from shale rocks.But the shale rush, especially in Texas and North Dakota, coupled with a rail jam that began after last year's severe winter has resulted in shortage of sand at drilling sites.""We did experience some disruptions early in the third quarter, where work was delayed because we were waiting on sand deliveries,"" Halliburton's Chief Executive David Lesar said on the company's post-earnings call on Monday.Halliburton has committed about $100 million this year to upgrade its infrastructure to move frac sand. The company signed up 30 additional trucking companies this year to transport sand, Jeffrey Miller, Halliburton's president, said on Monday. It has also opened a center in Houston to monitor supply and track its rail and trucking fleets, he said.Halliburton is also buying more sand under contract, which it said helped shave 15-20 percent off spot sand costs.""Halliburton has probably been the most proactive in establishing a 'just-in-time' inventory system for most of their frac sand products because it is becoming such a logistical game,"" said Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago, who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock. RISING COSTS Halliburton and Baker Hughes are beefing up their transportation networks to also shield themselves from the increase in costs to move sand, which is adding to already high sand prices.Prices for various grades of sand increased by between 5 percent and 20 percent past year, said Taylor Robinson, president of commodity logistics consulting firm PLG Consulting.For example, Robinson said, sand delivered from Illinois to the Eagle Ford shale field in Texas costs $127 per ton on average, with transportation and warehousing accounting for nearly two-thirds of that. ""I think there's going to be a limit to how much of these additional cost escalations our customers are prepared to take, given their free cash flow situation and also given the drop in oil prices,"" Schlumberger Ltd CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during the company's earnings call on Friday.The world's largest oilfield services company said last week that oil and gas spending would increase in 2015 as global oil demand was poised to rise, downplaying fears of an investment slowdown due to weak crude prices.Schlumberger did not respond to emails and calls requesting comment for the story. Baker Hughes declined to comment.Several sand miners are also stepping up investments in their transportation networks, which they use to deliver sand to companies such as Halliburton.U.S. Silica Holdings Inc, which has about 30 transloading terminals for transferring sand from railcars to trucks, plans to invest about $300 million to expand its logistics network by 2020, CEO Bryan Shinn said.U.S. Silica is constructing ""one of the largest transloading facilities in the country"" in the Permian Basin, he said, and expects to add another 15-20 locations in the next few years.

36,"  BAGHDAD Oct 21 Iraq's cabinet approved on Monday a $278.5 million drilling deal with U.S. oil service company Halliburton for the southern West Qurna- 1 oilfield, according to a government statement.Under the 30-month contract, Halliburton is to drill 30 oil wells in the 8.7-billion-barrel West Qurna Phase One field, operated by  U.S. major ExxonMobil, the statement said. Oil production at the West Qurna-1 field is running at a rate of 360,000 barrels per day due to problems with low levels of water injection, which is needed to boost production, officials said. Iraq has awarded lucrative oilfield development contracts to majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil with the ambitious target of expanding its oil production capacity to 8.5-9 million bpd by 2017. Increasing export capacity is a cornerstone of Iraq's ambitious plans to revive its oil industry after years of war, economic sanctions and neglect.

44,"  Nov 13 Oil services provider Halliburton Co.  is in talks to buy rival Baker Hughes Inc., Dow Jones reported on Thursday, citing unidentified sources.Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. Baker Hughes shares were halted in New York Stock Exchange trading due to volatility. They were last up 1.3 percent. Halliburton shares jumped following the Dow Jones report and were last up 3.5 percent to a session high.

45,"  The proposed merger of oilfield service companies Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc would create a serious challenger to Schlumberger NV in international markets and cement the two companies' dominance in North America.And that is the problem, according to some analysts.""The proposed merger would be dominant in North America, which could spur protracted (antitrust) scrutiny; and likely elicit howls of protest from customers everywhere, potentially requiring concessions to more than one national anti-trust authority,"" analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note.Baker Hughes disclosed after the market closed on Thursday that it was in preliminary merger talks with its Houston neighbor.But muted market reaction on Friday highlighted the likelihood that any deal would face an uphill regulatory battle.Baker Hughes' shares were up 0.2 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange while Halliburton's were up 1.4 percent. Schlumberger's stock was up 0.4 percent. A combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have combined revenue of about $52 billion, based on 2013 results, outstripping Schlumberger's 2013 revenue of $45.3 billion.The merged company's business in North America would also be about double that of Schlumberger, which gets more than two-thirds of its revenue from international operations.Still, the merged entity's market value of about $70 billion would be far less than Schlumberger's $120 billion. Baker Hughes, whose shares were trading at $58.38 at midday, should be able to command a 25 percent premium to its Wednesday close of $50.98 for an enterprise value of $25.46 billion, Evercore ISI analyst James West said in a note.The proposed deal would give Halliburton, the No. 2 oilfield services provider, the leading market share in oilfield services such as directional drilling, coiled tubing and drill-bits, unseating Schlumberger in all three markets, said West. A deal would not be all bad news for Schlumberger, however. Analysts said that by reducing the number of big players in  the industry to two from three, pricing could stabilize.""Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have been in a knife fight the past few years for international and offshore tenders,"" Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts said.""A combined company could help introduce more discipline to these bid processes and ultimately improve returns/profits for the industry.""  (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr)",2014-11-14,HAL,"Fri Nov 14, 2014 | 2:11pm EST",Proposed merger of oilfield firms poses challenge to Schlumberger,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bakerhughes-halliburton-research-idUSKCN0IY24H20141114?type=companyNews
46,"   By Terry Wade and Nadia Damouni | HOUSTON/NEW YORK  HOUSTON/NEW YORK Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc said on Thursday it is in preliminary merger talks with its larger rival Halliburton Co, though any potential deal would likely face antitrust concerns.Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Halliburton was looking to buy Baker Hughes, in what would be the second-largest energy deal of this year.Oil prices have slid by a third since June, eroding demand for drilling services and pummeling stock prices across the energy sector. That has prompted a flurry of chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities.A tie up between the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry might allow them to better weather the downturn and resist pressure from oil producers to slash prices.Baker Hughes said in a statement it has ""engaged in preliminary discussions with Halliburton Company regarding a potential business combination transaction.""Halliburton declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by Dow Jones and in The Wall Street Journal. A potential merger would create a drilling, logistics and well services giant worth $67 billion, initially with 140,000 employees.But the merged entity would be only half the size of industry leader Schlumberger, which has a market capitalization of $125 billion.If a deal were struck, the companies could well have to sell assets to convince regulators they would not hurt competition, said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division now in private practice. ""The question with mergers like this is are there divestitures of submarkets that can solve the problem,"" Bloom said. ""It's clearly not a slam dunk to approval but it's not automatic that you can't get it through. You have to drill down to see what the markets are like.""The deal is also likely to draw the scrutiny of regulators in Europe, China, Brazil and Mexico, others experts said. Arguably, the antitrust concerns would be greatest outside the United States, where there are relatively few services companies.There are at least seven major product lines where there is overlap between the two companies. The companies offer scores of services and technology, from drill bits, to cementing and casing work, to artificial lift systems that improve output from wells. An analyst who follows the company and did not want to be quoted said Halliburton could get the deal down with a mix of debt and equity and still maintain its investment rating.News of the talks sent shares of another services company,  Weatherford International Plc, which has long been seen as vulnerable, up nearly 6 percent.Baker Hughes shares were halted in New York Stock Exchange trading due to volatility. They later reopened and shot up 18 percent. Halliburton shares rose as much as 3.5 percent before trimming gains at the close.The last major deal in the energy industry, announced in August and worth some $70 billion, was pipeline giant Kinder Morgan Inc's move to fold its various units into a single entity.

47,"  Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) said on Thursday it was in preliminary merger talks with larger rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N).  A combination would help the companies better cope with weak oil prices. Global crude oil prices have slipped from over $100 in June to less than $80 this week amid excess supply and tepid demand growth.Despite the market share boost that a tie-up of the No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield companies would bring, the combined entity would only be about half the size of market leader Schlumberger NV (SLB.N).Below is a breakdown of the market share of the top three oilfield companies in various services, according to data from Spears and Associates and Cowen and Co.

57,"   By Mike Stone and Anna Driver | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 14 Talks that could lead to oilfield services provider Halliburton Co buying rival Baker Hughes Inc may herald increased deal-making in the energy business as companies bet on a protracted drop in oil prices, industry bankers said.Competing service companies including National Oilwell Varco Inc and Weatherford International may also be targets, bankers and lawyers said. In any deal, the incentives will be the same: consolidation would allow them to better weather the downturn and resist pressure from oil producers to slash prices.The Baker Hughes/Halliburton talks have stalled after the companies weren't able to agree on issues including price, people familiar with the matter said Friday.As oil prices fall, oil field service companies get squeezed, one industry lawyer said. That's because when prices fall far enough, it's no longer economical to get oil out of the ground. If it's too expensive to drill, there's no need to pay an oilfield service company. ""The services guys are the last marginal dollar,"" the lawyer said.While services companies are likely to feel the effect of lower oil prices sooner, overleveraged exploration and production companies may also be pushed to do deals over the medium term, bankers said. Such companies could include Apache Corp, Hess Corp, Marathon Oil Corp or Devon Energy Corp, bankers said. Those four exploration companies along with the oil services companies including Baker Hughes, all have market values that range between about $20 billion and $31 billion.In the end, price expectations will decide whether upstream exploration and production companies turn into sellers. If sellers' management believe the oil price will rebound fairly soon, sellers would wait until then, hurting chances for large deals. Brent crude traded at $79.60 a barrel on Friday, down from $115.06 on June 19.Until prices stabilize, exploration and production company deals will likely remain asset-level deals in distressed situations such as Samson Resources' sale of its Bakken assets. ""Certainly there will be instances where you will find more compromised balance sheet operators possibly being more inclined to sell their entire position,"" said Ted Harper, a fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors LLC in Houston.Not all will be targets, he said. Some exploration and production companies will seek to buy at a discount additional potential reserves near where they are already drilling ""to enhance returns from existing production,"" he said.Because exploration and production companies will slow or stop drilling if they are not making money, there is enormous pricing pressure on oil field services providers as oil prices fall. Indeed, the tumbling price may have pushed the companies into a dialog, especially if Halliburton's management believes that oil prices could remain low for some time.While Halliburton ""has first mover advantage"" in its bid to acquire Baker Hughes, ""it's common knowledge that Schlumberger made a run at Baker Hughes years ago to plug a major hole in (well) completions. That hole remains unfilled,"" Bill Herbert, oilfield analyst at energy-focused investment bank Simmons & Co told clients on Friday.""Further, GE is lurking in the shadows as well, manufacturing cultures are comparable,"" said Herbert. General Electric Co. has a large oil and gas business.While another bidder for Baker Hughes may not emerge, oilfield services companies and private equity firms will be looking to buy up any Baker Hughes business units shed to meet antitrust requirements if the Halliburton deal goes through, bankers said.""There is going to be reasonably competitive bidding on the part of the General Electrics, the National Oilwell Varcos and some of the midcap players,"" said Frost's Harper.

60,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Halliburton Co said on Monday it will buy Baker Hughes Inc for about $35 billion in cash and stock, creating an oilfield services behemoth to take on market leader Schlumberger NV as customers curb spending on falling oil prices.Halliburton expressed confidence that the tie up of the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry would clear regulatory hurdles, saying it was prepared to shed assets to mollify antitrust concerns that could arise in Asia, Europe and the Americas.The deal, the second biggest in the U.S. energy sector this year, could create a company with more revenue than  Schlumberger. (link.reuters.com/kav43w)With oil prices down by a third since June, demand for drilling services has slipped and stock prices across the energy sector have suffered. That has stoked chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities companies could take advantage of to weather the downturn.Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said the combined entity would be more resilient and able to offer a wider suite of products globally.""Stronger in any market condition is better,"" he told Reuters. ""We are in a cyclical business.”Halliburton said it was ready to divest businesses that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to satisfy regulators and would pay Baker Hughes $3.5 billion if the deal was not cleared.""At the end of the day, we wouldn't have done this deal if we didn't believe it was achievable from a regulatory standpoint,"" Lesar said on a conference call. Baker Hughes shares were trading well below the offer, suggesting that investors were not so sure of regulatory approvals.But Kurt Hallead, oilfield services analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the risk of the deal failing was low.""I think the assessment on divestitures matches up pretty closely with the work we've done. I don't anticipate there being any roadblocks,"" he said.The transaction would unite the two companies based in Houston and create an entity dominant in U.S. onshore services such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.  While there are at least seven major services where there is an overlap between the two companies, the deal would fill gaps in two product lines in Halliburton's portfolio – product chemicals and pumps that boost output from wells.Baker Hughes shares rose nearly 11 percent to $66.44 each  on Monday, well short of Halliburton's offer of $80.69, based on Friday's close.After a steep run up last week, Halliburton shares were down 8 percent at $50.60. Schlumberger was up 0.6 percent at $95.85.Talks between the two companies started over a month ago and came to a head on Friday when Halliburton threatened to replace Baker Hughes's board after its initial offer was rejected.

70,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON N.D.  WILLISTON N.D. Halliburton Co's $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes Inc will create an oilfield services powerhouse in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking, according to data seen by Reuters. The deal, announced on Monday, will help Halliburton better compete with global leader Schlumberger NV, as well as smaller peers Calfrac Well Services Ltd, Trican Well Service Ltd and other oilfield services companies in North Dakota, the second-largest oil producer in the United States.  The North Dakota market share projections for the combined company will be of keen interest to competitors and regulators.   The deal faces stiff antitrust hurdles and likely will receive close scrutiny from regulators in the United States and European Union. Halliburton has said it would be willing to shed units that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to ensure the deal closes.Even though oil production in the state's Bakken shale formation has grown exponentially in the past five years, more than 35,000 new wells are expected to come online in the state by 2030, highlighting the ongoing need for the services these companies provide.""We will rule unconventionals now,"" one Halliburton manager in North Dakota told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity.    In the Williston Basin, the oil-rich geologic formation holding much of North Dakota's Bakken and Three Forks shales, the combined company will control 53 percent of the market to line a new well with cement to prevent leaks, according to the data. The step is required by regulators and a key process to safeguard drinking water supplies. The combined company will also control roughly 36 percent of the Williston Basin market for hydraulic fracturing - the process commonly known as 'fracking' where water and sand are blasted into a well at high pressure to extract oil. And roughly 35 percent of the market for directional drilling, the process to drill wells horizontally, will be held by the combined company, according to the data.The Williston Basin market prowess in cementing and directional drilling would eclipse the united company's global share of those markets. Fracking market share in the basin would nearly match the new Halliburton, globally.   UNIFORM PRICING Halliburton is very interested in Baker Hughes' artificial lift division, which makes products that help old wells boost their productivity, as well as its production chemicals unit, according to footnotes accompanying the data.In a statement to Reuters, Halliburton said it is too early to discuss the status of the combined company. ""It is important to remember that until the close of the transaction, Halliburton and Baker Hughes remain separate companies,"" Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said.  It was not immediately clear what Schlumberger's market share is for various products and services in North Dakota, but the Halliburton-Baker Hughes tie-up gives the combined company clear dominance in most oilfield services performed in the state.Schlumberger did not respond to a request for comment. The deal could lead to higher prices for some oil producers. Baker Hughes historically has priced its services below Halliburton, and the deal will allow Halliburton to make pricing more uniform. Continental Resources Inc, for instance, uses a plethora of oilfield service companies for various well completion processes, often choosing the lowest bidder.The deal also gives Halliburton access to Baker Hughes' extensive North Dakota real estate holdings, including a training center it built earlier this year.

73,"  (Adds details on spin off concerns, REIT plans, rivals, customers, tax move)By Ernest ScheyderWILLISTON, N.D. Dec 29 Civeo Corp, which provides temporary housing for oilfield workers and miners, slashed its workforce on Monday and said revenue could fall by a third as slumping crude prices force oil producers to cut costsThe warning adds jitters to the already-wary global oil market and highlights weakness in Australia's coal industry, one of Civeo's biggest markets which has been battered by low global demand for steel.Civeo suspended its quarterly dividend and said it has reduced its workforce in the United States, its smallest market, by 45 percent, and in Canada, its second-biggest market, by 30 percent.Shares of the Houston-based company which was spun off from Oil States International Inc in May, fell 30 percent in extended trading.Civeo had long struggled before it became independent, even losing money in 2013 in the United States, its most-promising market. A 50 percent decline in crude prices since June has put new pressure on it as demand for temporary housing softens.Some oilfield workers also prefer to live in apartments, which many growing towns have urged developers to build. Williams County, North Dakota, has a moratorium on new temporary housing known as ""man camps"" which are made up of units that look like a cross between shipping containers and mobile homes. Civeo forecasts revenue of $160 million to $175 million for the first quarter ending March. Analysts on average expect $228 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Civeo expects, at most, 40 percent of its Australian and Canadian rooms to be rented by the time the new year starts. At this time last year, 75 percent of Canadian rooms and 55 percent of Australian rooms were rented.The company gained around 25 percent of overall 2013 revenues from the Australian coal mining industry. Before the spin off, some investors openly questioned the wisdom of floating the company as a ""pure-play,"" saying it would be undercapitalized and lack the protection of an established parent during a cyclical downturn. Those warnings now seem prescient.Civeo's plans to try and abrogate the commodity-price cycle by setting up a tax-advantaged Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) have also unraveled.The REIT setback prompted the company to say in September it would try to relocate to Canada to enjoy lower taxes, though U.S. regulators have tried to stymie such moves. 'MAN CAMP' Civeo, one of the largest publicly-traded players in the ""man camp"" accommodations business dominated mainly by privately-held companies, has more than 20,000 dormitory-style rooms across remote parts of Canada, Australia and the United States for workers at Imperial Oil Ltd, Vale  and others.One of its main rivals, Target Logistics, a subsidiary of Baltimore-based Algeco Scotsman, operates dozens of locations throughout North Dakota and has long-term contracts with Halliburton Co and others.(Video tour of North Dakota man camp:here )The man camps are often constructed with dozens of trailers joined together by temporary hallways, with a common cafeteria and entertainment facilities. They enforce a zero tolerance policy on drugs and alcohol.

74,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON, N.D.  WILLISTON, N.D. Dec 31 A nasty profit warning and deep job cuts. A gutted capital budget, a suspended dividend and shares tumbling by more than half on a single day.The retrenchment at Civeo Corp, which provides temporary housing for oilfield workers and miners, is the most-severe symptom of pain inflicted on the oil service industry by the slide in crude prices, and may presage similar steps by peers.It also exposes the transient nature of the ""man camp"" business of dormitory-style temporary housing the company helped pioneer.Drilling, a barometer of oilfield activity, has been slowing for weeks as producers slashed spending plans by 20 to 40 percent. Baker Hughes reported last week the U.S. land rig count fell by 35 to 1,770 and hundreds more rigs will be idled, hitting scores of services companies from ones renting trailers to those repairing pumps.The pain will spread unevenly. Companies with weaker finances or older equipment are set to be hit sooner and harder by the more-than 50 percent drop in crude prices since June.Analysts and investors say Civeo's problem is that it has spread itself geographically too thin, with not enough cash to quickly respond to customers' needs.The company, spun off in May from equipment maker Oil States International Inc, has seen demand drop in Canada's oil sands regions and in Australia, where it houses coal miners, leaving it with little cash to expand in North Dakota's oil counties, where it has only two facilities.Civeo shares are down over 80 percent this year after tumbling 53 percent on Tuesday, compared with Oil States's 15 percent slide and a roughly 13 percent gain in the S&P 500  index. Several firms serving Australia's mining sector, Civeo's key market, have also been hit hard by the retreat in commodity and energy prices.For example, Alliance Aviation Services  Ltd  <AQZ.AX, which flies miners to and from remote camp sites, this month cut its earnings forecast, dropped an interim dividend and reduced its aircraft fleet.Businesses providing services to the camps are smarting too. ""I took a massive plunge right along with the drop in coal prices,"" said Fiona Berridge, who runs Scrubz Pro Clean, a linen and cleaning service for miners in the coal town of Moranbah in Australia's Bowen Basin.""I used to have 35 people working here, now I have eight.""Stronger companies have proven more resilient, at least for now.Target Logistics, the top temporary housing operator in North Dakota and one of the largest in the world, says it is finishing 2014 with ""high utilization"" at its facilities. The privately-held company declined to be more specific, but said it did not expect a decline in 2015 occupancy. Analysts say the company has been able to land long-term contracts with companies like Halliburton Co and EOG Resources Inc, by offering them the size and scale Civeo cannot match. In North Dakota alone, Target Logistics has 10 camps and touts its ability to quickly add housing wherever needed.To save cash, oil producers have already started to ask drilling and well completion services firms to cut their prices by 10 to 30 percent, said PacWest, an energy consultancy in Houston.That is hurting the most so-called pressure pumpers, often small privately-held firms, that run fleets of diesel engines used to generate power for hydraulic fracturing jobs.""We expect cash flow and solvency challenges and more consolidation in the industry,"" PacWest said earlier this month.Kirby Corp, which moves crude and other fuels by barge, issued a profit warning in December as its business overhauling diesel engines in onshore fields was hit harder by the oil slide than earlier anticipated.The largest services companies, Halliburton and Schlumberger , have said they will reduce headcount, while BP Plc  announced a $1 billion restructuring.In the offshore drilling market, Hercules Offshore  has cut 15 percent of its staff, while Transocean Ltd  has said it will scrap seven older offshore rigs as softer demand means only the newest rigs can win contracts.

The job cuts, which come days after industry leader Schlumberger NV said it would cut 9,000 jobs, underscore the abrupt slowdown in drilling activity seen in the past two months.The U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs, or about 15 percent, over the last 60 days, Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on the call.Halliburton and Baker Hughes derive about half of their revenue from North America, a region they expect to fare worse than the rest of the world in the oil slump. Baker Hughes said most of the workforce reduction would take place in the first quarter, when it expects to book a one-time severance charge of $160 million to $185 million.The company, which had 61,100 employees as of Sept. 30, said it was also considering closing facilities.Halliburton, said it took a $129 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 to ""temper the impact of anticipated activity declines"". Lesar said Halliburton was committed to closing its deal with Baker Hughes, adding that the transaction was ""more compelling"" now than when it was announced in November.In response to Schlumberger's assertion that the company could gain market share as Halliburton and Baker Hughes integrate their operations, Lesar said the company would not ""get distracted"".""We've been through asbestos.

Halliburton, Statoil ASA, Hess Corp and other North Dakota energy companies have decided, for now, not to lay off staff in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, hoping to be prepared for any prolonged rebound in crude prices.Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices since last June. The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they're confident the state's economy can abide the slowdown. Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months.Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said.  Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota's oil patch.Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company ""will continue to monitor the business environment"" and cut costs as needed.Hess Corp, the state's third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. ""We're all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs,"" Hess spokesman John Roper said.Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce.

96,"  * Qualcomm jumps in premarket, to buy back shares* Crude oil falls; Exxon, Halliburton weaker* Futures down: Dow 103 pts, S&P 12.5 pts, Nasdaq 25.75 ptsBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, March 10 U.S. stock index futures fell on Tuesday, pressured by weaker-than-expected data out of China as well as ongoing concerns about debt talks in Greece.* Concern also came from a report that the Basel Committee may ask banks to boost capital as a sufficient cushion in case of spikes in interest rates. Rate policy has been a primary driver of equities of late; on Friday, the S&P 500 suffered its biggest one-day decline in almost two months after a stronger-than-expected jobs report was seen as goading the Federal Reserve into speeding up its time frame for raising rates.* Euro zone ministers agreed that technical talks between finance experts from Athens and its international creditors would start on Wednesday, with the aim of unlocking further funding. However, the ministers warned Greece that it had ""no time to lose."" * Greece's debt issues have been on the back burner for U.S. investors of late, but they continue to watch the region with caution. While the U.S. has little direct exposure to the country, there are concerns that extended uncertainly could spread throughout the euro zone.* In China, the pace of inflation unexpectedly picked up in February while producer prices continued to slide, underscoring the intense pressure on profit margins at Chinese companies and adding urgency to policymakers' efforts to find new ways to support growth.* Despite the weakness implied by futures, the S&P 500 is about 1.8 percent below its record closing high from last week, while the Dow is about 1.6 percent below its record. * In company news, Qualcomm Inc rose in premarket trading a day after the chipmaker said it would buy back up to $15 billion of shares and raise its quarterly dividend.* Urban Outfitters Inc late Monday reported earnings that beat expectations, lifted by an increase in same-store sales.* Energy shares will likely be in focus as crude oil  fell 0.6 percent, down for its third day of the past four sessions.

97,"  Oilfield giants Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced plans to lay off thousands of people in the past few months as global oil prices have halved since June.In March, Brent prices LCoc1 fell to a near six-year low, hurt by a global supply glut and OPEC's decision not to curtail production. This prompted oil producers to trim their budgets and lower the number of rigs planned for 2015, hurting their suppliers and service providers.Smaller oil services company Weatherford said last month it would eliminate the position of chief operating officer, while tiny oil and gas producer Resolute Energy Corp (REN.N) said it would slash its CEO's base pay by 96 percent.  Oil major BP Plc (BP.L) said it would freeze its base pay across the company this year, while Basic Energy Services (BAS.N) said it has implemented salary cuts for all management and administrative employees and made changes to some benefit programs.  The job cuts announced so far would not be sufficient to maintain profitability, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a note on March 16. The offshore oil services industry in the United States and Europe has to cut 10-15 percent more jobs over 2015, they said.

100,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Stone  Halliburton Co has hired Bank of America Corp  and Deutsche Bank AG to assist in the sale of two businesses that could be valued at as much as $5 billion collectively, according to people familiar with the matter.Following its $35 billion merger agreement with Baker Hughes Inc in November, Halliburton earlier this month outlined some of the oilfield services assets it will seek to divest to alleviate regulators' antitrust concerns. Bank of America has been mandated to sell parts of Halliburton's Sperry Drilling business, which provides offshore and onshore drilling and petrophysical engineering services globally, the people said this week. These assets include directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, and measuring-while-drilling, the people added.The Sperry units for sale generate about $3 billion of revenue annually, and could fetch about that amount in a sale, the people said.  Separately, Deutsche Bank is working to sell Halliburton's drill bits business, including the roller cone bits and fixed cutter bits, the people said. These assets could be sold for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, the people added.Many of Halliburton's clients have halted or postponed drilling projects in the last few months in the wake of low oil prices, a downturn that could weigh on the value of the assets for sale, the people cautioned.Credit Suisse Group AG, which advised Halliburton on its deal with Baker Hughes in November, is the global coordinator for all of the divestitures and will be involved in each auction, the people said. Halliburton remains in discussions with federal antitrust regulators regarding other possible divestitures, the people said. Investment banking mandates for Halliburton's cementing and well-completion businesses are expected to be awarded in the next two months once discussions with regulators have determined which assets should be divested, one of the people said.The sources required anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.

102,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Halliburton Co's decision to cut fewer jobs and keep its logistics network intact to capitalize on its pending merger with Baker Hughes Inc could give Schlumberger NV an edge at a time when cost cuts look like the best way forward.Halliburton is sticking to an ""elevated cost structure"" as it bets on its capacity to take on more work as a bigger company once the $35 billion deal closes, a move that could cost the company a 2-3 percent decline in near-time margins.But work itself is scarce, with oil producers doubling down for a long downturn in the North American shale industry, which has been crippled due to a slump in global oil prices.Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, recently wooed shareholders with 11,000 job cuts, in addition to the 9,000 announced earlier.

104,"   By Shubhankar Chakravorty  Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) quarterly profit beat analyst expectations by the biggest margin in at least eight quarters as cost cuts helped the oilfield services provider offset a steep fall in drilling in North America, its biggest market.The company's shares rose as much as 4.4 percent to $48.93 on Monday.Revenue fell by 4 percent to $7.05 billion in the first quarter, but beat analysts' average expectation of $6.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, helped by strength in the Middle East and Asia and Latin America.However, revenue and operating profit from all other regions fell.North America, which accounted for more than half the company's first-quarter revenue, ""experienced an unprecedented decline in drilling activity,"" Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in a statement.The average U.S. rig count has fallen about 40 percent since June and was at 1,110 in March, according to a Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) survey. Halliburton also forecast a fall in current-quarter revenue from North America as a 45 percent fall in oil prices since June continues to force drillers to slash spending.The company also forecast a fall in revenue from Latin America, hurt mainly by the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar against the dollar.Halliburton, which has cut more than 9,000 jobs, or over 10 percent of its global headcount in last two quarters, said it would cut capital spending by $500 million, or about 15 percent, to $2.8 billion this year. Industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) reported a better-than-expected profit last week and said it was shedding about 15 percent of its workforce, or 20,000 jobs.Baker Hughes, which will report results on Tuesday, had forecast cutting 7,000 jobs to rein in costs.Halliburton agreed to buy Baker Hughes for $35 billion last November, a deal aimed at helping the companies weather the slump in oil and resist pressure from producers to slash prices. Halliburton said earlier this month that it would sell three businesses to help get regulatory clearance for the deal.The company is likely to make additional divestitures to ensure the deal goes through, Chief Integration Officer Mark McCollum said on Monday.Excluding $1.21 billion in charges related to asset writedowns and other items, Halliburton earned 49 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 37 cents.The company's shares were up 3.5 percent at $48.53 in morning trading.

Halliburton's staff cuts in Nigeria are part of a company-wide jobs cull announced earlier this year to counter a sharp downturn in global oil prices since last summer that has shrunk profits. In April, the company, which provides drilling services to Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Chevron Corp in Africa's top oil producer, said it had cut 9,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of the global workforce, and that more were planned.""Halliburton is in conversations with the union to resolve the pending issues,"" a company spokeswoman said via email.

129,"   By Terry Wade and Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON BP Plc will pay up to $18.7 billion in penalties to the U.S. government and five states to resolve nearly all claims from its deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill five years ago in the largest corporate settlement in U.S. history.The agreement adds to the $43.8 billion that BP had previously set aside for criminal and civil penalties and cleanup costs. The company said its total pre-tax charge for the spill now stands at $53.8 billion. (link.reuters.com/duz94w)BP shares jumped more than 5 percent in New York trading as investors said the British company, often mentioned as a potential acquisition target, could now turn the page on one of the darkest chapters in its century-long history.Under the agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the states, BP will pay at least $12.8 billion for Clean Water Act fines and natural resource damages, plus $4.9 billion to states. The payouts will be staggered over as many as 18 years. The preliminary settlement, subject to all sorts of variables, avoids a substantial amount of further litigation.The rig explosion on April 20, 2010, the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history, killed 11 workers and spewed millions of barrels of oil onto the shorelines of several states for nearly three months.The agreement, which still needs to be approved by courts, covers Clean Water Act fines and natural resources damages, along with claims by Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas as well as 400 local government entities.""This is a realistic outcome which provides clarity and certainty for all parties,"" BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement. ""For BP, this agreement will resolve the largest liabilities remaining from the tragic accident.""  The size of the settlement was slightly more than the $17.6 billion that investors had initially feared BP would be fined for gross negligence under the Clean Water Act alone.   U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier, who has overseen the case, was expected to rule on that issue later this year. Even then, BP would have faced years of lawsuits to address claims by states and by the federal government under a natural resource damage assessment.The settlement announced Thursday closes off those remaining liabilities. ""This agreement will not only restore the damage inflicted on our coastal resources by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, it will also allow Louisiana to continue aggressively fighting coastal erosion,"" said Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, the hardest hit state.It was not immediately clear how BP will fund the settlement. BP has shed billions in assets to pay for the spill, eroding about one-fifth of the earnings base it had before 2010.BP's smaller size among the bigger oil majors has made it vulnerable to potential takeovers, especially with the sharp drop in oil prices.""Companies have been slightly hesitant to make a bid while this has been hanging over it, so I think it does clear the way for a potential bid,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at U.K.-based ETX Capital. BP said the government and the states could jointly demand an acceleration of payments if the company were acquired.Previous settlements also included an uncapped fund originally set at $7.8 billion to compensate individuals claiming economic harm from the spill.BP also settled with Transocean Ltd, which owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, and Halliburton Co, which worked on the Macondo well.""Now Gulf Coast restoration can begin in earnest. It's time to heal the wounds that BP tore in Gulf Coast ecosystems and communities,"" said David Yarnold, CEO of the National Audubon Society.

BP has shed billions in assets to pay for the spill, eroding about one-fifth of the earnings base it had before 2010.BP's smaller size among the bigger oil majors has made it vulnerable to potential takeovers, especially with the sharp drop in oil prices. ""Companies have been slightly hesitant to make a bid while this has been hanging over it, so I think it does clear the way for a potential bid,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at U.K.-based ETX Capital.BP said the government and the states could jointly demand an acceleration of payments if the company were acquired.Previous settlements also included an uncapped fund originally set at $7.8 billion to compensate individuals claiming economic harm from the spill.BP also settled with Transocean Ltd, which owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, and Halliburton Co, which worked on the Macondo well.""Now Gulf Coast restoration can begin in earnest. It's time to heal the wounds that BP tore in Gulf Coast ecosystems and communities,"" said David Yarnold, CEO of the National Audubon Society.(Reporting by Abhiram Nandakumar in Bengaluru, Ron Bousso in London and Kathy Finn in New Orleans; Writing by Terry Wade; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-07-02,HAL,"Thu Jul 2, 2015 | 6:15pm EDT",UPDATE 6-BP reaches $18.7 billion settlement over deadly 2010 spill,http://www.reuters.com//article/bp-gulfmexico-settlement-update-6-graphi-idUSL3N0ZI45320150702?type=companyNews
131,"  BP Plc reached a $18.7 billion settlement to end five years of litigation following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

The well is capped in mid-July. BP ultimately sets aside $42 billion to pay for cleanup costs, damages and penalties.* November 2012, CRIMINAL CASE SETTLED: BP agrees to pay $4.5 billion in fines and other penalties and pleads guilty to 14 criminal charges.

The company said in April that it would sell three of its drilling businesses. The cash-and-stock deal, announced in November, will create an oilfield services provider with higher revenue than market leader Schlumberger NV (SLB.N).The review date has been extended to the later of Nov. 25 or 90 days after Halliburton and Baker Hughes achieve ""substantial compliance"" with the department's second request, they said.

""There's going to be a further impact of pricing in the second half of the year. We haven't seen the full impact of that.""""There will be little to no improvement in pricing levels in North America and hence the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future.""""On the supply side of the oil market, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high cost producers is still playing out with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show."" ""We do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016, both for exploration and development related activity.""""We are prepared to carry slightly more cost into Q3 and this is not a significant part. Now, I can't say 100 percent certain that (growth is) going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we're saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom.""

When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in.""On Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc  merger: ""It's a bit difficult for me to say what the impact is. That's more of a customer question, right?

141,"   By Diane Bartz and Sneha Banerjee  Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co's  acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc  faces concerns from U.S. antitrust enforcers who believe the $35 billion merger will lead to higher prices and less innovation, according to a source close to the probe.A second source, who is also close to the probe, said the investigation into the proposed tie-up of the No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield services companies was far from complete and could well end with targeted divestitures to resolve the Justice Department's concerns.The combined company would overtake Schlumberger NV  as the No. 1 oilfield services provider.The Justice Department concern was first reported by Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/1HRYqUb) Share prices of both companies dropped on the report. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael said in an email to Reuters that the company was fully committed to its target of closing the acquisition in late 2015. Baker Hughes declined to comment.Halliburton has said it was willing to sell three drilling businesses to satisfy anticipated Justice Department concerns. Halliburton said on Monday that it was ""pleased with the prices and level of interest"" it had received. The second source called the potential purchasers ""impressive.""The Justice Department concern focused on two areas, according to the first source. One is that the drilling technology businesses would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders.

Microsoft fell as much as 4 percent to $45.35 after reporting its biggest quarterly loss, as the company wrote down its Nokia phone business and demand fell for its Windows operating system.Yahoo was down 0.8 percent at $39.38 after it forecast lower-than-expected revenue for the current quarter as it struggles to revive its core online advertising business.While markets are near record highs, June-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to dip 1.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, well below the 5.9 percent gain forecast on Jan. 1.So far, 70 percent have reported earnings above analyst expectations, above the 63 percent average beat rate since 1994. However, only 55 percent have topped revenue forecasts, below the 61 percent average beat rate since 2002.

Baker Hughes plans to cut about 13,000 jobs worldwide.Halliburton said in April it would cut 9,000 jobs, while Baker Hughes said it planned to reduce 10,500 jobs.Demand for oilfield services has been hit as oil producers have trimmed their budgets and lowered the number of rigs they planned to deploy this year.Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, said earlier in July that the company expects little improvement in pricing levels in the near future.  Houston-based Schlumberger said in April that it would cut 11,000 jobs, bringing the total job cuts announced this year to 20,000, or about 15 percent of its workforce.Oil producers have also cut thousands of jobs.

149,"   By Ernest Scheyder   (Story refiles to correct name in last paragraph to ""Beck"" from ""Bock"")By Ernest ScheyderWILLISTON, N.D. U.S. oil companies, under renewed pressure from falling crude prices, are increasingly tweaking and mixing fracking technologies as they scramble to squeeze more out of wells and eke out profits after rounds of cost-cutting. Shale oil firms need the experiments to payoff now more so than before given that oil prices have resumed their slide to trade around $49 per barrel this week from $60 a few months ago.Quarterly earnings - and the reams of data that accompany them - throughout the next few weeks will offer Wall Street the first opportunity to assess those efforts and pick potential winners and losers.When oil fetched $100 a barrel and profits were fatter, most companies followed a similar script. Now, many try to go their own way in a race to bring down the price level at which production remains profitable.Noting the new trend, CapitalOne Securities said in a recent note to clients that mixing up well completion techniques could result in ""a step-change in well performance."" For example, Continental Resources Inc is blending so-called plug and perforate well completion techniques with a ""sliding sleeve"" approach, betting that gains in oil volumes will outstrip additional costs of using more than one technology. Effectively, Continental divides a well into 30 or more sections, plugging off some and fracking others. For other parts of the well it uses a ""sleeve,"" a steel device that moves through the well and isolates small sections of a well at a time to be fracked. The approach has lifted initial production rates as much as 50 percent compared with nearby wells where standard procedures using just one method were applied, Continental president Jack Stark told investors two months ago. Stark will address Wall Street analysts again on August 6 with an update on the new approach. The company is expected to report a 95 percent drop in quarterly profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. To be sure, it will take months to fully assess the effectiveness of mixing and matching techniques across dozens of wells, though initial production rates, which get reported to state regulators, will offer a first glimpse. Wells are fracked by injecting a slurry of water, chemicals and sand at high pressure down holes to crack rock and release hydrocarbons. The technology, known for decades, has made big strides in the past six years when shale oil companies developed horizontal drilling that made oilfields more accessible. Whiting Petroleum Corp, North Dakota's largest oil producer, since this spring has experimented with pumping twice as much sand into a well during fracking as usual and has found it can boost output by as much as 40 percent. The Denver-based company, which is expected to barely eke out a profit when it reports quarterly results on Wednesday, was so encouraged by the output rise that earlier this month it increased its 2015 budget by 15 percent to $2.3 billion to finish more wells this year.Meanwhile, Hess Corp has opted to stick with just the cheaper ""sliding sleeve"" technique. Data from state oil regulators show that Hess has some of the most productive wells in North Dakota. ""I want to preserve that efficacy I have with sliding sleeve,"" Gerbert Schoonman, vice president in charge of Hess operations in North Dakota's Bakken shale oil formation, told Reuters. By contrast, Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy has chosen to continue to use ""plug and perforate"" in some areas and ""sliding sleeve"" in others, and not mix them up. Exxon is expected to report a nearly 50 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday.        ""We're trying to see what process works best in each part of the Bakken,"" Tim McIlwain, XTO's operations chief, said in an interview.Statoil is even looking beyond fracking designs. The Norwegian company is investigating whether artificial proppant shaped like the letter ""X"" could prove to be more effective at holding open cracks in shale rock than sand or ceramic balls. The technology, which is still being tested, came from a competition for scientists Statoil held earlier this year with General Electric Co to find new styles of proppant.""You can get more diameter out of the 'X' with less material than you could if it were a sphere of a sand grain,"" said Gene Beck, Statoil's North Dakota operations chief.

Halliburton would consider bids from a ""variety of interested parties in the near future,"" company spokeswoman Emily Mir said.   GE, Weatherford and Nabors were not immediately available for comment. U.S. antitrust enforcers believe the proposed $35 billion tie-up between Halliburton's and smaller rival Baker Hughes,  will lead to higher prices and lesser innovation in the oilfield services industry.  Halliburton, the No. 2 in the industry, had said it was willing to divest three drilling businesses in order to quell antitrust concerns expressed by the Justice Department.The department in July had said the drilling technology businesses would be sold to small companies that could not effectively compete with industry leaders.  GE, on the other hand, has been on a spree of selling parts of the conglomerate in order to sharpen its focus on industrial products. The latest business to be sold was the asset management arm to an investment management firm, last week.

Halliburton would consider bids from a ""variety of interested parties in the near future,"" company spokeswoman Emily Mir said.GE, Weatherford and Nabors were not immediately available for comment. U.S. antitrust enforcers believe the proposed $35 billion tie-up between Halliburton's and smaller rival Baker Hughes,  will lead to higher prices and lesser innovation in the oilfield services industry.Halliburton, the No. 2 in the industry, had said it was willing to divest three drilling businesses in order to quell antitrust concerns expressed by the Justice Department. The department in July had said the drilling technology businesses would be sold to small companies that could not effectively compete with industry leaders.GE, on the other hand, has been on a spree of selling parts of the conglomerate in order to sharpen its focus on industrial products. The latest business to be sold was the asset management arm to an investment management firm, last week.(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2015-09-15,HAL,"Mon Sep 14, 2015 | 8:21pm EDT",GE among bidders for Halliburton's assets -Bloomberg,http://www.reuters.com//article/halliburton-divestiture-idUSL4N11K5JK20150915?type=companyNews
161,"   By Daniel Wiessner  Halliburton Co will pay $18.3 million to more than 1,000 oil and gas workers it improperly exempted from overtime pay, the U.S. Department of Labor said on Tuesday, the latest development in a nationwide probe into wage practices in the industry.The department said Halliburton improperly identified workers in 28 job categories as exempt from overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. law governing wages and working hours. The company said it had begun paying the overtime and was cooperating with the Labor Department.The settlement is one of the largest for the Labor Department in recent years in an overtime case. Under the law, employees are entitled to mandatory overtime pay only if they earn less than $455 weekly or have few or no management duties. The Obama administration recently proposed more than doubling the income threshold, rankling business groups and Republican officials. The Labor Department said Halliburton automatically exempted all salaried workers from overtime without considering their income or job duties. ""Ignorance is never an excuse for violating the law,"" said Betty Campbell, a Labor Department official, in a statement. A Halliburton spokeswoman said the company independently discovered that workers had been misclassified during an internal audit and began paying workers overtime as required by the law. ""Throughout this process, Halliburton has worked earnestly and cooperatively with the U.S. Department of Labor to equitably resolve this situation,"" she said.  The company will pay $18.3 million to 1,016 employees. Halliburton has 70,000 employees in more than 80 countries.The Halliburton investigation was part of a larger ongoing probe into the oil and gas industry's pay practices, particularly in U.S. states in the Southwest and Northeast. In December, the Labor Department announced that a number of companies involved in natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, including Chesapeake Energy and Citrus Energy, would collectively pay $4.5 million to more than 5,300 workers who were improperly exempted from overtime pay. Halliburton, which has been hit by slumping crude oil prices and is buying Bakers Hughes Inc in a $35 billion deal, is cutting more than 14,000 jobs.

""We've been selling the defensive part of the portfolio exposed negatively to higher interest rates, such as consumer staples and utilities, and making room for what we see as a slow but gradual recovery in world growth.""BMO's Large-Cap Value Fund boosted it energy exposure to 13 percent from 10 percent at the end of February after buying more shares of ExxonMobil Corp and refiner Valero Energy Corp , for example.With oil prices down, ExxonMobil is seen as a defensive play because its refineries and chemicals manufacturing can benefit from lower input costs and offset lower profits from crude production.Shares of Exxon and other oil majors, such as Chevron Corp  and ConocoPhillips are hardly doing any better than the S&P 500 Energy Index, which is down 25 percent this year.Exxon shares are off 21 percent, while Chevron and Conoco are down 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, reflecting expectations that the global crude supply glut will persist, ultimately weighing on their returns. A Reuters analysis of 265 actively managed large-cap funds with at least $500 million in assets and combined assets of about $1.8 trillion, revealed that 25 percent of them increased their energy sector bets this year.That overall group of funds produced an average return of minus 7.17 percent so far this year, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company. And three-quarters of the funds that increased  their exposure to energy performed worse than the overall average.

BMO's Ramos said managers and investors have to remain patient with their energy picks.""We think we will eventually be rewarded with these stocks,"" he said.The $2 billion Ridgeworth Large Cap Value Equity Fund  made among the biggest bets on the energy sector among its peers earlier this year, raising its exposure to 14 percent at the end of August from 6.7 percent at the end of February, according to Lipper. The fund nearly doubled its stake in ConocoPhillips and bought more shares in EOG Resources, Hess Corp and Noble Energy Inc, disclosures show.All of those stocks are down at least 19 percent over the past three months, badly underperforming broad benchmarks. The Ridgeworth fund's year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story.Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too.Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund's assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time.

The core of the agreement includes $7.1 billion for natural resource damages, $5.5 billion for Clean Water Act fines, and $4.9 billion in payments to states.The Macondo well blowout and the fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20, 2010 killed 11 workers. Federal and state officials formally filed the settlement on Monday and it should be approved by a U.S. District Court in Louisiana soon.""The filing of the consent decree does not reflect a new settlement or any new money,"" BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said.In the past, BP has paid for liabilities by shedding assets, eroding about one-fifth of the earnings base it had before 2010. Its smaller size among the bigger oil majors has made it vulnerable to potential takeovers, analysts have said.BP has effectively settled all big claims from the spill. Previous settlements included a fund originally set at $7.8 billion to compensate individuals claiming economic harm from the spill.Other settlements included one with contractors Transocean Ltd and Halliburton Co.

The two divide the work of antitrust enforcement.The hearing will be March 9 at the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, which is headed by Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah. One matter that will be taken up is the FTC's use of Section Five, a portion of its authority that it uses to investigate companies which urge rivals to collude with them on price.The agencies are looking at a startling number of major, controversial mergers. The Justice Department is investigating two large insurance mergers - Aetna Inc (AET.N) buying Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) buying Cigna Corp (CI.N) - to insure they comply with antitrust law.

Many traders believe an output cut and not freeze is what the market needs to clear the global crude glut.""It's the Venezuela headline that got the market excited enough to rebound, though it's baffling why as everyone knows of this meeting and that it's not going to achieve anything,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, a New York energy hedge fund.U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled up 92 cents, or 2.9 percent, at $33.07 a barrel.

211,"   By Michael Flaherty and Diane Bartz  The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday sued ValueAct Capital for violating notification requirements related to Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) deal to buy rival Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), in a case that the activist hedge fund says it will fight. The lawsuit centers on a 40-year old U.S. law that exempts investors who buy up to 10 percent of a company's voting securities from disclosing purchases made only for passive investment purposes.The Department of Justice alleges that ValueAct was an active investor from the time it started to build its position in both companies shortly after the November 2014 merger agreement, and that the hedge fund violated the law - known as the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act - by waiting too long to disclose its intentions.""Plainly the regulators are trying to send a message that their view of what constitutes passivity is far more restrictive than what some portfolio managers apparently believe,"" said Christopher Davis, a partner at law firm Kleinberg Kaplan who chairs its mergers practice. The lawsuit said ValueAct used its access to senior Halliburton and Baker Hughes executives to formulate the merger and other strategies. The government is seeking a civil penalty of at least $19 million - a penalty it deemed ""significant.""""ValueAct was not entitled to avoid HSR requirements by claiming to be a passive investor,"" Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said in a press release.ValueAct, a $16 billion activist hedge fund, said it will contest the case, a departure from similar violation lawsuits that ended with investors settling with the government.""We fundamentally disagree with the Department of Justice’s allegations in this case,"" the San Francisco-based hedge fund said in an emailed statement. The lawsuit is another recent blow to ValueAct, which since August has had to stomach huge paper losses on its investment in embattled drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.N), which is under federal investigation.  ValueAct said having a relationship with a company's management, conducting due diligence and engaging with other stock owners are basic principles of shareholder rights. At issue is what defines passive investing. For ValueAct and other activist shareholders, engaging with management teams directly is a key part of their strategy to push for changes that activists feel is needed to boost a company's stock price.In the government's case against ValueAct, federal officials used emails to underscore their case that the hedge fund crossed the ""passive"" boundary as early as a month after the Halliburton agreement. The lawsuit says that on Dec. 5, 2014, the day ValueAct's Halliburton holdings crossed the HSR Act threshold, a ValueAct partner sent an email to ValueAct's founder and CEO Jeffrey Ubben suggesting a new compensation structure for Halliburton's chief executive.The partner suggested that the compensation plan of Valeant's CEO - a plan that is heavily weighted toward stock-based incentives - would be a good model for Halliburton's chief executive, the government says in its complaint, to which Ubben agreed. Halliburton is still awaiting regulatory approval for the acquisition, which was worth $35 billion when it was announced but has since fallen by nearly half, hit by the plunge in oil prices.The Hart Scott Rodino Act provides the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice with information about large mergers and acquisitions. Last August, Third Point LLC settled U.S. FTC charges that it failed to properly seek HSR clearance while it built a stake in Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) in 2011. The hedge fund did not pay a penalty but entered a five-year agreement to make appropriate disclosures. In the case of ValueAct, the hedge fund bought Halliburton and Baker Hughes shares shortly after the merger, having previously been a Halliburton shareholder. In January 2015, ValueAct said in a regulatory filing that it owned more than 5 percent of Baker Hughes shares. In October that same year, with oil prices plunging and confidence in the deal sagging, it amended the filing to say that it was going to take an activist position in Baker Hughes. The following month, ValueAct filed its HSR disclosure, a person familiar with the matter said. ValueAct's Halliburton-Baker Hughes holdings have cost the fund dearly in paper losses, Reuters previously reported.   The Justice Department noted on Monday that ValueAct filed “corrective notifications” for three acquisitions in 2003 and two years later, failed to inform the government of three acquisitions, paying a $1.1 million civil penalty.

It was the S&P's first decline in six sessions, leaving the index flat for 2016.As S&P 500 companies hand in their first-quarter reports over the next several weeks, average earnings are expected to fall 7.1 percent from the year-ago period, with the energy sector weighing most heavily, according to Thomson Reuters data.   ""General consensus is that we're going to see declining earnings,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. ""The big question is how big are those declines going to be?"" Reflecting concerns on Wall Street, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Tuesday warned of increasing risks to global economic growth unless policymakers take stronger measures.A week earlier Fed Chair Janet Yellen urged caution on rate hikes, citing a shaky global economy and low oil prices. Oil steadied near one-month lows after Kuwait said an output freeze by top producers would proceed without Iran. [O/R]Data on Tuesday showed the U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in February, while another report showed services sector activity rose in March.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 0.75 percent to end at 17,603.32 and the S&P 500 .SPX lost 20.96 points to 2,045.17. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC fell 0.98 percent to 4,843.93. Among the 10 major S&P sectors, the interest rate-sensitive utilities sector .SPLRCU fell the most, down 1.88 percent.The S&P financials sector .SPSY dropped 1.44 percent, led by Wells Fargo (WFC.N), which lost 2.04 percent.Allergan (AGN.N) shares fell 14.77 percent after the U.S. Treasury unveiled rules to curb tax inversion deals, potentially derailing the drug maker's merger with Pfizer (PFE.N). Pfizer climbed 2.1 percent. Allergan was the biggest negative influence on the S&P 500.Baker Hughes (BHI.N) fell 5.09 percent after Reuters reported that the U.S. Justice Department will file a lawsuit as soon as this week to stop oilfield services provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N) from acquiring the oil services company.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,131 to 878. On the Nasdaq, 1,971 issues fell and 818 rose.The S&P 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 37 lows.   About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, a little below the 7.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

226,"  EU competition regulators have resumed their scrutiny of U.S. oil industry services group Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) plan to acquire smaller rival Baker Hughes (BHI.N), a deal which U.S. authorities say is uncompetitive and wants to block.The European Commission, which halted its investigation into the $35 billion deal last month while waiting for more details from the companies, will now decide by Aug. 11 whether to clear or veto the takeover.""Once the requested missing information is provided the Commission restarts the clock,"" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. The EU antitrust authority has previously expressed concerns that the deal may reduce competition and innovation. Halliburton has said it is willing to sell assets from both companies with a combined 2013 revenue of $5.2 billion but has yet to make a formal offer to regulators. The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit last week to stop the merger, valued at $35 billion when it was first announced in November 2014, saying it would leave only two dominant suppliers in 20 business lines in the global well drilling and oil industry construction services industry, with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) being one of the two.

227,"   By Michael Flaherty and Ross Kerber | NEW YORK/BOSTON  NEW YORK/BOSTON The U.S. government's lawsuit against ValueAct Capital targets one activist investor but could call into question routine practices across the $16 trillion mutual fund industry, according to attorneys and industry representatives.The U.S. Department of Justice last week alleged that the hedge fund improperly classified two company investments as passive - and therefore exempt from disclosure requirements - while taking an activist role with executives. ValueAct disputes the claim.Some communications the government cites as evidence are similar to discussions that are increasingly common between traditional, buy-and-hold funds and companies in their portfolios.The case comes as active and passive investors work more together to pressure management at underperforming companies. Activists court passive shareholders before launching such a campaign, and passive investors recruit activists to agitate, several activist managers told Reuters. Traditional funds may need to reassess their compliance with disclosure laws, according to a memo to clients from Davis Polk, a New York law firm with expertise in financial services.""Such an institution will have to examine whether it can claim to have a truly 'passive' intent,"" said the memo, issued in response to the ValueAct case.Those firms could include, for instance, T. Rowe Price Group (TROW.O), BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group. Spokespeople at those companies declined to comment, and representatives of seven additional fund firms contacted by Reuters declined to comment or said executives were unavailable. The Justice Department also declined to comment.An industry trade group said the case could restrain shareholders from addressing important issues with corporate executives and board directors.""The DOJ case could have a chilling effect on dialogues between companies and their shareholders,"" said Amy Borrus, deputy director at the Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit whose members include pensions, endowments and major mutual funds.For a graphic showing the increase in company shareholder communication programs, see tmsnrt.rs/25PYHpm Competition for better returns has led some big mutual fund firms to take a more active role, weighing in on issues such as CEO pay and corporate governance.

228,"  (Corrects to remove extraneous word from penultimate paragraph)By Michael Flaherty and Ross KerberNEW YORK/BOSTON, April 12 The U.S. government's lawsuit against ValueAct Capital targets one activist investor but could call into question routine practices across the $16 trillion mutual fund industry, according to attorneys and industry representatives.The U.S. Department of Justice last week alleged that the hedge fund improperly classified two company investments as passive - and therefore exempt from disclosure requirements - while taking an activist role with executives. ValueAct disputes the claim.Some communications the government cites as evidence are similar to discussions that are increasingly common between traditional, buy-and-hold funds and companies in their portfolios.The case comes as active and passive investors work more together to pressure management at underperforming companies. Activists court passive shareholders before launching such a campaign, and passive investors recruit activists to agitate, several activist managers told Reuters.Traditional funds may need to reassess their compliance with disclosure laws, according to a memo to clients from Davis Polk, a New York law firm with expertise in financial services.""Such an institution will have to examine whether it can claim to have a truly 'passive' intent,"" said the memo, issued in response to the ValueAct case.Those firms could include, for instance, T. Rowe Price Group , BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group. Spokespeople at those companies declined to comment, and representatives of seven additional fund firms contacted by Reuters declined to comment or said executives were unavailable. The Justice Department also declined to comment.An industry trade group said the case could restrain shareholders from addressing important issues with corporate executives and board directors.""The DOJ case could have a chilling effect on dialogues between companies and their shareholders,"" said Amy Borrus, deputy director at the Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit whose members include pensions, endowments and major mutual funds. For a graphic showing the increase in company shareholder communication programs, see tmsnrt.rs/25PYHpmCompetition for better returns has led some big mutual fund firms to take a more active role, weighing in on issues such as CEO pay and corporate governance.

244,"   By Mike Stone  Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) announced the termination of their $28 billion merger deal on Sunday after opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators.The tie-up would have brought together the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies, raising concerns it would result in higher prices in the sector. It is the latest example of a large merger deal failing to make it to the finish line because of antitrust hurdles.""Challenges in obtaining remaining regulatory approvals and general industry conditions that severely damaged deal economics led to the conclusion that termination is the best course of action,"" said Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton.The contract governing Halliburton's cash-and-stock acquisition of Baker Hughes, which was valued at $34.6 billion when it was announced in November 2014, and is now worth about $28 billion, expired on Saturday without an agreement by the companies to extend it, Reuters reported earlier on Sunday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Halliburton will pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee by Wednesday as a result of the deal falling apart. The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit last month to stop the merger, arguing it would leave only two dominant suppliers in 20 business lines in the global well drilling and oil construction services industry, with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) being the other. ""The companies' decision to abandon this transaction – which would have left many oilfield service markets in the hands of a duopoly – is a victory for the U.S. economy and for all Americans,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement on Sunday.The European Commission also previously expressed concerns that the deal might reduce competition and innovation.The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce U.S. antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop an unusually high number of deals in the past 18 months. Lynch said last month that the number of big and complex deals being proposed made it ""a unique moment in antitrust enforcement."" The collapse of Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes comes as both companies struggle to cope with the impact that lower energy prices are having on their clients. Last week, Baker Hughes reported a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss and warned that the rig count globally would drop steadily through the end of the year because of fewer new projects.Halliburton said last month it cut more than 6,000 jobs in the first quarter as revenue slumped 40.4 percent and it took a $2.1 billion restructuring charge mainly for severance costs and asset write-offs. The merger's cancellation also represents a blow to the investment bankers who advised the companies, as their fee, typically in the range of a percentage point of a deal's value, is largely predicated upon the transaction being completed.

259,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Halliburton Co indicated that demand for its fracking equipment was returning, despite the fewer number of rigs at work, as high-intensity shale drilling soaked up all the available capacity in the market.Halliburton is the world's largest provider of equipment used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking - the process of pumping water and chemicals, known as proppants, into shale rocks to extract oil and gas.U.S. shale oil producers - Halliburton's customers - are now drilling longer horizontal wells with multiple fracking stages, and deploying more horsepower and proppants to cover larger areas. This high-intensity drilling is boosting demand for fracking equipment.""Let me start today with a headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity,"" the company's president, Jeff Miller, said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday.""I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market.""The company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and said it expected a ""modest uptick"" in rig count in the second half of the year. The U.S. rig count climbed by 7 to 447 in the week ended July 15, but is far short of the 1,931 at work in September 2014.Demand for Halliburton and rival Schlumberger NV's fracking equipment has also received a boost because a number of smaller services firms have mothballed equipment in response to a two-year rout in oil prices.Even Baker Hughes Inc, the world's third-largest oilfield service firm, said in April it was limiting its exposure to the pressure pumping business in North America to two basins. Many firms have also stripped idle fracking gear for parts to repair the ones in use.Up to 4 million of horsepower, representing about a fifth of peak capacity has been permanently removed from the market, Halliburton's Miller said on the call.Halliburton, however, preserved idle equipment, positioning the company to quickly get back to work. A near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices since February has brought oil producers back to the shale patch. Many shale producers are now completing previously-drilled-but-uncompleted wells, and some even drilling new wells.If a service firm were to re-activate cold-stacked equipment today, it would cost about $300,000, while replacing parts on cannibalized equipment may run into millions, said Evercore ISI analyst James West.The high costs are likely to keep cannibalized equipment off the market, giving Halliburton an advantage, West said.Schlumberger is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday.

262,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair  Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world's No.2 oilfield services provider, said it expects a ""modest uptick"" in rig count in the second half of the year, but emphasized that the current low pricing environment was unsustainable.Shares of the company were down about 1.6 percent at $44.24 in morning trading on Wednesday.Shale oil companies have started putting rigs back to work, encouraged by a near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices CLc1 since February.""We believe the North America market has turned,"" Chief Executive David Lesar said in a statement on Wednesday.But the rise in rig count has come without a corresponding jump in spending by oil and gas producers as increased productivity in the hydraulic fracturing process yields more barrels at lower cost.Lesar said on a post-earnings call that while some efficiency gains were sustainable and would continue, ""deep, uneconomic pricing cuts"" would have to be reversed.""Price negotiations have been a bar room brawl,"" company President Jeffrey Miller said on the call. With signs of recovery, the company has walked away from money-losing jobs in recent months and has been reviewing every contract and program, down to individual wells, Miller said.""It's a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases.""The company expects margins in North America to improve by 100 to 200 basis points in the third quarter. Halliburton derives about 40 percent of its revenue from North America and is more exposed to the region than larger rival Schlumberger NV (SLB.N).Excluding a $3.5 billion fee Halliburton paid Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) for terminating a proposed acquisition and other items, loss from continuing operations was 14 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 19 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Halliburton and Baker Hughes scrapped their deal - valued at about $35 billion when it was announced in November 2014 - in May after opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators.

263,"  CARACAS Oil services provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N) on Wednesday reported a $148 million loss as a result of accepting a promissory note in exchange for unpaid invoices linked to Venezuela operations.Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has built up more than $19 billion in debts to providers as it struggles with low oil prices and a decaying socialist economy, leading some leading service companies to slow operations.PDVSA President Eulogio del Pino has said the company was discussing financing agreements with Halliburton, Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N) and Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and was in talks to securitize provider debts. Halliburton said in a quarterly earnings report that it exchanged $200 million in trade receivables for a promissory note through a financing agreement with its ""primary customer in Venezuela.""  It said it subsequently ""recorded the note at its fair market value at the date of exchange, resulting in a $148 million pre-tax loss.""PDVSA and its subsidiaries are the only firms legally allowed to operate in Venezuelan oil fields. PDVSA said in its 2015 earnings report that it had issued $831 million in promissory notes, which pay 6.5 percent interest and mature in 2019, to pay off providers.It was not immediately evident if that sum includes the notes issued to Halliburton. Industry analysts say that problems in payments to services providers are linked to reports of declining production at PDVSA.

264,"  CARACAS, July 20 Oil services provider Halliburton Co on Wednesday reported a $148 million loss as a result of accepting a promissory note in exchange for unpaid invoices linked to Venezuela operations.Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has built up more than $19 billion in debts to providers as it struggles with low oil prices and a decaying socialist economy, leading some leading service companies to slow operations.PDVSA President Eulogio del Pino has said the company was discussing financing agreements with Halliburton, Weatherford International Plc and Schlumberger NV and was in talks to securitize provider debts.Halliburton said in a quarterly earnings report that it exchanged $200 million in trade receivables for a promissory note through a financing agreement with its ""primary customer in Venezuela."" It said it subsequently ""recorded the note at its fair market value at the date of exchange, resulting in a $148 million pre-tax loss."" PDVSA and its subsidiaries are the only firms legally allowed to operate in Venezuelan oil fields.PDVSA said in its 2015 earnings report that it had issued $831 million in promissory notes, which pay 6.5 percent interest and mature in 2019, to pay off providers. It was not immediately evident if that sum includes the notes issued to Halliburton.Industry analysts say that problems in payments to services providers are linked to reports of declining production at PDVSA. Del Pino has denied reports of declining production and insists service company debts are being resolved.

265,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair  Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world's No.2 oilfield services provider, said it expects a ""modest uptick"" in rig count in the second half of the year, but emphasized that the current low pricing environment was unsustainable.Shares of the company were down about 1.6 percent at $44.24 in morning trading on Wednesday.Shale oil companies have started putting rigs back to work, encouraged by a near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices CLc1 since February.""We believe the North America market has turned,"" Chief Executive David Lesar said in a statement on Wednesday.But the rise in rig count has come without a corresponding jump in spending by oil and gas producers as increased productivity in the hydraulic fracturing process yields more barrels at lower cost.Lesar said on a post-earnings call that while some efficiency gains were sustainable and would continue, ""deep, uneconomic pricing cuts"" would have to be reversed.""Price negotiations have been a bar room brawl,"" company President Jeffrey Miller said on the call. With signs of recovery, the company has walked away from money-losing jobs in recent months and has been reviewing every contract and program, down to individual wells, Miller said.""It's a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases.""The company expects margins in North America to improve by 100 to 200 basis points in the third quarter. Halliburton derives about 40 percent of its revenue from North America and is more exposed to the region than larger rival Schlumberger NV (SLB.N).Excluding a $3.5 billion fee Halliburton paid Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) for terminating a proposed acquisition and other items, loss from continuing operations was 14 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 19 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Halliburton and Baker Hughes scrapped their deal - valued at about $35 billion when it was announced in November 2014 - in May after opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. Net loss attributable to Halliburton was $3.21 billion, or $3.73 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $54 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 35 percent to $3.84 billion, but beat analysts' average estimate of $3.75 billion.Schlumberger is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Thursday, while Baker Hughes will release its earnings on July 28.

268,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Halliburton Co indicated that demand for its fracking equipment was returning, despite the fewer number of rigs at work, as high-intensity shale drilling soaked up all the available capacity in the market.Halliburton is the world's largest provider of equipment used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking - the process of pumping water and chemicals, known as proppants, into shale rocks to extract oil and gas.U.S. shale oil producers - Halliburton's customers - are now drilling longer horizontal wells with multiple fracking stages, and deploying more horsepower and proppants to cover larger areas. This high-intensity drilling is boosting demand for fracking equipment.""Let me start today with a headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity,"" the company's president, Jeff Miller, said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday.""I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market.""The company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and said it expected a ""modest uptick"" in rig count in the second half of the year. The U.S. rig count climbed by 7 to 447 in the week ended July 15, but is far short of the 1,931 at work in September 2014.Demand for Halliburton and rival Schlumberger NV's fracking equipment has also received a boost because a number of smaller services firms have mothballed equipment in response to a two-year rout in oil prices.Even Baker Hughes Inc, the world's third-largest oilfield service firm, said in April it was limiting its exposure to the pressure pumping business in North America to two basins. Many firms have also stripped idle fracking gear for parts to repair the ones in use.Up to 4 million of horsepower, representing about a fifth of peak capacity has been permanently removed from the market, Halliburton's Miller said on the call.Halliburton, however, preserved idle equipment, positioning the company to quickly get back to work. A near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices since February has brought oil producers back to the shale patch. Many shale producers are now completing previously-drilled-but-uncompleted wells, and some even drilling new wells.If a service firm were to re-activate cold-stacked equipment today, it would cost about $300,000, while replacing parts on cannibalized equipment may run into millions, said Evercore ISI analyst James West.The high costs are likely to keep cannibalized equipment off the market, giving Halliburton an advantage, West said.Schlumberger is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday.

269,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc said it did not expect a substantial recovery in drilling and pricing in North America this year, in contrast with comments from bigger rivals Schlumberger Ltd and Halliburton Co.Baker Hughes' shares, however, rose about 3 percent to $45.88 after the company said it expected margins to improve across its businesses due to recent job cuts and other restructuring actions.""I don't subscribe to the hopeful commentary,"" Baker Hughes Chief Executive Martin Craighead said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday.Schlumberger said last week the oil downturn appeared to have bottomed out, while Halliburton said it expected a ""modest uptick"" in North American rig count in the second half of 2016. ""I believe oil prices in the upper $50s (per barrel) at a minimum are required for a sustainable recovery in North America,"" Craighead said.Baker Hughes' outlook was more ""sanguine"" than its peers',  said Evercore ISI analyst James West, noting that oil prices have slid from last week, when Schlumberger and Halliburton reported results. Prices for both globally traded Brent futures and U.S. crude are down about 5 percent this week.In May, Baker Hughes and Halliburton scrapped their long-stalled deal - valued at about $35 billion when it was announced in 2014 - due to opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. The companies had hoped the merger would help them weather the worst oil price crash in a generation.Baker Hughes said in May proceeds from a $3.5 billion breakup fee from Halliburton would fund a $1.5 billion share buyback and a $1 billion debt repayment. Baker Hughes, which expects to save an annualized $500 million in cost by the end of 2016, said it cut 3,000 jobs in the second quarter. The company had laid off 2,000 employees in the first quarter and 18,000 last year. Baker Hughes had about 43,000 employees at the end of 2015.The company also said it was planning to launch new products this year, most of them for lowering costs and optimizing oil production. Net loss attributable to the company widened to $911 million, or $2.08 per share, in the quarter ended June 30.Excluding charges related to restructuring and asset writedown, the company reported a loss of 90 cents per share, bigger than the 62 cents analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell 39.3 percent to $2.41 billion.

272,"   By Anet Josline Pinto  Halliburton Co, the world's No.2 oilfield services provider, said oil prices would have to stabilize at above $50 per barrel for producers to meaningfully increase oilfield activity.The company posted a surprise quarterly profit on Wednesday by ""relentlessly managing costs"" and taking advantage of a rise in the number of rigs operating in North America.Halliburton shares rose as much as 6 percent to $49.81 in morning trading, their highest in nearly 18 months.Oil prices have nearly doubled since touching a low of $26.05 in February, prompting oil producers to put rigs back to work. U.S. oil was trading at $51.80 at 1534 GMT (1134 EDT), the tenth day in a row it has traded above $50.The U.S. onshore rig count rose by about a quarter in the three months ended September, according to a closely watched report from Baker Hughes Inc, which competes with Halliburton.  The rise in U.S. rig count is being driven by smaller operators, Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on a post-earnings call.""We saw a trend of less service-intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today's pricing,"" he said.Halliburton said it expected pricing pressure to continue globally and activity in the current quarter to be weak due to holiday and seasonal weather-related downtime.  This ""does not change our view that things are getting better,"" Lesar said.Halliburton's revenue from North America, which accounts for more than 40 percent of its total business, rose 9 percent from the second quarter - its first increase in seven quarters. But sluggish demand from international markets pulled down total revenue by 31.3 percent to $3.83 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $3.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cost cuts helped offset the fall in revenue. Halliburton plans to cut ""structural costs"" by about 25 percent, or $1 billion, on an annual run-rate basis by the end of 2016.Profit attributable to Halliburton was $6 million, or 1 cent per share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $54 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 6 cents per share.Market leader Schlumberger is scheduled to report on Thursday and Baker Hughes is scheduled to report on Tuesday.

277,"  WASHINGTON A Republican antitrust veteran has been named on Monday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's transition team for the Justice Department, a choice that lawyers say signals a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement compared to Democratic President Barack Obama.David Higbee, a partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams LLP, worked for President George W. Bush's administration from 2001 to 2005, spending the last year in the Antitrust Division. Since then he has advised clients on merger reviews, antitrust litigation and government investigations. Higbee joins Joshua Wright, an economist and former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, as the only two people on Trump's transition team with a background in antitrust.The Obama administration has challenged an unusually large number of mergers in the last few years, leading to the collapse of Halliburton Co's plan to buy Baker Hughes Inc, among others. Currently, the Justice Department is suing Anthem Inc to prevent it from buying Cigna Corp and Aetna Inc to stop its purchase of Humana Inc. While Trump, who campaigned as a populist, has talked tough on media mergers such as AT&T Inc buying Time Warner Inc, and singled out Amazon.com Inc for antitrust scrutiny, Higbee's naming heralds a return to a traditional Republican view of merger enforcement, lawyers said. ""Higbee will have that sensible caution,"" said Bruce McDonald, another veteran of the Bush administration now at the law firm Jones Day. ""He will be more confident in business and markets and less confident that government can identify and fix problems.""An antitrust division designed by Higbee would be tough on price-fixing and mergers of competitors but would be cautious in challenging deals where companies buy suppliers or incidents where companies are accused of breaking antitrust law to run competitors out of business, McDonald said.
