0,"  * Local entrepreneur makes black dolls to fill market niche* Africa not a major focus for world No.1 toymaker Mattel* Economists predict consumer boom for NigeriaBy Angela Ukomadu and Tim CocksLAGOS, Jan 15 With a booming economy in Nigeria and more black children than anywhere else in the world, Taofick Okoya was dismayed some years ago when he couldn't find a black doll for his niece.The 43-year-old spotted a gap in the market and with little competition from foreign firms such as Mattel Inc, the maker of Barbie, he set up his own business. He outsourced manufacturing of doll parts to low-cost China, assembled them onshore and added a twist - traditional Nigerian costumes.Seven years on, Okoya sells between 6,000 and 9,000 of his ""Queens of Africa"" and ""Naija Princesses"" a month, and reckons he has 10-15 percent of a small but fast-growing market.""I like it,"" said five year-old Ifunanya Odiah, struggling to contain her excitement as she checked out one of Okoya's dolls in a Lagos shopping mall. ""It's black, like me.""While multinational companies are flocking to African markets, Okoya's experience suggests that, in some areas at least, there is still an opportunity for domestic businesses to establish themselves by using local knowledge to tap a growing, diverse and increasingly sophisticated middle class.There's no doubt about Nigeria's economic potential. Economist Jim O'Neill has this year popularised it as one of the ""MINT"" countries - alongside Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey - that he sees as successors to the first wave of emerging markets he dubbed the BRICs (Brazil, Russia and India and China).With around 170 million people, Nigeria is Africa's most populous country by far, and its economy is growing at about 7 percent, vying with South Africa as the continent's largest.Several multinational firms have been here for years. Drinks group Diageo, for example, now sells more Guinness in Nigeria than in the beer's traditional home market of Ireland. South African grocer Shoprite has seven profitable stores in Nigeria and plans to roll out hundreds. While Western economies struggle, the appeal of emerging markets for toymakers is clear. Between 2006 and 2011, developed countries saw toy sales grow just 1 percent a year, versus 13 percent in emerging markets, according to Euromonitor data.But in Nigeria, basic goods aside, consumerism is in its infancy, creating opportunities for entrepreneurs.""When it comes to sectors like spirits or beer, or even cement, all the international players are already there,"" said Andy Gboka, London-based equity analyst at Exotix LLP Partners.""Other sectors, such as toys or less-developed industries, provide a huge potential for local companies."" TAILORED TO LOCAL TASTES Mattel, the world's largest toy company, has been selling black dolls for decades, but said its presence in sub-Saharan Africa was ""very limited"". Furthermore, the firm does not ""have any plans for expansion into this region to share at this time,"" according to spokesman Alan Hilowitz.There are good reasons for foreign companies to be cautious.While Nigeria sees thousands of births every day, two thirds of children are born into families unable to afford anything off the shelves of most toy shops.Multinationals also cite poor infrastructure and corrupt port authorities as reasons for steering clear.South Africa's Woolworths pulled out of Nigeria last year, blaming supply chain problems, though analysts said it also misread the local clothes market. The longer companies such as Mattel wait, however, the more time Okoya has to build his business and shape consumer tastes.At a small factory in Lagos' Surulere suburb, his workers stitch brightly patterned West African fabrics into miniature dresses and ""geles"" - traditional head gear.Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups of Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa are represented in the ""Queens of Africa"" range so far, highlighting the growing sophistication of consumers - and the need to tailor products to local tastes.The dolls go for between 1,300 Nigerian naira to the special edition 3,500 naira ($22), while cheaper ""Naija Princesses"" sell for 500 to 1,000 naira apiece. Okoya makes a profit margin of about one third, and as well as selling at home, is increasingly shipping to the United States and Europe.He plans dolls from other African ethnic groups, and is in talks with South Africa's Game, owned by Massmart, a part of Wal-Mart, to sell to 70 shops across Africa.Like Barbies, Okoya's dolls are slim, despite the fact that most of Africa abhors the Western ideal of stick-thin models.Okoya said his early templates were larger bodied, and the kids didn't like them. But he still hopes to change that.""For now, we have to hide behind the 'normal' doll. Once we've built the brand, we can make dolls with bigger bodies.""",2014-01-15,MAT,"Wed Jan 15, 2014 | 6:00am EST","In Nigeria, Queens of Africa steal a march on Barbie",http://www.reuters.com//article/nigeria-dolls-idUSL6N0KH2IW20140115?type=companyNews

When I get on the hill I'll know I've already done well there. It gives me a little bit of confidence."" Mattel is seventh in the World Cup standings after a series of good recent results and Jacques Gaillard, coach of the French women's team, is confident she will do well.""We hope at the minimum for a medal and why not the best one? She has the potential for that,"" he said. Mattel, who started jumping at the age of seven, came fourth in the World Championships in 2013 and won bronze in 2011.She also won the junior World Championship in 2011 and took second place in the 2014 competition held last month.Mattel, who is 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall and weighs 126 pounds (57 kg), sounded confident she could catch 17-year-old Sara Takanashi of Japan, the current World Champion and the runaway World Cup leader. ""At the start of the season she was certainly very, very impressive. She is jumping really well but we're at the Games and I think it's different,"" said Mattel.""At events like this she is not unbeatable: I think there are five or six girls who can get close to her and scare her.

Mega Brands' stock hit a high of C$17.89 in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, indicating some investors were expecting a higher offer.However, analysts said there was minimal chance of a rival offer for Montreal-based Mega Brands, which has long been viewed by some as a viable acquisition target for Mattel.""While the possibility of another offer exists, particularly in a toy industry dominated by giants, we feel it is unlikely,"" National Bank Financial analysts led by Leon Aghazarian wrote in a note to clients.Mattel's stock has fallen about 9 percent in the past 12 months.

Lego offers toy sets based on Star Wars, the Simpsons and DC comic characters such as Batman.The deal will also help Mattel expand its arts and crafts offerings with the addition of Mega Brands' Rose Art collection.Sales of building sets as well as arts and craft toys increased in the United States in 2013, amidst a 1 percent fall in overall toy sales, according to market research firm NPD Group. The fall was driven by declines in sales of action figures and preschool toys.Both Mattel and Hasbro posted lower-than-expected results in the holiday selling season, when toymakers typically make about 40 percent of their annual revenue. Mega Brands estimated net sales of $405 million in 2013. Mattel said it expects the deal to hurt earnings in 2014, before adding to profit next year.Mattel said shareholders holding 39 percent of Mega Brands, comprising Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd and the company's founding family, have agreed to vote in favor of the deal.Fairfax, run by Prem Watsa, is Mega Brands' largest shareholder with a stake of 27.4 percent as of December 31.Mega Brands will pay Mattel a termination fee of $12 million if it accepts an unsolicited proposal, subject to Mattel's right to match the proposal, the companies said in a joint statement.Mattel said it plans to fund the acquisition through a combination of new debt and cash.

29,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 29 (Fitch) Continued struggles and a change at the top have  sent credit default swap (CDS) spreads for Mattel Inc. to levels not seen in  four years, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest CDS Case Study Snapshot. Five-year CDS on Mattel widened out 49% over the past month. After pricing  consistently in-line with 'BBB' levels for much of the past year, the cost of  credit protection on Mattel's debt has now moved into below-investment grade  space.  'The bulk of Mattel's CDS widening has taken place over the earlier part of this  week, with spreads moving out 32%,' said  Diana Allmendinger. 'Likely driving  Mattel's CDS movement was the departure of its CEO amid disappointing holiday  sales and continued declines in quarterly sales.' Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

39,"  COPENHAGEN Feb 25 Denmark's Lego said it expected to keep outperforming rivals after it further narrowed the gap on market leader Mattel last year, aided by strong growth in Asia, a successful movie launch and increased sales of toys targeted at girls.Lego, owned by the family of company founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen, sees its growth moderately ahead of the global toy market in 2015, driven by innovation and global expansion.Lego's revenues grew 13 percent to 28.6 billion Danish crowns ($4.4 billion) while U.S. Barbie-maker Mattel's sales fell 7 percent to $6.0 billion, shrinking the gap between the world's two largest toy makers. Hasbro, also a U.S. company, increased sales by 4.8 percent to $4.3 billion in 2014. ""The Asia toy markets experienced the strongest regional growth, with both more established markets such as Japan and South Korea and emerging markets such as China experiencing year over year increases,"" Lego said. It said sales grew by more than 10 percent in the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China, with 'healthy' single figure growth in central and northern European markets.Lego's net profit rose 15 percent to 7.0 billion crowns in 2014.

Banking shares rallied following the Federal Reserve's annual check-up on the industry's health. The S&P financial sector rose 2.2 percent and was the day's biggest gainer. A weak outlook from Intel, however, limited gains in the tech sector.Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February, which helped the euro rebound from a 12-year low versus the dollar. Recent weakness in stocks has largely been driven by Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs data, which underscored views the Fed could raise rates as early as June.""To me, it shows maybe that moving the rate increase closer has potential fallout with regard to the ever-stronger U.S. dollar, and that's a headwind for growth and a headwind for earnings for a lot of companies that do business outside the U.S.,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 259.83 points, or 1.47 percent, to 17,895.22, while the S&P 500 gained 25.71 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,065.95. The day's percentage gains were the biggest for both the Dow and S&P 500 in about a month.The Nasdaq Composite added 43.35 points, or 0.89 percent, to 4,893.29.The rally represented just a partial rebound after a recent bout of weakness, which has left the S&P 500 down 2.4 percent from its March 2 record closing high. Citigroup passed in the Fed review, allowing it to raise dividends and sending shares up 3.3 percent to $54.08. Bank of America was told to get a better grip on internal controls and its data models; shares slipped 0.1 percent to $16.09.Intel Corp slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain.  Shares of the Dow component fell 4.7 percent to $30.80 and limited the Nasdaq's advance.Shares of Walt Disney Co rose 4.2 percent to $107.17 and were the biggest percentage gainer in the Dow after it said it has started work on a sequel to ""Frozen,"" the best-selling animated movie of all time. Shares of Mattel gained 4.2 percent to $25.65.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,241 to 823, for a 2.72-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,982 issues rose and 765 fell, a 2.59-to-1 ratio.The S&P 500 index posted 22 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 136 new highs and 73 new lows.About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

44,"   By Jilian Mincer | NEW YORK, April 8  NEW YORK, April 8 Striding confidently through Matty's Toy Stop in Manhasset, New York, Catie Tepedino, 7, is the sort of consumer who may hold the fate of the U.S. toy business in her own little fists.Finding that her top toy choice, Shopkins - tiny grocery store characters made by Australia's privately-held Moose Enterprise - was sold out, Catie went directly to the Barbie row and picked out one of Mattel Inc.'s iconic dolls. Next stop: the arts and crafts section, where she selected an Alex Brands jewelry-making set.""I know the aisles here,"" the petite brunette confided as she navigated the store along with her mother, Victoria. And knows what she wants as well: the Tepedinos spent perhaps five minutes shopping, not counting the time spent answering a reporter's questions.Catie's preferences are a good indication of the state of the toy business. Though Mattel, Hasbro and Lego control about 40 percent of the U.S. toy market, there's a growing niche for smaller companies such as Alex Brands that sell educational or environmentally friendly toys to delay the seemingly inevitable demand for electronic devices.That, in turn, has attracted investments from private equity companies including Propel Equity Partners of Greenwich, Connecticut, which since 2012 has been building a toy empire off of retro and ""green"" brands, buying at least 10 companies to date and bringing them together under the name Alex Brands. Other PE firms active in the sector include Winona Capital, the Friend Group and Topspin Partners.Propel's Alex Brands portfolio includes well-known older toy names, including Slinky and Shrinky Dinks, as well as newcomers such as Citiblocs, which makes wooden construction toys. Both categories represent a trend among parents nostalgic for their own toys and keen on environmentally-conscious products, and have helped weaken the grip of mainstream manufacturers such as Mattel and Hasbro. More toy company deals are expected in 2015, according to Reuters interviews with private equity firms. Targets may include Dallas-based KidKraft, which makes wooden toys and furniture, industry experts said.""There are times kids do other things"" besides play with electronic devices, Alex Brands CEO Neil Friedman, 67, told Reuters. ""We have things for them to do that make them creative and active."" Friedman joined Alex in October as CEO after holding senior roles at Toys R Us and Mattel.Alex Brands, which reached a licensing deal in February with kids cable channel Nickelodeon, wouldn't discuss its sales numbers or future plans. But it's opened a new headquarters in Fairfield, New Jersey, and a new distribution center in Woodbridge. The goal for many of these smaller toy companies is to get large enough - around $200 million in sales - to be bought by the bigger brands or create their own publicly traded corporation.Propel partners Michael C. Cornell and John M. Belniak appear to be employing the same playbook they used as executives at Jarden Corp, which has acquired many well-known consumer brands with growth potential including Coleman, Yankee Candle and Mr. Coffee. Jarden shares have risen almost 260 percent in the last five years. Both partners declined to be interviewed.NOT ALL CHILDS PLAY Toy brands large and small must still contend with a volatile selling season that relies heavily on gift-buying around Christmas. Consumers are fickle, imitation is easy and electronic devices are taking center-stage in children's free time. While worldwide toy sales are growing with the rise of middle class consumers in China and elsewhere, U.S. sales are expected to increase only slightly to $23.9 billion in 2018 from $22.6 billion in 2014, according to Forrester Research. To meet demand for educational toys, Amazon.com recently launched a separate online sales department for STEM Toys & Games, which encourage math and science skills and include many smaller private brands including Milton Industries, founded in 1946, and Melissa & Doug.""We know customers are interested in these types of toys, so we're making it easy for them to find them,"" said Amazon spokeswoman Lori Richter.Melissa & Doug, which specializes in wooden play-sets and children's arts supplies, sold a majority share to private investment group Berkshire Partners in 2010. It's a popular brand at the Dolphin Bookshop in Port Washington, New York, which has a large selection of Lego and some of the smaller, private toymakers.""We have a lot of people who ask for toys that are not made in China,"" said Debbie Klein, a bookseller at the store.Green Toys makes a variety of toys out of recycled milk cartons and has turned down shelf space at Wal-Mart because that's not the most likely shopping venue for his customers, said co-founder Robert von Goeben. Sales grew about 30 percent in 2014 after it partnered with The Friend Group, a private investment firm that focuses on small to medium-sized companies in the consumer packaged goods industry. Green Toys sell online, at specialty toy stores as well as Pottery Barn and Whole Foods Market.""Millennial parents buy toys like they buy food,"" said von Goeben, 52. ""They want to know what's in it, the country of origin. That's a sea change from day when I bought a toy because it was wacky and fun.""

47,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Mattel Inc said on Friday it has ended production of its SeaWorld Trainer Barbie doll, a move cheered by an animal rights group that has been a leading critic of SeaWorld for its treatment of killer whales.Mattel spokesman Alex Clark said production of the doll ended when a license agreement with SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment expired last year. He did not say why the deal was not renewed.SeaWorld, which operates parks in San Diego, San Antonio, and Orlando, Florida, has seen other business deals, including one with SouthWest Airlines, fall apart since the 2013 CNN documentary ""Blackfish"" presented a critical view of how the company treats killer whales, also called orcas.Stephanie Shaw, corporate affairs specialist for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said the group approached Mattel in 2012 and sought to persuade the California-based company to stop making the doll. ""Barbie has a rich history as an animal rights activist, she's actually been fur-free for her entire history,"" Shaw said. ""We are delighted to see that she can retain her animal friendly image.""SeaWorld Trainer Barbie comes with a toy whale and a toy dolphin, which squirt water, and a tiny fish pool. Barbie is dressed in a pink and blue wet suit.""We are disappointed in Mattel's decision to stop production of the SeaWorld Trainer Barbie,"" SeaWorld said in a statement. The company added that it was particularly disappointed that ""the decision appears to be based on complaints from PETA, an extremist organization that works to close zoos and aquariums.""Despite the end of production, the SeaWorld Barbie might still be available through some retailers as they go through their supplies of the special edition doll, Clark said.

48,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | LOS ANGELES, April 24  LOS ANGELES, April 24 Mattel Inc said on Friday it has ended production of its SeaWorld Trainer Barbie doll, a move cheered by an animal rights group that has been a leading critic of SeaWorld for its treatment of killer whales.Mattel spokesman Alex Clark said production of the doll ended when a license agreement with SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment expired last year. He did not say why the deal was not renewed.SeaWorld, which operates parks in San Diego, San Antonio, and Orlando, Florida, has seen other business deals, including one with SouthWest Airlines, fall apart since the 2013 CNN documentary ""Blackfish"" presented a critical view of how the company treats killer whales, also called orcas.Stephanie Shaw, corporate affairs specialist for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said the group approached Mattel in 2012 and sought to persuade the California-based company to stop making the doll. ""Barbie has a rich history as an animal rights activist, she's actually been fur-free for her entire history,"" Shaw said. ""We are delighted to see that she can retain her animal friendly image.""SeaWorld Trainer Barbie comes with a toy whale and a toy dolphin, which squirt water, and a tiny fish pool. Barbie is dressed in a pink and blue wet suit. ""We are disappointed in Mattel's decision to stop production of the SeaWorld Trainer Barbie,"" SeaWorld said in a statement.The company added that it was particularly disappointed that ""the decision appears to be based on complaints from PETA, an extremist organization that works to close zoos and aquariums."" Despite the end of production, the SeaWorld Barbie might still be available through some retailers as they go through their supplies of the special edition doll, Clark said. He could not say how many of the dolls were made but added that Mattel has dozens of special edition Barbies.Opponents of killer whale shows at SeaWorld have filed three lawsuit against the company since March.In the face of negative publicity, SeaWorld has said it would cut jobs in an effort to save $50 million by the end of 2015.

Toymakers including Hasbro and Barbie doll maker Mattel Inc  have seen declining sales of toys for girls as children increasingly opt for gadgets and tablets.Revenue in Hasbro's games category fell 8 percent in the third quarter, due to weak demand for its ""Magic: The Gathering"" and other games.Revenue in the toys for girls category fell 28 percent, the fourth straight quarter of decline, as demand for My Little Pony and Furby toys weakened.Games and toys for girls together account for nearly half of Hasbro's total revenue. Oppenheimer & Co Inc analyst Sean McGowan said the fall in sales of girls' toys was a concern.""If the weakness in girls' toys is the result of competitive shifts, then there isn't much to be done,"" he said. ""Other than heavy promotion or an acquisition, there is not much that Hasbro, or any other toy company, can do to change a product's performance in the short term.""Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said retailers were being more cautious and stocking inventory closer to the holiday shopping season, pushing toymakers' sales into the fourth quarter from the third quarter. Although Hasbro's sales of toys for boys jumped 24 percent, the rise was driven by demand for toys based on the latest films in the ""Star Wars"" and ""Jurassic World"" series. ""Jurassic World"" released in June, while ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is scheduled for launch in December.The company will release new toys under brands such as FurReal Friends in the current quarter as these sell better as holiday items, Chief Executive Brian Goldner said.Hasbro's net revenue was flat at $1.47 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 27, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Oil prices have fallen more than 70 percent since mid-2014.Adding to the cautious note, data on Monday showed that U.S. consumer spending was unchanged in December and manufacturing activity continued to contract in January.""The consumer spending numbers are a concern,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""We keep hearing that there is pent-up consumer demand that we are going to see down the line but we've seen little evidence of that.""Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and is seen as a bright spot in an economy affected by weak export growth and unsold merchandise.The reports follow a weak reading of the GDP, which showed that the U.S. economy expanded at an anemic rate in the fourth quarter.Investors will keep an eye on the monthly employment numbers later this week to gauge the strength of the labor market.
