10,"  * STMicro aims to outperform market in 2014 - CEO* Sees drop in first-quarter revenue* Says orders jumped 20 pct between Q3 and Q4By Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS, Jan 28 European chipmaker STMicroelectronics forecast a return to profit in 2014 after suffering two years of losses, hit by a decline in orders from phone maker Nokia. The Franco-Italian company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, posted a ninth straight quarterly loss but said it expects this year to outperform market growth forecasts, currently around 4.2 percent.It said its performance would be boosted by an improved order book, cost cuts and having exited its loss-making ST-Ericsson joint-venture with telecom network gear maker Ericsson last year.""We are definitely positive on generating a profit in the fiscal year 2014,"" Chief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. Orders jumped 20 percent between the third and fourth quarter of 2013, Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti said.STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm, Intel and Samsung in recent years because of its higher cost base and difficulties suffered by Nokia, once its largest customer. In the past year, it has particularly focused on cars, high-end smartphones and motion sensors but that move has yet to pay off in terms of profit.For the fourth quarter of 2013, the company reported an operating loss of $11 million on revenue of $2.01 billion, broadly in line with analysts' forecasts. That compared with a loss of $730 million on revenue of $2.16 billion in the same period of 2012.It said it expected 2014 first-quarter revenue to fall by about 9.5 percent on a quarterly basis, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, due to its exit from the ST-Ericsson joint-venture.The firm's share price was up 1.8 percent at 5.75 euros at 1400 GMT, while Europe's Stoxx 600 technology index  was flat.STMicroelectronics shares climbed 8.8 percent last year, while Europe's Stoxx 600 technology index rose 27 percent.

11,"  STMicroelectronics NV (STM.PA) posted lower quarterly revenue and a narrow loss on Monday underscoring how the European chipmaker is losing ground to rivals as orders from its key customer Nokia NOK1V.HE shrink.The company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, reported an operating loss of $11 million on fourth-quarter revenue of $2.01 billion. The revenue was lower than the $2.1 billion logged a year ago but largely unchanged from the previous quarter.Analysts had forecast revenues of $2.03 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company had earlier predicted that fourth-quarter sales would be unchanged from the prior three months, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. After a loss-making third quarter, STMicro pushed back a key profit margin target by six months, blaming higher sales of chips for low-end mobile phones that are not as profitable as chips for high-end phones like Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy line.Last year, STMicro and telecom network gear maker Ericsson ended their joint venture to make chips for mobile phones. Since then, STMicro has refocused on product lines for automobiles, video game consoles, and high-end smartphones, but that move has yet to pay off in terms of higher profits. Franco-Italian STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales, but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent years because of its higher cost base and the decline of Nokia.Worldwide semiconductor revenue rose 5.2 percent last year to $315.4 billion from $299.9 billion in 2012, according to market research group Gartner. Intel kept the leading spot by sales, despite lower demand for computers that caused its chip sales to fall 2.2 percent, while Samsung and Qualcomm both notched up growth, according to Gartner. STMicroelectronics shares climbed 8.8 percent last year, while Europe's Stoxx 600 technology index .SX8P rose 27 percent.(This story fixes headline, 1st and 3rd paragraphs because firm did not miss target, and also correct analysts' average forecast to $2.03 billion, from $2.01 billion)(Reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",2014-01-28,QCOM,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 8:42am EST",STMicro's fourth-quarter revenue stagnates,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-stmicro-results-idUSBREA0R0ZK20140128?type=companyNews

18,"  * Q4 royalties revenue $130.4 mln vs forecasts of $137.9 mln* Company sees royalties up about 19 pct in 2014* Licensing beat expectations* Shares fall sharplyBy Paul SandleLONDON, Feb 4 British chip designer ARM Holdings  said a slowdown in demand for Apple and Samsung  smartphones was behind a smaller than expected rise in fourth-quarter royalty revenues.ARM, whose technology is in nearly every smartphone, reported processor royalties of $130.4 million, up 7 percent, but short of analyst forecasts of $137.9 million.The top-end smartphone market has showed signs of reaching saturation, with Apple and Samsung, both ARM customers, last month reporting lower than expected sales of the iPhone 5S and Galaxy S4 phones in the holiday season.But the Cambridge-based company also said there was strong demand for licensing its technology across a whole range of applications from servers to dishwashers, exercise machines and wearable technology such as smart watches. ARM said its royalties continued to grow faster than the broader semiconductor market, but the degree of outperformance was impacted by slower sales of chips for high-end smartphones in the second half of the year.Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said the smartphones, which provide just under half of ARM's royalty revenue, were ""slowing down"" at the very high end, but cheaper devices were selling well.""Overall royalties in 2014 we expect to grow at a similar rate to the last three years, broadly 19-20 percent,"" he said.Royalties make up just over half of ARM's revenues, with licenses accounting for slightly less than half.ARM shares fell to a five-month low after the results, and were down 3.1 percent at 902.5 pence at 1034 GMT. Score said ARM continued to see strong demand for the licensing of its energy-efficient technology for new uses in networking, servers and wearable devices.Processing licensing revenue rose 26 percent to $107.2 million in the fourth quarter, beating market consensus expectations of $94.7 million.""We continue to benefit from the growth of digital electronics ... from smart consumer electronics such as phones, tablets and TVs, to energy efficient enterprise networking and serves to more embedded computing into things like smart sensors and wearable technology,"" he said. 10 BILLION CHIPS Analyst Julian Yates at Investec said: ""Royalties were slightly below expectations due to slower high end smartphone sales."" He said he expected to trim royalty estimates by about 3 percent, having forecast 22 percent year-on-year growth.But the stronger licensing outlook would compensate, he said, resulting in no change to his headline numbers, which were about 5 percent below consensus. He sees 2014 pretax profit of 419.8 million pounds.ARM licenses its designs to partners, such as Qualcomm Inc  and Samsung and receives a small royalty on every chip shipped. Some 10 billion ARM-based chips were shipped in 2013, Score said.The chips in the latest smartphones, such as the first 64-bit processors in the iPhone 5S, carry higher royalty rates than those in simpler phones.Score said, however, mid and low-tier smartphones, where most of the growth will come in the next five years, were  incorporating more and more ARM technology, enabling it to stick to its medium-term forecast of 15-25 percent per year growth in smartphone royalties over the next five years.Overall, ARM posted a 19 percent rise in pretax profit to 95.5 million pounds ($156 million) on revenue up 15 percent at 189.1 million pounds, broadly in line with expectations.The company said it expected to meet analyst forecasts for 2014 revenue, which Score said stood at $1.28 billion.",2014-02-04,QCOM,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 6:40am EST",UPDATE 2-Smartphone slowdown hits ARM's royalties in fourth quarter,http://www.reuters.com//article/arm-results-idUSL5N0L90VZ20140204?type=companyNews
19,"  By Paul SandleLONDON Feb 5 British microchip maker Wolfson Microelectronics swung to an underlying loss in the final quarter of 2013 after it struggled against Qualcomm's  dominance in 4G mobile phone technology.The Edinburgh-based company that specialises in audio technology is a supplier for the 3G version of Samsung's  Galaxy S4 smartphone but its chips were not in the 4G model of the top-selling handset. Chief Executive Mike Hickey said the company paid the price for a ""faster than anticipated transition from 3G to 4G smartphones that benefited a competitor"".He acknowledged that Qualcomm is the dominant provider of processing technology for first-generation 4G phones, but expects Wolfson to catch up as more platforms compatible with its chip technology enter the market. ""There are a lot of other silicon providers, such as Samsung LSI, Broadcom, Intel and Nvidia, all bringing to market alternative LTE (4G) platforms, and we are the natural choice for our customers with those platforms,"" Hickey said.Wolfson posted an underlying operating loss of $4.5 million for the final quarter of 2013, against a profit of $1.5 million for the same period a year earlier, on revenue that dipped to $42 million from $56.1 million. Hickey said he expects the company to resume its growth trajectory in the second half of 2014 as customers, including Chinese smartphone makers, launch new products using Wolfson's technology and as new LTE platforms come to market.Shares in Wolfson fell to a two-year low of 109 pence after the results, which analysts said were slightly worse than expected. They were trading down 9 percent at 120 pence by 1147 GMT.The outlook for first-quarter revenue of between $28 million and $36 million was also below consensus, which stood at $36.8 million, Citi analysts said.",2014-02-05,QCOM,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 6:51am EST",UPDATE 1-Chipmaker Wolfson Micro misses out on early 4G demand,http://www.reuters.com//article/wolfson-idUSL5N0LA15Q20140205?type=companyNews
20,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Qualcomm Inc, the world leader in smartphone microchips, may want to shore up its defensive tactics.Taiwan's MediaTek Inc, the leading chip supplier for Chinese smartphones, is barreling into the U.S. market with a new major global branding campaign and setting up shop in San Diego, California, home to Qualcomm.This year, MediaTek plans to hire about 150 engineers, business development and marketing staff in the United States, adding to a 300-strong U.S. workforce, said Kristin Taylor, MediaTek's vice president of U.S. corporate marketing. Outside the United States, the company plans to add 1,000 employees in 2014, increasing its ranks by around 10 percent.""We really feel that it's a strategic area,"" she said of San Diego's Sorrento Valley, where MediaTek plans to open its new office in the next few months. It is home to many technology companies clustered around Qualcomm, one of the city's largest employers.""A lot of our technology partners sit in that area and we want to be able to serve them,"" said Taylor, a former Qualcomm veteran who joined MediaTek last year.MediaTek is relatively unknown outside Asia, where it has grown in the past decade to become the dominant supplier of low-cost cellphone chips, instrumental in helping companies such as China's Xiaomi and South Korea's LG Electronics Inc produce handsets that sell for less than $100 each.MediaTek plans this month to launch a rebranding campaign highlighting its expansion beyond China and into the United States and other developed markets led by Qualcomm.""We need to redefine that we really are at this point serving the entire globe and not just small pockets of the world,"" Taylor said. She declined to give more details ahead of its launch. Lacking relationships with U.S. phone carriers, MediaTek is unlikely to challenge Qualcomm's command of the high-end phone market soon, analysts said. In the mid- and low-tier categories, the Taiwanese company's ability to produce chips very cheaply is giving it an edge over other U.S. players like Broadcom Corp, Nvidia Corp and even Intel Corp, which are all trying to compete with Qualcomm.MediaTek, whose stock market value of $18 billion surpasses Broadcom and Nvidia, far outsells Qualcomm in handsets aimed at Chinese consumers but it supplies processors for less than 3 percent of smartphones sold in the United States, according to Strategy Analytics analyst Sravan Kundojjala.MediaTek believes its future chips will help manufactures make cheap phones that can compete in quality against more expensive devices made with Qualcomm's components.""The opportunity lies in picking up one of the fringe (manufacturers), giving them an excellent platform, great performance and a good price,"" said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. ""Get a couple of those who get traction at a carrier in the U.S. and suddenly you see MediaTek's export share increase a lot.""SEEKING NEW GROWTH  Founded in 1997, MediaTek got its start designing chips for digital televisions and optical devices like DVD players, before turning its attention to cellphones. Last year, it sold over 200 million smartphone chips in Asia and became the world's 14th largest semiconductor company, according to research firm IHS.MediaTek's expansion into the U.S. market comes as it faces more competition in China, where Qualcomm as well as up-and-coming rivals like Shanghai-based chipmaker Spreadtrum are replicating its low-cost model.Analysts on average expect MediaTek's revenue growth to slow to 30 percent in 2014, from 36 percent in 2013. While that far outpaces Qualcomm's forecast 8 percent revenue growth, JPMorgan has warned that MediaTek could be hurt by the slower rollout of next-generation wireless products in China.With a strategy that centers on offering manufacturers turnkey blueprints for quickly making inexpensive phones, MediaTek's sights are set on mid-range smarpthones from the likes of Lenovo or Huawei, rather than premium devices from Apple Inc or Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Some analysts expect mid-range phones to gain popularity in the U.S. market, where a price war between carriers is expected to intensify this year.MediaTek's move into mid-priced devices in China and around the world, along with efficient cost controls, may push its 2013 operating margin of 18 percent up another 4 percentage points over the next two years, said Evercore's Wang.Like competitors, MediaTek is rushing to roll out wireless chips featuring Long-Term Evolution, an advanced technology for faster data transfer. LTE has become standard in U.S. phones and it is slowly being introduced in other parts of the world.So far, that technology is dominated by Qualcomm as rivals have run into delays launching their own LTE chips due to the technology's complexity. That has left handset manufacturers craving an alternative.""Qualcomm owns 90-plus percent of the LTE modem market. That's not a comfortable place for many of these OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),"" said IDC analyst Les Santiago. ""That alone will create an opportunity for a second-place LTE player. The issue is - who will that be?""For its part, Qualcomm said rivals have underestimated the challenge of making LTE chips that work well on different carriers' networks. The company has made four generations of LTE products, a much longer track record than MediaTek and others.""We'll see what happens when the products show up,"" Qualcomm Senior Marketing Director Peter Carson said of rivals' plans for LTE. ""We know the industry continues to underestimate the increasing complexity of the LTE roadmap. We believe we have a performance advantage.""(Editing by Tiffany Wu, Edwin Chan and Bernard Orr)",2014-02-07,QCOM,"Fri Feb 7, 2014 | 3:08pm EST",Analysis: Taiwan's MediaTek sets up backyard brawl with Qualcomm,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mobile-us-mediatek-idUSBREA161RL20140207?type=companyNews

24,"   By Michael Martina and Benjamin Kang Lim | BEIJING, March 3  BEIJING, March 3 China will present proposals to revamp its behemoth economic planning agency at an annual session of parliament this week, sources said, but the organisation's role as an antitrust regulator could eventually be enhanced.Chinese and foreign companies, including U.S. technology firms Qualcomm Inc. and InterDigital Inc., have fallen afoul of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in recent months as its anti-monopoly arm has become more assertive.The mammoth agency, which has several thousand employees and has sweeping powers to decide on investment, prices and other issues in the world's second-biggest economy, is striving to retain as much power as possible as it undergoes restructuring. The crackdown on price-fixing and monopolistic practices should become more pronounced as the NDRC has said it is ramping up staffing in its antitrust division.Academics and senior officials have forecast a streamlining of the NDRC since President Xi Jinping vowed to make the economy more responsive to market forces and shift to consumer-focused investment from a state-led model.Two sources close to senior leaders said proposals have been readied to restructure the NDRC and these will be discussed at the National People's Congress annual session beginning on Wednesday.It was not immediately clear if any decisions would be taken.But the NDRC's role as one of three national antitrust regulators - along with the Commerce Ministry and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce - is set in the country's five-year-old Anti-Monopoly Law that is unlikely to be cut back or revised soon.""The NDRC is getting ready for a new role. This corresponds with the flurry of antitrust actions,"" said a Beijing-based foreign diplomat who asked not to be named.Xu Kunlin, the head of the NDRC's price supervision and anti-monopoly bureau, has hinted at more unified antitrust powers, underlining speculation that the agency is seeking for primacy among the three regulators.""Having a relatively independent, authoritative or strong and unified antitrust body is a trend. Many antitrust structures around the world are under one roof,"" Xu said last month. Xu's comments could be part of the NDRC's attempt to focus on the antitrust role, and stay relevant as its broader powers are slashed, said Yee Wah Chin, a New York-based antitrust expert at law firm Ingram, Yuzek, Gainen, Carroll and Bertolotti.""The NDRC will continue to expand its AML (anti-monopoly law) enforcement scope by the investigations it conducts, and it is entirely possible that some formal restructuring of AML enforcement will be made after several more years,"" Chin said.FINES, INVESTIGATIONS Last year, the NDRC slapped Chinese and foreign companies with investigations and fines after high-profile pricing probes. In August, the regulator fined six infant formula manufacturers, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, Danone  and Fonterra, a record $110 million after a probe into price fixing and anti-competitive practices. The agency confirmed last month it had opened anti-monopoly investigations into Qualcomm and InterDigital, saying it had received complaints that the companies charged discriminatory high prices in China.Adam Dunnett, secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said he expects the pricing investigations to maintain their momentum in the medium term.""The European Chamber has encouraged its members to review their own practices and closely monitor further developments,"" he said, adding that the anti-monopoly law would play an important role in a more market-oriented China if evenly enforced.At the moment, the NDRC sets policy for strategic industries, approves big investments and has the authority to influence prices for everything from liquor to gasoline. Its powers are so sweeping that it is often called the mini cabinet.Beijing has promised to reduce its involvement in matters like the approval of new industrial projects, allowing it instead to focus on improving rules and regulations. According to one proposal, the agency would be renamed the National Development, Reform and Planning Commission and fold in functions of other departments, including the Development Research Centre, a cabinet think-tank.""Eventually, the NDRC will just be a think-tank. Its main functions will be to formulate (policies) and conduct research on macro (economic) planning,"" one source with ties to the leadership said on condition of anonymity.""The views of various ministries and provincial governments have been solicited,"" a second source said.The party announced after a conclave last November that a high-powered committee would be created to oversee the gamut of China's reforms, including coordination between ministries. President Xi heads the group which experts have said could signal changes to the NDRC's discretionary powers.""I do expect the NDRC's wings to get clipped,"" said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University.""The creation of the leading group on economic reform is already a big signal that the NDRC's powers will be cut,"" he said.The NDRC did not respond to Reuters questions sent by fax.However, a rapid transition is unlikely within such a huge bureaucracy.""The government has been cutting red tape but we cannot see any signs of downsizing,"" an NDRC researcher told Reuters on condition of anonymity, noting that there would be stiff federal-level employees.""The NDRC will still approve investment plans involving state spending. It will still be responsible for coordinating economic policies,"" the researcher said.",2014-03-02,QCOM,"Sun Mar 2, 2014 | 4:00pm EST",China's state planning body grows more assertive as revamp looms,http://www.reuters.com//article/china-parliament-ndrc-idUSL3N0LJ32D20140302?type=companyNews

""We're working on technologies that emulate how the brain processes information.

But Mollenkopf, who joined Qualcomm in 1994 as an engineer and was named chief operating officer in 2011, also faces an antitrust investigation in China that may affect future licensing revenue from smartphones made there.China's country's competition regulator said in February it suspected Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position. While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from chips that allow phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its CDMA cellphone technology - a component in new fourth-generation mobile phones.Also on Tuesday, Qualcomm raised its dividend by 20 percent and upped its share repurchase authorization by $5 billion to $7.8 billion.Shares of Qualcomm rose 3.74 percent to $76.38 following after the company announced its dividend increase.(Corrects surname of former CEO to Jacobs, not James)(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-03-04,QCOM,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 3:48pm EST",Qualcomm's new CEO says smartphone innovation still strong,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-qualcomm-ceo-idUSBREA2323320140304?type=companyNews

30,"   By Matthew Miller | BEIJING, March 10  BEIJING, March 10 TCL Corp expects group revenues to surpass 100 billion yuan ($16.32 billion) this year for the first time as the Chinese electronics giant increasingly turns to Europe, Latin America and the United States to sell more smartphones and televisions.TCL expects to see sustained revenue growth at its handset company, now the world's fifth-biggest, while profits at its television unit are expected rebound, company chief executive Thomson Li Dongheng told Reuters.Li also called on Qualcomm Inc., the U.S. chipset maker, to lower the fees it charges Chinese companies.TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings, TCL's Hong Kong-listed television unit, posted losses of HK$119 million ($15.33 million)last year even as revenue increased 9.6 percent to HK$39.5 billion, as overstocking of raw materials and supplier mishaps raised sales costs.""We have to be more competitive and speed up the transformation of the television business,"" Li said in an interview on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary session in Beijing. Li said revenue for the TV set business should increase about 10 percent this year.TCL is targeting international markets, which now account for 42 percent of total sales, as cheaper technology makes Chinese-made electronic goods affordable in both emerging and developed markets. The percentage of global sales is expected to increase, Li said.TCL reported group revenue last year reached 85.32 billion yuan, an increase of 22.9 percent, while net profit jumped to 2.88 billion yuan. TCL Communication Technology Holdings, the group's Hong Kong-listed handset maker, makes more than 90 percent of its revenue offshore, primarily in the Americas and Europe.Last year, TCL purchased the rights to rename Grauman's Chinese Theater, along Hollywood's Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, the TCL Chinese Theatre..Handset sales in 2013 reached 55.2 million units, including 17.6 million smartphones, and have been a main driver for the company since last July. TCL Communications, which sells under the Alcatel brand overseas, also competes against Huawei Technologies Co, ZTE Corp and Lenovo Group . TCL's mobile phone sales should increase by 50 percent this year, Li said. Profitability remains an issue, particularly as increased competition forces handset makers to lower prices.""We remain concerned about how the company can cope with mounting smartphone margin pressure in both emerging and matured markets,"" wrote Andrew Hsu, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd in a research note last month.""Chinese companies are becoming more competitive. There are five Chinese brands in the world's top ten, but our profitability is poor compared with Samsung or Apple,"" Li said. ""Chinese firms do better against brands like LG, Nokia and Motorola.""The TCL chief also said he supported efforts by China's anti-monopoly regulator to help lower the license fees on chipsets paid to Qualcomm Inc. ""Qualcomm's patent fees, frankly speaking, are relatively high,"" said Li. ""Our profits last year were only a little more than 1 percent. It's clear this standard isn't reasonable.""TCL on average paid royalty fees amounting to 5 percent of sales for chipsets used in its 3G and 4G handsets.China's National Development and Reform Commission, which in November started investigating Qualcomm's rates, said in February that the San Diego-based firm was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position.Li said a more suitable level for all mobile royalties would be 3 percent.",2014-03-10,QCOM,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 4:22am EDT","TCL's Li doubles down on global markets, nudges Qualcomm on fees",http://www.reuters.com//article/chi-tcl-idUSL3N0M725N20140310?type=companyNews

32,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Qualcomm gave details on Monday about a future high-end smartphone chip, including faster download speeds as well as 64-bit technology, which is quickly becoming standard.Due to appear in smartphones in 2015, the Snapdragon 810 is Qualcomm's latest bid to use its edge in wireless technology to maintain its marketshare lead in semiconductors for mobile devices.The 810 chip includes new, faster WiFi features as well as a 4G modem that Qualcomm says downloads data at twice the speed of chips made with its previous technology.The chip also allows for video recording and playback at ""4K"" ultra-high resolution.Following Apple's launch last year of its first iPhone made with a 64-bit processor, Qualcomm and other chipmakers have been rushing to roll out their own 64-bit technology, which reduces the gap between low-power mobile processors and punchier chips used in laptops, desktop PCs and servers. Qualcomm is announcing its newest chip before the preceding chip in its high-end lineup, the 805, has even begun to appear in smartphones.

33,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO, April 7  SAN FRANCISCO, April 7 Qualcomm gave details on Monday about a future high-end smartphone chip, including faster download speeds as well as 64-bit technology, which is quickly becoming standard.Due to appear in smartphones in 2015, the Snapdragon 810 is Qualcomm's latest bid to use its edge in wireless technology to maintain its marketshare lead in semiconductors for mobile devices.The 810 chip includes new, faster WiFi features as well as a 4G modem that Qualcomm says downloads data at twice the speed of chips made with its previous technology.The chip also allows for video recording and playback at ""4K""  ultra-high resolution.Following Apple's launch last year of its first iPhone made with a 64-bit processor, Qualcomm and other chipmakers have been rushing to roll out their own 64-bit technology, which reduces the gap between low-power mobile processors and punchier chips used in laptops, desktop PCs and servers. Qualcomm is announcing its newest chip before the preceding chip in its high-end lineup, the 805, has even begun to appear in smartphones.

He also said Qualcomm deserves a new trial if an appeals court disagrees. ""While the court is loath to overturn the jury's verdict, on this record, it is the court's only choice,"" Dalton wrote. He also rejected Qualcomm's request to rule the patents invalid.ParkerVision Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Parker said in a statement that he was ""obviously disappointed"" by the outcome, and that the Jacksonville-based company would appeal.""We are very pleased,"" Alex Rogers, head of litigation at San Diego-based Qualcomm, said in a statement. ""Qualcomm simply does not use the techniques claimed in ParkerVision's patents."" In court papers, ParkerVision had charged that Qualcomm in 2006 began infringing its patents for radio signal converion technology, incorporating it in products sold for use in mobile devices such as smartphones.ParkerVision claimed it had sought without success to license the technology to Qualcomm in the late 1990s, only to learn more than a decade later that the rival chipmaker had begun using it. The $173 million award had been seen as a disappointment for ParkerVision, which had sought more than twice as much.Jurors also rejected ParkerVision's argument that Qualcomm's alleged infringement was willful, which could have resulted in triple damages.ParkerVision also has a separate lawsuit against Qualcomm and HTC Corp over other patents that relate to radio frequency transmitters.In afternoon trading on the Nasdaq, ParkerVision shares were down $2.92, or 58.3 percent, at $2.09, after earlier falling to $1.21.

61,"  BEIJING Xiaomi launched its flagship Mi 4 smartphone at a glitzy event in Beijing, where the Chinese budget handset maker's chief executive sought to challenge larger U.S. rival Apple Inc.The Mi 4 comes as budget handset makers in China are competing more aggressively on price and generous features, with even high-end manufacturers feeling the pressure.South Korea's Samsung Electronics Ltd said this month that its disappointing smartphone shipments were due to poor sales in China, which had 1.27 billion mobile subscribers in June.Dressed in a black T-shirt and blue jeans, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun took aim repeatedly at iPhone maker Apple during the presentation on Tuesday, comparing the design and manufacturing process of his new 4G handset to the U.S. firm's more expensive offerings. ""Our product really is better than the iPhone,"" said Lei. ""Our white version is also better than their white version,"" he joked. ""Even our white color is whiter!"" Apple, which was due to announce second-quarter earnings later on Tuesday, was not immediately available to comment. The forthright Jun spent nearly an hour on stage describing the Mi 4 phone's construction - particularly its beveled metal rim whose similarity with Apple's phones drew murmurs of ""iPhone"" from the journalists at the event.The Mi 4, which goes on sale July 29 for 1999 yuan ($320), has a 5 inch, 1080p screen and a Qualcomm Inc Snapdragon 801 2.5 Ghz processor. An equivalent iPhone 5s costs $650.Analyst Neil Shah at technology consultant Counterpoint said that while Xiaomi was gaining swiftly in emerging markets, it did not pose a real threat to Apple just yet. ""Right now it's more a big talk rather than real threat to Apple,"" said Shah.""In emerging markets they are growing in leap and bounds, attracting buyers who aspire to Apple but they can't afford to buy Apple. ""But if tomorrow Xiaomi raise their price to Apple levels, they won't sell. They're trying to build that brand equity by comparing themselves to Apple."" Founded in 2010 by Lei and seven others, Xiaomi seeks to cut costs by eschewing brick-and-mortar stores in favor of web-based distribution and word-of-mouth marketing.Xiaomi became the world's sixth-largest smartphone vendor in the first quarter of 2014, according to data firm Canalys, after repeatedly doubling its sales. The company was valued at $10 billion last year, drawing industry speculation that the fast-rising company could threaten Apple and Samsung, which dominate the premium market.Xiaomi sold 18.7 million smartphones in 2013 and on Tuesday maintained a 60 million sales target for 2014.

62,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Qualcomm Inc's outlook for the September quarter was below Wall Street's expectations and its shares fell on Wednesday after the leading mobile chipmaker said it was having trouble collecting royalties in China.A new high-speed 4G network in China is driving fresh demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm has also faced legal and regulatory problems there, including an ongoing investigation by the country's antitrust regulator. Now Qualcomm is struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including a growing number of local manufacturers the U.S. chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past.""There was some impact in the quarter that we just reported in Q3 and we expect the impact will be larger in the next quarter and potentially for a number of quarters until we can get these things resolved,"" Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in an interview.While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology. Qualcomm has had royalty disputes in the past in China and the recent proliferation of local companies making low-cost gadgets for Chinese consumers is complicating the picture. “There's a lot of new guys ramping up new 4G phones and tablets over there,"" said Evercore analyst Mark McKechnie. ""They have a lot of licensees there already that are paying them, but this is going to be a pretty big challenge for the company in the coming years.” With smartphone shipments tapering off in wealthy markets like the United States, China has become a key market for Qualcomm.  The ongoing investigation by China's anti-monopoly regulator could lead to fines of more than $1 billion. It concerns Qualcomm's licensing business as well as interactions between its licensing business and its chipset business, Aberle later told analysts on a conference call. The investigation is making it harder to negotiate new 4G licenses with manufacturers in China, he said.The chipmaker reported third-quarter revenue of $6.81 billion, up 9 percent from the year-ago period. It said revenue in the fourth quarter, which ends in September, would be between $6.5 billion and $7.4 billion, with a midpoint of about $6.95 billion.  Analysts on average had expected third-quarter revenue of $6.52 billion and fourth-quarter revenue of $7.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Third-quarter net income was $2.24 billion, up 42 percent.

69,"   By Paul Carsten and Michael Martina | BEIJING  BEIJING China's antitrust regulator has confirmed that Qualcomm Inc, one of the world's biggest mobile chipmakers, has a monopoly, the state-run Securities Times newspaper reported on Thursday, as Qualcomm's chief executive held talks in China.  The regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary after it said in February the U.S. chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.The Securities Times report, based on unidentified sources it said were close to the NDRC, did not say whether the regulator had determined that Qualcomm had abused its monopoly.Angela Zhang, an antitrust expert at King's College London, said the report was a ""loose expression that the NDRC has gathered facts that Qualcomm has abused its dominant position.""""It seems likely that the decision will be announced soon,"" she said, noting that having a monopoly alone is not a violation of China's anti-monopoly law.Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf, who launched a $150 million ""strategic venture fund"" in China on Thursday, declined to take questions from reporters. A spokeswoman travelling with Mollenkopf also declined to comment on the newspaper report.    The NDRC declined to provide immediate comment.China is a key market for Qualcomm, accounting for nearly half of its revenue. The country is the world's biggest market for smartphones and is preparing to roll out faster 4G mobile networks this year.While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology. The Securities Times report said the NDRC was probing Qualcomm's local sales data and that Qualcomm's Aberle has been communicating with the NDRC over issues relating to the anti-monopoly investigation.    Analysts say that the process of confirming sales data is common in the late stage of an anti-trust investigation, and that the NDRC is likely calculating the extent of fines.Qualcomm President David Aberle, speaking as the company reported a lower-than-expected outlook for the September quarter on Wednesday, said ""some loss would be probable"" from the probe.""We are really not in a position to be able to estimate what that might look like, we just believe whatever the resolution may be, will likely include some form of payment,"" he added. Aberle said the investigation concerns Qualcomm's licensing business as well as interactions between its licensing business and its chipset business, and that the probe was making it harder to negotiate new 4G licenses with manufacturers in China. Qualcomm was also struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including a growing number of local manufacturers it has done little or no business with in the past, Aberle added. Some Chinese customers of San Diego-based Qualcomm, such as electronics giant TCL Corp, complain the firm is using its dominant market position to charge high patent fees on its chipsets. Industry experts, however, say the NDRC, which is also the government's main economic planning body, is trying to lower domestic costs as China rolls out the 4G mobile networks. TECHNOLOGY AND PATENTS The Securities Times said Qualcomm was charging lower royalties for patents to undercut competitors who have similar technology and maintain market share. The report also said that Qualcomm, as the only provider of chips for high-end phones, can dictate those fees.During the launch of the China fund, Qualcomm CEO Mollenkopf defended the company's licensing programme, saying the $30 billion spent in research and development over the company's lifetime had allowed it to spread its technology in China. ""It's really why anybody that signs up on a license, actually does it voluntarily – because it is a way of leveraging all of that R and D,"" Mollenkopf said.Under China's six-year-old anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company's revenues for the previous year. Qualcomm earned $12.3 billion in China for its fiscal year ended September 29, or nearly half of its global sales.  Qualcomm has previously said it is cooperating with the investigation.

""We are investigating this report and will continue to bid for and win government projects in China.""Shares of Symantec closed up 1.7 percent at $23.56 on the Nasdaq on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.72 percent. The People's Daily also tweeted that it had approved the use of five Chinese anti-virus software vendors: Qihoo 360 Technology Co, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin and Rising.FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said he sees the development becoming a more contentious issue over the coming months.""It's another headwind for the company as Symantec already faces numerous challenges to show growth again. China remains a headache situation for Symantec as well as other U.S. tech providers across the board."" Ives said. Symantec said last month it was in talks with Chinese authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software.Sunday's report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology amid concerns about U.S. spying and the indictment of five Chinese military officers on cyber espionage charges.Still, Eric Johnson, dean of the business school at Vanderbilt University and an expert on cyber security issues, said the Chinese government's move is only a ""symbolic one"" and will have ""little meaningful impact"" on Symantec.Chinese technology corporations like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp have grown into sophisticated global conglomerates in past years, and some analysts speculate that Beijing is promoting its local industry standard-bearers on its own home turf at the expense of U.S. corporations.Chinese state media have lashed out at Google Inc, Apple Inc and other U.S. technology companies, calling on Beijing ""to punish severely the pawns"" of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets.U.S. tech companies such as Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc have recently faced anti-trust investigations, while IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  have reported declining sales in China.

Unlike earlier smartwatches, Timex's watch has its own cellular connection to AT&T's network, letting it transmit data without having to be connected to a smartphone. The device, due out later this year, is made with a chipset from Qualcomm as well as Qualcomm's Mirasol low-power display technology, which can easily be viewed in direct sunlight. Last year, Qualcomm launched its own Toq smartwatch to showcase Mirasol, which in the past has faced production problems and has not caught on widely among device makers.

79,"   By Ben Blanchard and Matthew Miller | BEIJING  BEIJING Qualcomm Inc, under investigation for possible monopolistic practices in China, said it had no direct financial links with an antitrust expert sacked from a government advisory post after state media reported he had received payments from the firm. The San Diego-based company has been under investigation since November by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), one of China's three antitrust regulators, over how the company licenses its patents and prices its chipsets. Qualcomm is among an array of foreign firms that have been scrutinized by the government as China intensifies efforts to bring companies into compliance with its 2008 anti-monopoly law. At stake are financial penalties equivalent to as much as 10 percent of a company's annual revenue.  As part of the NDRC probe, Qualcomm hired Global Economics Group to produce an economic analysis for submission to the regulator, Christine Trimble, a spokeswoman at the chipset maker, told Reuters on Thursday. She said the Chicago-based consultancy employed Zhang Xinzhu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and one of China's leading antitrust experts, to co-write the report. Zhang was dismissed from the State Council's expert commission on competition issues for taking ""huge rewards"" from Qualcomm, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday.""Qualcomm paid Global Economics its standard rates for the firm's services,"" Trimble said, and did not have ""any financial dealings"" with Zhang directly. David Evans, chairman of Global Economics Group, declined to comment. The Qualcomm analysis was submitted to the NDRC in May and had three principal authors, including Zhang. Earlier, the 40-year-old professor also provided expert analysis for several domestic conglomerates including China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unionpay, as well as foreign firms involved in antitrust investigations such as Yum! Brands Inc.""Hiring economists to provide such economic analysis to antitrust authorities is routine practice in government investigations in China and around the world,"" Trimble said.The NDRC said in February that the chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.  Under the six-year-old anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company's revenues for the previous year. ONLY SILENCE Zhang had ""contravened work discipline"" and been removed from his position on the anti-monopoly committee, reported Xinhua.

""Against this backdrop, hiring relevant 'experts' from government departments to 'speak on behalf of foreign companies' is a violation of discipline ...

Zhang also has been critical of the NDRC in numerous articles published in Chinese media in recent years, which may have put him at odds with individuals at the regulator, said a Beijing-based industry person who is familiar with the workings of the advisory group.Zhang argued that at times the regulator had acted outside of its jurisdiction and misused antitrust principles.""Any enforcement should be based on the law and facts and not rely on public sentiment for judgment,"" Zhang wrote in a 2012 commentary published on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology news website.

81,"   By Michael Martina and Se Young Lee | BEIJING/SEOUL  BEIJING/SEOUL Chinese antitrust officials have met with their South Korean counterparts to discuss violations by U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), sources said, as Beijing reaches out to regulators overseas to complete a case that could result in record fines at home.Qualcomm is one of at least thirty foreign firms to come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law - efforts some critics say have unfairly targeted overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns.The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined San Diego-based Qualcomm more than $200 million in 2009 for abusing its dominant market position, but the stakes are bigger in China, where an investigation by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) could trigger changes to Qualcomm's licensing deals and fines of as much as a tenth of a company's annual revenue. Qualcomm had total revenue of almost $25 billion in the year to Sept. 29, 2013, about half of it in China. ""The Chinese authorities were very interested in how South Korea handled such issues and asked a lot of questions about South Korea's experiences,"" said a person who was present at meetings in May and June between the KFTC and the NDRC's price supervision and anti-monopoly bureau.  It's unlikely the NDRC could use exactly the same rationale as South Korea against Qualcomm, added the person, who didn't want to be named because of the sensitivity of the case. ""What China takes most exception to is that royalties on intellectual properties are comparatively higher in China. But high price itself shouldn't be an antitrust matter. It's only a problem when there are elements like discriminatory practices,"" the person said.Qualcomm has been under investigation by the NDRC, one of China's three antitrust regulators, since November last year over how it licenses its patents and prices its chipsets.  Exchanges between regulators are not uncommon, but some experts say the NDRC has relied on pressure tactics instead of detailed economic analysis to drive its cases. That the NDRC went to the KFTC months after the case was announced, they say, could indicate the bureau is looking for a legal justification for a case it had already launched.There are concerns that a central aim of the meetings between China and South Korea was to ""solicit advice in an economic argument against Qualcomm,"" a person in the U.S. business community familiar with the case said. ""It's putting the cart before the horse. They have reached a conclusion and attempted to get the facts later,"" the person said.""THOROUGH EXCHANGES"" In a statement about the meeting that took place in South Korea, the KFTC said: ""China's NDRC, seeking to advance its regulatory enforcement, requested that the Fair Trade Commission share economic analysis techniques used to deal with actual cases."" A KFTC official declined to comment further on the meetings when contacted by Reuters. The NDRC antitrust bureau, its delegation led by Director General Xu Kunlin, said in statements issued after the meetings that the two sides held ""thorough exchanges"". The NDRC did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.None of the statements specifically mentioned Qualcomm.Xu, an outspoken advocate of expanding the use of China's anti-monopoly law, has publicly stated that his bureau is hamstrung by under-staffing. That, lawyers say, is one likely element behind the bureau's reputation of employing less rigorous analysis in its investigations.At a conference in May, Xu said that because he had only around 40 staff - compared to hundreds at U.S. and European agencies - he had to rely on tip-offs of violations when pursuing cases. ""If you increased my staff by 100 workers, perhaps then I could actively investigate,"" he said. ""I think everybody would agree they are understaffed – they don't have enough people – and they are very new at this,"" said Peter Wang, an antitrust expert and Shanghai-based partner for law firm Jones Day. ""It's often easy to find theories for possible antitrust problems, but it takes an extensive amount of experience to be in a position to make good decisions about when something is likely to be a real problem and, just as important, when it's not.""Nonetheless, a slew of recent high-profile probes into overseas firms has rekindled concerns that Beijing may be using the investigations to support domestic industry.The NDRC this week fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices in China.  The agency has also said it would punish Audi (NSUG.DE) and Fiat SpA's FIA.MI Chrysler for monopoly practices, and last year hit foreign milk powder makers with hefty fines. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce in April sent a private letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urging Washington to get tough with Beijing on its use of the Anti-Monopoly Law to pursue ""China's industrial policy goals"".

The sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 21.Co-defendant Derek Cohen, who was also a director in Qualcomm's North America sales department, has pleaded not guilty. Qualcomm is based in San Diego. Federal authorities said Herman and Cohen invested more than $500,000 in Atheros stock and options on Jan. 4, 2011, soon after learning about Qualcomm's plan to buy the company, which was announced officially the following day. News of the $3.2 billion acquisition leaked a few hours after the defendants made their purchases, prompting them to sell their holdings and reap nearly $230,000 of profit, prosecutors said. Herman's share was $29,318, they added. According to a parallel U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint, Herman and Cohen claimed during an internal Qualcomm investigation of possible insider trading  that they learned about the Atheros acquisition from news media.The SEC said this was misleading because the first published news about the acquisition, from The New York Times, did not surface until after Herman and Cohen made their trades. Paul Pfingst, a lawyer for Herman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Michael Pancer, a lawyer for Cohen, did not immediately respond to a similar request.The case is U.S. v.

News of the $3.2 billion acquisition leaked a few hours after the defendants made their purchases, prompting them to sell their holdings and reap nearly $230,000 of profit, prosecutors said. Herman's share was $29,318, they added.According to a parallel U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint, Herman and Cohen claimed during an internal Qualcomm investigation of possible insider trading  that they learned about the Atheros acquisition from news media. The SEC said this was misleading because the first published news about the acquisition, from The New York Times, did not surface until after Herman and Cohen made their trades.Paul Pfingst, a lawyer for Herman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Michael Pancer, a lawyer for Cohen, did not immediately respond to a similar request.The case is U.S. v. Herman, U.S. District Court, Southern District of California, No. 14-cr-01202.

An EU probe would come at an awkward time for Qualcomm, which is seeking to end an investigation by China's pricing regulator into monopoly practices. British cellphone chipmaker Icera, acquired by Nvidia in 2011, took its grievances to the European Commission in June 2010, accusing Qualcomm of anti-competitive behaviour. Details of the complaint were never made public. But another person familiar with the issue said Icera had accused Qualcomm of using patent-related incentives and exclusionary pricing of chipsets to discourage customers from doing business with Icera.  Until now, the issue appeared to have faded from the Commission's agenda. But regulators decided to fast-track the case after Europe's second-highest court in June upheld a record 1.1 billion euro EU fine against U.S. chipmaker Intel for abuse of its dominant market position, according to one of the sources.  It is not unusual for the EU competition authority to take several years to build a case before opening an investigation. ""The Commission may open a case after the summer,"" said the source, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.  The Commission's spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, declined to comment, as did Qualcomm. Companies can be fined as much as 10 percent of their global revenues for breaching EU antitrust rules.

It is not targeting any market player, and of course, it is not targeting any foreign invested or foreign enterprises."" Xu added the investigation of Qualcomm, one of the world's biggest makers of mobile chips, was ""basically done"" and that the NDRC planned to meet the company's president, Derek Aberle, on Friday.Thursday's rare joint press conference, which also included anti-trust heads from the Ministry of Commerce and State Administration for Industry and Commerce, showed the regulators presenting a united front.It comes days after Premier Li Keqiang defended at a global forum a series of probes into overseas companies amid snowballing concern from the foreign business community. In the last two weeks, four leading international business lobbies have raised alarm over the investigations.Their complaints range from worries that foreign companies are being unfairly targeted by probes motivated by China's industrial policy aims, to concerns over the use of strong-arm tactics by Chinese regulators.On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez spoke publicly about reports of China's enforcement of its anti-trust law and its investigation of Qualcomm. ""I am seriously concerned by these reports, which suggest an enforcement policy focused on reducing royalty payments for local implementers as a matter of industrial policy, rather than protecting competition and long-run consumer welfare,"" Ramirez said, without mentioning Qualcomm by name.

They said they didn't make those criticisms and they didn't represent their opinions,"" Xu said.""Our communication with all of the companies we are investigating is extremely free-flowing."" RECORD FINES China's anti-trust enforcers have gone after an array of industries, including foreign automakers and tech firms. Last month, the NDRC fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices. The Qualcomm case could yield record fines of more than $1 billion.Regulators also on Thursday announced their first-ever punishments of foreign carmakers for price-fixing, fining a Chinese venture of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and the China sales unit of Fiat's Chrysler a combined $46 million. Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs declined to comment when asked about Aberle's meeting. ""We have a good business in China and we work very closely with the partners here,"" Jacobs said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum event in China's northern city of Tianjin.Separately, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) defended its investigation of Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest software company. Earlier this month, SAIC gave Microsoft 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite. Director General Ren Airong, of SAIC's Anti-monopoly and Anti-unfair Competition Enforcement Bureau, said that ""many firms"" had reported that Microsoft was suspected of monopoly practices.Ren also said that Microsoft had ""more lawyers"" than any case the regulator has investigated and that the SAIC's ""every move"" was conducted under their view.The regulators said they were focused on domestic firms as well as foreign companies, though critics argue that fines on Chinese companies are typically lower. China took action against white liquor makers Kweichow Moutai Group and Wuliangye Group, imposing more than $70 million in fines collectively.

103,"  TOKYO Sharp Corp said it would begin mass-producing a new type of next-generation displays with Qualcomm unit Pixtronix from 2017, in the hopes that innovation would pay off in the long term as the firm nurses its finances back to health. Qualcomm and Sharp said the new type of panel, called MEMS-IGZO after their respective display technologies, uses less energy and can withstand harsher temperatures than the liquid crystal displays (LCD) used in most smartphones and tablets. ""LCD is really hitting its limits in a lot of things. We can go brighter and this is the first generation of this technology,"" said Greg Heinzinger, senior vice president of Qualcomm's technology licensing division and president of Pixtronix, at a briefing at Sharp's Tokyo office on Friday. Sharp is hoping that innovative display technologies can sustain its recovery from a massive 545.4 billion yen ($5.34 billion) net loss in the year to March 2013, with its dependence on panels for operating profit approaching 50 percent. The MEMS-IGZO panels, which use a high-speed shutter to display images, boast brighter colours than LCD panels as they do not require a color filter, allowing more illumination from the backlight. Sharp said it will market the new technology to automakers, and makers of industrial devices, smartphones and tablets, and aims to start mass-production in 2017. It has built a test line for the technology at its factory in Tottori prefecture on Japan's northern coast.  Before then, Sharp hopes to release curved LCD panels with its 'Free Form Display' technology, unveiled in June, which it showcased on Friday with a car dashboard featuring three illuminated circular dials.

The company is releasing a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. They will support more than 200 telecoms carriers worldwide, with sales launching in Australia on Friday morning and then in the United States and other countries.Like previous iPhones, the iPhone 6 Plus uses a Qualcomm (QCOM.O) 4G LTE modem, according to iFixit.Dissembling the device in a Mac repair shop after lining up overnight to buy a phone, iFixit technicians also discovered a Murata (6981.T) wifi module, a Broadcom (BRCM.O) touchscreen controller, and chips from Skyworks, Avago and TriQuint TQNT.O. News that a supplier has been chosen - or rejected - for one of Apple's products can sometimes cause drastic swings in stock prices. Apple doesn't disclose which companies make the components that go into its smartphones. It also imposes strict rules forbidding its suppliers from discussing Apple-related business with investors and the media.Shares of GT Advanced Technologies Inc GTAT.O, a mineral crystal specialist, slumped 13 percent on Sept 9 after some investors were surprised the US company's scratch-resistent sapphire glass was not being used on the new iPhones.The phones launched on Friday are Apple's first to include NFC radio chips used for the new Apple Pay mobile payment platform. The NFC chip in the iPhone 6 Plus comes from NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O), according to iFixit, in line with most investors' expectations. NXP also supplies a motion co-processor, key to making the iPhone's sensors work without draining its battery, iFixit said.As in other iPhones, Apple has designed its own main processor with technology licensed from ARM Holdings ARM.L and in this device it is the A8 chip. The iPhone 6 Plus opened by iFixit also included a NAND flash memory chip, used for storing music and photos, made by SK Hynix (000660.KS). Apple in the past has depended on multiple companies to supply its memory chips.Raymond James analysts expects sales of iPhone 6 and larger iPhone 6 Plus to top 9 million in the first weekend.As well as Apple's stores, AT&T Inc (T.N), Sprint Corp (S.N), T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Verizon Wireless in the United States will start selling the phones on Friday.

Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals.""We've entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it's started to help the local semiconductor industry,"" said Nomura analyst Leping Huang.The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel's beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company's years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal.The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips.China is the world's largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co, or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan.China's ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance program PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry.For Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world's biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets. Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment.NATIONAL TARGETS The China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China's chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption. Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People's Congress, said in March that China's $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country's entire yearly petroleum imports.In June, the State Council offered the country's most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020.An important part of Beijing's effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq.The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing.As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA.Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan's MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup.TRUE PARTNERS  Since taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker.A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek.Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.

123,"   By Andrew Chung and Dan Levine  Oct 22 For two decades, companies that buy software patents to sue technology giants have been the scourge of Silicon Valley. Reviled as patent trolls, they have attacked everything from Google's online ads to Apple's iPhone features, sometimes winning hundreds of millions of dollars.But now the trolls are in retreat from the tech titans, interviews and data reviewed by Reuters show.In the wake of several changes in U.S. law, which make it easier to challenge software patents, patent prices are plummeting, the number of court fights is down, and stock prices of many patent-holding companies have fallen. Some tech firms say they are punching up research budgets as legal costs shrink, while support for major patent reform is under fire as trolls get trounced.""Their entire business model relies on intimidation, and that has lost its edge,"" said Efrat Kasznik, president of intellectual property consulting firm Foresight Valuation Group. ""If the patents are not enforceable in court anymore... the troll has no legs to stand on.""Brokers who work with the patent acquisition companies acknowledge the new climate.""In some cases, there are just no current buyers for these patents at all,"" said Robert Aronoff, founder of the patent brokerage Pluritas, citing new legal standards for the change.NetApp, a Silicon Valley maker of sophisticated data storage devices, last month used a new legal precedent to force a patent holder to pay its legal fees. The judge called the case ""reckless and wasteful.""The new playing field allows NetApp to spend more on developing its own patents, as opposed to litigation defense. ""It is freeing up dollars,"" said Douglas Luftman, NetApp's chief intellectual property counsel.To be sure, not all litigious patent owning companies are losing ground. Some with court-tested patents are doing well. And not all big tech companies are convinced of the change.Cisco Systems Inc has been at the forefront of the fight against infringement lawsuits and has not seen a drop in new suits in recent months, said General Counsel Mark Chandler.Cisco will continue to push for laws to stop warrantless lawsuits, Chandler said. Others see the need diminishing. THE BIRTH OF TROLLS Big tech companies distinguish between their own intellectual property, which they fiercely protect, and those of their adversaries, which they often dismiss as broadly worded and vague, allowing holders to sue all manner of defendants. The big tech companies note that the patent acquisition companies they label as trolls generally make no products but are solely in the business of buying patents and litigating to enforce them.The putative trolls see a different world. They buy patents from inventors and each other, creating a marketplace that checks big tech companies' sway, and rely ultimately on a fair arbiter: courts. This can provide vital protection for investors' ideas, said Matt Vella, CEO of Acacia Research Corp, which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies. ""I see it as a Robin Hood function,"" he said.If the so-called trolls had a birth date, it would be the summer of 1994, when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time. In the ensuing years, software patents exploded, covering topics from Wi-Fi to one-click shopping. So did patent lawsuits. Last year, more than 6,000 patent suits were filed, according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina. A 2013 White House report said ""trolls"" were responsible for 60 percent of suits, up from 29 percent in 2010.Congress struck the first blow against these high-volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system. Starting in 2012, companies accused of infringement could ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation. The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court.The reviews proved popular -- and devastating for many patent owners. As of June, the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents' claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent, depending on the type of review.Then, in June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea -- not normally eligible for a patent -- does not become patent-worthy if run on a computer. That case, Alice vs. CLS Bank, has made it easier still to quash software patents, and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that.MOUNTING EVIDENCE  New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year, to 329 cases, data from Lex Machina show.Defendants are also fighting longer, driving up costs for the acquisition companies. In 2004, the median time it took for a case that didn't settle was 467 days. By 2013, that had reached 673 days, according to Lex Machina.Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest private patent buyers, laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year. The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally, but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round. Intellectual Ventures declined to comment.A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings, found the average price of a patent was $165,000 in the second quarter of 2014, down from $375,000 in 2012.Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules, however. Marathon Patent Group announced last month that the U.S. government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent. Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid-June.Michael Friedman, managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo, said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, are still in a strong position to seek licenses.But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice, the 2014 Supreme Court case. InterDigital has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp is down over 9 percent. (See graphic: link.reuters.com/rej23w)Just three weeks after Alice was decided, an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing, used to sue over 30 tech firms.Acacia is appealing and said that in general, its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way, since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk.Still, Vella, Acacia's CEO, said, said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy, away from one-patent cases to challenges based on several patents.

Qualcomm could face a fine of more than $1 billion in China as a result of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) investigation, and the company could be forced to make concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging royalties on phones that use its patents.Qualcomm also said it faces a new probe by the European Commission about rebates and other financial incentives in the sale of its chips. Another preliminary investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerns a potential breach of licensing terms, the company said.On Wednesday, Qualcomm's shares slid about 6 percent at $72.50 in extended trading from a $77.20 close on the Nasdaq.“We're continuing to cooperate with the NDRC. We’ve continued to meet with them regularly, exchange some ideas for potential ways to resolve it,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in a telephone interview. “But we don't have an ability to update in terms of expectations and timing.” Qualcomm has also been struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including local manufacturers the U.S. chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past.Any concessions on royalties that Qualcomm is forced to make in China could spread to manufacturers in other countries, some investors said.""What people are most worried about is the ability to fence in this issue to Chinese vendors if there’s a reduced royalty rate, or does it spread to other geographies,"" Standard Life portfolio manager Brian Fox said.

135,"  * Nvidia sued Samsung, Qualcomm for patent infringement in Sept* Samsung says will defend intellectual property rights   (Updates with comments from Samsung, background)SAN FRANCISCO Nov 11 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  has accused Nvidia Corp of infringing several of its chip-related patents and for making false claims about its products, counter-suing after Nvidia filed a suit against the Korean company in September.Samsung Electronics, which filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court on Nov. 4, is seeking damages for deliberate infringement of several technical patents, including a few that govern the way semiconductors buffer and use data. The South Korean firm, the world's largest smartphone maker, also accuses Nvidia of false advertising when it says its ""Shield"" tablet sports the world's fastest mobile processor, the Tegra. Samsung Electronics cites benchmarking studies performed by researchers at Primate Labs as proving that claim false.""We are pursuing necessary legal measures to defend our intellectual property rights and to ensure our continued growth in the IT industry,"" Samsung Electronics said in an emailed statement. Samsung's lawsuit came after Nvidia accused the Asian company and rival Qualcomm Inc of infringing patents on its graphics-processing unit (GPU). Nvidia vies with Qualcomm in the business of providing chips for smartphones and tablets. The U.S. chipmaker said in September that Qualcomm and Samsung had used Nvidia's patented technologies without a license in Samsung's mobile devices, including the just-launched Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge.""We'll review and respond to these new claims against us, and look forward to presenting our case on how Nvidia GPU patents are being used without a license,"" Nvidia said in a statement on Tuesday.Nvidia also pointed to a benchmarking study that supported its claim that the Tegra was the fastest mobile processor on the market.

136,"   By Michael Gold | TAIPEI  TAIPEI Nov 17 Chips from Taiwan's MediaTek Inc  were mostly passed over by the big phone brands a decade ago, with the likes of Nokia and Motorola commanding legions of in-house engineers who could advise on electronics and circuitry.Fast-forward to the age of the smartphone.The market is heaving with Chinese smartphone makers out to grab share from Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd with low-priced handsets. Sparking the boom in budget smartphones is MediaTek, now a $23 billion go-to chip designer favoured by margin-conscious phone makers.MediaTek pioneered bundling low-cost chips with recommendations on hardware such as lenses and speakers. This ""system-on-chip"" approach saves phone makers the cost of finding and testing parts to match the chips they buy. That in turn allows them to cut prices and, in the past year, seize 10 percentage points of market share from leader Samsung.Thanks in large part to system-on-chip, the average price of a smartphone should fall to $267 by 2018 from $314 now, showed data from researcher IDC. That compared with a U.S. starting price of $749 for the latest Apple iPhone 6 Plus.MediaTek says system-on-chip has won it the patronage of every phone brand bar Samsung and Apple. It helped low-priced smartphone maker Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd become the industry's No.3 in just three years, and is tipped for similar success with Google Inc's Android One in India.""You can think about MediaTek as having a franchise business model, like McDonald's,"" Chief Financial Officer David Ku told Reuters. ""McDonald's gives you all the equipment you need, and the initial cost for you is lower."" MediaTek's system-on-chip strategy has helped the company's market value rise 125 percent to T$715.8 billion ($23.39 billion) in less than three years.The strategy involves collaborating with almost 200 Chinese component makers and handset assemblers to supply MediaTek's smartphone customers with parts compatible with its chips.MediaTek built up its supplier network in the feature phone era. At that time, it says, larger rivals sold chips to big phone makers which would employ thousands of engineers to find and test components such as screens for the chips to operate.""They weren't really interested in doing business with MediaTek,"" Ku said of phone makers. To differentiate, MediaTek began recommending hardware for its chips and targeting companies with limited means of sourcing and testing components independently. That lowered the barrier to enter the phone business, reduced costs and helped handsets reach the market quicker.""The smartphone ecosystem compared with the feature phone ecosystem is very similar, if not the same,"" said Ku. ""It's all well-connected pipes. It doesn't matter what product you pump in.""FABLESS CHIPMAKER MediaTek adds reference designs to basic chip architecture, enabling components to work together. It contracts fabs - or chip factories - to make the chips, which it sells to phone makers along with a list of compatible sensors, microphones and other hardware. It is the list that saves customers money, helping them make smartphones more affordable - particularly in emerging markets such as China, which accounts for 70 to 80 percent of MediaTek sales.Thrifty handset buyers have helped MediaTek sales rise at least 40 percent each month this year, culminating in October's 56 percent. For the full year, it estimates sales of 350 million smartphone ""chipsets"" from just 10 million in 2011.That would amount to 30 percent of the global market, showed Reuters calculations. Fubon Research analyst Carlos Peng estimated nearer 50 percent when excluding chipsets from the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Samsung that are primarily destined for high-priced smartphones.MediaTek's sales spurt is largely due to ""revolutionary"" growth in the value of silicon per handset in function-heavy smartphones versus their far simpler feature phone predecessors, said analyst Rick Hsu at Daiwa Capital Markets in Taipei.""It was a virtually 100 percent increase in silicon value,"" Hsu said. ""It spurred demand for a lot of peripheral chips.""Growth is unlikely to be as marked in the ongoing transition to fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (4G LTE) connectivity. MediaTek may even struggle with the emergence of 4G in China as it trails Qualcomm in the technology, analysts say.""The first couple of years of LTE could be very much like the early days of 3G (in 2008-2010), or when MediaTek had to play 'catch-up',"" Yuanta Securities analyst George Chang wrote in a research note. That ""usually leads to pricing erosion.""

In the past, Qualcomm has had a five-year target of double-digit annual growth in earnings per share and revenue. Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told analysts at the company's annual investor day that the troubles in China were hurting the QTL royalty business, which provides most of Qualcomm's profits. ""On QTL, the short story is that the underlying market continues to grow,"" Mollenkopf said. ""We are not participating in it right now to the degree we would like to, but once we resolve China, we think we'll continue to grow in that area.""Mollenkopf also said Qualcomm was adapting its technology to develop processors for data centers, a market dominated by Intel Corp.Applied Micro Circuits recently introduced ""microserver"" chips based on ARM Holdings Plc technology that is widely used in smartphones, and Advanced Micro Devices is working on similar processors. “The high-end design point for high-end smartphones, the evolution of the laptop and tablet, really are starting to merge with what would be feasible to put into the data center,” Mollenkopf said.Qualcomm's overall revenue rose 6.5 percent in fiscal 2014, far below growth rates of about 30 percent in recent years. Analysts expect 5 percent growth for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

141,"  (Refiles to clarify location of meeting)* Li says believes antitrust issue will be resolved soon* Qualcomm exec chairman says working on ""win-win"" solutionBy Paul CarstenHANGZHOU, China Nov 20 Qualcomm Inc's  opportunities in China will be far greater than its challenges, Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday as the U.S. mobile chipmaker prepares to face a possible record fine for antitrust violations in the country.

142,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday gave a more conservative five-year outlook than in the past as it faces an antitrust probe in China and consumers there and in other developing countries buy lower-priced smartphones.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by a year-old antitrust investigation there and troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers.The company expects its revenue to rise 8 percent to 10 percent annually over the next five years and for earnings per share to grow faster than revenue. In the past, Qualcomm has had a five-year target of double-digit annual growth in earnings per share and revenue. Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told analysts at the company's annual investor day that the troubles in China were hurting the QTL royalty business, which provides most of Qualcomm's profits. ""On QTL, the short story is that the underlying market continues to grow,"" Mollenkopf said. ""We are not participating in it right now to the degree we would like to, but once we resolve China, we think we'll continue to grow in that area.""Mollenkopf also said Qualcomm was adapting its technology to develop processors for data centers, a market dominated by Intel Corp.Applied Micro Circuits recently introduced ""microserver"" chips based on ARM Holdings Plc technology that is widely used in smartphones, and Advanced Micro Devices is working on similar processors. “The high-end design point for high-end smartphones, the evolution of the laptop and tablet, really are starting to merge with what would be feasible to put into the data center,” Mollenkopf said.Qualcomm's overall revenue rose 6.5 percent in fiscal 2014, far below growth rates of about 30 percent in recent years. Analysts expect 5 percent growth for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Also on Wednesday, Qualcomm said customers were testing its fifth-generation LTE modem chip, which has improved upload and download speeds, and that it would probably be commercially available next year.Qualcomm's stock was down 1.7 percent at $70.79 in afternoon trading.

In a press release, Broadcom said it raised its 2015 quarterly dividend 17 percent to 14 cents per share, and it also announced a $1 billion stock buyback authorization for next year. Shares rose more than 1 percent in extended trade.The company, based in Irvine, California, said it expects fourth-quarter revenue between $2.075 billion and $2.150 billion, with the midpoint of its forecast at $2.11 billion. In October, Broadcom said revenue in the fourth quarter would be $2.0 billion to $2.15 billion, with the midpoint of its forecast at $2.075 billion.

166,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) reduced its outlook for fiscal 2015, saying it expects its newest Snapdragon mobile chip will not be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone, sending its shares lower.The San Diego, California, company also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China, where Qualcomm has been disappointed with growth that has fallen short of expectations.The chipmaker said in a statement on Wednesday it expects fiscal 2015 revenue between $26.0 billion and $28.0 billion, down from a previous estimate of between $26.8 billion and $28.8 billion.It now expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 between $4.75 and $5.05, compared to a previous range of $5.05 to $5.35.Top smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) decided not to use the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor for its next flagship Galaxy S smartphone after the chip overheated during testing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Samsung had declined to comment on the report.  Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts on a conference call that the Snapdragon 810 performed well and is on track to be used in 60 devices. Samsung designs and makes its own line of smartphone processors, the Exynos, but the Korean company in the past has depended on Qualcomm's chips for many of its smartphones.“Qualcomm has a lot of market share but they have some customers with scale to do their own silicon, and it looks like that’s happening,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “This may be a trend.”Qualcomm said ""product challenges"" with a chip in China have created an opening for smaller competitors. ""We have already addressed many of the initial product challenges in order to support early customer device launches in these tiers and are continuing to further enhance the performance of this chip,"" Mollenkopf said.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by a year-old antitrust investigation there and troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers.The company said it resolved a dispute with a major licensee in China but that the timing and impact of a resolution of the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) investigation remain uncertain. Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion, up 7 percent.

167,"  (Adds comment from conference call)By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO Jan 28 Qualcomm Inc  reduced its outlook for fiscal 2015, saying it expects its newest Snapdragon mobile chip will not be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone, sending its shares lower.The San Diego, California, company also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China, where Qualcomm has been disappointed with growth that has fallen short of expectations.The chipmaker said in a statement on Wednesday it expects fiscal 2015 revenue between $26.0 billion and $28.0 billion, down from a previous estimate of between $26.8 billion and $28.8 billion.It now expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 between $4.75 and $5.05, compared to a previous range of $5.05 to $5.35.Top smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  decided not to use the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor for its next flagship Galaxy S smartphone after the chip overheated during testing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Samsung had declined to comment on the report. Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts on a conference call that the Snapdragon 810 performed well and is on track to be used in 60 devices.Samsung designs and makes its own line of smartphone processors, the Exynos, but the Korean company in the past has depended on Qualcomm's chips for many of its smartphones.""Qualcomm has a lot of market share but they have some customers with scale to do their own silicon, and it looks like that's happening,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. ""This may be a trend."" Qualcomm said ""product challenges"" with a chip in China have created an opening for smaller competitors.""We have already addressed many of the initial product challenges in order to support early customer device launches in these tiers and are continuing to further enhance the performance of this chip,"" Mollenkopf said.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by a year-old antitrust investigation there and troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers. The company said it resolved a dispute with a major licensee in China but that the timing and impact of a resolution of the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) investigation remain uncertain.Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion, up 7 percent.

It removes a major source of concern among Qualcomm investors, sending shares of the U.S. chipmaker up 1.6 percent to $68.18 in after-hours trading.    China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust investigation, which has also contributed to troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers.Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the China's National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) finding that Qualcomm violated an antitrust law. Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, ""We fully respect their authority, but we don’t believe it’s likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.""The U.S. chipmaker also cut its full-year earnings estimate because of the fine, which Qualcomm said would cost it about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. “It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and really positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,” Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in a phone interview. “It’s something we’re happy is over.” Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday. Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents - widely used by Chinese device makers - separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the selling price of phones, instead of on the whole price.  Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm's licensing business in China could affect the technology company's licensing deals in other countries.""That's the first time I've ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it's not the right number everywhere,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with its prior forecast of $4.04 to $4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion. Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85 to $5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75 to $5.05.

While sales of high-end devices like Apple's iPhone remain robust - and generate hefty profits for Qualcomm - the average selling prices for smartphones in developing countries will fall to $102 by 2018 from $135 last year, predicts IDC. In the United States, smartphones often sell for more than $600 without a contract.CHEAP CHINESE CHIPS  Qualcomm, a long-time leader in wireless chip technology, is also under increasing competition from Taiwan's MediaTek  and a handful of small Chinese chipmakers that specialize in making chips for low-priced phones.Qualcomm has led the industry with LTE technology, giving it a major advantage in the recent roll-out of the advanced technology in China.

185,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China's corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices.The deal - the details of which were first reported by Reuters on Monday - also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping local smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.Qualcomm said the agreement removes a major source of concern for its investors, sending shares of the San Diego-based chipmaker up 2.8 percent to $69 in after-hours trading.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust probe, which has also contributed to problems in collecting royalty payments from device makers.Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) finding that it violated an antitrust law.Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, ""We fully respect their authority, but we don't believe it's likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.""The U.S. firm cut its full-year earnings estimate, putting the cost of the fine at about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. ""It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,"" CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. ""It's something we're happy is over."" FINE COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday.Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC's anti-monopoly bureau, said the $975 million fine - equal to 8 percent of Qualcomm's 2013 sales in China - was less than the 10 percent of sales maximum allowed under Chinese law because Qualcomm fully cooperated with investigators. ""Issuing the fine was not our primary purpose,"" Xu told reporters on Tuesday, according to a Sina.com live-blog of his remarks. ""Our purpose was to restore orderly, free-market competition. Qualcomm's practices had stifled innovation.""Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents, widely used by Chinese device makers, separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the phone's selling price, instead of on the whole price.Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm's licensing business in China could affect the technology company's licensing deals elsewhere.""That's the first time I've ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it's not the right number everywhere,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of $3.56-$3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with a prior forecast of $4.04-$4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to $26.3-$28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $26-$28 billion.Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85-$5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75-$5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Qualcomm is one of several overseas companies, including Microsoft Corp, to come under investigation in China for allegedly anti-competitive practises.

186,"   By Robyn Mak | HONG KONG  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China has held back with its Qualcomm settlement. The country's antitrust watchdogs hit the U.S. chipmaker with a $975 million fine on Feb. 9 and forced it to lower patent fees. That's helpful for local smartphone makers that rely on Qualcomm's third and fourth generation mobile technology. Yet the resolution stopped short of explicitly curbing the tech giant's dominance in the country. Big as China is, it can't yet afford to shut out foreign technology.The one-off fine may be the largest in China's corporate history, but the $117 billion tech group can afford to take the hit: Qualcomm is debt-free and held $32 billion worth of cash and securities at the end of December. But Beijing's order for Qualcomm to price its royalties based on 65 percent of the selling price of a phone, rather than the whole price, will leave a bruise. Assuming 30 percent of the company's China revenue in the last fiscal year comes from patents - in line with Qualcomm's global ratio - a 35 percent reduction in royalties collected would have slashed the group's revenue last year by $1.4 billion.Yet China's antitrust watchdogs have left some leeway for Qualcomm to play tough with its customers. Unlike in Japan or South Korea, Beijing did not explicitly ban the company from ""cross-licensing"" - where Qualcomm requires clients to make their patents freely available to the chipmaker and its other customers - or from bundling chip sales with license agreements. Rather, Qualcomm has committed to negotiating with Chinese companies ""in good faith"". The lack of detail raises the risk Chinese regulators will flex their interpretation of ""good faith"", but there's scope for Qualcomm to retain its dominance and market share.A likely explanation for the relative lenience is China's reliance on foreign technology. The country has been aggressively ramping up next generation mobile networks: shipments of 4G smartphones in China will hit 422 million by 2017, up from 152 million last year according to IDC. But more than 90 percent of chips are imported, which means even more reliance on foreign companies for expanding 4G networks. Beijing's regulators may have a lot of weight, but Qualcomm is still very much in the game. CONTEXT NEWS - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm announced that it has reached a resolution with China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) on Feb. 9, ending a 14-month investigation into anti-competitive practices. The NDRC is China's top economic planning body and also regulates prices and market dominance under China's anti-monopoly law. - Under the agreement, Qualcomm will pay China a fine of $975 million for violating China's anti-monopoly law and modify some of its business practices in a ""rectification plan"". Specifically, the company will change the way it charges royalties from smartphone manufacturers for its third and fourth generation cellular technology. Qualcomm has also committed to negotiating its licensing and chip sales agreements with Chinese manufacturers fairly and reasonably.- Qualcomm raised its forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion, as a result of the agreement. - Qualcomm reported revenue of $7.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, a 7 percent increase from the same period last year on Jan. 29. Net income increased 5 percent year on year to $2.3 billion.- Shares of Qualcomm closed up 1.2 percent on Feb. 9, at $67.11.- Qualcomm press release (pdf):  bit.ly/1IGWHXq- Reuters: Qualcomm to pay $975 mln to resolve China antitrust dispute     (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

188,"   By Noel Randewich and Gerry Shih | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Feb 10 Even after agreeing to pay a record near-$1 billion fine in China for antitrust violations, U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc faces big challenges in its most important market.As low-cost, low-margin Chinese smartphone manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc and Huawei Technologies  push into other developing markets, they are driving down average handset prices - bad news for San Diego-based Qualcomm, which collects royalties based on the handset's value.Qualcomm could see its margins slip, eroding its profits, as firms like Xiaomi and Huawei push their budget devices into markets such as India and Latin America.""You've got all these Chinese companies - like Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo - that want to go global and take share from Samsung Electronics, HTC and presumably even Apple, but they're going to do it at much lower price points,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. While sales of high-end devices like Apple's iPhone remain robust - and generate hefty profits for Qualcomm - the average selling prices for smartphones in developing countries will fall to $102 by 2018 from $135 last year, predicts IDC. In the United States, smartphones often sell for more than $600 without a contract.CHEAP CHINESE CHIPS  Qualcomm, a long-time leader in wireless chip technology, is also under increasing competition from Taiwan's MediaTek  and a handful of small Chinese chipmakers that specialize in making chips for low-priced phones.Qualcomm has led the industry with LTE technology, giving it a major advantage in the recent roll-out of the advanced technology in China. But Intel, Marvell, MediaTek and HiSilicon, a unit of Huawei, are making inroads. In the second quarter of last year, Qualcomm's global share of LTE baseband chips dipped to 89 percent from 95 percent a year before, lshihargely due to the success of emerging Chinese competitors, said StrategyAnalytics analyst Sravan Kundojjala.Last month, Qualcomm cut its annual revenue outlook partly because a major customer - reported to be Samsung - chose not to use Qualcomm's newest processor in its next top-tier phone.Qualcomm also said it expected increased competition in China in medium and high-end devices, a part of the market it has traditionally dominated. Huawei, which sold about 75 million handsets in 2014, uses its own HiSilicon processor for its flagship Ascend models.Qualcomm rival Intel is also eyeing a comeback in the mobile market after striking an alliance with the Chinese government, saying in September it would invest up to $1.5 billion in state-owned chipmaker Spreadtrum to jointly develop processors.

191,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China's corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices.The deal - the details of which were first reported by Reuters on Monday - also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping local smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd [XTC.UL] and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Qualcomm said the agreement removes a major source of concern for its investors, sending shares of the San Diego-based chipmaker up 2.8 percent to $69 in after-hours trading.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust probe, which has also contributed to problems in collecting royalty payments from device makers.Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) finding that it violated an antitrust law. Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, ""We fully respect their authority, but we don't believe it's likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.""The U.S. firm cut its full-year earnings estimate, putting the cost of the fine at about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. ""It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,"" CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. ""It's something we're happy is over.""FINE COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday. Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC's anti-monopoly bureau, said the $975 million fine - equal to 8 percent of Qualcomm's 2013 sales in China - was less than the 10 percent of sales maximum allowed under Chinese law because Qualcomm fully cooperated with investigators.""Issuing the fine was not our primary purpose,"" Xu told reporters on Tuesday, according to a Sina.com live-blog of his remarks. ""Our purpose was to restore orderly, free-market competition. Qualcomm's practices had stifled innovation.""Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents, widely used by Chinese device makers, separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the phone's selling price, instead of on the whole price.  Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm's licensing business in China could affect the technology company's licensing deals elsewhere.""That's the first time I've ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it's not the right number everywhere,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of $3.56-$3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with a prior forecast of $4.04-$4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to $26.3-$28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $26-$28 billion.Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85-$5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75-$5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Qualcomm is one of several overseas companies, including Microsoft Corp, to come under investigation in China for allegedly anti-competitive practises.

Such a view has helped fuel a stock market surge of nearly 30 percent in the last few months, though the rally has shown signs of flagging in recent weeks as more firms issue profit warnings. ""We're seeing a technical rebound as expectations of further policy support help stabilise the market,"" said Shen Zhengyang, analyst at Northeast Securities.""But we don't see fresh capital flowing in as the market doesn't guarantee red envelopes ahead of the Lunar New Year,"" he added, referring to the customary gifts of cash in red packets for the holiday.The CSI300 index ended the morning session up 0.6 percent at 3,426.22 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index  was up 0.2 percent. But Hong Kong shares fell, with the Hang Seng index  down 0.8 percent and the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index  marginally weaker.Trading volumes in Shanghai remained thin, after hitting a fresh three-month low on Tuesday, as many investors await clues on whether the economy is bottoming out.Although the market expects fresh monetary easing measures  - China International Capital Corp forecast another interest rate reduction and three reserve ratio cuts ahead - analysts said they are aimed at bolstering the economy, rather than the stock market. In a sign of waning interest in stocks, the number of new trading accounts opened last week totalled 384,800, down nearly 20 percent from the previous week, according to the China Securities Journal.Software and telecom stocks climbed on Wednesday, as investors bet the $1 billion anti-trust fine China slapped on U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc would benefit domestic rivals.

198,"   By Marty Graham | SAN DIEGO  SAN DIEGO A former director of sales for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc pleaded guilty in San Diego on Thursday to insider trading, officials said.Derek Cohen, 52, admitted that he netted about $200,000 from a series of stock and options trades made after learning that the company planned to buy Atheros Communications in 2011, a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego said.As knowledge of pending Atheros acquisition spread within Qualcomm, Cohen spent about $430,000 on stock and call options. When the deal was reported in the media, the stock's value leapt higher, the statement said. Cohen, who had earlier pleaded not guilty, was the fifth person to admit guilt in connection with the deal, according to court records.Former sales director Robert Herman pleaded guilty in July to making about $30,000 from trading the stock before and after the acquisition, while Michael Fleischli pleaded guilty to netting about $3,000, prosecutors said.

199,"   By Marty Graham | SAN DIEGO  SAN DIEGO A former director of sales for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) pleaded guilty in San Diego on Thursday to insider trading, officials said.Derek Cohen, 52, admitted that he netted about $200,000 from a series of stock and options trades made after learning that the company planned to buy Atheros Communications in 2011, a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego said.As knowledge of pending Atheros acquisition spread within Qualcomm, Cohen spent about $430,000 on stock and call options. When the deal was reported in the media, the stock's value leapt higher, the statement said.Cohen, who had earlier pleaded not guilty, was the fifth person to admit guilt in connection with the deal, according to court records.

201,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Honeywell International Inc said on Monday it has teamed up with satellite internet startup OneWeb Ltd to expand the high-speed data services it offers to aircraft.OneWeb, whose investors include Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Qualcomm Inc, plans to build a network of 648 low-orbit satellites capable of beaming fast internet around the world starting in 2019.Honeywell will use OneWeb's bandwidth to provide aircraft services such as streaming maintenance data from engines and other equipment to the ground, transmitting weather and navigation data to pilots and supplying fast internet connections to passengers. The system also could stream black box flight data or cockpit video, ideas regulators are discussing, Honeywell said.Honeywell already supplies some services through satellite providers such as Iridium Communications Inc and Inmarsat Plc. But the faster speeds and low latency that OneWeb promises - at least 50 megabits per second per aircraft, and possibly much more - could in theory increase Honeywell's market by three to five times, Carl Esposito, vice president of marketing and product management at Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview.    ""It's a big opportunity,"" he said. Because of the high bandwidth, ""it really is transformational across the entire aircraft.""  The deal does not rule out or alter other partnerships.""It is very complementary to the solutions we're already providing,"" he said.Honeywell will also sell equipment that connects the aircraft to the satellite.  Honeywell says the agreement will allow it to target a wider range of aircraft, including smaller business and military planes, along with commercial jetliners.OneWeb says its system will be capable of providing 10 terabits of data per second, and much of that bandwidth will go to ground-based users in developing countries seeking internet access. Aircraft add another, potentially lucrative market, although the prices of OneWeb and Honeywell's services have not been set. OneWeb does not see a threat from other technology companies that provide global broadband such as Facebook Inc, Google Inc and SpaceX. ""There's an insane appetite for bandwidth,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Wyler said. ""We're going to make a dent in it with our system. But we're not going to complete it.""OneWeb plans to start launching its small satellites in 2017, placing them about 750 miles above Earth. The satellites will weigh 275 pounds (125 kilograms) and will be built with a partner. The satellite and launch partners have not been announced. (Additional reporting by Alexei Oreskovic.

203,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Qualcomm Inc, a maker of smartphone chips and software, unveiled on Monday fourth-generation LTE modems that will enable cars to stay better-connected wirelessly to cloud-based services via the Web. Cars using the new technology should be on the market within a few years' time.Qualcomm's Snapdragon X12 and X5 modems are designed to be embedded in cars and work with owners' mobile devices to access a variety of Internet services, from streaming music to vehicle diagnostics.Cars are becoming a key battleground for technology industry giants, including Google Inc and Apple Inc, as they seek to develop a market where drivers will be online while on the road.""These modems will give carmakers and consumers an in-car experience that rivals the best smartphones,"" said Kanwalinder Singh, senior vice president of business development for Qualcomm Technologies. ""Consumer expectations of the experience inside the car are being driven by their experiences with their smartphones."" Singh said the new modems are faster and will support advanced telematics and infotainment systems being developed for cars that could hit the market in the next two to three years.Automakers and third-party service providers like the ""ubiquitous connectivity"" - the ability to stay connected to the Internet - offered by embedded modems.  The technology means, among other things, that dealerships can alert customers to when service is needed or if a part needs repair. In some cases, software can be upgraded over the air while the vehicle is parked overnight in a garage.Insurance companies would also be able to offer vehicle owners a ""good driving"" discount, if they agree to have their driving habits monitored wirelessly and transmitted over the in-vehicle modem.""The marriage of the smartphone and the car will be the next thing,"" Singh said. In the future, mobile devices such as phones and tablets will be fully integrated with modems and software already embedded in the vehicle, he said.That means owners will be able to access a wider variety of apps and services, and their cars will be able to communicate wirelessly with other vehicles - a technology known as V2V - to help avoid potential accidents and traffic jams.

209,"  * Qualcomm jumps in premarket, to buy back shares* Crude oil falls; Exxon, Halliburton weaker* Indexes down: Dow 1.05 pct, S&P 500 1.01 pct, Nasdaq 1.09 pct   (Updates to market open)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, March 10 U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, dropping in a broad decline amid renewed concerns about debt talks with Greece and as crude oil fell, weighing on energy shares.Euro zone ministers agreed that technical talks between finance experts from Athens and its international creditors would start on Wednesday, with the aim of unlocking further funding. However, the ministers warned Greece that it had ""no time to lose.""Greece's debt issues have been on the back burner of late for U.S. investors, who continue to watch the region with caution. While the United States has little direct exposure to the country, there are concerns that extended uncertainty could spread throughout the euro zone. ""There's a lot of rhetoric out there, some of which feels like name-calling, all of which makes the situation read as worse than it used to be,"" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York.In China, the pace of inflation unexpectedly picked up in February while producer prices continued to slide, underscoring the intense pressure on profit margins at Chinese companies and adding urgency to policymakers' efforts to find new ways to support growth.The day's losses were broad, with all 10 primary S&P 500 sectors lower. Despite that, major indexes were less than 3 percent away from record levels, and the S&P 500 appeared to find support at its 50-day moving average of 2,061.61. ""Valuations are reasonable now. They're not low anymore,"" Colas said. ""We're at a level where we'll still make new highs, but there will be a lot more volatility on the path higher.""Qualcomm Inc rose 1.5 percent to $73.80 a day after the chipmaker said it would buy back up to $15 billion of shares and raise its quarterly dividend.Urban Outfitters Inc late Monday reported earnings that beat expectations, lifted by an increase in same-store sales.

The rise of 126,000 jobs was well below economists' expectations for a gain of 245,000.* The jobs data was released on Good Friday, when Wall Street was closed. Major European markets were closed from Friday through Monday for the Easter holiday, and were set to reopen Tuesday. * The weak data eased some concerns that the U.S. dollar would continue to strengthen and further pressure earnings of companies with international exposure. It also pushed expectations of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve further down the road.* However, investors are concerned that a patch of soft economic data, including jobs, factory activity and consumer spending, may point to more than a weather-related slowdown and could indicate a loss of momentum in the U.S. economy.* Separate readings on the U.S. services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the country's economic activity, are due shortly after the opening bell.

216,"  * Seeks to resolve supply issues for curved model quickly* Says could use Qualcomm chips in future products* Plans new wearable devices   (Adds comments from executives, analysts, background)By Se Young LeeSEOUL, April 9 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  expects record shipments for its new Galaxy S6 smartphones and said it will struggle to meet demand for the curved-edged version due to production constraints, adding to hopes for a turnaround in mobile sales.The S6 models are widely expected to sell briskly following a string of positive reviews, boosting prospects for an earnings recovery in 2015. This week, the company estimated its January-March operating profit to be its highest in three quarters, which analysts said was partly because Samsung put its own chips in the new phones.Samsung expects the flat screen S6 to sell more than the higher-margin S6 edge - priced about $120 more in South Korea - but mobile chief J.K. Shin said at a media event on Thursday the firm won't be able to keep up with demand for the latter model in the near term because the curved screens are harder to manufacture. ""Some carriers are switching existing orders to get more of the S6 edge, and it looks like demand for the model will exceed supply throughout this year,"" said HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh. ""That means average selling price will fall at a slower rate, which will have a positive impact on Samsung overall.""Samsung has not disclosed its shipment record for a handset. Analysts regard the Galaxy S3 as its best-selling model overall, though they estimate the Galaxy S4 to have done better in its initial year, when a model is most profitable.Nomura estimated that Samsung sold 80 million S3s in three years from its 2012 launch, and 43 million S4s from the model's April 2013 launch to the end of that year. Some analysts say Samsung could ship 50 million or more S6 phones this year. Samsung's Shin also said the South Korean electronics maker is preparing a variety of wearable devices, including a new version of its Gear smartwatch, but did not give specifics. Arch-rival Apple Inc is due to roll out its much-anticipated smartwatch on April 24. QUALCOMM STILL A PARTNER Shin acknowledged that Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc.Samsung previously relied heavily on Qualcomm chips for its flagship phones, but recent reports based on dismantling Samsung's handsets showed the firm replaced many Qualcomm chips with its own. Shin said the companies remain close partners.""We have to use the best engines to make our products competitive, which is why we opted to use our own chips,"" Shin said. ""But we may very well end up using products from Qualcomm again in the next Galaxy phone.""The new Galaxy devices go on sale in 20 countries on Friday.

Shares of General Electric Co dropped 3.1 percent to $27.63 after rallying on Friday, when the company said it may return more than $90 billion to investors through 2018. Shares of 3M Co were down 0.7 percent at $165.84.The dollar was last up 0.1 percent against a basket of major currencies after hitting a peak of 99.99, its highest in four weeks.

""Most people are thinking earnings are going to be weak due the strong dollar, lower oil prices and sluggish consumer spending due to the winter weather. But we'll see."" Among the companies expected to report this week are GE, Intel Corp and Johnson & Johnson, whose shares fell 1.5 percent to $100.55 on Monday. Several big banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Bank of America Corp , also are due to report.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.61 points, or 0.45 percent, to 17,977.04; the S&P 500 dropped 9.63 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,092.43, and the Nasdaq Composite eased 7.73 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,988.25.The Nasdaq briefly traded above 5,000, within 110 points of its all-time intraday high. In post-market trading, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp  fell 3.8 percent to $100.94 after the railroad gave a disappointing outlook.During the regular session, Apple Inc shares dipped 0.2 percent to $126.85, reversing earlier gains that followed reports the company may have received about an initial million orders for its Apple Watch. Netflix Inc shares rose 4.4 percent at $474.68.

The company, which has a market value of $114 billion, reiterated plans to buy back $15 billion in shares, with $10 billion earmarked for the next 12 months.Qualcomm's chip business is facing intense competition in a crowded smartphone-chip market.Earlier this year, longtime customer Samsung Electronics Co opted to use an internally developed processor for its new Galaxy S6 smartphone rather than Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon mobile chip. Qualcomm's chips business has also been facing regulatory scrutiny in China. The company agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in February, ending a 14-month Chinese government investigation into anti-competitive practices.""Qualcomm has been accused of bundling, that is giving you a kickback on the chip if you pay them for royalties or vice versa, which is not considered a good way to do business in most countries,"" Charter Equity Research analyst Edward Snyder said.Qualcomm's shares were marginally down at $68.99 in afternoon trading.

220,"  * Jana says chip unit ""essentially worthless"" at current valuation* Hedge Fund says it has had ""constructive dialogue"" with Qualcomm   (Adds details, analyst comment)By Supriya Kurane and Svea Herbst-BaylissApril 13 Hedge fund Jana Partners said on Monday that Qualcomm Inc's chip business was ""essentially worthless"" at current valuations and pressed the company to spin it off from its patent-licensing business to ""restore investor confidence.""Jana also wants Qualcomm to cut costs, accelerate a share buyback, improve disclosures and refresh its board, the New York-based firm said in a quarterly letter to investors.""We believe that the board and management recognize the need to address its historical underperformance and improve investor perceptions of the company,"" Jana said.While the buyback is a good step, Qualcomm needs to do more, including considering strategic deals, Jana said. Jana, which has investments totaling about $11 billion, said it owned about 4.4 million Qualcomm shares after investing about $2 billion in the company. (1.usa.gov/1H05TD5)Responding to Jana's comments, Qualcomm said it was committed to ""maintaining an active dialogue with all stockholders.""The company, which has a market value of $114 billion, reiterated plans to buy back $15 billion in shares, with $10 billion earmarked for the next 12 months. Qualcomm's chip business is facing intense competition in a crowded smartphone-chip market.Earlier this year, longtime customer Samsung Electronics Co  opted to use an internally developed processor for its new Galaxy S6 smartphone rather than Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon mobile chip.Qualcomm's chips business has also been facing regulatory scrutiny in China. The company agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in February, ending a 14-month Chinese government investigation into anti-competitive practices. ""Qualcomm has been accused of bundling, that is giving you a kickback on the chip if you pay them for royalties or vice versa, which is not considered a good way to do business in most countries,"" Charter Equity Research analyst Edward Snyder said.Qualcomm's shares were marginally down at $68.99 in afternoon trading.Jana said at Qualcomm's current stock price, the chipset business was essentially worthless and could be valued better by partial or full separation of the businesses.The Wall Street Journal first reported that Jana was putting pressure on Qualcomm to break up.

227,"  (Adds investor reaction to Fink letter)By Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK, April 14 BlackRock Inc chief Larry Fink has asked the top executives of the 500 largest publicly listed U.S. companies urging them to take a long-term approach to create value for shareholders or risk losing his firm's support.In a letter to the chief executive officers of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years.""It is critical ... to understand that corporate leaders' duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies' shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long term owners,"" Fink wrote in the letter, dated March 31.BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager. At the end of 2014, it had $4.65 trillion of assets under management.In 2014, dividends and buybacks in the United States totaled $900 billion, the highest ever, according to the letter. Through March, buyback authorizations totaled $257 billion, the fastest start to any year on record, according to Birinyi Associates.Many market analysts expect that a rise in interest rates will not derail the buyback boom bolstering stocks.The company made Fink's letter available to Reuters after The New York Times first reported on the document on Monday evening, ahead of the company's scheduled release of first-quarter results on Thursday. Given the low interest rate environment, such moves ""send a discouraging message about a company's ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long-term,"" Fink wroteCorporate boards should act as ""the first line of defense"" against short-term pressures.""In the last two years, activists have taken positions in some of the largest U.S. corporations seeking larger share repurchases, divestitures or other corporate action. The companies targeted included Apple Inc, General Motors Co, DuPont and Qualcomm Inc.Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co, which has $8.2 billion in assets under management, disagrees with Fink and believes most activists now are more long-term than the corporate raiders of the 1980s. ""I think the majority of activist investors today are really investors and are not going into this to slash and burn,"" Smith told Reuters in an interview Tuesday afternoon.For example, Smith applauded Nelson Peltz' Trian Fund Management LP for taking a long-term approach with its campaign against the management of chemicals and agricultural company DuPont.Trian is pushing the company's board to be more accountable and argues it should be split in two. The fund is pushing for four seats on DuPont's board.""I think Trian represents a positive influence,"" he said. Smith also disagrees with Fink that dividends are a sign  companies are thinking short-term.""Dividends are the mother's milk of returns to investors,"" said Smith, who only invests in companies that pay them. ""Dividend increases are the most tangible statement management can make about the firm's fundamentals and future prospects.""For its part, BlackRock has revised its proxy guidelines to highlight it expects board members to protect shareholders against short-term thinking.Firms that have a long-term strategy to create shareholder value, as well as credible metrics to assess performance, will have BlackRock's support during periods of underperformance.""In such cases, we will take action to ensure that the owners' interest are effectively served,"" he wrote.Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles and known as the Warren Buffett of bonds, shared Fink's sentiments.""In a number of cases, in the tech area among the most prominent of the examples, is where you ought to be reinvesting in the business,"" he said.

228,"  * Revenue likely to fall 7-8 pct from Q1* Forecast comes after client Qualcomm's chips dropped by Samsung* Q1 net rises 65 pct to T$79 bln, beats estimates   (Adds revenue outlook, industry outlook, executive comments)By Michael GoldTAIPEI, April 16 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC)  on Thursday said revenue is likely to fall in the second quarter from the first, due in part to the loss of business at one of its key customers.The world's largest contract chip manufacturer expects a decline of 7 percent to 8 percent in April-June. In the three months prior, revenue was flat on quarter but grew 50 percent on year, pushing net profit beyond analyst estimates.The forecast comes a week after rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said it used its own chips in its just-released flagship smartphone instead of chips from Qualcomm Inc, which contracts a large share of its production to TSMC. ""A key customer's business loss to an IDM ... will negatively impact our business,"" TSMC Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho said in a quarterly analyst conference, without identifying the IDM or the customer.IDM refers to companies like Samsung which both design and manufacture chips, unlike TSMC which only manufactures them.The development follows TSMC's presumed loss of orders to Samsung for chips for Apple Inc's next iPhone, likely due out this year, analysts said. Estimates for TSMC's share in the handset's next iteration range from 30 percent to 50 percent, from as much as 100 percent in the iPhone 6 models. At the lower end of the smartphone market, declining prices worldwide may drive handset makers to opt for smaller players such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp  and United Microelectronics Corp which offer more competitive prices for less-advanced technology, analysts said.SLOWING MARKET  TSMC said the chip industry - from design to manufacturing and testing - is likely to grow 4 percent this year, rather than 5 percent forecast in January, and that revenue growth in manufacturing alone will be more 10 percent than 12 percent.""Emerging countries' demand for low-end smartphones is relatively weak"" in the short-term, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun. ""We're also seeing some delay in the launch of high-end phones from Android brands other than Samsung.""TSMC also sliced $1 billion from its capital expenditure plan for 2015, largely attributed to improved efficiency rather than weak demand.For the three months through March, TSMC said net profit rose 65 percent to T$79 billion ($2.54 billion), beating the T$77.8 billion average estimate of 22 analysts polled by Reuters.Ahead of the earnings, TSMC shares closed up 2.8 percent versus a 1.2 percent rise in the overall TAIEX index.

Company-watchers are skittish about the firm's future as competition intensifies to produce the smallest, most energy-efficient chips against rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and Intel Corp.Most agree TSMC lost orders to Samsung to produce chips for Apple's next-generation iPhone, likely due out this year.

230,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, April 17 (IFR) - Hedge fund pressure to break up Qualcomm is not likely to be an obstacle when the world's largest phone chip-maker comes to market as expected with a jumbo bond to finance a share buyback.Activist hedge fund Jana Partners, which holds 4.4 million shares in Qualcomm, wants it to split its chip-making business from its technology-licensing operation, among other changes.But with A1/A+ ratings, no debt outstanding and some US$32bn of cash on hand, Qualcomm is highly unlikely to take heed - and investors are expected to shrug off Jana's complaints as well.""Qualcomm is a US$113bn company,"" said Matt Duch, senior portfolio manager at Calvert Investments.""So I'm sure the (buy-side) response is: they are too big for Jana to really influence management decisions.""Jana is widely seen as the biggest and toughest of all hedge fund activists, and typically its involvement would spell nothing but trouble for a company.Moreover, its gripes about Qualcomm's recent performance are understandable.Qualcomm shares have slumped almost 9% year-to-date, and the company is facing intense competition from the likes of Samsung, MediaTek and Intel.""We believe that the board and management recognise the need to address its historical underperformance and improve investor perceptions of the company,"" Jana said this week, calling Qualcomm's chip business ""essentially worthless"" at current valuations.But with its strong ratings and lack of debt, Qualcomm has the ability to issue tens of billions of dollars of bonds for shareholder-friendly actions - and still remain single A rated with cash to spare. ""As a bondholder you're always concerned that a company may pursue more aggressive financial policies to boost shareholder returns,"" said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida & Habacht.""But an inaugural issuance in the A rated technology bucket by a company with no debt outstanding would appeal to a wide audience.""With demand for high-quality corporates increasing with every drop in government bond yields worldwide, investors are more willing to accept bonds that mitigate risks with covenants.""In this market, Qualcomm could structure the bond issuance with strong covenants (change of control language, limitations on leverage and subordination) and enough credit spread to overcome the Jana Partners overhang,"" said Kimball.""In fact, one could argue that debt with heavy covenants limits Jana's flexibility."" PRESSURE'S ON Jana is hardly alone when it comes to activism, which has skyrocketed in the US since the credit crisis.With large piles of offshore cash, tech companies like Qualcomm and Apple - which bowed to pressure with its first-ever bond for a share buyback two years ago - are regular targets.According to Moody's, tech companies were the target of 20% of all such activism in 2014. And the ratings agency said there had been 55 cases across 14 non-financial industry sectors by early April, versus 43 in the same period in 2014.Qualcomm would be one of the last of the tech giants to bite the bullet and put debt on its balance sheet to pay for shareholder-friendly actions, and the market is gearing up for a bond deal as large as US$10bn.While there is no official mandate yet, expectations are that deal will surface soon after the company announces earnings on April 22.A bond would help finance a US$15bn share buyback plan announced by the company in March, about two-thirds of which it aims to do this year.Some analysts say Qualcomm could easily issue up to US$20bn and still keep a low single A rating.And the investment-grade bond market has proven time and again that it can absorb mammoth deals in one fell swoop - even for lower rated issuers like Actavis, which sold US$21bn across 10 tranches in March. Actavis is rated Baa3/BBB-/BBB-.""While we originally thought management would take leverage up to 1.0x, indicating a US$10bn issuance, we think that with activist pressure, Qualcomm may end up with closer to US$20bn of debt over time,"" said Erin Lyons, technology analyst at CreditSights.""At this level, Qualcomm could hold onto a low single A rating, given it would still have a sizeable net cash position.""(Reporting by Danielle Robinson; Editing by Natalie Harrison and Marc Carnegie)",2015-04-17,QCOM,"Fri Apr 17, 2015 | 11:40am EDT",Hedge fund pressure unlikely to block Qualcomm bond,http://www.reuters.com//article/qualcomm-bond-idUSL2N0XA1NI20150417?type=companyNews

250,"   By Lehar Maan and Bill Rigby  Avago Technologies Ltd's (AVGO.O) $37 billion deal to buy chipmaker Broadcom  Corp (BRCM.O) creates new competitive challenges for Qualcomm and may force the world's largest mobile chip maker to radically rethink its own strategy.Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which has dominated the market for connectivity chips on smartphones, has been looking to extend its reach into data centers and network infrastructure, but may find its way blocked by an enlarged competitor combining Avago's strength in storage and Broadcom's power in networking.""Qualcomm has aspirations of moving into Intel's data center processor incumbency that the Avago storage and now enterprise networking (from Broadcom) capability directly overlays,"" said Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington. That could result in Qualcomm creating some sort of partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O), he said, to combat the reach of the new company.Wall Street analysts generally cheered the deal on Thursday, despite some fretting about price, saying Broadcom's strength  in wireless networking, WiFi and Bluetooth chips is a good complement to Avago's presence in industrial and wired devices.That presents a challenge to Qualcomm, which finds itself in a tough spot in the maturing microprocessor business, as smartphone makers such as Samsung (005930.KS), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Huawei (002502.SZ) put more effort into producing their own chips. Now a Avago/Broadcom tie-up - which will take the name of Broadcom - potentially gives handset makers another viable supplier, giving them more leverage and putting even more pressure on Qualcomm, said IDC analyst Mario Morales.""The other material impact will come from the adjacencies that Qualcomm is trying to enter now, the data center, infrastructure and the consumer area,"" he added. ""We see a lot of synergy in the technology they (Avago) are buying.""Qualcomm has hinted that it is looking at new areas.  ""I think there's going to be a tremendous amount of growth in computing and resources dedicated to supporting the cloud,"" Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said at last year's Consumer Electronics Show. ""We look at that as an opportunity for a company like ours.""The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment on its strategic plans in response to the Broadcom deal on Thursday.Avago/Broadcom is just the latest in a wave of heavyweight mergers and acquisitions reshaping the chip industry.  NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) unveiled a deal in March to buy smaller peer Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N. In the same month, Reuters reported that Intel was in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp ALTR.O, which many investors expect to result in a deal soon.That backdrop of consolidation may force Qualcomm's hand.""Either divest themselves of the business that they are in that is in direct competition with Broadcom - and now Avago - or find a way to grow their presence,"" said Chris Geier, partner-in-charge of Sikich Investment Banking, assessing Qualcomm's options. ""They are going to have to do one or the other. The status quo for them at this point won't work.""

256,"  June 26 A former high-ranking executive at semiconductor maker Qualcomm Inc was sentenced on Friday to a year and a half in prison and fined $500,000 for masterminding a three-year insider trading scheme.Jing Wang, formerly Qualcomm's president of global business operations, made hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits from buying shares of Qualcomm and another company based on knowledge gained in his elevated position, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.Wang, 52, of Del Mar, California, pleaded guilty in July last year to charges of insider trading, money laundering and obstruction of justice in connection with his scheme.According to the Justice Department, Wang admitted to three separate insider trades using a brokerage account in the British Virgin Islands. In early 2010, he bought about $277,000 worth of Qualcomm stock, with prior knowledge that the company planned to increase its dividend and repurchase stock. In December 2010, he bought stock of chipmaker Atheros with the knowledge that Qualcomm planned to make an offer to purchase the company. A few weeks after that, he told his stockbroker, Gary Yin, to sell the Atheros stock and purchase Qualcomm stock, just one day before the company announced record earnings.Wang pleaded guilty to money laundering for transferring his illegal proceeds between entities he controlled in the British Virgin Islands, and also admitted to obstructing justice by concocting a plan whereby he and stockbroker Yin would blame Wang's brother Bing Wang, who lived in rural China, for the insider trading scheme.

257,"  SEOUL U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has no plans to spin off its chips business at present, Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs said on Tuesday, despite recent investor pressure to do so amid intensifying industry competition. Hedge fund Jana Partners said in April Qualcomm should spin off the chip business from its patent-licensing business to improve shareholder value, calling the chip business ""essentially worthless"".""We've had that discussion for a long time, many years the board has looked at it but we still think the synergies of having the businesses together outweighs the dissynergies,"" Jacobs told Reuters on the sidelines of an American Chamber of Commerce event in Seoul.  Jacobs said, however, that the company is always evaluating its options and that the situation could change in the future.

258,"   By Mari Saito | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Tumbling markets and economic uncertainty in China pose a risk to major chipmakers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) that derive a big portion of their sales from the world's second-largest economy.Consumer electronics giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O) could also be vulnerable - 17 percent of the company's overall revenue last fiscal year came from China, and in the most recent quarter it sold more iPhones in the country than in the United States for the first time.But the slowing pace of China's economic growth - on top of already weakening demand for mobile devices - could deliver a particularly tough blow to chipmakers, analysts said. ""When you have waning demand hitting at the same time (as the stock market uncertainty), it just makes that industry that much more difficult,"" said Christopher Rolland, a senior equity analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. Beijing took steps during the weekend to revive shares following a 30 percent slide in its stock market since mid-June, which raised investors' concerns about the stability of the Chinese economy.Among the companies with the biggest exposure to China are Qualcomm and fellow chipmaker Broadcom Corp (BRCM.O), which depend on China for 50 percent and 24 percent of their overall revenue, respectively. Qualcomm declined to comment ahead of its earnings announcement, and a Broadcom representative was not immediately available to comment. Apple declined to comment.  China's stock market stumble comes as the chip sector was already facing a tough year. Research firm Gartner said it is downgrading its assessment of worldwide semiconductor sales, which it had initially expected to reach $354 billion this year, a 4 percent increase from 2014, although it has not yet released its new assessment.However, the situation may not be as dire as the revenue numbers indicate. Exposure to China may be smaller than the companies' reports suggest, according to Cody Acree, an analyst for Ascendiant Capital Markets.  For instance, Cirrus Logic Inc (CRUS.O), which supplies integrated circuits for audio and automotive applications, reports that it made nearly 80 percent of its revenue in China last year. But the company said the number represents where its products are manufactured and not necessarily the end-market where products are sold. The company said it did not currently see any impact on its business.

Baker | July 13  July 13 Moelis & Co has hired investment banker Zach Righellis as a managing director to build up a practice in global semiconductors, one of the most active areas this year in technology dealmaking, the company said on Monday.Righellis, who was previously at Barclays, will be based in Palo Alto and focus on clients in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Israel. Moelis made the announcement in a memo published on Monday. Semiconductor dealmaking has reached $79.7 billion so far this year, an amount that already surpasses every full-year period on record, with the exception of 2000, when M&A in the sector hit $115.5 billion. Righellis represented semiconductor maker Silicon Image this year on its sale to connectivity chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp. Earlier in his career, he helped advise Qualcomm Inc on the divestiture of vehicle fleet technology company Omnitracs LLC to Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm.. The boutique advisory firm has been adding to its TMT investment banking ranks in recent months. It hired Barclays tech analyst Ben Reitzes as a managing director in March.

The European Commission said on Thursday it was launching twin probes into the San Diego-based chip designer which center on its control of baseband components used in most of the world's smartphones, including Apple iPhones.One investigation will look into whether Qualcomm offered financial incentives to customers for baseband chips that form the core of the latest 4G phones and tablets, on condition that they bought exclusively or almost exclusively from Qualcomm.The second will look at whether Qualcomm engaged in ""predatory pricing"" by charging at less than cost with a view to forcing competitors out of the market.  The second probe was triggered by a complaint from British phone software maker Icera, which later was acquired by Nvidia Corp in a bid to enter the market for smartphone chips and compete with Qualcomm. ""We are launching these investigations because we want to be sure that high-tech suppliers can compete on the merits of their products,"" European Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement.""Many customers use electronic devices, such as a mobile phone or a tablet, and we want to ensure that they ultimately get value for money.""Qualcomm, which faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its global  turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules, said it was disappointed to hear of the new EU investigations. ""We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the Commission, and we continue to believe that any concerns are without merit,"" it said in a statement.The Commission is expected to seek information from Intel, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Renesas and the former ST-Ericsson joint venture as part of its investigations.As recently as 2009, the market for mobile baseband chips was teaming with competitors, but many established names have since quit. The components are key to allowing the latest 4G phones to ship data at high speeds without sapping batteries.  Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Freescale and ST-Ericsson have all exited this specific category in recent years to focus on other sectors. Graphics chip maker Nvidia, which paid $367 million in 2011 to acquire Icera, acknowledged in May that it had failed to make inroads into the market and that it would wind down its Icera business, if it could not find a buyer.

275,"  LONDON Top European technology stocks shed nearly $6 billion of market value on Wednesday, with suppliers for Apple the top fallers after the tech giant's revenue forecasts fell short of expectations.While the worst hit were the handful with 20-70 percent direct exposure, the whole sector suffered as investors cautioned against frothy valuations, with the STOXX Europe 600 tech index .SX8P trading well above its historical average.The European technology index lost 5.7 billion dollars of market capitalization, led lower by a 6.5 percent slump in Germany's Dialog Semiconductors and a 5.1 percent fall in British-listed ARM Holdings ARM.L. Apple orders accounted for around 70-75 percent of Dialog's total revenue, industry experts said, while Apple accounted for 20-25 percent of ARM's processor royalties last year.While Apple's biggest suppliers, such as Intel (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O), are American, Apple is a large customer of many smaller European companies.Dialog, which makes chips for Apple, lost $287 million, while ARM, which licenses chip designs for use in Apple products, saw $1.7 billion knocked off its value.Dialog remains up 67 percent so far this year, and trades at valuations over 15 percent higher than its historical averages. ""We have nothing against Apple, but expectations on that side of the market are a little bit too high and that the reason we now don't have any Apple-related stocks,"" said Anko Beldsnijder, managing director of MainFirst Asset Management.Austria's Ams AG fell 2.9 percent. Its technology is used in the Apple watch, though in June a Swiss newspaper reported it would miss out on a valuable new Apple contract. Shares in European companies with smaller direct exposure to Apple such as Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and STMicro (STM.PA) also fell by around 5 percent, with investors saying sentiment around technology stocks in general had turned negative. The STOXX Europe tech index trades at a price of 18.7 times its 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of 16.2 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. It trades at a premium to every other sector apart from telecoms and healthcare stocks.Tech consultancy Gartner said in April it forecast a 4 percent rise in semiconductor sales worldwide in 2015 but warned that stronger dollar, excess inventories and end of PC upgrade cycle were seeing ""mounting concerns"".ARM's drop came as the chip-designer's reported results that were broadly in line with expectations, saying that Apple's outlook would not change its view of second half trading. Veronika Pechlaner, fund manager at Ashburton, said the resilience of royalties from Apple last quarter was a good sign, and that ARM had enough other diverse streams of revenue to withstand a slight Apple slowdown.""Looking at the share price now, we could be nearing a buying opportunity. We still like ARM in the longer term, even in the context of weaker Apple earnings, as there are lots of opportunities outside handheld devices,"" Pechlaner said.She added that Dialog would be more sensitive to Apple sales, and that after today's fall investors would reconsider their position in the stock in the coming days.""We still own it, it's a question of whether we still want to continue to own it, whether we add to it here, or if the Apple concentration is a problem in the longer term.

287,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) President Derek Aberle, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners to improve the licensing and chip design firm's stock performance, on Thursday sounded a cautionary note about a potential breakup of the company.Stressing that the board and management do not expect to  complete a review of a possible split until the end of the year,  Aberle told Reuters that Qualcomm agrees with Jana that its stock is undervalued. Shares have fallen 25 percent over the past 12 months, whereas the S&P 500 is down 2.25 percent. Aberle said that investors calling for a split are taking a ""sum of the parts"" analysis and believe that Qualcomm's two divisions  - its highly profitable licensing arm and its chips unit - would be valued more highly as independent companies. ""You have to step back and say why is that and would a separation actually solve whatever the underlying issues are that are creating the current valuation?,"" he said. ""You have to be careful that it's not too simplistic an analysis.""The company's current structure, Aberle said, also allows Qualcomm to leverage relationships with Chinese customers, since the chipmaker is well-positioned to help them expand to other countries.  At the same time, Aberle acknowledged that having both a chips and licensing division has at times created conflicts with customers, ""but we manage it pretty well.""  DEALING WITH JANA  Jana in April unleashed a public campaign to reform Qualcomm, calling its chip business ""essentially worthless"" at current valuations and pressing the company to spin it off or pursue strategic mergers or acquisitions.Aberle said that when Qualcomm was approached by Jana, the hedge fund which owned $2 billion in stock did not pressure it to pursue a breakup but rather wanted them to review a split as one option to unlock value. It is also working on adding a third independent board member, whom Aberle declined to name. Qualcomm has already added two new board members in cooperation with Jana. ""A lot of the things (Jana) put on the table were very consistent with things we’d already been talking to our shareholders about and already been planning for a long time,"" Aberle said. Qualcomm said in July it would reduce costs by about $1.4 billion, cut about 4,500 full-time staff, or 15 percent of its workforce, and boost capital returns to shareholders.  (Reporting by Liana B.

Qualcomm is in the middle of a strategic review after hedge fund Jana Partners urged it to separate its chip unit from its highly profitable patent-licensing business.  The company has also announced job cuts and other cost-cutting steps in the face of stiff competition, which is likely to intensify as chipmakers consolidate to meet demand for cheaper semiconductors and to diversify their portfolios. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that demand for the new version of its flagship Snapdragon mobile chips was stronger than it had expected in the fourth quarter. The company was hurt earlier this year by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (005930.KS) decision to use an internally developed processor, instead of the Snapdragon chips, in its Galaxy S6 smartphones.  Samsung had not ruled out using Qualcomm's chips in the future and media reported last month that the South Korean company's Galaxy S7 phones for the U.S. and China markets were expected to use Snapdragon 820 chips.

308,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle charges it violated U.S. anti-bribery laws by hiring relatives of Chinese officials to obtain business, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday.The Chinese officials related to Qualcomm's new hires were deciding whether to select the company’s mobile technology products amid growing competition in the global telecommunications market, the SEC said.The conduct, which included offering jobs to some individuals who fell short of hiring standards at the San Diego-based telecommunications company, occurred between 2002 and 2012, the SEC said.Qualcomm, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings, had previously disclosed the SEC probe, the company said in a statement. Qualcomm has taken additional steps to enhance its existing internal controls and procedures, it said.The case is part of an SEC crackdown involving the hiring of ""princelings,"" the term used in Asia to refer to the children or younger relatives of China's political leaders or top executives at state-owned enterprises. The practice could potentially violate U.S. anti-bribery laws.  HSBC, Europe's biggest lender, disclosed on Feb. 22 that the SEC was also investigating its hiring practices in Asia. The SEC had also opened a probe into JPMorgan in 2013 regarding the hiring of princelings.Improper hiring by Qualcomm included a situation in 2010, when a manager at a Chinese state-owned telecommunications company asked Qualcomm employees to find an internship at Qualcomm for her daughter. A Qualcomm employee noted the girl's parents gave ""great help"" for Qualcomm's business development, the SEC said in a settlement.In another instance, Qualcomm gave financial support to the son of an executive at another state-owned company through a $75,000 research grant to an American university where he studied. The measure allowed the son to renew his student visa and retain his position in a PhD program. The Chinese executive's son was later a Qualcomm intern and then permanently employed, despite being deemed a ""no hire"" after company interviews.A Qualcomm executive later personally loaned the employee $70,000 to buy a home. Qualcomm now closely monitors employment referrals to determine if candidates have relationships with employees of state-owned entities or government, the company said. It applies a stricter scrutiny to avoid potential future anti-bribery law risks, the company said.The SEC also found that Qualcomm provided gifts, travel, and entertainment to try to influence officials at government-owned telecom companies in China.Qualcomm lacked sufficient internal controls to detect those payments and misrepresented them in the company's books and records as legitimate business expenses, the SEC said.

318,"  U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) forecast third-quarter profit below analysts estimates as it expects to ship fewer chips, including those for smartphones, its biggest business.The company's shares dropped 3 percent to $50.50 in after market trading on Wednesday, having earlier oscillated between slight gains and losses.Qualcomm, whose customers include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), said it expects chip shipments to fall 13-22 percent to 175-195 million in the current quarter.The company said it expects 3G and 4G device shipments increase to 8 percent at the midpoint in this quarter, lower than its previous estimate of about 10 percent growth.Besides slowing smartphone sales, Qualcomm is also being squeezed by competitors making chips that rival its own in price and performance, and the likes of Samsung and Apple increasingly making their own components for smartphones.Qualcomm said it expects to earn between 90 cents and $1.00 per share in the third quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Research firm Gartner expects global smartphone sales to grow in single digits in percentage terms for the first time ever this year, while Apple in January also forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years.The uncertainty in the smartphone business seemed to show in the company's third-quarter revenue forecast of $5.2-$6.0 billion, which implies revenue could be between 11 percent lower and 3 percent higher than the year-ago quarter.However, while Qualcomm's chip business is the bigger contributor to revenue, the San Diego-based company's business of licensing its chip technology is the bigger driver of profit. But here too the company has faced delays in closing licensing agreements in China, its biggest market.Qualcomm, which has recently signed new deals with several companies including Lenovo, said on Wednesday it was still in talks with key Chinese smartphone makers to sign agreements. Revenue at Qualcomm's chipmaking division and its licensing business fell, 25 percent and 12 percent respectively, in the latest quarter, dragging down total revenue for the fourth quarter in a row.However, the 19.5 percent drop, to $5.55 billion, in the three months ended March 27, was less than the nearly 23 percent drop analysts were expecting.Net income attributable to Qualcomm rose 10.5 percent to  $1.16 billion, or 78 cents per share.

327,"  June 24 Qualcomm Inc has filed a complaint in a Chinese court against smartphone maker Meizu Technology Co after the tech giant said it was unable to reach a licensing accord with one of the top 10 handset suppliers in its biggest market.The filing by San Diego-based Qualcomm, submitted to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday, is the first legal action by Qualcomm as it seeks to uphold terms of its landmark 2015 anti-trust settlement with China's economic policy panel, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC). Qualcomm agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in the settlement, the largest in China's corporate history.The complaint against Meizu asks the court to affirm that Qualcomm's terms for a patent license agreement complies with China's anti-monopoly law and the company's fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory licensing obligations under its 2015 remediation agreement with the NDRC, the company said.Reuters could not immediately contact officials at Meizu for comment.Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel, said in a telephone interview that the firm has negotiated extensively and in good faith with Meizu to sign a patent license agreement consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted by Qualcomm to, and accepted by the NDRC. ""There's no question that Qualcomm's intellectual property has been used and we have not been properly paid,"" Rosenberg said. He said Qualcomm was not focused on damages, but on leveling the playing field for everyone in China.Meizu, located in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, was China's eighth-biggest smartphone maker in 2015, shipping 24.82 million devices for the year, according to IDC data. China is Qualcomm's most important market, making up 53 percent of global revenue of $25.28 billion for the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, with a large chunk of profit coming from higher-margin royalties earned from the company's licensing arm.As part of its 2015 settlement with the NRDC, Qualcomm agreed to a plan that modified its business practices in China.

329,"  SHANGHAI Qualcomm Inc has filed 17 fresh complaints in China against Meizu Technology Co, stepping up its battle with the Chinese smartphone maker after the two were unable to reach a licensing accord in the U.S. tech giant's biggest market.The patent infringement complaints by Qualcomm, submitted to intellectual property courts in Beijing and Shanghai on Thursday, mark the second time in a week it has taken legal action against Meizu, one of China's top 10 handset suppliers. It filed its first complaint in Beijing last Friday.Qualcomm is seeking to uphold terms of its landmark 2015 anti-trust settlement with China's economic policy panel, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC). The San Diego-based firm agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in the settlement, the largest in China's corporate history.The 17 latest patent infringement complaints cover a range of features and technologies used in smartphones, Qualcomm said, including those relating to 3G (WCDMA and CDMA2000) and 4G (LTE) wireless communications standards. ""Meizu is attempting to obtain an unfair and improper cost advantage over its competitors,"" said Qualcomm's general counsel, Don Rosenberg, in an e-mailed statement to Reuters. The company's vice-president, Li Nan, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying at a news conference on Tuesday that the terms of a patent license offered by Qualcomm were neither fair nor reasonable. Meizu, located in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, was China's eighth-biggest smartphone maker in 2015, shipping 24.82 million devices for the year, according to IDC data. China accounted for 53 percent of Qualcomm's global revenue of $25.28 billion for the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, with a large chunk of profit coming from higher-margin royalties earned from the company's licensing arm.As part of its 2015 settlement with the NRDC, Qualcomm agreed to a plan that modified its business practices in China.

Baker  NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) is exploring selling itself to Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The deal would help diversify Qualcomm's business and make it a bigger supplier to the automotive industry. Talks are in the early stages and NXP may entertain other offers, should they emerge, according to one of the sources.  An agreement with Qualcomm could be struck in the next two to three months, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported news of the talks. Representatives for Netherlands-based NXP and San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to comment. NXP shares rose 16.9 percent to close at $96.12 on Thursday, while Qualcomm's rose 6.3 percent to $67.45.  NXP closed a nearly $12 billion deal to buy U.S.-based Freescale Semiconductor last December, creating the world's top maker of automotive electronics and doubling the percentage of its auto-related revenue to 40 percent. It could also attract interest from other large semiconductor companies such as Broadcom and Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O), analysts have said. Qualcomm, which supplies Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), has been dealing with slowing smartphone sales and stiff competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals.Qualcomm has so far sat out the transformative consolidation sweeping the industry, which has seen mega-deals such as Avago (AVGO.O)  buying Broadcom for $37 billion last year.  Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from chip sales but most of its profit comes from wireless patents it licenses to the mobile industry. It explored a plan to break up its chip business from its patent licensing unit after pressure from activist investor Jana Partners but decided to remain whole. Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said that the deal would give Qualcomm a roadmap for the next decade while moving away from a maturing handset market and toward the faster growing opportunity in automotives. Qualcomm was ranked third in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015, while NXP ranked No. 7, according to research firm IHS.  RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said the potential deal would be accretive to Qualcomm, which could also use offshore cash.""Assuming a reasonable valuation is paid, this would be an attractive acquisition for Qualcomm and a good use of $30 billion in cash Qualcomm currently has on their balance sheet,"" Daryanani said.NXP has a market value of about $28.5 billion, while Qualcomm's is about $93 billion.

351,"   By Liana B. Baker  Activist hedge fund Elliott Management said it bought 8.1 percent stake in Mentor Graphics Corp (MENT.O), calling on the company to increase shareholder value and pursue ""strategic opportunities."" Mentor Graphics is the latest technology firm the hedge fund has targeted, following successful campaigns at Qlik Technologies, Riverbed, Informatica and Compuware, which all sold to private equity firms after Elliott invested. Elliott said in a filing Thursday it had initiated a dialogue with the board of directors after taking a roughly $200 million stake in the company.Elliott's broad range of investments across the tech industry are overseen by portfolio manager Jesse Cohn, who also leads its private equity investing arm, Evergreen, based in Menlo Park, California.  In June, it partnered with Francisco Partners to acquire Dell Inc's software assets in a deal worth more than $2 billion that was an offshoot of its campaign against storage company EMC Corp. Mentor Graphics, based in Wilsonville Oregon and run by Chief Executive Wally Rhines, is no stranger to activist investors or takeover offers.

352,"   By Liana B. Baker  Activist hedge fund Elliott Management said it bought 8.1 percent stake in Mentor Graphics Corp (MENT.O), calling on the company to increase shareholder value and pursue ""strategic opportunities."" Mentor Graphics is the latest technology firm the hedge fund has targeted, following successful campaigns at Qlik Technologies, Riverbed, Informatica and Compuware, which all sold to private equity firms after Elliott invested. Elliott said in a filing Thursday it had initiated a dialogue with the board of directors after taking a roughly $200 million stake in the company.Elliott's broad range of investments across the tech industry are overseen by portfolio manager Jesse Cohn, who also leads its private equity investing arm, Evergreen, based in Menlo Park, California.  In June, it partnered with Francisco Partners to acquire Dell Inc's software assets in a deal worth more than $2 billion that was an offshoot of its campaign against storage company EMC Corp. Mentor Graphics, based in Wilsonville Oregon and run by Chief Executive Wally Rhines, is no stranger to activist investors or takeover offers.

370,"   By Sophie Sassard | LONDON  LONDON The value of merger and acquisition deals between UK companies has plunged 62 percent to a 30-year low since the country's vote to leave the European Union, according to Thomson Reuters data.Domestic deals in Britain since the June 23 referendum have totaled just $1 billion the data shows. Foreign purchases of British firms have also slumped 69 percent, according to the figures, despite a sharply weaker pound.That stands in contrast to a burst of dealmaking in the United States and the rest of Europe, which has lifted bankers' hopes for a Christmas fee bonanza after an otherwise mediocre year for M&A globally. AT&T's (T.N)'s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner (TWX.N), Qualcomm's (QCOM.O) $38.5 billion buy of Dutch chip  maker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) and GE Oil & Gas's $32 billion merger with Baker Hughes (BHI.N) are expected to earn bankers advising on these deals $475.91 million in fees, data compiled by Thomson Reuters and Freeman & Co show.  Those deals, announced in the past month, have pushed global fees earned from completed mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to stand at $21 billion so far this year, down 7 percent on the same period in 2015.Last year was a record year for dealmaking globally with several large deals involving UK-listed companies, like Anheuser-Busch Inbev's (ABI.BR) $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell's (RDSa.L) $53 billion takeover of BG Group.      Softbank's (9984.T) $30.7 billion acquisition of UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings in July had sparked hopes among bankers that the fall in sterling might lead to more deals, but few others have materialized so far.    LAZARD JUMPS ON SABMILLER, BG DEALS  Goldman Sachs remains the biggest earner globally according to Thomson Reuters.But the stand-out performer has been pure advisory firm Lazard (LAZ.N), which is the top fee-earner in Europe so far this year. If it retains that position by the end of 2016 it will be the first time in the 15 years that the data has been collated that it has clinched the top spot. Lazard advised Tyco International on its $16.5 billion merger with Johnson Controls and also worked with ARM Holdings on the Softbank deal.Globally, Lazard ranked fourth both in terms of fees from completed deals and the number of announced deals so far this year, challenging large American bulge bracket banks which also get M&A credit for lending money to their clients.  Companies over the past few years have increasingly turned to so-called ""boutique"" pure advisory firms which are seen as more independent in their advice than universal lending banks. Another pure-play advisory firm, Rothschild (ROTH.PA), ranked number two for European fees and number six globally, the data showed.Among the bulge bracket firms, UBS is set for a record year after advising Swiss chemical firm Syngenta on its $43 billion deal with Chemchina. The Swiss bank ranks at number two for announced deals so far this year in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), just behind Goldman Sachs. But its European rival Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which is in the middle of a strategic overhaul as it risks a multi-billion fine from U.S. regulator, has been struggling, falling from sixth to tenth globally on announced deals so far this year, the data showed.
