3,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  A South Carolina jury on Monday awarded $8.1 million to a former adviser who sold his wealth management business to BB&T Corp and later alleged that the company mismanaged his retirement nest egg with a risky strategy, according to a person familiar with the matter.The verdict, reached on Monday by a jury at the Court of Common Pleas for the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit in Greenville, South Carolina, included $3.1 million in actual damages and $5 million in punitive damages, the person said.A spokeswoman for BB&T Corp and a lawyer for the plaintiff declined to comment.The plaintiff, Francis Maybank, filed the case against BB&T Corp and two of its units in 2011. Maybank, of Charleston County, South Carolina, founded a trust and asset management company that BB&T acquired in 2001, according to the complaint.  BB&T bought Maybank's firm, which managed $700 million in client assets, with 246,000 shares of BB&T company stock, according to the complaint. Maybank hired BB&T's wealth management division in 2006, when nearing age 74, to advise him on investing his retirement portfolio. The BB&T advisers were required to act in Mayfield's best interests because they were so-called ""fiduciaries,"" but instead put the company's interests first by not recommending that Mayfield sell off the company shares and diversify his investments across multiple asset classes to minimize his market risks, according to the complaint. BB&T recommended a complex investment strategy involving a type of derivative, a security whose value was linked to the performance of underlying BB&T stock, which BB&T advisers said would help him to reduce his concentration in the company's shares while raising cash which he could invest in a diversified portfolio, Maybank alleged. They did not disclose to Maybank that the strategy would force him into an expensive cycle of rolling over one derivatives transactions into another, which locked him into paying more fees and incurring greater tax liabilities while depleting the amount available to him for investments, according to the complaint. ""They were really leveraging up investments and making it riskier, under the guise of diversifying and lowering the risk,"" said Craig McCann, an economist in Fairfax, Virginia, who testified on behalf of Maybank.The firm and its advisers also violated their fiduciary duties by not explaining the speculative nature of the strategy or fees he would have to pay, which included a $1.3 million upfront charge, Maybank alleged.

9,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed BB&T Corporation's (BBT)  Issuer-Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The  affirmation reflects BBT's conservative risk appetite, strong management team,  and improving financial profile.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VIABLITY RATINGS (VR) & SENIOR DEBT BBT's ratings were affirmed at 'A+/F1' reflecting the consistency of the  company's performance through the credit cycle. Despite an operating footprint  that was particularly hard hit, BBT remained profitable through the cycle, a  testament to its strong underwriting and conservative risk culture. Given the  prolonged low interest rate environment, Fitch remains concerned regarding the  industry's potential to assume greater risk to improve returns. In Fitch's view,  BBT's risk appetite and control infrastructure help to guard against excessive  growth or weakening of underwriting standards. The company utilizes conservative  risk limits, and exceptions to these limits are very rare. The company has  historically had a very granular loan book with very few outsized credits.  Although not immune to regulatory-related actions or legal fines, BBT's  experience to date has been relatively manageable, especially in light of its  sizeable residential mortgage exposure which has been the root of so many  problems for the industry. While BBT did record a charge in the second quarter  of 2014 (2Q'14) related to its FHA-insured loan origination processes, it was  manageable, and not considered indicative of material risk control failings.  BBT's ratings are also supported by its consistent business model, strong  insurance franchise, and experienced management team. BBT's insurance franchise  is considered one of the company's key franchise strengths, as the sixth largest  insurance broker in the world, based on total brokerage revenue. Fitch views  BBT's insurance line of business favorably, as it supports a good degree of  revenue diversity with strong margins. In terms of its financial profile, BBT's earnings performance has improved, and  now tracks better than the peer average, providing support to its higher  relative rating. Asset quality metrics continue to moderate, with just 40 basis  points (bps) of net charge-offs (NCOs) in 2Q'14 (excluding covered assets),  below the company's normalized range of 50bps to 70bps for the next few  quarters. Fitch views the industry's low level of NCOs as unsustainable, and  expects some mean reversion in losses, particularly in C&I and card, for the  industry over the near-to-intermediate term.  BBT's liquidity and capital profiles also remain solid. BBT disclosed its  estimated liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) at June 30, 2014 of close to 140% under  the final rules. BBT also disclosed that its high quality liquid asset (HQLA) as  a percentage of total assets was 16%, an additional metric that many of its  peers have yet to publicly disclose. Fitch views BBT's capital position as  appropriate, especially in light of the company's conservative risk profile. The  bank's Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was an estimated 10% at June 30,  2014, unchanged from last quarter, and roughly in line with other large regional  banks.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT As BBT is one of the highest-rated large regional banks, an upgrade is currently  viewed as unlikely over the near term; however, significantly improved  profitability metrics, combined with the maintenance of an appropriate level of  capital could lead to an upgrade. Conversely, failure to maintain earnings at  current levels could result in negative ratings pressure.  Although considered a low likelihood, a large legal or regulatory fine that  impaired capital or raised concerns regarding BBT's risk management  infrastructure could pressure the company's ratings. In addition, a new  strategic direction which suggested its risk appetite was increasing could apply  downward pressure on BBT's ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   BBT's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should BBT's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for BBT given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that BBT may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  BBT has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, BBT is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  BBT's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BBT and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from BBT or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by BBT and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in BBT's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of BBT's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Branch  Banking & Trust Company and BB&T Financial, FSB are equalized across the group.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of BBT to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in BBT's IDRs.  To the extent that one of BBT's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from BBT's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS BBT's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by BBT and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in BBT's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: BB&T Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Subordinated debt at 'A';  --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.  Branch Banking & Trust Company --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Subordinated debt at 'A'; --Short-term debt at 'F1';  --Long-term deposits at 'AA-'; --Short-term deposit at 'F1+'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

12,"   By Amrutha Gayathri and Peter Rudegeair  BB&T Corp agreed to buy Pennsylvania-based Susquehanna Bancshares Inc on Wednesday for $2.5 billion in cash and stock and said it was eyeing further expansion to new markets between Texas and Alabama.  The Susquehanna acquisition is one of the biggest U.S. banking deals since the 2008 financial crisis and follows BB&T's September purchase of Bank of Kentucky Financial Corp as well as 41 Citigroup Inc branches in Texas.Merger activity in the banking sector has been muted since the financial crisis as regulators subjected acquirers to stricter scrutiny. For instance, M&T Bank Corp's planned $3.7 billion purchase of Hudson City Bancorp Inc has been on hold for over two years after the Federal Reserve raised concerns about M&T's anti-money laundering procedures.But BB&T Chief Executive Kelly King said the tone on bank mergers has been changing, so long as they wouldn't result in reduced levels of capital or liquidity or place an undue burden on existing systems.  ""I think the regulators have been signaling that they are receptive to combinations,"" King said. ""They've just made it very clear to acquirers that you better have your house in order."" King added that he would like to fill gaps in the bank's southeastern U.S. footprint between Alabama and Texas and would look to expand more into Pennsylvania in the future, either through organic growth or acquisition.

The Susquehanna acquisition is one of the biggest U.S. banking deals since the 2008 financial crisis and follows BB&T's September purchase of Bank of Kentucky Financial Corp  as well as 41 Citigroup Inc branches in Texas.Merger activity in the banking sector has been muted since the financial crisis as regulators subjected acquirers to stricter scrutiny. For instance, M&T Bank Corp's planned $3.7 billion purchase of Hudson City Bancorp Inc has been on hold for over two years after the Federal Reserve raised concerns about M&T's anti-money laundering procedures.But BB&T Chief Executive Kelly King said the tone on bank mergers has been changing, so long as they wouldn't result in reduced levels of capital or liquidity or place an undue burden on existing systems. ""I think the regulators have been signaling that they are receptive to combinations,"" King said. ""They've just made it very clear to acquirers that you better have your house in order.""King added that he would like to fill gaps in the bank's southeastern U.S. footprint between Alabama and Texas and would look to expand more into Pennsylvania in the future, either through organic growth or acquisition.

14,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 12 (Fitch) BB&T Corporation (BBT) recently announced its  intention to acquire Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc. (SUSQ) and its primary  subsidiary Susquehanna Bank which at third quarter 2014 (3Q'14) had  approximately $18.6 billion in assets, according to Fitch Ratings. On a pro  forma basis, this acquisition represents less than 10% of assets, and a  projected 50 basis point (bps) to 60bps impact to Common Equity Tier 1,, both of  which are considered manageable in the context of BBT's credit profile. As such,  Fitch does not anticipate the transaction will have any impact on BBT's ratings.  On Nov. 12, 2014, BBT announced a definitive agreement had been reached with  SUSQ to acquire all of its assets (including 252 branches) and deposits for $2.5  billion. Fitch views the pricing of the deal to be reasonable with BBT paying  1.69x tangible book value of SUSQ in a transaction that will be financed in 70%  stock and 30% cash.  While the transaction does not present a great deal of geographical overlap  within BBT's footprint, it does improve its market share in Maryland, increasing  to the fifth position, from seventh. Further, the acquired markets in  Pennsylvania and New Jersey are contiguous to BBT's existing footprint. With  this acquisition, BBT gains the number one share in Lancaster, PA, the 11th in  Philadelphia, and incrementally improves its position in the Baltimore  metropolitan statistical area (MSA).  As with any merger or acquisition (M&A), there are operational and  execution-related risks. Given BBT's track record and competency in bank  acquisitions, Fitch believes related risks will be managed well within BBT's  risk management infrastructure. Further, BBT intends to phase-in the integration  over a lengthy period to minimize disruption, as well as pause on further bank  M&A transactions, which is considered prudent.  BBT's ratings were recently affirmed at 'A+/F1' in early October, as part of the  large regional bank periodic review. The affirmation reflected its conservative  risk appetite, strong management team, and improving financial profile. A  transaction of this magnitude was incorporated in Fitch's last rating action, as  BBT is expected to be an opportunistic acquirer of banks and nonbanking  companies.

16,"   By Peter Rudegeair and David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 20 U.S. banks are taking on ""incredible"" risk in corporate and commercial lending, offering interest rates and terms that do not reflect potential losses, BB&T Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Kelly King said on Thursday.Intense competition in that market has led some lenders to cut pricing dramatically, he said, with some bankers again turning reckless and lending like they have in the past. ""Our corporate returns have gone down faster in the last two to three years than our retail returns because we're killing each other,"" King said at a financial conference organized by an industry group called The Clearing House. ""It's incredible the amount of risk that's being taken.""King said the banking industry should be more responsible, and said regulators have not been pressuring banks in commercial and corporate lending as they have with consumer accounts. ""Nobody is forcing us to drive prices down except ourselves,"" King said. U.S. commercial banks had $1.74 trillion worth of commercial and industrial loans as of October on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to Federal Reserve data. That figure was up 0.5 percent from the prior month, and up 12 percent from October 2013. Over the past five years, the market has grown 33 percent.BB&T, a large regional lender based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, had an average balance of $40 billion in commercial and industrial loans during the third quarter. That balance was up 5 percent from the prior quarter and 4 percent from the same period in 2013.

25,"   By Dan Freed  Feb 9 BB&T Corp is still in the hunt for acquisitions following three recent deals in 2015, although CEO and Chairman Kelly King says he may hold off in 2016.""While long-term we are still bullish with regard to M&A, I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't do anything this year,"" King said in a web cast on Tuesday from a financial services conference hosted by Credit Suisse in Miami Beach, Fla.One thing that gives King pause about doing more deals is the bank's low share price. Even though he typically prefers to use the bank's capital for mergers and acquisitions more than buybacks, those priorities can shift when the bank believes its shares are significantly undervalued, he said. ""I think M&A gets less likely; I think buybacks get more likely, because I don't really want to use our currency for M&A in this environment,"" King said.Shares of BB&T, like those of most other banks, have taken a beating in recent months as jittery markets have increased the likelihood the U.S. Federal Reserve will move more slowly to raise interest rates. Low interest rates make it harder for banks to make money by crimping their lending margins. BB&T shares are down more than 18 percent over the past three months, compared with a more than 21 percent decline for the S&P 500 bank index.Despite BB&T's low share price, King would not rule out more near-term acquisitions. ""If we were to have a really attractive M&A opportunity that met all of our criteria and we got really excited about, that would take precedence over a buyback,"" he said.BB&T, the 12th-largest U.S. bank by assets, announced last year it would acquire National Penn Bancshares Inc, a $1.8 billion deal the bank said will close ""on or about"" April 1. Last year, it bought Susquehanna Bancshares for about $2.6 billion and the Bank of Kentucky for $395 million.(Reporting by Dan Freed; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2016-02-09,BBT,"Tue Feb 9, 2016 | 4:59pm EST","BB&T CEO eyes more deals, though low share price gives him pause",http://www.reuters.com//article/bb-and-t-ma-idUSL2N15O222?type=companyNews
26,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Depositors at some of the largest U.S. banks are finally going to get the chance to do something quick and simple: send money to another person's account instantaneously by mobile phone.The idea has been in the works for at least five years, and in the meantime, Silicon Valley has made incursions into the industry's role as a payment intermediary. But now, big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp are starting to plug into a system they jointly own, called clearXchange, that will allow each others' customers to transfer money in a flash when they split a dinner check, rent payment or vacation bill.""What we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview. The bank is one of two that have started rolling out the system to customers.While technology companies like PayPal Holdings and Facebook Inc already offer snazzy payment apps that appeal to young consumers, the banking industry has a crucial advantage because it controls how quickly money actually moves between bank accounts. Individuals transferred some $200 billion to one another using mobile phones and computers last year, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.Bank executives and analysts who closely track payment systems say that if clearXchange is fast, functional and user-friendly, banks can make up for lost ground.Bank of America plans to announce on Wednesday that its customers can transfer funds instantly through clearXchange with customers of U.S. Bancorp, which said last week that it was plugged into the speediest part of the network. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Capital One Financial Corp representatives told Reuters they plan to offer the service later this year. Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday that it is working to roll out instant payments in the middle of this year.Analysts expect PNC Financial Services Group Inc will also start this year. A representative declined to comment.Those six banks are among the seven largest by deposits in the United States.  Regional bank BB&T Corp is also one of the seven owners of the network, but is not ready to announce its plans, a spokesman said.Citigroup, which has the fourth most U.S. deposits, has not joined clearXchange. A spokeswoman declined to say why. Citigroup uses an older network called Popmoney, which is owned by Fiserv Inc, for person-to-person payments. SLOW TO ADAPT Today, if a customer wants to transfer cash to another person digitally — whether on an app like Paypal's Venmo, or through an individual bank's payment transfer system, like Chase's QuickPay — it usually takes one to three days for money to move to an account at another institution. On clearXchange, the cash can move instantaneously with the tap of a finger.The initiative is particularly important for banks as their customer base shifts from a generation that cashed paper checks and got mortgages by walking into a branch, to one that goes online first to transact and borrow. It's important for banks to cater to 18-to-34-year-old Americans in the so-called Millennial generation as they enter their prime years for borrowing and saving.But adapting to these behavioral changes was a low priority for U.S. banks after the financial crisis, as they grappled with losses, fines, new regulations and slow revenue growth. In short order, financial technology startups filled the void — not just in payments, but in areas ranging from student loans to financial planning. If banks don't catch up quickly, they may end up losing some young customers altogether, analysts said.""There is a short window of opportunity for the banks,"" said Michael Moeser, director of payments for Javelin.For clearXchange to be successful, it needs to reach a critical mass of participants so that depositors will be able to transfer funds among most of their friends, relatives and colleagues. Until more banks connect to provide immediate service, the network has little value. Any U.S. bank or credit union can participate in clearXchange, and its owners hope many more will. The network says its members represent two-thirds of U.S. deposits.Banks in other parts of the world are making similar moves. In the U.K., for instance, there is an app called Paym that allows individuals to transfer up to 250 pounds ($355) to another user's bank account. Nordic countries are leading the way toward a cashless society, with mobile payment apps Swish in Sweden and MobilePay in Denmark.Analysts expect the mobile banking market to keep growing as consumers become more aware of apps, and as the technology improves.VIRAL NATURE Venmo, which launched in 2012, handled $7.5 billion of person-to-person payments last year. In January, the company moved $1 billion between individuals – up tenfold in two years, said Bill Ready, PayPal's global head of product and engineering, who brought Venmo to PayPal as part of a 2013 deal. Those figures track well below the $22 billion of cash swapped digitally by Bank of America customers last year, or the $20 billion Chase QuickPay handled. But Venmo is growing rapidly, and its popularity has come almost entirely by word of mouth, as friends ask friends to sign up, said Ready. Facebook's Messenger app offers a similar service.While these apps send immediate alerts that money is on the way, they still rely on banks to make sure cash is available and move it. And, unlike banks, they have no control over the speed at which that occurs.""As a Bank of America customer, when I hit send, a couple of seconds later the U.S. Bank customer will see the money in their account,"" said Bank of America's Harman.Even so, Ready, the senior PayPal executive, said he is skeptical clearXchange will be a success. ""The banks have a hard time working with one another,"" he said, adding that it would be difficult for them to ""recreate the viral nature of Venmo.""Facebook representatives declined to comment on the banks' plan, but said the company is continuing to improve Messenger's payment functions.The banking industry's advantage could be short-lived, though. The network that Venmo and others often use to transfer funds will begin phasing in daily settlement in September. That network, called the Automated Clearing House Network, is a not-for-profit association whose members are financial firms.""If Venmo becomes real-time,"" said Javelin's Moeser, ""then the banks have no differentiator anymore.""Banks that are part of clearXchange realize they must overcome the buzz and momentum that existing apps have gathered. They are working to come up with a catchier name than clearXchange, and hope to launch a marketing campaign around the middle of this year, said Harman.""The important thing,"" she said, ""is that we are acting now.""

The network says its members represent two-thirds of U.S. deposits.Banks in other parts of the world are making similar moves. In the U.K., for instance, there is an app called Paym that allows individuals to transfer up to 250 pounds ($355) to another user's bank account.

28,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK, March 9  NEW YORK, March 9 Depositors at some of the largest U.S. banks are finally going to get the chance to do something quick and simple: send money to another person's account instantaneously by mobile phone.The idea has been in the works for at least five years, and in the meantime, Silicon Valley has made incursions into the industry's role as a payment intermediary. But now, big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp , Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp are starting to plug into a system they jointly own, called clearXchange, that will allow each others' customers to transfer money in a flash when they split a dinner check, rent payment or vacation bill.""What we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview. The bank is one of two that have started rolling out the system to customers.While technology companies like PayPal Holdings and Facebook Inc already offer snazzy payment apps that appeal to young consumers, the banking industry has a crucial advantage because it controls how quickly money actually moves between bank accounts. Individuals transferred some $200 billion to one another using mobile phones and computers last year, according to Javelin Strategy & Research.Bank executives and analysts who closely track payment systems say that if clearXchange is fast, functional and user-friendly, banks can make up for lost ground.Bank of America plans to announce on Wednesday that its customers can transfer funds instantly through clearXchange with customers of U.S. Bancorp, which said last week that it was plugged into the speediest part of the network. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Capital One Financial Corp  representatives told Reuters they plan to offer the service later this year.Analysts expect Wells Fargo & Co and PNC Financial Services Group Inc to do the same. Their representatives declined to comment.Those six banks are among the seven largest by deposits in the United States.  Regional bank BB&T Corp is also one of the seven owners of the network, but is not ready to announce its plans, a spokesman said.Citigroup, which has the fourth most U.S. deposits, has not joined clearXchange. A spokeswoman declined to say why. Citigroup uses an older network called Popmoney, which is owned by Fiserv Inc, for person-to-person payments. SLOW TO ADAPT Today, if a customer wants to transfer cash to another person digitally - whether on an app like Paypal's Venmo, or through an individual bank's payment transfer system, like Chase's QuickPay - it usually takes one to three days for money to move to an account at another institution. On clearXchange, the cash can move instantaneously with the tap of a finger.The initiative is particularly important for banks as their customer base shifts from a generation that cashed paper checks and got mortgages by walking into a branch, to one that goes online first to transact and borrow. It's important for banks to cater to 18-to-34-year-old Americans in the so-called Millennial generation as they enter their prime years for borrowing and saving.But adapting to these behavioral changes was a low priority for U.S. banks after the financial crisis, as they grappled with losses, fines, new regulations and slow revenue growth. In short order, financial technology startups filled the void - not just in payments, but in areas ranging from student loans to financial planning. If banks don't catch up quickly, they may end up losing some young customers altogether, analysts said.""There is a short window of opportunity for the banks,"" said Michael Moeser, director of payments for Javelin.For clearXchange to be successful, it needs to reach a critical mass of participants so that depositors will be able to transfer funds among most of their friends, relatives and colleagues. Until more banks connect to provide immediate service, the network has little value. Any U.S. bank or credit union can participate in clearXchange, and its owners hope many more will.

37,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed BB&T Corporation's (BBT)  ratings at 'A+/F1+'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation reflects  the consistency of the company's performance, conservative risk appetite, and  its sound risk management practices. The rating action follows Fitch's periodic review of the large regional banking  group, which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation  (COF), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth  Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the consistency of the company's performance,  conservative risk appetite, and sound risk management practices. Fitch views  BBT's management team very favorably, with a very solid consistent track record.  BBT's insurance franchise is also considered one of the company's key strengths,  as the sixth largest insurance agency/broker in the world. Fitch views BBT's  insurance line of business favorably as well, as it supports a great deal of  revenue diversity with strong margins. BBT recently reiterated that the company's strategic focus has shifted from  executing on strategic deals to improving profitability through expense  management and revenue enhancements, and M&A is 'off the table.'  BBT completed  the conversion of National Penn in mid-July, which added approximately $7  billion in deposits and $10 billion in assets, with 126 new branches in  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland.  In second quarter 2016 (2Q16), BBT incurred $92 million in merger-related and  restructuring charges related to National Penn, but also to insurance broker  Swett & Crawford. Given the company's acquisitive nature, Fitch does not exclude  merger-related charges, though recognizes these items will be more episodic in  nature, and likely will be lower given management's stated objectives to take a  break from M&A. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BBT reported  an ROA of 1.16% in 2Q16. BBT remains one of the highest rated banks, and this  quarter's results are in line with our expectations.   Given BBT's fee income and solid efficiency levels, Fitch still expects BBT to  outperform its peers. BBT's long-term ROA objective is between 1.3% and 1.5%,  with a targeted efficiency ratio between 53% and 55%. Fitch views these targets  as very attainable, especially in a better interest rate environment.  BBT also disclosed that three previously discussed large technology-related  spending projects are either completed (the new general ledger system and data  center) or almost completed (new commercial loan system) and as such, core  operating expenses should improve going forward. Fitch views BBT's capital position as appropriate, especially in light of the  company's conservative risk profile. BBT's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under  Basel III was 10% at June 30, 2016. While this is below peer averages, it  remains well above the company's internal operating target of 8.5%, which is  deemed as adequate for BBT given its historical track record. Over the past 40  quarters, BBT has reported the most consistent earnings of the large regional  bank peer group, which were also higher than the peer average. BBT recently  reiterated that its capital distribution priorities remain in this order:  organic growth, dividends, M&A, and last, share buybacks.  BBT has already begun planning to become an Advanced Approach (AA) bank given  its asset size with projections of exceeding the $250bn threshold over the near-  to intermediate-term. In preparation, BBT has around 40% of its securities  classified as held-to-maturity, which would insulate regulatory capital from  swings in interest rates when the company becomes an AA bank. BBT's ratings also incorporate a solid core funding base, which is derived from  its extensive regional banking franchise that spans the Southeast and  Mid-Atlantic. BBT has at least the top-five market share in most of the markets  in which it operates. Ample holding company liquidity is deemed important for  BBT due to a higher balance of debt relative to other large regional peer banks.  BBT also disclosed its estimated liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) remains a very  high 135%.  Asset quality remains very good. BBT reported just 36bps of net charge-offs  (NCOs) in 2Q16, just slightly higher than the peer median. Given the make-up of  BBT's loan book, especially in its subprime automobile, credit card and other  lending subsidiaries portfolios, it is expected to have somewhat higher loan  losses than its peers. Fitch expects that loan losses will deteriorate for BBT,  as well as for the industry, from currently unsustainably low levels. Further,  BBT's nonperforming assets were the second lowest of the peer group at June 30,  2016, and energy-related exposure is modest at just 1% of total loans.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES BBT's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a+' for loss  severity. BBT's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instrument's  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Branch Banking & Trust Company are rated one  notch higher than BBT's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt  because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S.  depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  BBT's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiary. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the very  close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default  probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR BBT has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, BBT is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With a long-term IDR of 'A+', BBT remains one of the highest rated banks in the  world. There is currently a low likelihood that BBT's ratings would be upgraded  over the near term. Upward ratings migration would be predicated on a superior  earnings profile relative to peers, and the maintenance of capital at or above  internal targeted operating minimums.  Fitch anticipates that BBT will not pursue bank M&A over the near term as it  concentrates on improving profitability. However, if BBT were to acquire another  bank, Fitch would evaluate any acquisition on its merits., A sizable acquisition  that adds incremental risk and leverage to the company, however, could have  negative rating implications.  BBT's ratings could also move lower should credit quality deteriorate  substantially or if the company becomes a more aggressive capital manager. Fitch  expects it will take some time for BBT to manage its capital ratios down to its  operating targets.  Fitch views a downgrade as a low likelihood given the conservative risk appetite  and consistency in performance. Downgrade scenarios would be predicated on BBT  converging at peer averages across the board, and not adequately distinguishing  itself from its peer group.    SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for BBT and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to BBT's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to BBT's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should BBT's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the bank's ratings.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since BBT's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: BB&T Corporation --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Subordinated debt at 'A';  --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.  Branch Banking & Trust Company --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Subordinated debt at 'A'; --Short-term debt at 'F1';  --Long-term deposits at 'AA-'; --Short-term deposit at 'F1+'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

It corrects BB&T Corporation's short-term ratings to 'F1', which were  stated as 'F1+' in the original release.) Fitch Ratings has affirmed BB&T Corporation's (BBT) ratings at 'A+/F1'. The  Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation reflects the consistency of the  company's performance, conservative risk appetite, and its sound risk management  practices. The rating action follows Fitch's periodic review of the large regional banking  group, which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation  (COF), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth  Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the consistency of the company's performance,  conservative risk appetite, and sound risk management practices. Fitch views  BBT's management team very favorably, with a very solid consistent track record.  BBT's insurance franchise is also considered one of the company's key strengths,  as the sixth largest insurance agency/broker in the world. Fitch views BBT's  insurance line of business favorably as well, as it supports a great deal of  revenue diversity with strong margins. BBT recently reiterated that the company's strategic focus has shifted from  executing on strategic deals to improving profitability through expense  management and revenue enhancements, and M&A is 'off the table.'  BBT completed  the conversion of National Penn in mid-July, which added approximately $7  billion in deposits and $10 billion in assets, with 126 new branches in  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland.  In second quarter 2016 (2Q16), BBT incurred $92 million in merger-related and  restructuring charges related to National Penn, but also to insurance broker  Swett & Crawford. Given the company's acquisitive nature, Fitch does not exclude  merger-related charges, though recognizes these items will be more episodic in  nature, and likely will be lower given management's stated objectives to take a  break from M&A. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BBT reported  an ROA of 1.16% in 2Q16. BBT remains one of the highest rated banks, and this  quarter's results are in line with our expectations.   Given BBT's fee income and solid efficiency levels, Fitch still expects BBT to  outperform its peers. BBT's long-term ROA objective is between 1.3% and 1.5%,  with a targeted efficiency ratio between 53% and 55%. Fitch views these targets  as very attainable, especially in a better interest rate environment.  BBT also disclosed that three previously discussed large technology-related  spending projects are either completed (the new general ledger system and data  center) or almost completed (new commercial loan system) and as such, core  operating expenses should improve going forward. Fitch views BBT's capital position as appropriate, especially in light of the  company's conservative risk profile. BBT's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under  Basel III was 10% at June 30, 2016. While this is below peer averages, it  remains well above the company's internal operating target of 8.5%, which is  deemed as adequate for BBT given its historical track record. Over the past 40  quarters, BBT has reported the most consistent earnings of the large regional  bank peer group, which were also higher than the peer average. BBT recently  reiterated that its capital distribution priorities remain in this order:  organic growth, dividends, M&A, and last, share buybacks.  BBT has already begun planning to become an Advanced Approach (AA) bank given  its asset size with projections of exceeding the $250bn threshold over the near-  to intermediate-term. In preparation, BBT has around 40% of its securities  classified as held-to-maturity, which would insulate regulatory capital from  swings in interest rates when the company becomes an AA bank. BBT's ratings also incorporate a solid core funding base, which is derived from  its extensive regional banking franchise that spans the Southeast and  Mid-Atlantic. BBT has at least the top-five market share in most of the markets  in which it operates. Ample holding company liquidity is deemed important for  BBT due to a higher balance of debt relative to other large regional peer banks.  BBT also disclosed its estimated liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) remains a very  high 135%.  Asset quality remains very good. BBT reported just 36bps of net charge-offs  (NCOs) in 2Q16, just slightly higher than the peer median. Given the make-up of  BBT's loan book, especially in its subprime automobile, credit card and other  lending subsidiaries portfolios, it is expected to have somewhat higher loan  losses than its peers. Fitch expects that loan losses will deteriorate for BBT,  as well as for the industry, from currently unsustainably low levels. Further,  BBT's nonperforming assets were the second lowest of the peer group at June 30,  2016, and energy-related exposure is modest at just 1% of total loans.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES BBT's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a+' for loss  severity. BBT's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instrument's  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Branch Banking & Trust Company are rated one  notch higher than BBT's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt  because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S.  depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  BBT's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiary. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the very  close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and default  probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR BBT has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, BBT is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With a long-term IDR of 'A+', BBT remains one of the highest rated banks in the  world. There is currently a low likelihood that BBT's ratings would be upgraded  over the near term. Upward ratings migration would be predicated on a superior  earnings profile relative to peers, and the maintenance of capital at or above  internal targeted operating minimums.  Fitch anticipates that BBT will not pursue bank M&A over the near term as it  concentrates on improving profitability. However, if BBT were to acquire another  bank, Fitch would evaluate any acquisition on its merits., A sizable acquisition  that adds incremental risk and leverage to the company, however, could have  negative rating implications.  BBT's ratings could also move lower should credit quality deteriorate  substantially or if the company becomes a more aggressive capital manager. Fitch  expects it will take some time for BBT to manage its capital ratios down to its  operating targets.  Fitch views a downgrade as a low likelihood given the conservative risk appetite  and consistency in performance. Downgrade scenarios would be predicated on BBT  converging at peer averages across the board, and not adequately distinguishing  itself from its peer group.    SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for BBT and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to BBT's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to BBT's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should BBT's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the bank's ratings.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since BBT's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: BB&T Corporation --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Subordinated debt at 'A';  --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.  Branch Banking & Trust Company --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --Subordinated debt at 'A'; --Short-term debt at 'F1';  --Long-term deposits at 'AA-'; --Short-term deposit at 'F1+'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.
