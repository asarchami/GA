23,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 06 (Fitch)  Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Thermo Fisher Scientific's (Thermo Fisher) proposed $800 million senior notes.  The Rating Outlook is Negative. The ratings apply to $14.5 billion of debt at  Sept. 27, 2014. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this press release.  The proceeds of the proposed notes will be used to fund a portion of $3.1  billion of scheduled debt maturities in the next year, so the issuance has a  nominal effect on pro forma leverage.  Key Rating Drivers: --Thermo Fisher has demonstrated solid and consistently paced improvement in the  credit profile since the fourth quarter 2013 (Q4'13) acquisition of Life  Technologies, a transaction that added $10.8 billion of debt to the capital  structure and resulted in a one-notch downgrade of the ratings.  --Thermo Fisher has applied the majority of free cash flow (FCF; equals CFO less  capital expenditures and dividends), as well as about $1 billion in proceeds  from business divestitures, to debt reduction in 2014, reducing the  post-acquisition debt balance by $2.7 billion.  --At Sept. 27, 2014, Fitch calculates gross leverage of slightly under 4x,  versus a pro forma level of 4.5x at the end of 2013. Maintenance of the 'BBB'  rating will require Thermo Fisher to reduce leverage to 3x or below by the end  of 2015. Fitch projects that meeting this target will require about $1 billion  of additional debt paydown.  --Fitch forecasts Thermo Fisher to produce adequate FCF to accomplish this level  of debt reduction. It is likely that the company will resume capital deployment  for share repurchases and acquisitions during 2015. As long as this does not  derail progress in deleveraging, it will not result in a downgrade of the  ratings. --EBITDA growth should also contribute to leverage reduction. The integration of  the Life Tech business is proceeding smoothly, demonstrated by Thermo Fisher  raising the target for cost synergies; revenue synergies should also be a  tailwind to growth in 2015. Aggressive Capital Deployment Pressures Credit Profile The ratings continue to have a Negative Outlook, reflecting a pattern of  aggressive capital deployment over the past several years that contributed to  higher debt levels and deterioration of credit metrics. Although funding sources  for the Life Tech acquisition included approximately $3 billion of equity  proceeds and $2 billion of cash on hand, debt funding drove pro forma leverage  to nearly 4.5x versus a pre-acquisition level of 2.6x. Prior to the Life Tech acquisition, the company funded three fairly sizeable  acquisitions in 2011-2012, as well as a high level of share repurchases. Thermo  Fisher also instituted a regular dividend in 2012, which now consumes about $240  million of cash from operations (CFO) annually. Thermo Fisher has not indicated  a cash return to shareholder policy in terms of a percent of CFO applied to  share repurchases and dividends, but funded a high level of shareholder cash  payouts in 2011-2012, spending 70% and 50% of CFO on share repurchases and  dividends, respectively, in these years.  Decent Progress on Debt Reduction Plan  Despite funding a high level of business development activities and returns to  shareholders, Thermo Fisher has a generally strong track record of maintaining  gross leverage within a publicly stated target range of 2.5x-3.0x. The company  suspended the share repurchase program upon the announcement of the Life Tech  acquisition in Q2'13, and management has made debt reduction the priority for  cash deployment during 2014.  While growth in EBITDA should contribute to leverage reduction, Fitch expects  that reducing leverage to 3x by the end of 2015 will continue to require the  company to apply a sizeable portion of FCF to pay down debt. Fitch forecasts  EBITDA of $4.5 billion for Thermo Fisher in 2015. So far, $2.7 billion of cash  and asset sale proceeds have been used to pay down debt, meaning the company  needs to apply an additional $1 billion to debt reduction to meet the leverage  target in 2015.  Fitch thinks this amount of debt reduction is achievable, even if the company  resumes share repurchases and acquisitions during 2015. On a stand-alone basis,  both Thermo Fisher and Life Tech generated ample and consistent FCF. This  provides excellent financial flexibility and is a key support of the credit  profile of the combined company. Fitch projects annual FCF generation of about  $2.5 billion for the combined company in 2015. A high level of debt repayment is facilitated by the terms of the debt used to  fund the acquisition, including use of commercial paper and considering required  bank term loan amortization of $500 million in 2014 and $1 billion in 2015. The  financial maintenance covenants in the debt agreements also encourage  deleveraging. The term loan and bank revolving credit facility agreements  require Thermo Fisher to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than  4.5x through the end of 2014 and the required ratio steps down incrementally to  3.5x in August 2015. Life Tech Integration Proceeding Smoothly Thermo Fisher appears to be making good progress in the integration of the Life  Tech. During Q3'14, the Life Solutions Segment, which primarily consists of the  Life Tech business, posted organic revenue growth of 3%. This is generally  consistent with growth in the broader life sciences industry. Beginning in 2015,  Fitch thinks this business could post above-market organic growth given the  potential for revenue synergies in end-markets where the companies had  significant overlap, including academic, government and biopharmaceutical  research settings.   A more immediate influence of the business combination is improved profitability  and greater sales predictability for Thermo Fisher. In Q3'14, the company's  gross operating margin improved by about 500 basis points (bps) compared to the  prior year period, while the operating margin improved by about 250 bps. In  part, this reflects Life Tech's high proportion of consumables sales. The  addition of the Life Tech portfolio of products increased the proportion of  Thermo Fisher's sales that can be classified as 'recurring' consumables or  services to 61% from 56%. Sales of consumable products are highly profitable and  fairly predictable, since demand is somewhat less susceptible to the headwinds  that are influencing sales of larger capital equipment in the life sciences  sector, particularly in government and academic research end-markets in the U.S.  and western Europe. The realization of cost synergies is also supporting growth in the operating  margin. The company reports that it realized $73 million in cost synergies  year-to-date, and expects to realize slightly more than $100 million for the  full year 2014. This is somewhat above the original synergy target of $85  million for 2014.  Rating Sensitivities Maintenance of the 'BBB' IDR will require Thermo Fisher to reduce leverage to 3x  by the end of 2015. A downgrade could result if it appears likely that the  company will not meet this target because cash deployment for acquisitions or  shareholder payouts delays debt repayment, if growth in EBITDA is hampered by  difficulties in the integration of Life Tech, or operating trends are weaker  than expected. A positive rating action is not anticipated before the end of 2015, since it  would require the company to commit to maintain leverage below 2.5x. A revision  of the Rating Outlook to Stable could occur before the end of 2015 if Fitch  believes the company has made sufficient progress in debt reduction to achieve  the 3x leverage target. Fitch currently rates Thermo Fisher as follows: Thermo Fisher  --Long-term IDR and senior notes 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. Life Tech --Long-term IDR and senior notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Life Tech had approximately $2 billion of senior notes due 2015, 2016, 2020 and  2021 prior to the acquisition that remain outstanding. Life Tech is now a  wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the parent company, Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Inc. The parent company is the issuer and obligor of all other debt  in the capital structure. There are no upstream or downstream guarantees of the  debt outstanding at either of the parent or Life Tech subsidiary level. The debt issued by the Life Tech subsidiary is therefore structurally senior to  the debt outstanding at the parent level to the extent of the assets of the  subsidiary. Despite the lack of guarantees and a potentially stronger financial  profile at the Life Tech subsidiary, the ratings are equalized at the parent's  'BBB', rating since Fitch believes there are strong operational and strategic  linkages between the parent and subsidiary. Furthermore, Thermo Fisher  consolidates the results of the Life Tech subsidiary at the parent-company  level. Without stand-alone financials at the subsidiary level Fitch cannot  assess its financial status on an on-going basis.

25,"  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N), the world's largest maker of scientific instruments, forecast 2015 sales and earnings below analysts' expectations, becoming the latest U.S. healthcare company to warn about a strengthening dollar.The strengthening of the dollar, particularly against the euro and the Japanese yen, would result in a 4 percent decline in Thermo Fisher's revenue in 2015, CFO Peter Wilver said on a call with analysts.Thermo Fisher expects full-year revenue of $16.80 billion to $17 billion. Analysts were expecting $17.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company expects profit to be hit by 58 cents in 2015. It forecast $7.22 to $7.40, excluding special items, below analysts' average estimate of $7.62.Heavyweights such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) have warned about the impact of a strengthening dollar on their 2015 earnings.After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar .DXY has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand.CEO Marc Casper said the company plans to move more production of reagents to its Lithuanian site to cut costs and ""get aggressive"" on its operating plan to offset the impact from a strong dollar.Thermo Fisher reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Thursday, boosted by the contribution from the Life Technologies acquisition.

26,"  (Adds forecast, shares, CEO and CFO comments)Jan 29 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, the world's largest maker of scientific instruments, forecast 2015 sales and earnings below analysts' expectations, becoming the latest U.S. healthcare company to warn about a strengthening dollar.The strengthening of the dollar, particularly against the euro and the Japanese yen, would result in a 4 percent decline in Thermo Fisher's revenue in 2015, CFO Peter Wilver said on a call with analysts.Thermo Fisher expects full-year revenue of $16.80 billion to $17 billion. Analysts were expecting $17.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company expects profit to be hit by 58 cents in 2015. It forecast $7.22 to $7.40, excluding special items, below analysts' average estimate of $7.62.Heavyweights such as Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Inc have warned about the impact of a strengthening dollar on their 2015 earnings. After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar  has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms.The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand. CEO Marc Casper said the company plans to move more production of reagents to its Lithuanian site to cut costs and ""get aggressive"" on its operating plan to offset the impact from a strong dollar.Thermo Fisher reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Thursday, boosted by the contribution from the Life Technologies acquisition.With the addition of Life Tech business, Thermo Fisher's life sciences business reported a surge in sales to $1.19 billion, compared with $192 million a year earlier.

28,"  * Four research deals tap into pioneering CRISPR technology* AstraZeneca working with academic groups and Thermo Fisher* Builds on in-house CRISPR programme at drugmaker   (Adds further details on promise of new technology)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Jan 29 AstraZeneca said on Thursday it had struck four research agreements in the hot area of genome editing as it bets on a new ""genetic scissors"" technology to deliver better and more precise drugs for a range of diseases.The academic and commercial tie-ups will allow British-based AstraZeneca to use so-called CRISPR technology across its entire drug discovery platform in areas such as oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory and immune system medicine. CRISPR, which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, allows scientists to edit the genes of selected cells accurately and efficiently. It has created excitement since emerging two years ago and is already being tipped for a Nobel Prize.The collaborations with Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Innovative Genomics Initiative in California, the Broad Institute and Whitehead Institute in Massachusetts, and Thermo Fisher Scientific build on an in-house CRISPR programme at AstraZeneca that has been running for over a year.Other drugmakers, keen to exploit the potential of a powerful new scientific tool, are also forming alliances. Earlier this month Switzerland's Novartis struck deals with Intellia Therapeutics and Caribou Biosciences, two unlisted U.S. biotech companies that have been set up to take advantage of CRISPR.While certain existing techniques already allow scientists to add genes to cells, CRISPR lets them make changes in specific genes far faster and in a much more precise way. It is also much easier to handle in the laboratory. The technique is based on a naturally occurring system that bacteria use to defend themselves against viral infection and incorporates enzymatic ""scissors"" that cut DNA in the cell nucleus.It is already being used by academic researchers seeking to understand how cells work and the hope is that it will now help in the design of improved drugs.AstraZeneca believes the technology will let it identify and validate new drug targets more quickly, accelerating the drug development process. It should also reduce the failure rate for experimental compounds as they move from preclinical tests into clinical trials, making drug research more cost-effective.""CRISPR is a simple yet powerful tool that enables us to manipulate genes of potential importance in disease pathways and examine the impact of these modifications in a highly precise way,"" said Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's head of innovative medicines and early development.No financial details of the collaborations were disclosed but AstraZeneca said it would share cell lines and compounds with its partners, based on an ""open innovation"" research model. Neither side will own any targets identified.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (Thermo Fisher) USD800 million 3- and 10-year  senior notes offering. The proceeds of the issue will be used to redeem the  outstanding $900 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 3.20%  senior notes due March 1, 2016. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to $13.2 billion of debt at Sept. 26, 2015. The ratings also  apply to Thermo Fisher's EUR425 million senior notes issued in November 2015.  The proceeds of the euro-denominated notes will be used to redeem the entire  outstanding $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior notes due  2016 issued by Thermo Fisher's subsidiary, Life Technologies Corporation (Life  Tech), which mature Jan. 15, 2016. The early call notice for these notes has  been issued and the settlement is scheduled for Dec. 14, 2015.   A full list of ratings follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Thermo Fisher has demonstrated solid and consistently paced improvement in  credit metrics since the first-quarter 2014 (1Q14) acquisition of Life Tech. The  transaction added $11.3 billion of debt to the capital structure and resulted in  a one-notch downgrade of the ratings.  Through 315, Thermo Fisher has applied the majority of free cash flow (FCF; CFO  less capital expenditures and dividends) plus about $1 billion in proceeds from  business divestitures to debt reduction, reducing the post-acquisition debt  balance by about $4 billion. At Sept. 26, 2015, Fitch calculates gross leverage of 3.1x, versus a pro forma  level of 4.5x at the end of 2013. Maintenance of the 'BBB' rating contemplates  Thermo Fisher reducing gross leverage to 3.0x or below by the end of 2015. Fitch  views Thermo Fisher's current leverage as largely in line with the 3.0x target  that Fitch articulated as consistent with a 'BBB' rating in the wake of the  company's acquisition of Life Tech in early 2014. Fitch forecasts Thermo Fisher will produce FCF of around $2.4 billion in 2015,  which is sufficient to accomplish necessary debt reduction. It is likely that  the company will also deploy capital for bolt-on acquisitions. As long as this  does not derail progress in deleveraging, it is not likely to result in a  downgrade of the ratings. EBITDA growth should also contribute to leverage reduction. The integration of  the Life Tech business is proceeding smoothly, demonstrated by Thermo Fisher  raising the target for cost synergies; revenue synergies should also be a  tailwind to growth in 2015. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Thermo Fisher's gross debt leverage drops to 3.0x by the end of 2015 as a  result of $670 million of debt repayment. --Organic currency-neutral revenue growth of about 3% in 2015-2016. This  reflects Fitch's general expectations for growth in the life sciences sector.  Persistent headwinds in academic and government end markets in developed markets  will be offset by good growth in emerging markets and by faster growth in the  healthcare and diagnostics end markets.  --The operating EBITDA margin rises slightly through the end of 2016 due to some  continued cost benefits from the integration of Life Tech, as well as a stable  to slightly improving pricing environment.  --CFO is sufficient to fund a slightly increasing dividend, a small number of  bolt-on acquisitions, and at least $1 billion of modeled annual share  repurchases beginning in 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Thermo Fisher's favorable business profile, with significant scale, good  end-market diversification and improved product mix following the Life Tech  acquisition, supports the ratings. Therefore, rating actions are more likely to  be triggered by capital deployment decisions than by an operational stress  scenario. Maintenance of the 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating contemplates Thermo Fisher  reducing leverage to 3.0x total debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2015. A downgrade  could result if the company fails to meet this target because of cash deployment  for acquisitions or shareholder pay-outs, delays in debt repayment, or lack of  EBITDA growth. A near-term positive rating action is not anticipated, since it  would require a commitment from the company to maintain leverage below 2.5x. AMPLE LIQUIDITY Thermo Fisher's ample liquidity supports the 'BBB' credit profile. At Sept. 26,  2015, sources of liquidity included $503 million of cash on hand, $1.9 billion  of available capacity on the bank facility revolving loan and LTM FCF of $1.9  billion. The credit facility is back-up for the commercial paper (CP) program  and if the revolver is drawn the company intends to leave an available balance  at least equal to the amount of CP outstanding. The debt maturity schedule of the company's senior notes is well laddered.  Thermo Fisher used a high proportion of debt with a relatively short tenure to  facilitate rapid deleveraging post the acquisition of Life Tech. Since the close  of the acquisition, $4 billion of cash and asset sale proceeds have been used to  pay down short-term debt. The proceeds of recent notes issuances, including the  EUR425 senior notes due 2020 and the proposed $750 million USD notes issuance,  provide additional liquidity to address 2016 note maturities.  Life Tech had approximately $1.5 billion of senior notes due 2016, 2020 and 2021  prior to the acquisition that remain outstanding. Life Tech is now a  wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the parent company, Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Inc. The parent company is the issuer and obligor of all other debt  in the capital structure. There are no upstream or downstream guarantees of the  debt outstanding at either of the parent or Life Tech subsidiary level. The debt issued by the Life Tech subsidiary is therefore structurally senior to  the debt outstanding at the parent level to the extent of the assets of the  subsidiary. Despite the lack of guarantees and a potentially stronger financial  profile at the Life Tech subsidiary, the ratings are equalized at the parent's  'BBB' rating since Fitch believes there are strong operational and strategic  linkages between the parent and subsidiary. Furthermore, Thermo Fisher  consolidates the results of the Life Tech subsidiary at the parent company  level. Without stand-alone financials at the subsidiary level Fitch cannot  assess its financial status on an on-going basis. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Thermo Fisher as follows: Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. --Long-term IDR and senior notes 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. Life Technologies Corp. --Long-term IDR and senior notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

47,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Thermo Fisher Scientific's  (Thermo Fisher) ratings, including the 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The  Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to $12.5 billion of debt at Dec. 31,  2015. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Thermo Fisher has demonstrated solid and consistently paced improvement in  credit metrics since its Life Tech acquisition, using free cash flow (FCF) and  proceeds from business divestitures to reduce post-acquisition debt by about  $4.6 billion. Thermo Fisher's current leverage of 3.0x is consistent with  Fitch's target for the 'BBB' rating. --Fitch views the possibility of aggressive capital management, not operating  risk, as Thermo Fisher's key credit risk. Capital deployment for acquisitions  and shareholder payments has occasionally contributed to higher debt levels and  deterioration of credit metrics, reducing financial flexibility in the aftermath  of leveraging transactions.  --Thermo Fisher's diversification across customer markets and product categories  helps to mitigate the impact of cyclical downturns or secular headwinds to sales  or profitability in any one of the company's end markets. --Thermo Fisher's ample FCF, which could exceed $3 billion in 2016, should be  sufficient to repay any debt issued to finance bolt-on acquisitions, as well as  to fund share repurchases of at least $1 billion in 2016. --The integration of the Life Tech business is proceeding smoothly, demonstrated  by Thermo Fisher raising the target for cost synergies; revenue synergies were a  tailwind to growth in 2015 and this should continue in 2016. These benefits have  helped Thermo Fisher generate EBITDA growth despite meaningful headwinds from  foreign currency translation.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Thermo Fisher include: --Thermo Fisher's gross debt leverage drops to 2.8x by the end of 2016 and 2.5x  by year-end 2018, reflecting stable debt levels and EBITDA growth. --Revenue growth of about 3%-4% over the forecast period. This reflects Fitch's  general expectations for growth in the life sciences sector. Persistent  headwinds in developed industrial markets will be offset by stronger growth in  emerging markets and biopharmaceutical end markets. --The operating EBITDA margin rises slightly through the end of 2018 due to some  continued cost benefits from the integration of Life Tech, as well as a stable  pricing environment. --Cash from operations (CFO) is more than sufficient to fund a slightly  increasing dividend, greater than $4 billion of bolt-on acquisitions, and over  $4 billion of share repurchases over the next three years. --Annual FCF exceeds $3 billion throughout the forecast period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Thermo Fisher's favorable business profile, with significant scale, good  end-market diversification and improved product mix following the Life Tech  acquisition, supports the ratings. Therefore, rating actions are more likely to  be triggered by capital deployment decisions than by an operational stress  scenario. Maintenance of the 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating considers Fitch's continued  expectation that Thermo Fisher will be an active acquirer going forward while  maintaining run-rate gross debt/EBITDA of between 2.8x-3.2x in most periods.  Fitch recognizes that gross leverage may occasionally exceed this range in the  immediate aftermath of leveraging transactions. If the company were to complete  a leveraging transaction that cast doubt on its ability to return leverage to  roughly 3.0x within the following 18-24 months, it could result in a downgrade. A near-term positive rating action is not anticipated, since it would require a  commitment from the company to maintain leverage below 2.5x. DEBT REDUCTION COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE Despite funding a high level of business development activities and returns to  shareholders, Thermo Fisher has a generally strong track record of maintaining  gross leverage within a publicly stated target range of 2.5x-3.0x over most  periods.  Upon the announcement of the Life Tech acquisition in second-quarter 2013, the  company suspended its share repurchase program and management made debt  reduction the priority for cash deployment during 2014 and 2015. In those years,  Thermo Fisher applied the majority of FCF (CFO less capital expenditures and  dividends) plus about $1 billion in proceeds from business divestitures to debt  reduction, reducing the post-acquisition debt balance by about $4.6 billion. As  a result, Thermo Fisher has demonstrated solid and consistently paced  improvement in credit metrics since first-quarter 2014.  At Dec. 31, 2015, Fitch calculates gross leverage of roughly 3.0x, versus a pro  forma 4.5x at the end of 2013, which included $11.3 billion of additional debt  used to help finance the Life Tech acquisition. Thermo Fisher's current leverage  is consistent with the 3.0x target that Fitch stated as consistent with a 'BBB'  rating in the wake of the company's acquisition of Life Tech. AGGRESSIVE CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT PRESSURES CREDIT PROFILE Fitch notes that several facets of the firm's credit profile could support  higher ratings than the current 'BBB'. These include the company's significant  scale, good end-market diversification and product mix, as well as its  constructive growth outlook, solid margins, and robust cash flow profile. Thus  we view the possibility of aggressive capital management, and not operating  risk, as Thermo Fisher's key credit risk. Aside from Thermo Fisher's publicly stated leverage target of 2.5x-3.0x  (calculated on a gross, unadjusted basis), the company has shown that it is  comfortable increasing leverage well above this level to fund a large  acquisition. The downgrades of Thermo Fisher's IDR in 2012 and 2013 reflected  aggressive capital deployment that contributed to higher debt levels and  deterioration of credit metrics. Although funding sources for the Life Tech  acquisition included approximately $3 billion of equity proceeds and $2 billion  of cash on hand, debt funding drove pro forma leverage to nearly 4.5x versus a  pre-acquisition level of 2.6x. Fitch continues to expect that Thermo Fisher will be an active acquirer while  maintaining run-rate gross debt/EBITDA of between 2.8x-3.2x, which we view as  supportive of Thermo Fisher's 'BBB' ratings. Fitch notes that the company funded three fairly sizeable acquisitions in  2011-2012, as well as a high level of share repurchases, although it did suspend  share repurchases in right after the Life Tech acquisition, before resuming  stock buybacks of $500 million in 2015. Thermo Fisher also instituted a regular  dividend in 2012, which now consumes about $240 million of CFO annually. Fitch  currently models $1 billion of share repurchases and $240 million of dividends  for calendar year 2016, in addition to $1.8 billion of acquisitions. LIFE TECH INTEGRATION AHEAD OF SCHEDULE Thermo Fisher appears to be making good progress in the integration of Life  Tech. The Life Solutions Segment, which is primarily composed of the Life Tech  business, posted organic revenue growth of 7% in 2015. Fitch believes this  business could continue to post above market organic growth given the potential  for revenue synergies in end markets where the companies had significant  overlap, including academic, government and biopharmaceutical research settings. Another benefit of the business combination is improved profitability and  greater sales predictability for Thermo Fisher. In 2015, the company's gross  operating margin improved by about 150 bps compared to the prior year period,  while the operating margin improved by about 140 bps. In part, this reflects  Life Tech's high proportion of consumables sales. The addition of the Life Tech  portfolio of products increased the proportion of Thermo Fisher's sales that can  be classified as 'recurring' consumables or services to 62% from 56% before the  acquisition. Sales of consumable products are highly profitable and fairly  predictable, since demand is somewhat less susceptible to the headwinds that are  influencing sales of larger-capital equipment in the life sciences sector.  The realization of cost synergies is also supporting growth in the operating  margin. The company reports that it realized $130 million in cost synergies in  2015, ending the year at its original targeted three-year run-rate. This is  somewhat above the original synergy target of $115 million for 2015. Thermo  Fisher also achieved $90 million of revenue synergies in 2015.  Thermo Fisher expects to deliver an additional $55 million of year-over-year  cost synergy benefits in 2016, as well as a further $60 million of revenue  synergies that would enable Thermo Fisher to achieve its three-year goal of $350  million of total cost and revenue synergies in 2016. AMPLE LIQUIDITY Thermo Fisher's solid financial flexibility and strong liquidity is an important  factor supporting the investment-grade credit profile. At Dec. 31, 2015, Thermo  Fisher's sources of liquidity included $452 million of cash on hand and $1.935  billion of capacity under the $2 billion revolving credit facility. The credit  facility is back-up for the commercial paper (CP) program and if the revolver is  drawn the company intends to leave an available balance at least equal to the  amount of CP outstanding. At Dec. 31, 2015, $50 million of CP was outstanding,  versus no amounts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2014. Cash generation has historically been strong and consistent. Fitch forecasts  that Thermo Fisher will produce at least $3 billion in FCF annually for the next  several years. The company's senior notes debt maturity schedule is laddered,  following recent refinancing of $1.3 billion of 2016 debt.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Thermo Fisher --Long-term IDR and senior notes at 'BBB'; --Bank revolving credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Life Technologies --Long-term IDR and senior notes at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

55,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N) sent a letter to Affymetrix Inc AFFX.O shareholders on Tuesday, reiterating its argument that its $1.3 billion agreement to acquire the U.S. gene-testing company is superior to a bid from Origin Technologies Corp.Thermo Fisher's letter was a response to a letter from Origin to Affymetrix shareholders on Monday, addressing concerns about the credibility of its offer, including uncertainty about its ability to obtain financing and the possibility of lengthy regulatory reviews. The two potential acquirers have exchanged retorts about the viability of Origin's offer since the privately held company proposed to acquire Affymetrix last week. Shareholders of Affymetrix, which makes technologies used for genetic analysis, are scheduled to vote on Thursday on Thermo Fisher's offer of a cash deal valuing Affymetrix at $1.3 billion, or $14 per share. The deal could close this week, subject to shareholder approval. Origin's cash offer is richer than Thermo Fisher's, at $1.5 billion, or $16.10 per share. Origin is a newly created shell company headed by former Affymetrix executives. It says its offer will be financed by SummitView Capital, a Chinese private equity firm. In its letter, Thermo Fisher described Origin's offer as a ""a highly uncertain, vague and speculative non-binding proposal.""Thermo Fisher cited what it considers lingering uncertainties about Orgin's financing plan and the likelihood that the Chinese-backed bid would be subjected to a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  It also noted that the proposal from Origin was subject to due diligence. Origin's letter on Monday sought to assure investors by providing a commitment letter for financing from SummitView.

56,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N) sent a letter to Affymetrix Inc AFFX.O shareholders on Tuesday, reiterating its argument that its $1.3 billion agreement to acquire the U.S. gene-testing company is superior to a bid from Origin Technologies Corp.Thermo Fisher's letter was a response to a letter from Origin to Affymetrix shareholders on Monday, addressing concerns about the credibility of its offer, including uncertainty about its ability to obtain financing and the possibility of lengthy regulatory reviews. The two potential acquirers have exchanged retorts about the viability of Origin's offer since the privately held company proposed to acquire Affymetrix last week. Shareholders of Affymetrix, which makes technologies used for genetic analysis, are scheduled to vote on Thursday on Thermo Fisher's offer of a cash deal valuing Affymetrix at $1.3 billion, or $14 per share. The deal could close this week, subject to shareholder approval. Origin's cash offer is richer than Thermo Fisher's, at $1.5 billion, or $16.10 per share. Origin is a newly created shell company headed by former Affymetrix executives. It says its offer will be financed by SummitView Capital, a Chinese private equity firm. In its letter, Thermo Fisher described Origin's offer as a ""a highly uncertain, vague and speculative non-binding proposal.""Thermo Fisher cited what it considers lingering uncertainties about Orgin's financing plan and the likelihood that the Chinese-backed bid would be subjected to a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  It also noted that the proposal from Origin was subject to due diligence. Origin's letter on Monday sought to assure investors by providing a commitment letter for financing from SummitView. It also said that the due diligence would be ""confirmatory in nature"". The letter affirmed the possibility of a CFIUS review, and said that Origin is ""fully committed to cooperating with CFIUS."" Affymetrix traded as high as around $16 per share after Origin revealed its offer on Friday. Since then, it has traded down to slightly above $14, closer to Thermo Fisher's offer.

57,"   By Ankur Banerjee  Gene sequencing products maker Affymetrix Inc AFFX.O delayed a shareholder voting on its deal to be acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N), saying a raised offer from its former executives could be a superior proposal. Shares of Affymetrix, which postponed the vote to until March 31 from March 24, rose as much as 6.8 percent to $15.35 on Wednesday.Origin Technologies Corp LLC, owned by the group of former executives of Affymetrix, raised its all-cash bid on Tuesday to $17 per share from $16.10 it offered last week.The revised offer values Affymetrix at $1.37 billion, based on 80.5 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 11.Thermo Fisher, the world's largest maker of scientific instruments, agreed in January to buy Affymetrix for $14 per share, a deal that Affymetrix said its board continues to back.  Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said Affymetrix's decision did not come as a surprise, but the tight timeframe to perform due diligence favors Thermo Fisher. ""Origin's new bid and extra timing does increase the likelihood that Thermo Fisher sweetens their offer,"" Muken wrote in a note, adding that Thermo Fisher could raise its offer by 25-50 cents per share. Affymetrix had rejected Origin's initial bid, raising doubts about its ability to fund the deal, including paying a termination fee of $55 million to Thermo Fisher.  Origin has increased the reverse termination fee - the fee an acquirer has to pay the target company if it backs out of a deal - to $100 million from $75 million. Origin has secured committed financing for the deal from SummitView Capital, a Chinese private equity firm.  Thermo Fisher said on Wednesday it was confident that Origin's proposal would not result in a superior proposal and that Origin had still not addressed the ""fundamental flaws"" in its bid.In a letter to Affymetrix shareholders a day earlier, Thermo Fisher also pointed to the possibility of lengthy regulatory reviews for a potential deal with Origin.  Affymetrix shares were up 4.5 percent at $15.01 in afternoon trading. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 56 percent since Jan. 8, when Thermo Fisher announced the deal.

81,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (Thermo Fisher) EUR1.6 billion senior notes  offering. Fitch expects that the proceeds of the issue will be used to finance  the planned acquisition of FEI Company. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $15 billion of debt at June 30, 2016. A full  list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch calculates pro forma gross leverage of around 3.5x when Thermo Fisher  completes its acquisition of FEI Company (FEIC; NASDAQ: FEIC), for $4.2 billion  in cash. Fitch expects gross leverage to return to around 3.0x within 12 months  after the deal is completed in late 2016, a level that we view as consistent  with the 'BBB' rating. --Flexibility at Thermo Fisher's current 'BBB' rating is limited until its  de-levering plan is complete. This should be achievable if near-term targets are  bolt-on acquisitions that augment the company's product portfolio. Larger  transactions during this timeframe would likely require a component of equity  financing to maintain the current rating category. --Fitch views the possibility of aggressive capital management, and not  operating risk, as Thermo Fisher's key credit risk. Capital deployment for  acquisitions and shareholder payments have occasionally contributed to higher  debt levels and deterioration of credit metrics, reducing financial flexibility  in the aftermath of leveraging transactions.  --Thermo Fisher's diversification across customer markets and product categories  helps to mitigate the impact of cyclical downturns or secular headwinds to sales  or profitability in any one of the company's end markets. --Thermo Fisher's ample free cash flow (FCF), which could exceed $3 billion in  2017, should be sufficient to repay debt issued to finance bolt-on acquisitions,  as well as to fund share repurchases of at least $1 billion in 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Thermo Fisher include: --Thermo Fisher's gross debt leverage rises to between 3.5x-3.6x by the end of  2016 but returns closer to 3.0x by year-end 2017, benefitting from debt  repayment and EBITDA growth. --Revenue growth of about 3%-4% over the forecast period. This reflects Fitch's  general expectations for growth in the life sciences sector. Persistent  headwinds in developed industrial markets will be offset by stronger growth in  emerging markets and biopharmaceutical end markets. --The operating EBITDA margin rises slightly through the end of 2018 due to some  continued cost benefits from the integration of Life Tech, as well as a stable  pricing environment. --Cash from operations is more than sufficient to fund a slightly increasing  dividend and greater than $4 billion of bolt-on acquisitions and over $4 billion  of share repurchases over the next three years. --Annual free cash flow (FCF) exceeds $3 billion throughout the forecast period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Thermo Fisher's favorable business profile, with significant scale, good  end-market diversification and improved product mix following the Life Tech  acquisition all support the ratings. Therefore, rating actions are more likely  to be triggered by capital deployment decisions than by an operational stress  scenario. Maintenance of the 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating considers Fitch's continued  expectation that Thermo Fisher will be an active acquirer going forward while  maintaining run-rate gross debt/EBITDA of between 2.8x-3.2x in most periods.  Fitch recognizes that gross leverage may occasionally exceed this range in the  immediate aftermath of leveraging transactions. If Thermo Fisher were to  complete a leveraging transaction that cast doubt on its ability to return  leverage to roughly 3.0x within the following 18-24 months, it could result in a  downgrade. A near-term positive rating action is not anticipated, since it would require a  commitment from the company to maintain leverage below 2.5x. COMMITMENT TO DEBT REDUCTION FOLLOWING ACQUISITIONS In assessing Thermo Fisher's commitment to maintaining a financial profile  consistent with solid investment-grade ratings, Fitch strongly considers the  successful execution of its de-levering plan following its acquisition of Life  Technologies Corp. (Life Tech) for $16.8 billion in 2014. Despite funding a high level of business development activities and returns to  shareholders, Thermo Fisher has a generally strong track record of maintaining  gross leverage within a publicly stated target range of 2.5x-3.0x over most  periods.  LIMITED FLEXIBILITY AT 'BBB' RATING Flexibility at Thermo Fisher's current 'BBB' rating is limited until its  de-levering plan is complete. This should be achievable if most targets in  2016-2017 are similar in size or smaller than FEIC - bolt-on acquisitions that  augment the company's product portfolio. Larger transactions during this  timeframe would require a component of equity financing in order to maintain the  company's credit metrics at levels commensurate with the current rating  category. AMPLE LIQUIDITY Thermo Fisher's solid financial flexibility and strong liquidity is an important  factor supporting the investment-grade credit profile. At June 30, 2016, the  company's sources of liquidity included $663 million of cash on hand and $2.4  billion of capacity under the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). The  RCF is back-up for the commercial paper (CP) program and if the revolver is  drawn the company intends to leave an available balance at least equal to the  amount of CP outstanding; at June 30, 2016, this was $989.4 million. Cash generation has historically been strong and consistent. Fitch forecasts  that Thermo Fisher could produce at least $3 billion in FCF annually for the  next several years. The debt maturity schedule of the company's senior notes is  laddered.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Thermo Fisher as follows: Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. --Long-Term IDR and senior notes 'BBB'; --Bank revolving credit facility 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. Life Technologies Corp. --Long-Term IDR and senior notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
