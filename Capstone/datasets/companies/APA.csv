0,"  * Asset sales to reduce 4th-qtr production by 134,000 boepd* Output slightly decreased in Texas Panhandle and Western Oklahoma* Permian production increased only by about 1,000 boepdJan 16 Oil and gas producer Apache Corp  said severe winter hurt output at its operations in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico in the fourth quarter.Apache did not provide an overall output estimate for the quarter.Mizuho Securities estimated the company's output at 655,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the three months ended Dec. 31.Apache produced 784,000 boepd in the third quarter. The company halted some operations because of storms in late November and early December. Widespread power cuts and icy roads slowed down the resumption of production.Energen Corp, Pioneer Natural Resources Co  and its unit Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners have also said severe weather in the United States hurt production.Pipeline outages and downtime caused by severe weather offset an increase in output in the Permian Region, which spans New Mexico and Texas, Apache said. The company estimated that Permian production increased by about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) during the fourth quarter. Output there had shot up by about 8,400 boepd during the third quarter.Apache said output slightly decreased in the Central Region, comprising Texas Panhandle and Western Oklahoma, but did not give an estimate. Fewer rigs drilling in the region also weighed on output.Mizuho Analysts said they were modeling a 4 percent production growth for the region. Apache said asset sales also hurt fourth-quarter output.The timing of the company's stake sale in Egypt was largely responsible for the 6 percent drop in Mizuho's estimate for Apache's fourth-quarter production.Apache sold a 33 percent stake in its Egypt oil and gas business to Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp for $3.1 billion.Besides, the deal in Egypt, Apache expects the divestment of its Gulf of Mexico shelf operations and the sale of some Canadian assets to reduce quarterly production by 134,000 boepd from the third quarter.Apache shares were up 1.4 percent at $85.65 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon.",2014-01-16,APA,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 1:15pm EST",UPDATE 2-Apache Corp says severe weather hurt U.S. output,http://www.reuters.com//article/apache-production-idUSL3N0KQ40O20140116?type=companyNews

2,"  HOUSTON/BUENOS AIRES Feb 12 U.S. oil and gas company Apache Corp on Wednesday said it sold all of its operations in Argentina to state-controlled energy company YPF  for $800 million cash, part of a plan to shed less profitable properties.Apache, which also has oil and gas operations in Egypt, Australia and the North Sea, announced plans in May to sell assets to cut debt and shore up its balance sheet and share price through buybacks.So far in the last two quarters, the Houston company said it has collected $7 billion in cash from asset sales that included its shallow Gulf of Mexico holdings.Reuters reported in November that the YPF deal, which is expected to close in 30 days, was being negotiated. The government of President Cristina Fernandez, who has at times rattled investors, nationalized YPF in 2012 by seizing Repsol of Spain's majority stake in the company.Apache has stakes in about 25 fields in Argentina, including the giant Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas field. Other global oil companies with rights to the Vaca Muerta include Chevron Corp .The formation, in the southern Patagonia region, has 661 billion barrels of oil and 1,181 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources, according to YPF. At the end of 2013, Apache had estimated reserves in the country of approximately 540 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent. Last year, Apache's production from Argentina averaged 256 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day.Assets in Argentina were responsible for around 6 percent of the company's production in 2012 and 3 percent of its proved reserves. The company is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. YPF paid a $50 million deposit on the deal, which also includes the assumption of $52 million in back debt.A U.S. Department of Energy report has shown Argentina holds 802 trillion cubic feet of commercially viable natural gas resources trapped in shale rock and 27 billion barrels of oil, the bulk of it located in Vaca Muerta.That would make Argentina the second largest holder of shale gas reserves after China and No. 4 in shale oil.Argentina is counting on Vaca Muerta to recover the energy self-sufficiency it lost a decade ago.

The company said its net profit fell to $174 million, or 43 cents per share per share in the fourth quarter, from $649 million, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier.Adjusted earnings were $1.57 per share. Revenue fell 19 percent to $3.57 billion.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.79, on revenue of $3.67 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apache said on Wednesday that it agreed to sell all of its operations in Argentina to state-controlled energy company YPF for $800 million.  The sale is part of a company plan to cut its debt and focus drilling in higher growth areas, like shale formations in the Permian Basin in West Texas.Production from Apache's operations in the Permian Basin and Central U.S. regions accounted for a third of the company's global output in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.Total output averaged 688,000 barrels oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, much lower than last year's 800,005 boepd. Apache, which also operates in Egypt, Australia and the North Sea, had set an asset sale target of $4 billion for 2013, but has generated $7 billion in the last two quarters alone.""We've largely accomplished what we set out to do which is to make our North American regions a centerpiece of our growth strategy,"" Steve Farris, Apache's Chief Executive Officer told investors on a conference call, noting that ""the heavy lifting"" was behind it.Following the Argentina deal, which Farris said took ""months and months and months"" to negotiate, Apache does not plan any more large divestitures.""Management continues to make the right strategic moves by refocusing portfolio and directing capital to highest rate of return assets,"" analysts at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co wrote in a research note to clients.Apache's shares last traded down 56 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $80.72 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The NOC spokesman said protests at Al Wafa had been lifted, but the protest at the El Sharara pipeline continued. He did not give a breakdown of production by field.The NOC had given Libya's oil output on Sunday as 390,000 bpd, some 70,000 bpd less than during the preceding week.  Armed protesters, former rebels and tribes often target Libya's oil infrastructure as a way to make demands on its weak central government, three years after the civil war that ousted Muammar Gaddafi.Before the 2011 conflict broke out production was around 1.6 million bpd with exports of around 1.25 million bpd.

17,"  (Repeats with no changes)By Ross KerberNEW YORK, April 17 Steve Farris runs a $33 billion Texas oil and gas company and turns, for advice, to a bearded Vermont environmentalist.As other energy firms battled climate change and anti-pollution activists in recent years, the Apache Corp  chief executive instead built an alliance with Steven Heim, managing director of Boston Common Asset Management, one of the better-known socially responsible investment firms.The relationship helped Apache sidestep time-consuming proxy fights that have plagued some of its peers, in exchange for changes like committing to protect the rights of native peoples living near remote gas projects, and using cleaner chemicals in hydraulic fracturing, a drilling method that environmentalists say could threaten groundwater.Heim also stages investor meetings for Apache where its executives and engineers take questions on topics like pollution or human rights. These draw representatives from mainstream investment firms like T. Rowe Price, Gabelli & Co and Morgan Stanley & Co.""What I've been trying to do is to elevate the level of understanding of issues by the investors, not just the executives,"" Heim said.Others have taken notice as climate change becomes more of a business concern. ConocoPhillips now also consults Heim, for instance, while Chevron Corp Chief Governance Officer Lydia Beebe said it has sent representatives to the Apache meetings and staged similar ones of its own.""The 'Apache Model' is a very appropriate one for constructive shareholder/company engagement,"" Brian Rice, a portfolio manager for the California State Teachers' Retirement System, said in an e-mail. Peace with environmentalists has helped take some pressure off Apache, whose share price has lagged rivals' on concerns like the security of some of its overseas projects, including a large investment in politically chaotic Egypt.Proxymonitor.org shows Apache has not faced any shareholder proxy proposals on environmental issues since 2006. Larger rivals like Exxon Mobil Corp have faced dozens, as have smaller ones like EOG Resources Inc, which has faced three.Apache's Farris said the relationship with Heim helps the company connect with shareholders who increasingly expect transparency. ""Shareholders own the company, they have a right to their opinion,"" Farris said.Apache Senior Vice President Sarah Teslik said that while Apache does not aim its outreach to pre-empt proposals, ""we hope it obviates the need for most of them."" BUILDING BRIDGES Boston Common owns only about 75,000 shares of Apache, a slight number relative to its influence. Other environmental activists say they too have gotten a better reception lately as  companies want to at least appear responsive.Just last month for instance, Exxon Mobil reported on risks it could face from climate change and Southern Co said it would report on its renewable energy projects, in both cases following deals with activists. ""You can't be a climate-change denier any more,"" said Andrew Behar, chief executive of As You Sow, a California foundation that has negotiated with both companies.""Shareholder Engagement"" has become a cliche as executives  cultivate investor ties and defend against wealthy activists like Third Point LLC's Daniel Loeb or Pershing Square Capital Management's William Ackman. But where those managers run their own candidates for corporate boards, activists like Boston Common and As You Sow get leverage by sponsoring shareholder resolutions.Heim, who splits his time between Boston and Montpelier, Vermont, estimates his firm files about five such proxy proposals a year. One in 2013 called on PNC Financial Services Group to report on the emissions impact of its lending.Some question the resolutions. In a March 27 speech Daniel Gallagher, a Republican member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, suggested making it harder to get some resolutions onto ballots. He cited Boston Common's PNC item and said it was ""dubious"" it was worth a vote.At least in the energy sector, however, big investors are paying more attention to climate topics. David Smith, portfolio manager for Gabelli & Co said the threat of new regulations also drives companies to embrace climate concerns. ""This is something they want to get ahead of,"" Smith said.Others worry partnerships such as the one between Apache and Heim do not push far enough to bring real change. ""Like apartheid, climate change doesn't yield to incremental tiny steps,"" said Bill McKibben, president of 350.org, known for protests against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.Told of the critique, Heim cited other changes his firm has  won like deals with pipeline companies to report on gas leaks and getting solar panel makers to cut waste.

25,"  (Adds details of project, CEO comments, share price)June 4 TransCanada Corp said on Wednesday it has agreed to build a C$1.9 billion ($1.74 billion) natural gas pipeline to supply a liquefied natural gas project on British Columbia's Northern Pacific coast planned by Chevron Corp and Apache CorpTransCanada, the country's No. 2 pipeline company, said the planned Merrick pipeline project will take 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Dawson Creek, British Columbia, to Summit Lake, B.C., a distance of 260 kilometers (161 miles). There, it will meet the Pacific Trail Pipeline planned by the two partners backing the LNG project. The proposed line is the fourth in the works by TransCanada to supply northern British Columbia's nascent natural gas industry, which plans to liquefy the abundant shale-gas reserves in the province's north for export to high-paying markets in Asia and elsewhere. None of the handful of planned projects have received final approval from their backers.TransCanada said the line, which is conditional on Chevron and Apache proceeding with their LNG project at Kitimat, B.C., could be in service in early 2020, provided it receives timely regulatory approvals.

28,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON U.S. oil and gas company Apache Corp told Reuters it is looking at ways to wring more cash out of its valuable mineral rights, as it and other energy companies face investor pressure to tap more profits from the North American shale boom.Apache did not detail the options it is mulling, but two recent successful mineral rights offerings could provide a model.Viper Energy Partners LP and Canada's Prairie Sky Royalty Ltd this year have bundled the royalties generated by their mineral rights into subsidiaries and then listed them in public offerings.""We continually review our mineral interest position to determine the best course of action for maximizing value,"" Apache spokesman Bill Mintz said in response to a Reuters query.""Depending on the location of the acreage and activity in the area, we may look at options to unlock value from our mineral interests when it makes sense to do so.""Mineral rights are especially valuable because they entitle owners to a share of the profits from oil and gas wells, and owners are not required to pay for any of the operating or capital costs.So Apache profits by collecting royalties when others drill on its so-called fee-acreage, a factor that greatly enhances its returns.ACTIVIST INVESTOR  Apache has been selling assets like Gulf of Mexico offshore oil properties that would be expensive to develop, raising funds to spend on less-expensive shale drilling. Pressure on the company to accelerate that process has ramped up.One activist investor, Jana Partners LLC, disclosed in its second-quarter update in June that it has a $1 billion stake in the Apache.Jana has urged the company to exit its liquefied natural gas projects (LNG) in Canada and Australia and focus on drilling onshore in the United States.Besides Apache, Anadarko Petroleum Corp said last week the $675 million a year in royalty revenue it gets from some 8 million acres in the western United States provides ""future options for additional value acceleration."" That statement helped push Anadarko's shares up more than 4 percent. Energy investment bank Simmons & Co implies a valuation of up to $13.5 billion for Anadarko's mineral rights.There is ""strong market appetite,"" for royalty interests that offer growth potential,"" according to analysts at Credit Suisse.  Apache did not detail revenue from royalties, but it has extensive acreage.In Louisiana, Apache has about 275,000 net fee acres. In the Permian of Texas, it also has about 405,000 net fee acres  acquired from BP Plc in 2010.  REWARD NOW, RISK LATER? Mineral rights securities carry risk – a drop in oil prices would quickly erode returns. But with interest rates still hovering around historic lows and crude oil trading around $100 a barrel, investor appetite remains high.Parent Encana Corp raised $1.35 billion with its IPO of PrairieSky in late May. Units in Viper opened at $31.50 on the June 18 market debut, up 21 percent from its initial public offering price of $26 per unit.Viper holds mineral interests in the Permian Basin that Diamondback acquired for $440 million in September 2013. Viper's current market capitalization is $2.56 billion.Both the Viper and PrairieSky deals were innovative and, according to analysts, marked what could be the next chapter in energy finance.They borrowed a page from royalty trusts that have been around for decades and master limited partnerships (MLPs), which U.S. energy companies have feverishly set up in recent years because they pay no corporate taxes if they distribute most of their profits to investors.

31,"  (Adds detail from conference call)By Anna DriverHOUSTON, July 31 U.S. oil and gas company Apache Corp, under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners, said on Thursday it plans to sell interests in two liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects as it sharpens the focus on developing North American shale fields.The move, a significant pullback from the LNG market, relieved investors worried about the potential project costs. Apache shares rose to their highest level in more than two years.Apache reported that profits fell in the second quarter, but still topped expectations.Apache said it intends to completely exit LNG projects - in which it partners with Chevron Corp - in Wheatstone in Australia and Kitimat in Canada. Apache is also evaluating its international assets for a potential spinoff to shareholders, outright sale or other options, Chief Executive Officer Steve Farris told analysts on a conference call.""In our opinion, it makes sense that we reduce the size of our international assets,"" Farris said, noting that the company's North American and international units ""are two different businesses.""Jana, which disclosed in June it had a $1 billion stake in Apache, has urged the Houston-based company to exit the Canadian and Australian projects and focus on drilling onshore in the United States.Over the last year, Apache has sold $10 billion worth of assets to focus its drilling on more profitable and predictable shale oil wells in places like the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford in South Texas. ""Apache is really trying to focus on domestic oil production,"" said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ""The question is, For a company the size of Apache, do they need to be involved in big legacy LNG projects that need a lot of cash upfront?""The $15 billion Kitimat LNG project in British Columbia is the most advanced of the dozen or more LNG plants that have been proposed for Canada's Pacific coast, though rival projects by Malaysia's Petronas and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  are gaining ground.Originally proposed as a regasification facility for LNG imports, the Kitimat site has environmental approvals in hand. Early construction has begun, and plans for a pipeline from northern British Columbia's shale-gas fields to the facility are well under way and face limited opposition from Aboriginal groups.For companies that want to supply the Asian market, taking a stake in the Kitimat facility could speed those plans. CHEVRON TO DISCUSS KITIMAT Still, Kitimat has yet to get a final investment decision from Chevron and has been under review since the company bought into the project alongside Apache in December 2012.It also needs to finalize LNG sales agreements. Chevron has said publicly it was concerned about costs, given Kitimat's location in a remote part of British Columbia.Chevron said in a statement that it will discuss its view of the project when it reports earnings on Friday. Previously, the San Ramon, California-based company has said that it has no interest in becoming sole owner in the Kitimat project, or even increasing its stake beyond 50 percent.One source involved in LNG trade said Kitimat is struggling.Apache's Farris said his company's exit from the project will not affect its valuation.""Frankly, Chevron and Apache are way ahead of anyone else in that arena,"" Farris said.Apache reported second-quarter profit fell to $505 million, or $1.31 per share, from $1.02 billion, or $2.54, in the same period a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, Apache posted a profit of $1.67 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.65, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Apache shares rose $1.00, or 1 percent, to $102.29 in afternoon trade.

53,"  CAIRO Dec 17 Egypt has signed its first contract to extract gas by fracking in a deal with Apache and Shell Egypt that includes investments of $30-$40 million, the oil ministry said on Wednesday, part of efforts to boost output and ease a lingering energy crunch.""The project will require horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which is the same as the shale gas production method used in the United States,"" the oil ministry statement said.The ministry said in a statement that the deal to drill three wells in the Abu al-Ghardeeq region of the Western Desert, about 200 km west of Cairo, was Egypt's first contract for the production of unconventional gas.The head of Egypt's state oil company (EGPC) signed the deal with a senior executive of Houston-based Apache Corporation  and the chairman of Shell Egypt, a subsidiary of Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell. Shale gas extraction is more expensive than traditional drilling and generally requires high energy prices to make it economically feasible. Global oil prices are at 5-1/2-year lows, with benchmark Brent crude futures under $60 a barrel. A source at the petroleum ministry told Reuters that unconventional gas extraction in the Western Desert will require the operators to drill to depths of 14,000 feet.The deal comes as Egypt is seeking new sources of energy to cope with its worst energy crisis in decades, caused by declining gas production and rising consumption. Egypt reached an agreement with Norway's Hoegh LNG  in November for a long-delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal to be installed at the end of March, in time to receive cargoes before power demand peaks in summer.It is also seeking a second floating LNG import terminal to boost its import capacity.

62,"  * Half of the assets on sale are in North America* North Sea could prove a hard sell* Potential buyers holding out for further price falls* Wave of deals expected within three to six monthsBy Ron BoussoLONDON, Jan 30 With more than $110 billion of oil and gas assets on the block as companies big and small count the cost of the collapse in oil prices, it is now a question of who will blink first to set the M&A scramble in motion.Energy groups with spare cash, venture capital funds and multinational and state oil companies are eyeing assets with valuations that have largely tracked the halving of the oil price to less than $50 a barrel since last June.But with the exception of a few recent moves, including Repsol's $3 billion acquisition of Talisman Energy , buyers have largely stayed on the sidelines.""Deals have just about dried up because you're catching a falling knife,"" said Simon Henry, chief financial officer at Royal Dutch Shell.Though it hopes to sell assets worth $5 billion to $6 billion this year, Shell is not ruling out purchases of others that will increase its production base, Henry said.Diverging views on when oil prices will recover leave plenty of potential for disagreement over the value of producing assets.""If you end up paying at $50 (per barrel) plus a $30 premium and the oil price stays at $40 for three years you look a fool, or vice-versa,"" Henry said. Strength in refining and trading and low debt mean Shell appears more able than some rivals to cover dividends from operating cash flow.The entire industry is in the midst of spending cuts to ensure shareholders get their pay-outs. Those savings will take time to kick in but, even in the short term, bank borrowing will help avoid hasty sales of assets.The waiting game will continue for a little while yet, says Rupert Newall, BMO Capital Markets' co-head of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.""We are going to need another three months of these prices before sellers will become more realistic about the price environment they are selling into today,"" Newall said.DISTRESSED ASSETS  But as companies become ""more desperate"", as Shell's Henry puts it, and the divergence between valuations narrows, mergers and acquisitions are expected to flow.""That will be driven in large part by financing challenges where there is a lot of debt rollover,"" Henry said, adding that  such pressure could be most keenly felt with smaller and medium-sized operations in North America but also some of the smaller European companies.While private equity funds aim to buy distressed assets that they expect to flourish once the oil price stages its eventual recovery and majors look to expand production on the cheap, Asian national oil companies are expected to chase global capacity to secure supplies for their energy-hungry economies.Potential buyers include Asian state-run companies such as Chinese oil champions CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC, as well as Indian and Japanese companies.Based on company filings and announcements compiled by oil and gas consultancy 1Derrick, assets worth about $112 billion dollars are being offered for sale.Half of these are North American, mostly U.S. oil and gas shale fields such as Anadarko's Wyoming field and Reliance Industries' Eagle Ford assets, as well as ConocoPhillips' oil-sands operations in Canada. Outside North America, Russian oil giant Rosneft  is offering its non-core operations while Apache has mainly Egyptian assets for sale.A total of 22 asset packages valued at about $16.6 billion were put up for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with 56 worth $41.1 billion in the previous nine months, says 1Derrick analyst Mangesh Hirve.NORTH SEA PROFIT SQUEEZE Similarly to Shell, BP is another oil major that has said it would consider acquisitions even as it sheds operations in higher-risk, higher-cost regions such as Nigeria and Iraq.""The area where we believe there is going to be less interest is in the North Sea, which is a mature, high-costs oil province,"" HSBC said.Top players in the North Sea, including Total, BG Group and ConocoPhillips, are all trying to sell assets in the region, 1Derrick says, and the chief executive of French group Total  said at the World Economic Forum last week that the company would be investing less in mature fields to focus on assets with potential for higher returns.A host of small operators could also try to sell North Sea assets as profit margins are increasingly squeezed.""In the North Sea, we have a proliferation of relatively small companies; very few move the needle for fund managers,"" said Jon Fitzpatrick, head of Macquarie Capital's oil and gas team.With so much on offer around the world, it looks unlikely that investors such as Carlyle International Energy Partners will jump the gun.As its managing director Marcel Van Poecke said this month: ""After a crash like this, there is clearly more upside than downside. This will be a great time to invest, but there is no need to rush into it.""

63,"  Feb 2 A unit of the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank, a multilateral lending institution, has provided $80 million worth of sharia-compliant reinsurance to cover political risk for oil and gas projects in Egypt.Such credit guarantees by reinsurers like the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment & Export Credit (ICIEC) are gaining traction and attracting a wider range of firms to the Islamic capital markets.The deal covers the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  for its own insurance policy on the exploration projects of Houston-based Apache Corporation, ICIEC said in a statement on Sunday. The announcement comes as Egypt is seeking new sources of energy to cope with its worst energy crisis in decades, caused by declining gas production and rising consumption.The policy would allow the country to retain foreign direct investment during a ""critical transtional period"", said Hani Salem Sonbol, ICIEC's acting chief executive. Apache is the largest U.S. investor in Egypt and the largest producer of natural gas in the Western Desert, where it has been granted several concessions by the government. In December, Apache and Shell Egypt signed the first fracking contract in the country, a process that involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into a well to extract more oil or gas.The firm maintains about $1 billion worth of political risk coverage for nationalization, expropriation and currency inconvertibility. In 2011, some of that cover expired without being renewed in the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings.

64,"   By Anna Driver  Apache Corp (APA.N), one of the top U.S. shale oil producers, said on Thursday it would slash capital expenditures and its rig count in 2015, in response to the collapse of crude oil prices.The company, which reported a multibillion-dollar net loss but adjusted earnings that beat Wall Street's estimates, also said it would not divest its overseas businesses, with one possible exception.

70,"  (Adds details on production outlook)By Anna DriverFeb 12 Apache Corp, one of the top U.S. shale oil producers, said on Thursday it would slash capital expenditures and its rig count in 2015 as the collapse of crude oil prices prompts it to slow drilling, keeping output growth mostly flat.The company, which reported a multibillion-dollar net loss but adjusted earnings that beat Wall Street's estimates, also said it would not divest its overseas businesses, with one possible exception.Crude oil prices , down about 50 percent since June, prompted Apache to cut its 2015 capital expenditures by 60 percent and slash its fleet of drilling rigs by 70 percent.On a conference call with investors, Chief Executive Officer John Christmann also said the company is setting aide plans to sell or spin off its Egyptian and North Sea businesses, as they generate much-needed cash. ""Clearly in this price environment it would not make sense to monetize them and they complement things very nicely so at this point, there are no plans to sell or spin them,"" said Christmann.However, Apache is exploring a possible sale of its offshore oil assets in Australia, he said.The Houston-based company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $4.8 billion, or $12.78 per share, compared with a year-ago profit of $174 million, or 44 cents per share. Excluding $5.2 billion in charges mostly related to write-downs on the value of assets, Apache earned $1.07 a share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected a profit of 76 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Apache's total output of 673,000 barrels oil equivalent per day (boepd) topped estimates by 4 percent, according to analysts at Baird. Apache, which initially planned to spin off or sell its international operations to focus on onshore shale oil wells, said its North American liquids production rose 5 percent.It said 2015 onshore North American production would be relatively flat from last year's rate of about 302,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as adjusted for asset sales.The company said its rig count will be reduced to 27 rigs at the end of this month from an average of 91 rigs in the third quarter of 2014.Capital expenditures are expected to be around $3.8 billion this year, down 60 percent from 2014, said Christmann.Shares of Apache fell 17 cents, or 0.26 percent, to $64.58 on Thursday, after trading as high as $67.56 earlier in the day.

71,"  (Adds details from the statement and background)April 8 U.S. oil and gas company Apache Corp  said it would exit its exploration and production business in Australia by selling its unit in the country to a consortium of private equity funds for $2.1 billion in cash.The sale of Apache Energy Ltd to a consortium of funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Ltd and Brookfield Asset Management Inc has an effective date of Oct. 1, 2014, Apache said.Apache, one of the top U.S. shale oil producers, had said it was exploring a sale of its offshore oil assets in Australia to focus more on domestic shale drilling as well its operations in Egypt and the United Kingdom's North Sea.""Following the sale of our Australian assets, about 70 percent of Apache's production will come from North America onshore,"" Chief Executive John Christmann said on Wednesday. The Australian unit, Apache Energy Ltd, averaged production of about 49,000 barrels oil equivalent per day (boepd) in March. That compares with Apache's total output of 673,000 boepd in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.A slump in oil prices has spurred activity among private equity investors who are hoping to scoop up attractive assets on the cheap. Buyout group's poured $31 billion into the oil and gas sector in 2014, clearly outstripping the $8 billion in investments that sponsors have invested in the sector over the five prior years, according to Thomson Reuters data.Apache said the sale of its Australian assets is expected to close in mid-2015, but it will have some presence in the country through its 49 percent ownership interest in fertilizer producer Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Ltd. Houston-based Apache in December sold its stake in two liquefied natural gas projects, Wheatstone LNG in Australia and Kitimat LNG in Canada, to Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd  for $2.75 billion.Apache in February cut its 2015 capital expenditures by 60 percent and slashed its drilling fleet by 70 percent, mirroring steps taken by several oil and gas companies due to a decline in global crude prices.Apache's shares have risen about 4 percent this year through its close of $65.25 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

73,"  HOUSTON The Texas House overwhelmingly approved a bill on Friday that would give the state the exclusive right to regulate the oil and gas industry, and gut the power of municipalities to pass anti-fracking rules.In Texas, the top U.S. crude producer and the birthplace of fracking, the bill also needs to be passed by the state's Senate and signed by the governor before it becomes law.State lawmakers have been under pressure to halt an incipient anti-fracking movement since November, when voters in the town of Denton voted to outlaw the oil and gas extraction technique behind the U.S. energy boom. In fracking, a mixture of pressurized water, sand and chemicals is used to unlock oil and natural gas from rock. Operators say it is safe, but many environmental groups oppose the practice - calling it wasteful, polluting, dirty and noisy. Fracking was pioneered at the Barnett shale formation, where Denton is located. Exxon Mobil Corp's XTO unit honed its shale expertise in the natural gas-rich Barnett. Most of the crude output in Texas comes, however, from the growing Eagle Ford and Permian fields to the south and west.

75,"  (Adds quotes, details)By Anna DriverMay 7 Apache Corp reported a quarterly loss on Thursday as low commodity prices took a toll, but a recent rally in crude has the U.S. oil and gas company preparing for a rebound.Crude oil prices fell by more than half from a June peak over $100 a barrel. In response, the Houston-based company slashed spending 60 percent and drastically cut its rig count.Those actions have left the company in good shape to spring to action as crude prices move higher. Crude is trading in New York around $60 a barrel up from lows of around $42 in recent months.Apache, which drills in North American shale fields in Texas as well as in the Egyptian desert and the North Sea, plans to monitor oil prices and will reconsider its 2015 drilling plans at mid-year. ""Should oil prices stabilize at these higher levels, and cash flow increase accordingly, we are well-positioned to ramp up the drilling program in an efficient and cost-effective manner,"" Apache Chief Executive Officer John Christmann said on a conference call.Crude oil around $65 a barrel is enough to invest in new drilling in the Canyon Lime and Eagle Ford fields in Texas, he said, adding that any new wells would have to compete for capital with other projects.Harold Hamm, the chief executive officer of Bakken operator Continental Resources Inc, told investors on a Thursday conference call that oil at $70 a barrel ""turns it on for us,"" in response to a question about at what price rigs would go back to work. WRITEDOWN  Earlier, Apache reported a first-quarter loss of $4.7 billion, or $12.34 per share, compared with a profit of $236 million, or 60 cents per share in the same period a year earlier.Excluding one-time items such as a nearly $5 billion asset impairment writedown, mostly for the United States, Canada and North Sea, Apache had a loss of 37 cents per share.Analysts, on average, expected a steeper loss of 57 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Oil and gas output fell 6 percent from a year ago to 601,000 barrels oil equivalent per day.Apache left its North American capital spending forecast unchanged at $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.

He also indicated the company, one of the top U.S. independents, wanted to go it alone.  On Monday, analysts at Simmons & Co told clients that they believed top takeover candidates for Houston-based Apache would be either world's largest public oil company Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) or BP Plc (BP.N). ""While some might be surprised regarding BP, keep in mind that Apache bought a large amount of assets from BP in the Permian, Canada and Egypt,"" following BP's Macondo well blowout, Simmons wrote. ""In addition, BP still currently holds a large position in Egypt.""The analysts noted, however that the ""object of affection for any acquirer is Apache's Permian position,"" consisting of more than 3 million acres.

""Our target is for net debt at the end of 2016 to be unchanged or lower than it was at the end of 2015.” The Houston-based independent reported a quarterly loss on Thursday that, while wider than a year ago, was smaller than analysts' expectations thanks to sharply lower costs.The net loss attributable to Apache's common shareholders widened to $7.21 billion, or $19.07 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $4.81 billion, or $12.78 per share, a year earlier. Excluding writedowns and impairment charges of $5.9 billion, the company had a loss of 6 cents a share, much smaller than the average analyst estimate of 48 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue more than halved to $1.26 billion.     During the year, the company completed $6.2 billion of asset sales, mainly for LNG stakes, and reduced its debt load by $3.2 billion.Apache said it has no debt due this year or next year, and only $700 million maturing through 2020. The company's undrawn $3.5 billion revolving loan was extended to June 2020.

112,"   By Luc Cohen | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Apache Corp's cost savings in the first three months of 2016 exceeded its own expectations and are likely to continue even if oilfield services costs rise, executives of the Houston-based oil and gas producer said on Thursday. The cost cuts mean the company could achieve its goal of cash flow neutrality for 2016 with oil prices at $35 per barrel and natural gas prices at $2.35 per million British thermal units, Chief Executive John Christmann told investors on a conference call to discuss first quarter results.The surprise savings come despite concerns that U.S. shale companies might have hit a wall in cost or productivity improvements, and are the latest sign that cost reductions could allow U.S. shale producers to keep drilling and pumping even if prices fail to recover significantly from a nearly two-year rout. ""Six quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter on quarter cost improvements,"" Christmann said, noting that well cost reduction efforts ""continued to exceed our expectations.""  He said these cost reductions ""are more than belt-tightening efforts in response to the downturn.""U.S. oil prices have fallen 60 percent since mid-2014 amid a global glut, but have rebounded since falling to nearly $26 per barrel in February, ending Thursday at about $44 a barrel. Natural gas futures settled at $2.08. Christmann acknowledged skepticism around the sustainability of the company's cost-cutting hopes, particularly if demand for oilfield services rebounds, but said Apache's structural changes would help its bottom line ""regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future."" Overall, the company's well costs in key North American onshore plays were 45 percent below 2014 levels, with oilfield with service cost savings making up half the decline and design and efficiency savings making up the other half.  Chief Financial Officer Steve Riney noted that capital costs in North American regions for the quarter were lower than the company had budgeted for, led by savings in the Permian basin.
