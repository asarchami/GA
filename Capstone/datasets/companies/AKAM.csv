0,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a patent case involving technology for managing web images and video that features Limelight Networks Ltd and Akamai Technologies and which has been closely followed by much of the high-tech world for years.The nation's top court also said it would hear a second patent case, Nautilus, Inc v Biosig Instruments, Inc., that centers on heart-rate monitor technology.In the original case, dating back to 2006, Akamai accused Limelight of infringing on its patented technology for managing Web images and video.The case has wound its way through the court system since then. Limelight objected to a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which had said that in the case of software and other so-called ""method patents,"" two companies - for example, a manufacturer and a user - can jointly infringe on a patent.Major technology companies including Google, Cisco, Oracle, Red Hat, SAP America filed a brief in support of Limelight, saying the earlier ruling could make tech companies subject to more infringement lawsuits. ""I certainly think that Limelight will be reversed,"" said patent expert Hal Wegner of the law firm Foley and Lardner LLP. ""I'm sure the big software companies are delighted"" that the Supreme Court will hear the case.Akamai Technologies had asked the court to decline to hear the Limelight case, and filed a separate appeal.The Supreme Court did not indicate if it would take the Akamai appeal. Nor did it say whether it would hear three other patent cases of interest: Sovereign v. Newegg; Power Integrations v. Fairchild Semiconductor; and Organic Seed v Monsanto. In the long-running heart rate monitor case, Biosig had sued Nautilus in 2004, saying that Nautilus infringed its patent for a heart rate monitor that a user grips while using exercise equipment.A district court had said that the patent was invalid because of ""indefiniteness,"" which basically means it was not clear. The Federal Circuit said it was clear and that the patent was valid. The case is of interest since patentees tend to draft what a patent can do as vaguely as possible so that the issued patent will be as broad as possible. In this case, the Federal Circuit had said that the patent language was appropriately definite.The first case at the U.S. Supreme Court is Limelight Networks, Inc v. Akamai Technologies.

4,"  (Adds comment from security expert, detail on Akamai connection)By Jim Finkle and Ross KerberBOSTON, April 16 American Funds, the No. 3 U.S. mutual fund family, advised some customers to change user names and passwords on Wednesday as the number of companies and people affected by the notorious ""Heartbleed"" bug grows.The company sent emails to some 825,000 clients, saying they had been exposed to ""a very narrow window of risk"" related to ""Heartbleed,"" which has been described as the biggest computer security threat since the mass adoption of the Internet.American Funds also advised customers who logged into Americanfunds.com from Dec. 12, 2013 to April 14 to create new security questions and delete their browsing history.Heartbleed refers to a security bug in software known as OpenSSL used in about two-thirds of all websites and many other technology products. Hackers have created malicious software that exploits the bug, allowing them to attack vulnerable websites and steal data.Dan Guido, chief executive of cybersecurity startup Trail of Bits, said more warnings are likely because no company will want to be remiss in trying to protect customers. ""I expect to see a lot more of this,"" Guido said.On Tuesday, Canada's Tax authority became the first major organization to report an attack related to Heartbleed, and more are expected. Canadian police on Wednesday charged a 19-year-old man in connection with exploiting the bug to steal taxpayer data.American funds spokesman Chuck Freadhoff said his firm does not believe it has been breached and issued the notice ""out of an abundance of caution"" after learning that a vendor had been affected by Heartbleed. He did not identify that vendor. ""It would be almost impossible to access a shareholder's account and transact, given the multiple layers of security within the American Funds system,"" he said.AKAMAI CONNECTION  OpenSSL software helps encrypt traffic with digital certificates and ""keys"" that keep information secure while in transit over the Internet. Heartbleed went undetected for several years, so experts believe hackers have likely stolen some certificates and keys, leaving data vulnerable.American Funds decision to alert customers may be related to a move by Akamai Technologies Inc to replace the digital security keys of its customers.The Americanfunds.com site is routed through Akamai, one of the biggest providers of services for distributing and securing websites, said John Bumgarner, chief technology officer with the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit. He reviewed the digital SSL certificate embedded on the fund company's website.Akamai had said on Monday that it was replacing SSL certificates of its customers out of concern that those keys may have been compromised before the bug had been discovered.""Anything could have happened,"" Akamai Chief Security Officer Andy Ellis said when asked on Monday about the impact of exposure to Heartbleed on SSL customers. ""There is a lot going on here. This is a 'can of worms' question.""Both Akamai and American Funds declined to say whether SSL keys for American Funds have been replaced.

5,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared unsure how to proceed in a dispute over whether Limelight Networks Inc infringed upon patented technology for managing Web images and video held by Akamai Technologies Inc.The nine justices are weighing whether a company can be held liable for inducing patent infringement when the final step that leads to infringement is carried out by a third party.But during much of a one-hour-long argument, the justices focused less on the legal issue and more on concerns about whether the high court should issue its ruling without first asking a lower court to take a second look at the case.The justices are reviewing an August 2012 ruling by a divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Akamai's favor, which effectively made it easier to prove that a company is liable based on the induced infringement theory.But as several justices noted on Wednesday, the appeals court did not decide the question of whether direct infringement had occurred before ruling that there was induced infringement. Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Elena Kagan both raised concerns that a Supreme Court ruling on the induced infringement question would be rendered largely meaningless unless the direct infringement issue was resolved.""I can't think of a way our decision ... would be relevant for any case,"" Kagan said. Likewise, Justice Stephen Breyer said he was ""worried about setting forth any rule"" without being more informed on the subject.Various other companies, including Google Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and Oracle Corp, joined briefs backing Limelight.

A spokesman Massachusetts-based for Akamai said in a statement that the company was pleased with the decision and hoped to be ""sufficiently compensated for Limelight’s infringement.”  Technology companies have closely followed the case, which was on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court.

A divided Federal Circuit ruled for Akamai in 2012.  Limelight petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case, supported by companies such as Google Inc and Cisco Systems Inc, saying the ruling could prompt more infringement lawsuits.The high court overturned the decision in June 2014, saying a defendant is not liable for inducing infringement when not a single party directly infringed a patent. In May, a Federal Circuit panel said Limelight did not infringe and that if Limelight could be found jointly liable with its downstream users, innocent customers doing as little as swiping a debit card could be targeted by predatory patent suits.The appeals court on Thursday voided that ruling and reinstated the jury verdict because the evidence showed that ""Limelight directs or controls its customers’ performance of each remaining method step, such that all steps of the method are attributable to Limelight.""The case is Akamai Technologies, Inc et al. v.
