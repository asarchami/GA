Woodford's new venture got off to an auspicious start with asset management firm St James's Place announcing last month that it was ending 7.7 billion pounds ($13.06 billion) worth of investment mandates with Invesco Perpetual and would allocate nearly half of that to Woodford. The new fund will continue to use Woodford's signature investment style, focusing on companies offering ""sustained dividend growth"", the company said.""I will run this new fund in the same way that I have always run money, adopting the same philosophy and the same long-term approach,"" 54-year-old Woodford said. ""My passion and energy have never been stronger."" Woodford is one of Britain's best-known stock pickers who added to an already strong reputation by weathering the 2008-09 financial crisis, during which his funds still made money.The company said it no longer had an ""operational relationship"" with Oakley Capital. In December Oakley said Woodford would join the investment firm but a spokesperson said the intention had always been for Oakley to provide support for Woodford's transition rather than to administer the fund.

25,"   By Nicholas Vinocur and Alexandria Sage | PARIS  PARIS Feb 2 When Edith Zemirou bought Euro Disney stock two decades ago, she expected a decent return and her own small share in Mickey Mouse magic.In 1989, the Walt Disney Company announced a public share offering of its young European arm. It was the continent's largest-ever IPO to that point and analysts said Euro Disney stock promised ""good long-term returns.""Zemirou bought in, and has regretted it ever since. Her original 1992 investment would have lost 95 percent of its value by now. ""It's too bad they didn't give us paper share certificates,"" said the grandmother and former high school principal, who still has 100 shares worth about 3 euros ($3.4)each. ""At least we could have framed them, as souvenirs.""Zemirou says she feels duped. She heads Euro Disney's investor club and is one of 1,000 or so investors who are furious at the way Euro Disney, which is raising fresh capital in the face of insolvency, has been run. The Paris-listed firm has recorded losses in 16 of its 23 years, despite owning Europe's top tourist destination with about 14 million visitors per year.Euro Disney managers say the firm has struggled because initial projections were too optimistic and the park borrowed too heavily. They also blame a lack of visitors, Europe's weak economy and, in many years, guests who spend too little on food and merchandise.Shareholders do not dispute there are difficulties, but point to another factor: U.S.-based Walt Disney Company, which owns 40 percent of Euro Disney, extracts tens of millions of euros annually from the European firm by charging it a host of fees and royalties for everything from operating a call centre to the use of intellectual property.Those charges cost Euro Disney around 10 percent of its annual revenue - too much, shareholders say, for it to become profitable. As evidence, they point out that all the years the European firm did turn a profit for shareholders were between 1995 and 2001, a period when Walt Disney Company had suspended most of its charges.Euro Disney Chief Financial Officer Mark Stead rejects the complaint. Fees, he said, are priced at ""market rates"" or lower. He pointed to similar fees for Tokyo Disneyland which amount to about 7 percent of its revenue. Disney, which does not own Tokyo Disneyland, would not suspend such charges if a retailer selling its branded products fell on hard times, for instance. Why should it for Euro Disney?But shareholders say this argument is flawed because Disney, as part-owner of Euro Disney, has a shared responsibility in the firm's financial well-being. Yet Disney charged further fees and even raised them as Euro Disney fell on hard times.A Disney spokeswoman said the Burbank, California-based firm had ""consistently demonstrated its commitment"" to supporting Euro Disney and, in addition to waiving fees in the mid-1990s, had deferred payment on some of its fees.Multinational firms regularly shift revenue between different divisions to minimise the taxes they have to pay. In Euro Disney's case, finance experts and shareholders argue that such transfers have been used primarily to channel revenue to one dominant shareholder over others. Those transfers, as well as management mistakes, have led to under-investment in the French theme park, some shareholders say, hurting visitors' experience.Broken-down rides, hotels needing renovation, long queues at restaurants and shortened opening hours have dragged down  visitor satisfaction, company documents show.Euro Disney acknowledges the need for new investment. It won shareholder approval on Jan. 13 for a recapitalisation plan to cut debt, renovate the park and set it on a firmer financial footing. The Walt Disney Company, which purchased Euro Disney's debt load from French banks in 2012, says it aims to reduce the 1.7-billion-euro debt to about 1 billion euros and improve Euro Disney's cash position by about 250 million euros.Virginie Calmels, head of Euro Disney's supervisory board, told shareholders that the strategy would ""finally put the firm on the path to profitability.""But some shareholders - there are around 56,000 - no longer trust such assurances.They are angry that the operation will give the parent company up to 82 percent in Euro Disney. In addition to Disney's stake, 10 percent of Euro Disney's equity is held by Saudi Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, and 6 percent by U.S. investment firm Invesco. Both declined to comment. The rest of the equity is held by small shareholders in Europe.Under terms laid out in a letter to investors last October, Euro Disney proposes that small shareholders triple their initial investment to keep the same stake proportionally. Alternately, they can sell purchase options for new shares and make a small gain. If they do nothing, they will lose money. ""After so many years of losses the fair thing to do would be to buy everyone out at a decent price,"" said shareholder Pierre-Alain Le Duc. ""Instead they're taking our shares when they are close to their all-time low and securing the rest of the park's equity for a bargain.""""Last stop, everybody off - that's what they're telling us.""""SHAREHOLDERS NOT THE MAIN CONCERN"" The trouble at Euro Disney stems from the firm's origins and ownership structure.Pierre-Henri Leroy, head of the independent investment advisory firm Proxinvest, says the 1987 agreement that established Euro Disney was made to benefit Disney and the French state, whose main concern was developing a depressed agricultural region east of Paris.In this, Disney was a welcome guest. Some 55,000 jobs in the greater Paris area depend, directly or indirectly, on Euro Disney, making it the largest private employer in the Seine-et-Marne region, according to a 2012 economic study commissioned by the government. The firm has also paid 5.3 billion euros in various taxes to local and national authorities since 1992.In return, Disney has won a foothold in Europe, a storefront for its merchandise and media properties, and prime access to 500 million consumers. The U.S. parent company has also made money from its French adventure. Since 1992, royalty and management fees have added up to 975.69 million euros for the Walt Disney Company, according to Reuters calculations based on financial reports. Euro Disney said 285 million euros of that was not paid as of 2014, but still owed to Disney.Add to that other Related-Party Transactions such as those for developing and building rides, other services and financial charges, and total charges reach at least 1.481 billion euros. Most of that revenue goes to other holding firms in the Netherlands, which has a tax-friendly policy for intellectual property. Disney says such services are crucial to maintain high and consistent standards at Euro Disney.Over the same period, Euro Disney has incurred total net losses attributable to shareholders of more than 2 billion euros. As a result, it has paid no corporate taxes. Even in its profitable years, Euro Disney used ""tax loss carry forwards,"" which allow firms that have incurred losses to avoid taxes.The losses were almost inevitable according to Proxinvest's Leroy, who is not a Euro Disney shareholder but advised French investment banks and corporations on the stock.""To us it was clear from the start that this was not a good investment,"" he said. ""I would never have advised anyone to buy these shares because so much money was being taken out through transactions with Disney.""An official in former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's government when the deal was signed said the state had imposed a shared ownership structure out of ""patriotic sentiment,"" and had not prioritised the protection of European shareholders.""The shareholders were not the main concern,"" said Christian Cardon, mayor of Trouville in northern France and former chief of staff for then Transport Minister Pierre Mehaignerie. Disney and the government ""didn't look too closely at the financial setup. If there had been a purely private approach... with major private shareholders, things would have been different."" WAITING TO PROFIT The U.S. parent firm uses a corporate structure known as the ""societe en commandite par actions,"" or SCA. This set-up, used by a handful of firms in France, allows Disney to manage Euro Disney via a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. It charges what Leroy and others call ""enormous"" fees for Related-Party Transactions including royalties, management, development, maintenance and other services.These services are not only expensive, but sometimes inefficient, shareholders say. Maintenance and upgrades cannot be performed on most Disney-themed rides, hotels and restaurants, without using Disney-controlled businesses. Shareholder Le Duc cited the example of a hotel inside Disneyland Paris. Staff there were unable to open windows because they had lost their only keys; replacements had to be ordered from the United States.All the fees add up to around 10 percent of Euro Disney's revenue. And that's set to climb even further. As part of Euro Disney's turnaround plans, one of those charges, the management fee, will rise to 6 percent on Oct. 1, 2018 from 1 percent now. Disney says this will restore it to originally planned levels.Euro Disney Chief Financial Officer Stead said Euro Disney shareholders were aware of its fees and charges which had ""always been disclosed.""It is not uncommon for parent firms to charge their subsidiaries such fees. Disney says its royalty and management fees are priced at market rates and less than what's charged by some other sellers of intellectual property. But some theme parks pay much less. Merlin Entertainments, which operates the Legoland park near London, for instance, paid Lego fees and royalties of around 2 percent in 2011 and 2012.Euro Disney shareholders complain that they have held on to their stock because of repeated assurances from management that it will become profitable in the medium-term. In 2012, CEO Philippe Gas said Euro Disney was ""setting the stage for sustained long-term profitability.""When Supervisory board chief Virginie Calmels and CEO Tom Wolber presented the rescue plans in Paris this month - Calmels said Euro Disney will finally turn a profit in 2019 - guests hectored them with shouting and accusations.TROUBLING? Shareholders also point to the fact that Euro Disney made money during the years Disney suspended Related-Party Transactions payments as evidence that the fees are an important cause of the theme park's losses.Euro Disney faced its first financial crisis just two years after opening. Walt Disney Company suspended royalty fees between 1994 and 1998, before reinstating them at half the normal rate until 2004. The firm's profitable years came during this period. Euro Disney warned in its 1995 financial report that reinstating full payment of royalties and management fees would ""have a significant impact on the Group's results of operations.""That prediction came true. Euro Disney plunged back into the red in 2002, soon after an investment in a second park, Walt Disney Studios. The second financial crunch led to a capital-raising operation in 2004.At that point, ""they should have said: 'either we stop these fees, or we buy back everyone's shares at a decent price.' But instead of that they are coming back for more money,"" said Leroy. ""Investors have already lost their underwear. I find it troubling.""A Disney spokeswoman said further deferring or waiving fees would not have substantially improved Euro Disney's liquidity situation.Moez Bennouri, a finance professor at Rouen Business School, said one problem is that auditors often struggle to determine the market value of Related-Party Transactions. In Euro Disney's case, all but one financial analyst has given up reporting regularly on the stock. The last to do so, financial services firm Oddo Securities, works for Euro Disney to help ensure investors can trade in the company's shares.A spokeswoman for Oddo said there is a Chinese wall between its brokerage and corporate finance sections.

29,"   By David Lin and Pete Sweeney | SHANGHAI, April 14  SHANGHAI, April 14 Invesco Ltd's China fund venture has raised about 11 billion yuan ($1.77 billion) for China's first mutal fund product to buy Hong Kong stocks under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, said two sources with knowledge of the situation.The fund will be the first of its kind after Beijing in late March allowed domestic mutual funds to invest in Hong Kong via the Connect. The fund was launched by Invesco Great Wall Fund Management, which completed its subscription process on Monday. According to comparative data from fund consultancy Z-Ben advisors, this marks the second-largest fund-raising by a Chinese mutual fund so far this year and the fifth-largest since 2010.The size of the fund underscores increasing mainland interest in relatively cheap Hong Kong stocks, and would add fuel to a stock market that has already jumped 11 percent in April. The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the press. An Invesco spokesperson declined to comment on the fund-raising, saying they would release information later. Seeking to front-run mainland mutual funds, Chinese and global hedge funds and wealthy individual have already piled into Hong Kong stocks over the past two weeks, boosting prices of Hong Kong-traded shares.BOC International has forecast that about 100 billion yuan could be raised by mutual fund managers in April to invest in Hong Kong's stock market.

32,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt  Dec 29 The lopsided performance of exchange-traded funds tracking China's turbulent domestic markets is stanching the flow of new money into a market that once excited investors.Investors pulled $418 million out of ETFs tracking Chinese stocks that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges in the year to Dec. 21, withdrawals representing more than half the total assets held in those funds, according to FactSet Research Systems Inc.Over the same period, ETFs tracking Chinese stocks not traded on the mainland attracted $1.2 billion.Much of the outflows came during a late-summer rout of once-high-flying stocks that exposed issues with government intervention, corruption and strict regulations for foreign investment.Moves by China's government to restrict trading on domestic exchanges have sometimes blocked index funds from buying the stocks they need to replicate the performance of Chinese benchmarks.When China halted most trading on its onshore exchanges in July, for example, the largest A-Shares fund, Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF, was thrown so far off track that its losses for the year at one point doubled the index's.Since then, A-Shares ETFs have managed to rebound, delivering an average 0.7 percent in returns for the year to Dec 21, compared with the 2.5 percent loss averaged by other Chinese stock-tracking funds, FactSet said. The Deutsche ASHR has also improved its performance - the value of the fund's shares traded on exchanges increased 19 percent over the 12 months that ended in November, compared with the index's 24 percent return, Deutsche data shows.Despite the resurgent performance, lingering concerns are preventing the funds from taking off.On Monday, the ASHR ETF paid investors $8.43 for each share held, about a quarter of what they are worth. Such so-called distributions are viewed negatively by investors, who must pay taxes on the earnings.The distributions were likely tied to heavy redemptions by the fund's investors this year, which sometimes force the sale of stocks held by the fund, according to Todd Rosenbluth, U.S. director of ETF and mutual-fund research at S&P Capital IQ . When funds sell assets that have gained value, they have to pay those earnings out to investors.PowerShares said earlier this month that it will shut down its China A-Share Portfolio in March.Spokeswomen for Deutsche Bank AG and PowerShares owner Invesco Ltd did not respond to requests for comment. In an earlier statement, PowerShares said CHNA's closure would ""align its product line with the changing investment landscape."" The weak sales of ETFs tracking Chinese A-Shares come despite performance that bests their traditional counterparts. Other Chinese ETFs often track shares of companies that trade outside mainland China, in places such as Hong Kong.One top-performing fund, Market Vectors ChinaAMC SME-ChiNext ETF, has returned 46 percent over the year to Dec. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund focuses on privately owned firms, as opposed to Chinese state-owned enterprises, in sectors such as information technology and healthcare.""At the end of the year we're still going to see these products being the best performers,"" said Rosenbluth. ""My fear would be investors in these products not fully understanding the risks tied to a still-emerging market.""Nonetheless, ETF companies are pushing forward with new products in the hope that China's markets will offer investors more diversified portfolios and access to quick growth in the world's second-largest economy.A decision last month by MSCI to add Chinese companies listed in the United States and elsewhere, such as  Alibaba, to its indexes was also seen as improving investors' exposure to China's growth.Vanguard Group is currently adding A-shares to its $51 billion Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund   . Deutsche is planning more A-Shares products, as are BlackRock Inc's iShares and other issuers, according to U.S. regulatory filings.A Vanguard spokesman said Chinese markets have proven easy to trade in and described the fund's transition to A-Shares as going ""exceptionally well.""

41,"   By Tomo Uetake | TOKYO  TOKYO Even though the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, long-term U.S. bond yields are unlikely to rise due to China's slowdown and negative rates in Japan and Europe, the top fund manager of Invesco Ltd's (IVZ.N) $240 bln global bond funds said.Gregory McGreevey, Atlanta-based CEO of Invesco Fixed Income also said most U.S. bonds are no longer cheap but still many of their valuations are at fair value.""We see slowing growth in China and emerging markets and a modest growth in developed economies. We think that backdrop will keep interest rates quite low for a longer period than most people in the market anticipate,"" McGreevey told Reuters in an interview.Expectations that the Federal Reserve will consider raising interest rates next month have risen after  minutes from the bank's previous policy meeting showed many policymakers felt the U.S. economy could be ready for another interest rate increase in June.""We think that even if the Fed were to raise interest rates on the short-end curve, that wouldn't have much of an impact on the longer end of the curve,"" he said. But McGreevey also said they are no longer cheap after price gains since March.""Over the course of the month of April and May, we saw pretty significant improvement in price, so they went from being 'cheap' back in March to being 'fair valued' today. We have changed our view of U.S. valuation from 'positive' to 'neutral',"" he said.While the overall bond market is challenging due to very low or even negative yields, there are pockets of opportunities, he added. ""We still like parts of the U.S. investment grade market, despite valuations and fundamentals, because of the very strong demand we continue to see for those particular products,"" he said.European corporate bonds also look good because of support from buying, due to start next month, by the European Central Bank.On the other hand, he said the asset manager is negative on U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. ""From our standpoint, we see valuations being very, very rich, the spreads continued to have tightened over the course of last couple of months,"" he said.McGreevey, who was in Tokyo to meet clients, also said he  expected Japanese investors to eventually diversify their investment outside corporate bonds to high yields, bank loans, structured products and other riskier assets.Invesco had more than $770 billion in assets under management as of March 31.

44,"   By Ben Hirschler  Circassia Pharmaceuticals lost nearly two-thirds of its value on Monday as its experimental cat allergy treatment failed in a late-stage trial, dealing a major blow to the high-profile British biotech company.Circassia listed on the London stock market in March 2014 in Britain's largest biotech flotation for decades and last year it expanded by buying two companies focused on asthma.Its two biggest shareholders are Invesco and Neil Woodford, both longstanding backers of UK life science. They have increased their holdings in the last six months to 35.1 and 19.2 percent respectively, according to Thomson Reuters data. Hopes for a cat allergy treatment have been central to Circassia's investment case, taking its valuation to $1 billion, but the company's immunotherapy failed to meet the main goal in a Phase III study because of a marked placebo effect among patients not on therapy.As a result, all groups in the study showed improvement compared to the baseline and the results of the active treatment groups were not significantly better than those on placebo.In fact, all the groups showed an improvement of close to 60 percent in rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, such as itchy eyes, runny noses and sneezing.RBC analyst Nick Keher described the news as ""very disappointing"" and shares in the company fell 64 percent to 97 pence by 1200 GMT. The stock was floated two years ago at 310p. Unlike antihistamines, which provide short-term relief, Circassia's treatment aims to change patients' underlying allergy by making their immune systems tolerate allergens.The company said it would stop its recently initiated registration study of its grass allergy treatment and preparatory work for a study on suitable doses of its ragweed allergy therapy.DUSTING DOWN  Steve Harris, Circassia’s chief executive, said he only got the clinical trial results over the weekend and was surprised and disappointed by the findings, since such a dramatic placebo effect was not seen in earlier mid-stage clinical trials.The placebo effect is well-known in medicine but the size of its impact in this trial is nonetheless puzzling. Some analysts suggested it might have been due to patients over-reporting baseline symptoms in order to get into the study, although Harris said he was not convinced by this explanation. ""We have to dust ourselves down, understand the result and get on with building the business up again,"" Harris told Reuters. Oxford-based Circassia will now focus more efforts on its respiratory franchises, which were unaffected by the results.This includes the Aerocrine business bought last year for just over $200 million, which makes instruments to measure airways inflammation for managing asthma, and a pipeline of generic lung drugs that came with the purchase of Prosonix.  Circassia said its unaudited cash balance remained over 139 million pounds ($202.5 million).""We were hoping for a better scenario, but under this scenario we still have the cash and the manpower to progress a number of exciting opportunities,"" Harris said.($1 = 0.6838 pounds) (Additional reporting by Mamidipudi Soumithri in Bengaluru; editing by Keith Weir and Jason Neely)",2016-06-20,IVZ,"Mon Jun 20, 2016 | 11:38am EDT",UPDATE 2-Cat allergy flop torpedoes high-profile UK biotech Circassia,http://www.reuters.com//article/circassia-pharma-study-allergy-idUSL4N19C2J7?type=companyNews

46,"   By Claire Milhench | LONDON  LONDON Sovereign investors, including wealth funds, made $14.1 billion worth of acquisitions in the second quarter, down 26 percent from the first three months of the year but underpinned by a rebound in real estate deals.   Data compiled by Thomson Reuters shows sovereign investors, a category that can include everything from state pension funds to oil-backed investment vehicles, were involved in 39 deals between April and June, six fewer than in the first quarter.The single biggest deal was the $4.5 billion funding round for Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of China's biggest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group Holding, which attracted China's CIC Capital, amongst others.Some sovereign investors witnessed reduced inflows as a result of lower oil prices and increasing demands from cash-strapped governments - Russia for instance is proposing to empty one of its two sovereign funds next year.Volatile markets have also taken a toll, with big direct investors such as Singapore's Temasek suffering a fall in the value of its portfolio of almost $18 billion over the past year. This could be making the sector more cautious about committing new capital. However, industry experts suggested the publicly available figures might not tell the whole story, with some deals flying below the radar, such as those carried out by boutique fund managers on behalf of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). ""There's a steady secular flow into illiquid investments which hasn't stopped, so the overall volumes should be higher,"" said Elliot Hentov, head of policy and research in the official institutions group at State Street Global Advisors.  ""There are a lot of deals we don't see that have SWF participation.""Patrick Thomson, head of international institutional clients at JP Morgan Asset Management, said there was no requirement for private transactions to be reported, so some investments were not being captured in public data.The overall volume was still 11 percent higher than the second quarter of 2015, helped by a handful of very large transactions.     The second largest deal was the $3.5 billion investment in ride-hailing service Uber by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, while the $2.5 billion sale of BlackRock's 43-storey office building in Singapore to the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) was in third place. REAL ESTATE Following Britain's vote on June 23 to leave the European Union, London property markets have been thrown into turmoil with many funds freezing investor cash to counter ballooning outflows.However, property-related deals made up roughly a quarter of the second quarter total, as SWFs continued to diversify away from low or negative yielding developed market government bonds.  Property offers predictable, repeatable cashflows, and yields of 3-5 percent in some core retail markets, JPMorgan's Thomson said. Also, prime office blocks are expensive, allowing investors to do very large single transactions. ""SWFs have relatively limited investment staff, and need to put quite a lot of money to work, so they need an asset class that can absorb a lot of capital,"" Thomson said.Real estate has also proved easier for SWFs to access than infrastructure and private equity in recent years. An Invesco survey of sovereign investors found that the average portfolio exposure to real estate had risen to 6.5 percent in 2015, from 3 percent in 2012.""There is a greater stock of real estate and a greater number of places to source deals,"" said Alex Millar, head of EMEA sovereigns, Middle East and Africa institutional sales at Invesco. Some Gulf SWFs were said to have held back from new property buys in Britain before the referendum. But Norway's $830 billion fund said in March it was undeterred, and Singapore's Gif said the turmoil may even bring buying opportunities.
