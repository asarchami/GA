2,"  * Southwestern to buy assets in Marcellus and Utica shale fields* Southwestern shares at 2-yr low indicating co is overpaying* Southwestern adds 435 horizontal wells through deal   (Adds Breakingviews column link, updates share movement)Oct 16 Southwestern Energy Co said it would buy some oil and gas assets in the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in West Virginia and Pennsylvania from Chesapeake Energy Corp for about $5.37 billion.But investors dumped Southwestern stock during regular trading hours on Thursday, sending it down 12 percent to a more than two-year low of $31.34, indicating that the company had overpaid for the assets. Shares were little changed in post-market trading after closing at $31.97. Chesapeake shares, on the other hand, gained as much as 18 percent during regular trading.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Ryan Oatman said that according to his calculations Southwestern would pay $9,625 per acre for the assets.The deal is positive for Chesapeake and other Utica and Marcellus shale players as it marks the first time the brokerage has seen a company pay more than $5,000 per acre for assets in the area, Oatman added. Southwestern Chief Executive Steven Mueller, however, said on a conference call that the deal was based more on the potential of the assets, and he expected it to contribute significantly to cash flow in a few years.The company, which already has assets in Fayetteville shale and northeastern Pennsylvania Marcellus, will add 256 operated and producing horizontal wells and 179 non-operated horizontal wells. It plans to deploy four to six rigs in 2015 for the new assets and increase that number to 11 rigs by 2017. The average net daily production from the wells was about 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent in September, consisting of 184 million cubic feet of gas, 20,000 barrels of natural gas liquids and 5,000 barrels of condensate, Chesapeake said.Chesapeake, the second-largest U.S. producer of natural gas, has been selling assets to reduce debt and improve profitability after Aubrey McClendon was forced out as CEO in April last year over spending.Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake said the deal would not impact its growth profile and that it expected its 2015 production outlook to remain at 7-10 percent growth adjusted for asset sales.Southwestern said it would fund the transaction with its existing revolving credit facility and a $5 billion loan from Bank of America.

4,"  * Statoil reduces stake in U.S. shale formation* Transaction worth $394* Deal could help Statoil maintain dividend - analyst   (Adds detail, analyst, background)OSLO, Dec 23 Statoil has sold part of its stake in a shale field in the northeast of the United States to Southwestern Energy for $394 million, the Norwegian energy firm said on Tuesday.Like its rivals, Statoil is stepping up efforts to sell assets and preserve cash as the industry faces a slump in the oil price, which has fallen by around a half since June. Shale oil is typically more expensive to produce than conventional oil.Statoil said it had agreed to reduce its stake in the U.S. Southern Marcellus onshore asset to 23 percent from 29 percent. The Norwegian firm has stakes in 615,500 acres of the formation, of which 91,400 are operated by Statoil. The stake it sold is not operated by Statoil.""The proceeds from this deal represent approximately one crown per Statoil share and helps it maintain its dividend for the next quarter, but not much more than that,"" ABG Sundal Collier analyst John Olaisen said. Southwestern Energy closed an additional acquisition of oil and gas assets in the Marcellus and Utica shale fields on Monday in a $4.98 billion transaction with Chesapeake Energy Corp , the second-largest U.S. producer of natural gas. .""The price is in line with what Southwestern paid in the Chesapeake deal. If Statoil could get the same price per acre for its entire stake in Marcellus, then that would be a very very good price,"" Olaisen said.Statoil's third-quarter production from the Marcellus play amounted to 130,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which around 4,000 barrels came from the assets included in the transaction.

8,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Billionaire investor David Tepper's Appaloosa Management bet on the embattled energy sector during the fourth quarter, buying stocks including Kinder Morgan, Southwestern Energy Co., Freeport-McMoRan, and Williams Partners.According to the fund's latest 13-F filing made on Friday, Tepper bought 9.4 million shares of energy company Kinder Morgan, whose shares are roughly flat this year even as commodity prices have fallen. The fund bought 4.3 million shares of natural gas and oil exploration company Southwestern Energy Co. who's shares have climbed 25 percent this year.He also bought 2.3 million shares of Williams Partners LP, which has tumbled 50 percent, and added 3.5 million shares of natural resource company Freeport-McMoRan, whose stock has dropped 18 percent this year. Commodity prices have tumbled this year and weighed on many energy company share prices. Fund managers have also voiced concern about anemic economic growth, which would not help energy demand.U.S. crude oil futures jumped 12 percent on Friday, yet oil was still headed for a weekly loss.  The 13-F filings show what U.S. stocks a fund owned at the end of the previous quarter and while the filings are often backward looking, investors pay close attention to them nonetheless to try and divine investment trends.Tepper, 58, has been called one of the best traders of his generation and his $18.6 billion hedge fund has routinely delivered returns so strong that the manager has periodically returned capital to investors because the fund was getting too large.  The manager, a former Goldman Sachs junk bond trader who is worth an estimated $11.6 billion according to Forbes magazine, runs his fund from Short Hills, New Jersey and recently opened an office in Miami.

Chesapeake Energy Corp, which has also won price reductions from Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams, said on Wednesday that is was aggressively pursuing new deals with its pipeline operators. Southwestern also reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.1 billion, or $5.58 per share, compared with a profit of $312 million, or 89 cents per share in the same period a year earlier.

20,"   By Mike Stone and Devika  Krishna Kumar | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Acquisition-hungry energy companies are back on the prowl.Dealmakers have recovered from the shock of Britain's ""Brexit"" vote last month to leave the European Union and have resumed buying oil and gas fields in choice locations in Canada and the United States, restocking their inventories on a bet that a two-year slump in the price of oil has abated.""Buyers are increasingly confident in a stable to slowly increasing oil price - as are their funding sources, whether private equity funds or public market investors,"" said Bobby Tudor, chief executive of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an oil and gas investment bank.Oil prices CLc1 have held steady at or above $45 a barrel for a majority of the last two months and touched a 2016 high above $51, ahead of the British referendum.Tudor said buyers were banking on it eventually settling at around $60 a barrel, giving them confidence about buying drilling acreage in some of the nation's shale heartlands.U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O) last week said it would spend $560 million buying leases on oil-rich land in the Southern Delaware Basin, within the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, where initial production results have been strong and costs are coming down.A day later, U.S. energy company Laredo Petroleum Inc (LPI.N) said it would spend $125 million buying acreage in the Midland Basin, also part of the Permian.These deals mark a resumption in buying after Brexit caused a temporary lull in acquisitions.Before the British referendum on June 23, buyers and sellers had grown comfortable with the idea that oil had rebounded from 12-year lows. That conviction helped to unclog the acquisition pipeline after a long-dormant period in which deals were offered but failed to materialize.About $5.1 billion of U.S. and Canadian properties traded hands in June, the largest dollar amount in more than a year according to PLS Inc, global M&A database for such deals.Acreage deals create confidence and open the door to acquisitions of entire companies, so long as oil remains relatively steady, according to nearly a dozen dealmakers interviewed by Reuters.More acreage deals are in the works, including ones that involve large exploration and production (E&P) companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Southwestern Energy Co  (SWN.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, like Magnum Hunter Resources, or are going through the process, like Ultra Petroleum Corp [UPLMQ.PK], will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy, having eliminated much of their debt.Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now, a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions. Traditional E&P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter, representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value, respectively, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price.  Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate, where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart.Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine-week period of relatively low oil volatility, when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about $40 and $50 a barrel.  Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out CLc36, according to bankers. That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about $60 per barrel, the bankers said.That forward price has now returned to its pre-Brexit levels of about $54 a barrel, enabling deals once again.Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location. Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about $50 per barrel is profitable. The acreage most sought-after is in Texas' Permian Basin and in Oklahoma's STACK area (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties), popular because of their easy-to-extract rock formations and relatively low break-even prices.     In June, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) said it would spend about $888 million to acquire STACK acreage and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) said it would sell Texas acreage to Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) and an undisclosed buyer for $858 million.HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES     While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months, many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long-term.""Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U.S. rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market. We think those concerns are unwarranted,"" ANZ said in a note.""We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017.""On Friday, U.S. oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher. [O/R]        Acreage inventory is being offered for sale, including 180,000 acres of West Virginia holdings currently belonging to Southwestern Energy Co (SWN.N), people familiar with the deal said. Southwestern declined to comment.     Anadarko is marketing 86,000 net acres in East Texas, one person familiar with the deal said, adding that the deal could fetch as much as $1 billion.

Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, like Magnum Hunter Resources, or are going through the process, like Ultra Petroleum Corp [UPLMQ.PK], will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy, having eliminated much of their debt.Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now, a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions. Traditional E&P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter, representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value, respectively, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price.  Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate, where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart.Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine-week period of relatively low oil volatility, when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about $40 and $50 a barrel.  Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out CLc36, according to bankers. That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about $60 per barrel, the bankers said.That forward price has now returned to its pre-Brexit levels of about $54 a barrel, enabling deals once again.Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location. Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about $50 per barrel is profitable. The acreage most sought-after is in Texas' Permian Basin and in Oklahoma's STACK area (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties), popular because of their easy-to-extract rock formations and relatively low break-even prices.     In June, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) said it would spend about $888 million to acquire STACK acreage and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) said it would sell Texas acreage to Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) and an undisclosed buyer for $858 million.HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES     While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months, many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long-term.""Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U.S. rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market. We think those concerns are unwarranted,"" ANZ said in a note.""We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017.""On Friday, U.S. oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher. [O/R]        Acreage inventory is being offered for sale, including 180,000 acres of West Virginia holdings currently belonging to Southwestern Energy Co (SWN.N), people familiar with the deal said. Southwestern declined to comment.     Anadarko is marketing 86,000 net acres in East Texas, one person familiar with the deal said, adding that the deal could fetch as much as $1 billion. A spokesman for Anadarko declined to comment.
