The chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue. General Electric Co lost 2.8 percent to $26.44.

Concerns over debit and credit card safety have increased after Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, disclosed the breach that lasted 19 days through Dec. 15.Cards on American Express's platform are seen as safer than those on Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc platforms due to the 'closed loop' system.STRONG RESULTS  American Express benefited from the holiday shopping season in the United States, with billed business in its core market growing 9 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the highest growth in six quarters.""Even though overall growth in consumer spending has been somewhat muted, the fact that American Express focuses on affluent consumers is helping it grow its billed business,"" said Janney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale.U.S. retail sales increased 3.8 percent in the 2013 holiday season, according to data released by the National Retail Federation on Tuesday.The same day, the U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales including automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants rose 1 percent from a year earlier in the October-December period.

6,"  * American Express, Citigroup, Discover prevail* Cardholders alleged collusion to require arbitration   (Adds comments from Citigroup, Discover lawyer)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, April 10 Consumers suffered a setback on Thursday as three big credit card issuers won the dismissal of U.S. lawsuits accusing them of colluding to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than class action lawsuits.U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said cardholders failed to show that American Express Co, Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  conspired to violate the Sherman antitrust law.The plaintiffs had argued that the conspiracy ran from May 1999 to October 2003, when 10 card-issuing banks and their lawyers held 28 meetings to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements.Pauley said his decision in the decade-old case was a close call, given the ""conscious parallel action"" among the biggest card issuers to include the clauses.""It was only by a slender reed that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the lawyers who organized these meetings had spawned a Sherman Act conspiracy among their clients,"" Pauley wrote in a 92-page decision, following a 2013 non-jury trial.Class action litigation can allow consumers to pool resources and obtain greater recoveries at lower cost than individual arbitrations. ""This is a big dent for consumer rights,"" said Curtis Arnold, a consumer advocate and founder of CardRatings.com in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""Class action lawsuits have over the years kept this industry in check. Individuals don't have much recourse taking on card giants by themselves.""Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years.Merrill Davidoff, a partner at Berger & Montague representing the plaintiffs, said his clients were ""obviously disappointed"" and strongly disagreed with Pauley's decision. He said it is premature to address whether there will be an appeal.Robert Sperling, a partner at Winston & Strawn representing Discover, said the cardholders ""never came close to proving collusion."" Citigroup spokeswoman Emily Collins said that the bank is pleased with the decision. Spokeswomen for American Express did not respond to requests for comment. American Express, Citigroup and Discover collectively held about 31.1 percent of U.S. outstanding credit card balances in 2013, according to the Nilson Report.AVOIDING A BACKLASH In April 2010, Bank of America Corp, Capital One Financial Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co settled with the plaintiff cardholders by agreeing to remove their arbitration clauses for 3-1/2 years. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated in December that just over 50 percent of outstanding credit card loans remain subject to the clauses. It said the percentage would have been 94 percent absent the earlier settlements.Other industries also use arbitration clauses. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 upheld contracts used by AT&T Inc  requiring consumers to arbitrate disputes individually.In his decision, Pauley noted that of the 10 banks that had been part of the litigation, just two had mandatory arbitration clauses at the start of the alleged collusion.He found ""compelling evidence"" that cardholders would have little economic incentive to fight alleged abuses absent class actions, and said that the banks' ""need to parry consumer backlash and temper any 'rogue' players"" established a motive to conspire.""A motive to conspire, however, does not mean that a conspiracy existed,"" he said. ""This court is convinced that the evidence is just as consistent with legitimate activity in furtherance of the issuing banks' independent self interests.""Pauley said the case also offered a ""cautionary lesson"" to lawyers, given that the banks' cost to defend against the lawsuits offset potential savings from the arbitration clauses.""In retrospect, the issuing banks' short-term goal of lowering litigation costs eluded them,"" he wrote.The cases are in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. They are Ross et al v. American Express Co et al, No. 04-05723; and Ross et al v. Bank of America NA et al, No. 05-07116.

8,"   By Aman Shah  American Express Co's (AXP.N) quarterly profit beat analysts' average estimate as a tighter control on expenses helped make up for slower growth in consumer spending in its key U.S. market.The world's biggest credit card issuer said an unusually severe winter caused billed business in the United States to rise 6 percent in the first quarter, lower than the 9 percent growth in the preceding quarter.However, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said on a post-earnings conference call that the business had grown through the second half of the quarter as the weather improved.U.S. retail sales increased 1.1 percent in March — the biggest gain since September 2012 — in a sign that the economy is bouncing back after the severe winter.""While consumers remain cautious about taking on additional debt, we continued to see a modest increase in card member loan balances"" CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.For a graphic on the company's U.S. billed business growth over the past four years, click (link.reuters.com/dyx58v) American Express, which issues its own cards unlike rivals such as Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N), benefits from its largely affluent customers' consistent spending and low default rates.The company's focus on affluent consumers should help drive growth as such customers in the United States spend 6 times more on their cards, Janney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale wrote in a note in February.The United States accounts for about two-thirds of American Express's total billed business.PROFIT BEATS  The company's net income rose 12 percent to $1.43 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.30 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue, net of interest expense, rose 4 percent to $8.20 billion but fell short of Wall Street expectations of $8.36 billion.Overall spending by the company's card users rose 7 percent, adjusted for foreign currency, while consolidated expenses fell by 1 percent to $5.5 billion. ""They (American Express) have been trying to control expenses quite a bit and the run rate of expenses is below what we've seen in quite a few quarters,"" Gokhale said.American Express in March spun off half of its business travel division into a joint venture with four financial investors as companies cut their budgets to protect profit margins.CFO Campbell said that while the company still expects the deal to close in the second quarter, delays in getting approvals could push back this quarter's earnings release.The company had said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 13 percent to 26 cents per share and buy back up to $4.4 billion of stock in 2014 after it passed the Federal Reserve's annual stress test in March.The company's shares were unchanged at $87.40 in extended trading on Wednesday.

10,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed American Express Company's  (AXP) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR at 'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A full list of ratings is detailed at the end of  this release.  The ratings affirmation reflects AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, strong credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization. Ratings are constrained by limited  revenue diversity and heightened legislative scrutiny of consumer products. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects operating performance to continue to improve in 2014 supported by  growth in consumer and business spending, an expanding Card Member base, and  expense discipline. Fitch also expects the company to continue to invest in the  franchise including strategic initiatives to expand key businesses (e.g. OPEN,  Merchant Services, Serve, Bluebird) and develop new products and services. That  said, some headwinds remain including a challenging economic backdrop,  particularly in the U.S. and Europe, increased regulatory oversight, and intense  competition from both traditional and alternative payment providers. Credit performance is expected to remain strong in 2014 although charge-offs and  delinquencies will likely start to increase from historically low levels. Fitch  expects provision expenses to increase in 2014 driven by portfolio growth, lower  reserve releases, and some modest deterioration in credit metrics. Net  charge-offs on the lending portfolio improved 30 basis points (bps) to 1.8% in  2013 and were below other top credit card issuers. Reserve coverage remains  strong at 1.9% of loans and 169% of loans past due at Dec. 31, 2013.  Capital ratios remained strong in 2013. The Tier I common ratio grew 60 bps to  12.5% in 2013 and the TCE/TA ratio improved 50 bps to 10.4% in 2013. Both  metrics compare favorably to peer banks. Fitch expects capital ratios to remain  stable as earnings generation is offset by asset growth and return of capital to  shareholders (e.g. dividends, stock repurchases). AXP's liquidity profile remains a rating strength, with approximately $13  billion (excluding CP and operating cash) of readily available cash and  marketable securities at Dec. 31, 2013 to fund $12.5 billion of long-term debt  and CD maturities over the next 12 months. The parent company has $1.3 billion  of unsecured debt maturities in 2014, which compares to cash and equivalents and  investment securities of $6.2 billion at year-end 2013 which Fitch believes is  more than adequate to cover dividend and interest payments for the year. RATING SENSITIVITIES Limited Upside in Ratings: Fitch believes positive rating momentum is relatively  limited, given the company's strong ratings currently, concentrated exposure to  consumers and focus on payment services.  Deteriorating Operating Performance: Negative rating action could be driven by a  decline in earnings performance, resulting from a decrease in market share or an  inability to contain costs, a weakening liquidity profile, significant  reductions in capitalization, and/or potential new and more onerous rules and  regulations. Negative rating momentum could also be driven by an inability of  AXP to maintain its competitive position and earnings prospects in an  increasingly digitized payment landscape. Fitch has taken the following rating actions:  American Express Company -- Long-term IDR affirmed at 'A+'; -- Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F1'; -- Short-term debt affirmed at 'F1'; -- Senior debt affirmed at 'A+'; -- Hybrid capital instrument affirmed at 'BBB'; -- Viability Rating affirmed at 'a+'; -- Support affirmed at '5'; and -- Support Floor affirmed at 'NF'.

12,"  American Express Co, the world's largest credit card issuer, reported an 8.1 percent rise in quarterly profit due to higher spending by U.S. customers using its credit cards and a rise in its net interest income. Spending by U.S. holders of AmEx cards rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosting profit in the business by 14 percent.The business accounted for nearly three-quarters of the company's profit. U.S. consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August after being unchanged in July, the Commerce Department said last month. AmEx, which issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks, benefits from its largely affluent customer base and low rates of default. However, single-digit growth in spending by its card users for about two years has pushed the company to launch products such as a fee-free card that targets a wider range of customers.The company's net income rose to $1.48 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.37 billion, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. Net interest income rose 8.7 percent to $1.4 billion. However, total revenue, net of interest expense, remained nearly unchanged at $8.33 billion.Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said AmEx's revenue was growing at a pace below the company's long-term target. ""While the economy is stronger, it is not growing as fast or as steadily as most people would like,"" he said in a statement. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.36 per share and revenue of $8.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.AmEx's shares closed at $80.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB-' to  the $750  million in preferred stock issued by American Express Company (AXP,  rated 'A+/F1' by Fitch). This preferred issuance represents approximately 1% of  AXP's total risk-weighted assets at Sept. 30, 2014. AXP had previously stated that it would issue preferred shares for Basel III  capital planning purposes. More specifically, the new Tier 1 ratio requirement  under Basel III is 150 basis points higher than the current common equity Tier 1  ratio and regulators have started using the new minimums to assess capital  adequacy in the CCAR process. Fitch believes AXP's strategy is consistent with other large financial  institutions which have included preferred stock in their non-common Tier 1  capital structures. KEY RATING DRIVERS - Preferred Shares AXP's preferred stock rating is five notches below the entity's Viability Rating  (VR) of 'a+' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The  preferred stock rating includes two notches for loss severity given these  securities deep subordination in the capital structure, and three notches for  non-performance given that the coupon of the securities is non-cumulative and  fully discretionary. Fitch has accorded these preferred securities equity credit of 50%, which is in  line with its methodology in assessing and rating bank subordinated and hybrid  securities. RATING SENSITIVITIES - Preferred Shares The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile.

16,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 13 (Fitch) Draft terms agreed to by the European Parliament  and the European Council in December that cap interchange fees on some European  debit and credit card transactions will likely have a manageable financial  impact on American Express (AmEx, 'A+') and Discover Financial Services  (Discover, 'BBB+'), Fitch Ratings says.  We expect that the effect will also be manageable but more felt at banks with  operations concentrated in the EU that issue payment cards on the Visa and  MasterCard networks. However, the interchange fee caps have been widely  anticipated, and we believe that issuers have had time to prepare for the impact  on revenue. Fitch believes increased regulation could have some unintended consequences. For  example, card members could face higher fees and/or reduced benefits as banks  re-assess these programs and seek to maintain appropriate profitability targets.  Fitch believes these could potentially take the form of annual membership fees,  account maintenance or other fees and/or more limited rewards. At the same time,  it remains unclear if merchants will be willing to pass through the savings to  consumers.  According to the European Commission, the new rules would introduce maximum fees  for consumer debit and credit cards and establish transparency rules for all  transactions, among other points. The agreement is in line with expectations  that interchange fees paid by merchants will become capped at 0.2% for debit  card transactions and 0.3% for credit card purchases. The primary targets of the  proposals are four-party payment networks (e.g. Visa and MasterCard), although  three-party payments systems that rely on bank issuers are also likely included  in the new rules. Three-party systems that rely on bank issuers would include  AmEx's Global Network Services (GNS) business and Discover's Diner's Club,  although neither is a material earnings contributor to their respective  franchises. The core proprietary card businesses of Amex and Discover (which do  not rely on bank issuers), are not included in the recent agreement, consistent  with the prior proposal. The agreement remains subject to final endorsement by EU member states and by  the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, before being put to a vote by the  full Parliament, which is expected in early 2015, according to the European  Commission. The caps are expected to take effect six months after the  legislation enters into force.

38,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed American Express Company's  (AXP) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and its short-term IDR at  'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the  end of this release.  AXP's rating review was conducted as part of Fitch's periodic peer review of  U.S. consumer finance companies. For a summary of the outcomes and drivers of  this peer review please see the release entitled 'Fitch Affirms Five U.S.  Consumer Finance Companies Following Peer Review' dated April 8, 2015.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, Subordinated Debt, Preferred Shares, Support Ratings,  Support Rating Floors, VRs, Deposits The rating affirmations reflect AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, peer-superior credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization.  Rating constraints include AXP's concentrated and cyclical business model,  potential funding sensitivity associated with wholesale and internet deposit  funding sources, the likelihood of asset quality reversion from current levels.  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that AXP's favourable business model  and strong competitive position afford it a degree of operational and financial  flexibility to respond to recent challenges associated with AXP's loss of the  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco, 'A+', Outlook Positive) relationship, and  continued elevated regulatory, legislative and litigation risk.  Fitch expects AXP's operating performance to remain under a degree of pressure  over the near term reflecting a number of headwinds including lackluster modest  global economic growth, normalizing credit performance, the loss of the Costco  relationship, a stronger U.S. dollar and continued heightened regulatory,  legislative and litigation risk. Despite these challenges, Fitch believes AXP's longer-term operating performance  will remain strong supported by the company's favourable business model and  competitive position, the continued shift in global payments away from cash and  checks, an expanding Card Member base, and expense discipline. Fitch also  expects the company to continue to innovate and invest in new opportunities that  complement its existing competitive strengths. Credit performance is expected to remain among the strongest of other top credit  card issuers in 2015, although charge-offs and delinquencies will likely start  to normalize. Fitch expects provision expenses to increase in 2015 driven  primarily by portfolio seasoning and growth, as well as some modest  deterioration in credit metrics. Net charge-offs on the lending portfolio  improved 30 basis points (bps) to 1.5% in 2014 and remained well below other top  credit card issuers and the industry average. Reserve coverage remained strong  at 1.7% of loans and 167% of loans past due at Dec. 31, 2014.  The impact from rising interest rates is expected to be manageable for AXP. At  Dec. 31, 2014, assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates,  AXP estimates that net interest income (NII) over the following 12-month period  would decrease by approximately $212 million. This estimated decline in NII  primarily relates to non-interest bearing charge card receivables and fixed rate  credit card loans that are funded with variable rate debt. As of Dec. 31, 2014,  fixed rate worldwide charge card receivables and credit card loans accounted for  approximately 67% of AXP's total portfolio. Regulatory capital ratios improved further from already strong levels in 2014.  The Tier I capital ratio increased 110 bps to 13.6% in 2014 and the Tier I  common ratio grew 60 bps to 13.1% in 2014. Both metrics compare favorably to  peer banks. Additionally, AXP performed very well relative to peers in the  Federal Reserve's most recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).  As part of this review, AXP received a non-objection related to its capital plan  submitted in January 2015. Fitch expects capital ratios to remain relatively  stable as strong capital generation is offset by asset growth and return of  capital to shareholders (e.g. dividends, stock repurchases). AXP's liquidity profile remains a rating strength. AXP had $15.2 billion  (excluding CP and operating cash) of readily available cash and marketable  securities at Dec. 31, 2014. This compared to $13.4 billion of long-term debt  and CD maturities over the next 12 months. Furthermore, the parent company has  no unsecured debt maturities in 2015, which compares to cash and equivalents and  investment securities of $8.8 billion at year-end 2014. On Feb. 12, 2015 AXP announced that it would not renew its U.S. co-brand  relationship with Costco. AXP expects the loss of the Costco U.S. contract to  have a negative impact on earnings and revenue growth after the contract expires  in March 2016. However, the company reiterated its long-term earnings per share  growth target of between 12% and 15% beginning in 2017.  Fitch believes AXP will pursue other investment opportunities including within  consumer and small business payments, prepaid products, global network services  (GNS) bank partnerships, and new co-brand relationships in an effort to offset  the long-term loss of earnings from the Costco relationship. For example, on  March 19, 2015 AXP announced a new exclusive multi-year partnership with Charles  Schwab & Co., Inc. ('A', Outlook Stable) to create two new premium co-branded  cards.  Fitch views AXP's decision not to renew such an important relationship as an  understandable outcome when seeking to balance long term economic value and  short-term results. Although near term earnings will be pressured, Fitch  believes AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business model and leading market  position in the payments industry position it well to achieve its long term  operating performance targets. For a more in-depth review of the implications related to this announcement,  please refer to Fitch's press release 'Loss of Co-Branding Relationship Adds to  Near-Term Challenges Facing Amex' published on Feb. 17, 2015. On Feb. 19, 2015, the United States District Court in the Eastern District of  New York ruled in favor of the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) in its  anti-steering case against AXP. AXP has moved to bring its case to the appellate  court and believes it will prevail on appeal. Fitch believes losing the DOJ lawsuit (for now) is a credit negative and adds to  AXP's near term challenges. That said, in a scenario where the ruling is upheld  Fitch believes the longer term impact on AXP's business model and operating  performance could be modest. While Fitch believes allowing merchant steering  could negatively impact AXP's billed business volumes, it is unclear how many  merchants would actually steer customers at the point of sale. In Fitch's  opinion, merchants will need to prudently manage the trade-offs between customer  satisfaction, sales volume and transaction pricing when making the decision to  steer customers to lower cost forms of payment. That said, if merchant steering  becomes widespread, Fitch would need to evaluate the impact on AXP's market  share and merchant discount revenue, which accounted for 57% of net operating  revenue in 2014. The ratings for AXP and its subsidiaries are equalized, which reflects Fitch's  view that each subsidiary is core and integral to AXP's business strategy and  operations. Fitch believes AXP would fully support each of these subsidiaries in  the event of need. The Support Ratings (SRs) of '5' reflect Fitch's view that external support  cannot be relied upon. The Support Rating Floors (SRFs) of 'No Floor' reflect  Fitch's view that there is no reasonable assumption that sovereign support will  be forthcoming to AXP. AXP's subordinated debt rating is one notch below the entity's Viability Rating  (VR) of 'a+' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The  subordinated note rating includes one notch for loss severity given the  subordination of these securities in the capital structure, and zero notches for  non-performance given contractual limitations on interest payment deferrals and  no mandatory trigger events which could adversely impact performance. AXP's preferred stock ratings are five notches below the AXP's VR of 'a+' in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instruments respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The preferred stock  ratings include two notches for loss severity given these securities deep  subordination in the capital structure, and three notches for non-performance  given that the coupons of these securities are non-cumulative and fully  discretionary. AXP Centurion Bank's and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings of 'AA-/F1+'  are rated one notch higher than their respective IDR's because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference in the U.S. Fitch believes depositor  preference in the U.S. gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, Subordinated Debt, Preferred Shares, Support  Ratings, Support Rating Floors, VRs, Deposits Fitch believes positive rating momentum is relatively limited, given the AXP's  strong ratings currently, concentrated exposure to consumers and focus on  payment services. That said, longer-term positive rating momentum could  potentially be driven by successful navigation of current regulatory,  partnership and competitive/technological challenges, increased earnings  diversification that results in less cyclical financial performance, and  enhanced funding diversity/stability, particularly with respect to  internet-based deposits.  Negative rating action could be driven by a material decline in AXP's franchise,  which may be evidenced by discount rate erosion, declines in volumes or loss of  market share, among other factors. Other negative drivers could include  weakening earnings performance, resulting from a decrease in market share,  sustained deterioration in credit performance, the loss of key partner  relationships, increased merchant steering or an inability to contain costs, a  weakening liquidity profile, significant reductions in capitalization, and/or  potential new and more onerous rules and regulations. Negative rating momentum  could also be driven by an inability of AXP to maintain its competitive position  and earnings prospects in an increasingly digitized payment landscape. AXP's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumptions around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  The subordinated debt ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. AXP Centurion Bank and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one  notch higher than each company's IDR, and therefore are sensitive to any changes  in their respective IDR's. The deposit ratings are primarily sensitive to any  change in AXP's long- and short-term IDRs. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  American Express Company --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Senior debt at 'A+'; --6.80% Subordinated Debentures due September 2036 at 'BBB'; --3.625% Subordinated Notes due Dec 2024 at 'A'; --Preferred Shares, Series B at 'BBB-'; --Preferred Shares, Series C at 'BBB-'; --Viability Rating at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

39,"  SAN FRANCISCO Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has forged a deal to allow online shopping startup Bigcommerce's 70,000-plus clients to more easily buy from top-ranked Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on Alibaba.com.The tie-up helps round off Bigcommerce's services, a startup which helps clients from Gibson Guitars to Ubisoft Entertainment SA create and market e-commerce websites.The Chinese company and Bigcommerce have created a software app to help Bigcommerce's customers better navigate Alibaba.com, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday.Alibaba.com is the Chinese ecommerce giant's original product, a service through which millions of merchants around the world source cheap parts, components and products from Chinese suppliers.  It caters primarily to smaller businesses looking for manufacturing partners in China and elsewhere but often lack the financial resources to secure reliable suppliers on their own.Clients of six-year-old Bigcommerce, which counts Softbank Capital, American Express Co and General Catalyst among its investors, will start out with access to 300 ""gold suppliers"" on Alibaba's service.  That partnership may eventually extend to thousands more suppliers, and Bigcommerce's customers will also have the option of selling their products to Alibaba.com users. ""For many of our merchants, Alibaba.com represents a tremendous opportunity to tap into the world's largest supplier network - whether to start selling or expand an existing business - without taking on unnecessary risk or sacrificing margins,"" Bigcommerce co-founder and CEO Eddie Machaalani said in a statement.

50,"  (Adds details of holdings, comment, byline)By Jonathan StempelMay 15 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire's favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co  and International Business Machines Corp.The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31.Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp , another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies.No new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall. Buffett has long praised his ""Big Four"" stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire's equity investments.Buffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM's stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola's sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law. ""Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well"" in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett's investment strategies. ""Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.""Friday's regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs.In the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares. The U.S. Bancorp stake grew about 5 percent to 83.8 million shares. Other holdings that grew include Deere & Co, Liberty Global Plc, Phillips 66, Precision Castparts Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.Holdings declined in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Charter Communications Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc , Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc.Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses, including the Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance.Buffett, 84, this month celebrated his 50th anniversary running his Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose market value is fifth-highest among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

63,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.)Gary Friedman of the Friedman Law Group can now put a price tag on the cost of his horribly misguided decision to share privileged and confidential documents from his antitrust class action against American Express with his old friend Keila Ravelo, a lawyer for MasterCard in a parallel case: $75 million.After a ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Brooklyn, Friedman and his co-counsel in the Amex case are no longer in line for that $75 million.They were slated to receive the money for a settlement that permits merchants to impose a surcharge on customers who use Amex credit cards, as long as those retailers impose the same surcharge when consumers use other credit cards.The judge denied final approval of the settlement, finding that Friedman didn't provide class members with adequate representation.DEVASTATING DETAILS Garaufis' ruling adds devastating details to previously bare-bones allegations about the documents Friedman gave Ravelo.The misconduct first surfaced after federal prosecutors charged Ravelo with setting up a fake legal services company that she and her husband allegedly used to defraud MasterCard and two law firms where she had been a partner, Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Hunton & Williams.Willkie's internal investigation of Ravelo turned up evidence that Friedman had been sending documents from the Amex case to her, even as she defended MasterCard in a separate class action raising similar swipe-fee antitrust allegations against Visa and MasterCard.Merchants that didn't like the terms of the Amex settlement or the $5.7 billion settlement in the MasterCard case have argued that Friedman's disclosures tainted both deals, even though MasterCard was not a defendant in the Amex case Friedman led and Friedman wasn't lead counsel for the class suing Visa and MasterCard.Their briefs have been heavily redacted. Judge Garaufis' opinion is not. His decision shows that Friedman gave Ravelo pretty much his entire case file: confidential Amex documents (at least 33), confidential documents from members of the class he was representing (22 of those), even his own work product, including strategy memos and emails amongst his co-counsel.Friedman's lawyers, New York University law professor Samuel Issacharoff and Theresa Trzaskoma of Brune & Richard, have said he used Ravelo as an informal sounding board, to the benefit of the class. Judge Garaufis said instead that his disclosures to a lawyer for MasterCard called his loyalty to his clients into question.""Whether Friedman exchanged confidential and/or privileged materials with Ravelo and consulted with her regarding these actions for financial reasons, out of personal loyalty, due to a misplaced sense that her advice would in fact benefit the merchant class and was not improper, and/or for some other reason(s), is something this court cannot currently, and need not, determine,"" he wrote. ""Whatever his reason for doing so, Friedman's bringing MasterCard's counsel into the negotiating process created a conflict between class members and class counsel, and specifically a risk that Friedman, with Ravelo in his ear, negotiated settlement terms that are worse for class members than the terms he might have negotiated absent that conflict.""The judge said Friedman's co-counsel, Reinhardt Wendorf & Blanchfield and Read McCaffrey, showed their own questionable judgment by sticking with Friedman in a brief attempting to rescue the settlement, rather than acknowledging his wrongdoing.""This gives the appearance that Friedman's co-counsel may be more interested in protecting Friedman, their settlement, and their attorneys' fees application, than they are in protecting the merchant class that they purport to represent,"" the judge said. He removed Friedman as class counsel and ordered the other lead lawyers to submit briefs on why he shouldn't bounce them as well.""BURN AFTER READING"" Garaufis' opinion is full of surprising revelations, like Friedman and Ravelo's plan to jointly represent merchants in arbitrations against American Express or to buy a Gulfstream jet and start an air charter business. Friedman, according to the judge, knew full well that it was wrong of him to share documents from the Amex case with Ravelo. He sent some sensitive messages to Ravelo's personal email account, rather than her work addresses, ""suggesting an intention to keep the communications from being discovered,"" Judge Garaufis wrote. And in at least two emails to Ravelo, the judge said, Friedman wrote, ""Burn after reading.""Breaching attorney client privilege might have been enough of an offense to justify a finding that Friedman did not adequately represent the merchants in the class, the judge said, ""but this is not where the misconduct ends, and it does not constitute the complete story of the inadequacy of representation in this case.""""FANTASY RESOLUTION"" That is where Judge Garaufis' opinion gets really interesting. He discusses the intersection of the now-rejected Amex settlement with merchants' $5.7 billion settlement with MasterCard and Visa, suggesting a motive for Friedman to push for a certain provision in the MasterCard deal. Retailers with objections to the MasterCard settlement have struggled to convince the magistrate judge in their case that Friedman's improper disclosures should upend the final judgment entered against MasterCard and Visa.Garaufis' opinion should help them hone their theory. According to the judge, the two settlements were inextricably connected, and Friedman - who assisted class counsel in the MasterCard case in negotiations on injunctive relief - had an incentive to argue for a provision in that settlement that would help him reach a deal with Amex.The judge quoted an email from November 2011 in which Friedman told Ravelo that Amex's ""fantasy resolution"" of the swipe fee litigation was surcharge parity, in which merchants can tack on fees for Amex users as long as they charge the same fees when customers use Visa and MasterCard credit cards. The way to obtain that ""fantasy,"" Friedman said, was to include a provision in the merchants' settlement with Visa and MasterCard to require a ""level playing field"" for such surcharges.INTERDEPENDENCE Friedman was in constant touch with Ravelo during MasterCard's settlement negotiations, according to Garaufis, providing her with the plaintiffs' strategy memos and even volunteering to draft a paragraph on the level playing field provision for Ravelo to present to MasterCard.At the same time, the judge said, he passed to her information about Amex's negotiating position and the class posture in that case.""This interaction between the (MasterCard) settlement and the (Amex) settlement agreement illustrates why Friedman's apparent collaboration with Ravelo is so troubling,"" Judge Garaufis said.""Friedman's ability to be a zealous advocate for the class was compromised by his collaboration with counsel for MasterCard, an entity with interests divergent to those of the class; there is reason to be concerned that he was not acting solely in the class's interests when he, teamed with Ravelo, engaged in settlement negotiations and decision-making.""The judge effectively outlines the interdependence of the two settlements. But the challenge for objectors in the MasterCard case will be to show Friedman or Ravelo had decision-making authority over that settlement. That won't be easy.The class was represented by lead counsel from Robins Kaplan; Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd; and Berger & Montague, with Friedman just in a supporting role. MasterCard's lead counsel was Ken Gallo of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, not Keila Ravelo.And as settlement proponents in the MasterCard case have said repeatedly, their deal - including the level playing field provision - was proposed by an independent mediator in December 2011. Much of the correspondence between Friedman and Ravelo that Judge Garaufis cites came after the mediator had already suggested the provision.Overturning the MasterCard settlement is still a very long shot, but Judge Garaufis' Amex ruling may improve the odds for settlement detractors. Objectors have submitted briefs calling for judgment in the case to be vacated to Visa, MasterCard and class counsel. Settlement proponents have until Aug. 18 to respond.(Reporting by Alison Frankel)",2015-08-05,AXP,"Wed Aug 5, 2015 | 7:32pm EDT",COLUMN-Judge finds lawyer 'fatally tainted' Amex deal: Frankel,http://www.reuters.com//article/otc-amex-idUSL1N10G3YZ20150805?type=companyNews

70,"  * No deal on Apple Pay yet with top 4 Australia lenders* Banks, with own sophisticated apps, in no rush for accord* Without deal, Apple cut off from 80 pct of payments market* As talks drag on, lawmaker raises competition concernsBy Matt SiegelSYDNEY, Dec 10 Apple Inc is struggling to persuade Australia's big banks to sign up for its Apple Pay mobile payment system, people familiar with the matter say, as the technology giant works from an unfamiliar negotiating position: weakness, not strength.Apple rolled out the service in Australia last month with support for payment cards issued directly by American Express Co . The move is part of the iPhone supplier's global drive to extend its mobile consumer electronics prowess into financial services, with a China launch expected soon.But the firm has yet to strike a deal with any of the four main banks - ANZ, National Australia Bank (NAB) , Commonwealth Bank  and Westpac. That sets it adrift from 80 percent of consumers using mobile payments systems linked to other credit cards in a market Westpac sees as being worth more than $2 billion this year.""The banks here feel like they've done the hard work in bringing contactless payments already to Australia and Apple is just going to come in...and eat their lunch,"" said Foad Fadaghi, managing director of technology research firm Telsyte.Apple declined to comment, citing company policy. The firm has faced - and eventually dealt with - hurdles rolling out the service in other markets such as the United States, where contactless payments are rare, and in Britain, where it faced resistance from big banks over fees before relenting.Yet analysts say Australia's banks are unique, having forged ahead of the banking industry elsewhere in developing contactless payments systems. Like the people familiar with negotiations between Apple and the lenders, sector watchers say the banks feel little sense of urgency to conclude a deal.A source at one of the Australian banks, who wasn't authorised to speak publicly, said Apple did not understand the market and was trying to fill a gap that does not exist.""It's a different world here,"" he said. ""Where's the value in this for the banks?""The lenders' approach is one that could also stymie other tech players potentially interested in rolling out payments systems in Australia, including Apple rival Samsung Electronics Co, now expanding its own Samsung Pay system. Neither ANZ nor Westpac responded to requests for comment and Commonwealth declined to comment, citing the confidential nature of any negotiations.NAB declined to answer questions, but a spokesman said in an email that it remained open to negotiations.""We are very alive to these innovations and the expectations of our customers. We continue to work with potential players in this space, but there is no more we can tell you at this time,"" NAB spokesman Nick Higginbottom said. TINY SLICE, BIG MARKET As the negotiations drag on, analysts say Apple may seek to build momentum for Apple Pay through partnerships, software and feature upgrades to entice consumers.Apple Pay gives the consumer electronics supplier a chance to tie customers more tightly to the popular iPhone, as well as the Apple Watch. In return for the convenience of making payments from smartphones or smartwatches, Apple takes a tiny slice from each retail transaction.Apple's iOS operating system was used in roughly 37 percent of mobile devices sold in Australia in September, according to data published by research firm Kantar Worldpanel, second only to Google's Android system.Contactless payments have also skyrocketed since their introduction in 2010, accounting for 22 percent of face-to-face transactions in 2014, according to a Reserve Bank of Australia report. That's because the major Australian banks already offer sophisticated smartphone apps for mobile payments and contactless payment on their bank cards, without significant  competition from tech firms.All of those factors have combined to reinforce the banks' negotiating position. That has angered opposition Labor Party lawmaker Ed Husic, who last month wrote a letter to the RBA accusing the lenders of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour at consumers' expense.""The bottom line is we've got an arm wrestle going on here and the longer it goes on, the longer the customers have to stand by at the edges...waiting for some sort of resolution,"" Husic told Reuters.For Husic, the longer the stalemate drags on, the more likely a potential investigation of the banks for anti-competitive behaviour becomes. ""If it drags on, I think the drum beat for that type of action will grow,"" he said.In a written response to Husic's letter, RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said the central bank does not interfere unless there are public interest issues at stake. ""The Bank's discussions relating to Apple Pay have not provided any evidence that Australian banks have been 'boycotting' Apple Pay,"" Stevens wrote.

The company, which has historically catered to upscale consumers and has attempted to woo big businesses into partnerships, has been trying to rebrand itself over the last few years.    Competitive pressure on the credit card issuer has increased and it lost long-term partnerships with Fidelity Investments and retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O).

But competition and the company’s attempts to expand its customer bases eroded its profitability on multiple fronts and intensified in the past year. To keep banks from taking its deals to issue co-branded cards with Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), British Airways and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide HOT.N, for example, AmEx had to renegotiate contracts earlier than planned and at lower prices.    To counter the appeal to consumer of cards from banks, including Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), offering cash back of 1.5 percent and 2 percent of purchases, AmEx has had to increase its offers.

81,"   By Sudarshan Varadhan  Credit card issuer American Express Co's (AXP.N) shares slumped in extended trading on Thursday after the company's 2016 earnings forecast disappointed analysts and investors.AmEx shares fell about 3.7 percent to $60.35 in extended trading following the company's 2016 earnings forecast of $5.40-$5.70 per share.Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, said while the new guidance for 2016 is above consensus earnings estimates, it includes an expected $1 billion gain on the sale of Costco portfolio, which implies that underlying growth in 2016 will be ""weaker than expected, not stronger.""Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault did not specify he size of the expected gain from the Costco portfolio sale during the company's earnings conference call. Nomura Securities analyst Bill Carcache said some investors stripped about $0.66 a share off the expected earnings per share for the year to account for the gain. Analysts on an average estimate 2016 earnings of $5.41 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.AmEx lost long-term partners such as Fidelity Investments, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) last year.The company also said it would cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017 as it responds to intensifying competition in the payments industry. ""Our 2015 results and outlook reflect the reset in co-brand economics, pressures on merchant fees, the evolving regulatory environment and intense competition that have been re-shaping the payments industry,"" Chenault said in a statement.Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $873 million or 89 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.44 billion or $1.39 per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a $335 million after-tax charge and the year-earlier period a $453 million after-tax gain.AmEx reported its fourth straight decline in total revenue, net of interest expense, of $8.39 billion. Adjusted revenue rose 4 percent.Shares of the company, which had fallen about 10 percent this year to Thursday close, lost a quarter of their value in 2015.

82,"   By Olivia Oran  American Express Co (AXP.N) wants to grow small-business lending to make up for revenue it expects to lose after its credit card partnership with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) ends this year.    Last week, American Express said it will pay an undisclosed amount to feature its charge cards on Fundera, an online marketplace. AmEx hopes small-business owners will compare loan terms and rates and choose its cards over traditional loans.    The company is bracing for the end of co-branded cards with Costco that accounted for 8 percent of worldwide annual spending on AmEx cards in 2014, and 20 percent of the company's outstanding loans.    The planned end of the partnership in March has been delayed a few months because it has taken more time to move customers to a new card, the Seattle Times reported last week.    To make up for that lost revenue, American Express has focused on small-business loans, where it already has a foothold. It views small-business cards as an area with room to grow in the near term, unlike consumer spending.  In 2014, American Express cards for small businesses funded $190 billion in purchases, up from $122 billion in 2010. The company considers cards an untapped form of small-business funding, because small businesses tend to rely more heavily on cash and traditional loans. Only 10 percent of small-business spending takes place on cards.     At AmEx's investor day last year, management highlighted its small-business loan operation as an area of focus.    ""One of the very most important things we're doing as a company is lending and funding,"" David Rabkin, AmEx’s senior vice president of small-business customer acquisition, said in an interview. ""Putting our cards on Fundera marketplace is part of that.""    The charge cards American Express offers on Fundera, called Open, are designed for companies that need to fund large spot purchases of inventory or raw materials, and can pay off the balance in full each month. The Open cards do not charge interest, but carry an annual fee. Spending limits adjust with usage and payment history.     There may be pain ahead as American Express works to grow small-business lending. The credit-card business has gotten more competitive because banks and card issuers view the loans and transaction fees as a relatively stable source of revenue. Also, consumer spending has slowed despite cheaper gasoline.     American Express shares have fallen 25 percent so far this year. The company plans to cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017.

Berkshire also owns close to 90 businesses in industries including energy, food, insurance, manufacturing, railroads and retail.

85,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives.Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier.Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share.Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion.Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire's intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501.For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.Buffett's largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash.Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G shares that Berkshire now owns.Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market.Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell. Buffett said BNSF's profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire's insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments.The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments.Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31.In Friday trading, Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.

99,"  Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) on Wednesday reported no growth in quarterly comparable sales at U.S. stores for the first time in more than six years, hurt by weak sales in April.Sales at stores in the United States open more than a year were flat, falling short of the 1.9 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at U.S stores had last fallen in 2009.Analysts earlier this month said a pullback in spending by high-income consumers, who make up Costco's core customer base, contributed to lower comparable sales in April, when the company posted flat growth.Unseasonably cold weather in April, transition issues arising from the company switching to Visa Inc (V.N) for its co-branded credit cards from American Express Co (AXP.N) may have also weighed on comparable sales during the third quarter ended May 8.While retailers such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported weak quarterly sales, citing unseasonable weather and lower demand for apparel and electronics, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which largely caters to lower-income customers, reported better-than-expected sales, helped by demand for basic apparel and higher drug prices.  The quarterly results from retailers suggest that lower-income customers are spending while middle and higher-income customers are holding back. Comparable store sales were flat in the third quarter, lower than the 1 percent rise analysts were expecting. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, sales at comparable stores rose 3 percent, below the average analyst estimate of 4.6 percent growth.Net income attributable to Costco rose to $545 million, or $1.24 per share, in the third quarter ended May 8 from $516 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 2.6 percent to $26.77 billion from $26.10 billion a year earlier.Analysts on an average had expected earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $27.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Comparable sales at U.S stores had last fallen in 2009.Analysts earlier this month said a pullback in spending by high-income consumers, who make up Costco's core customer base, contributed to lower comparable sales in April, when the company posted flat growth.Unseasonably cold weather in April, transition issues arising from the company switching to Visa Inc (V.N) for its co-branded credit cards from American Express Co (AXP.N) may have also weighed on comparable sales during the third quarter ended May 8.While retailers such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported weak quarterly sales, citing unseasonable weather and lower demand for apparel and electronics, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which largely caters to lower-income customers, reported better-than-expected sales, helped by demand for basic apparel and higher drug prices.  The quarterly results from retailers suggest that lower-income customers are spending while middle and higher-income customers are holding back. Comparable store sales were flat in the third quarter, lower than the 1 percent rise analysts were expecting. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, sales at comparable stores rose 3 percent, below the average analyst estimate of 4.6 percent growth.Net income attributable to Costco rose to $545 million, or $1.24 per share, in the third quarter ended May 8 from $516 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 2.6 percent to $26.77 billion from $26.10 billion a year earlier.Analysts on an average had expected earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $27.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

102,"   By Matt Siegel and Se Young Lee | SYDNEY/SEOUL  SYDNEY/SEOUL Smartphone leader Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has for years been a spectator as Apple (AAPL.O) built a services ""ecosystem"" supporting its products. But now, as the two develop the market for mobile payments, the Korean tech giant is taking the fight to its U.S. archrival.For Apple, offering users the ability to tap their iPhones on sales terminals to buy a coffee, snack or train ticket is a fresh revenue stream, like its iTunes music and entertainment service. The banks it works with cough up a small charge for each transaction - reportedly 0.15 percent in the United States.Samsung, which has trailed behind its competitors in software and services, is taking a different path.It is not seeking fees from its financial partners, viewing Samsung Pay as an engine to drive sales of phones and other devices.""We're a hardware company, and at the end of the day I think what we're trying to do is get people who hold (one of) our phones and use it ... to just love it more,"" Elle Kim, Global Vice President of Samsung Pay, told Reuters in Sydney.It is early days yet; the companies' payment services have been direct competitors in the United States only since last September, China for four months, and Australia and Singapore for just a week or two. Apple Pay is also available in Britain and Canada, and Samsung Pay in South Korea and Spain.Apple Pay usage totaled just $10.9 billion last year, mostly in the United States, tiny compared with China, where an estimated $1 trillion worth of mobile transactions were completed last year, dominated by Internet giants Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK).Alibaba and Tencent have ambitions to develop their business outside China, too, but have yet to make significant inroads.Samsung said on Tuesday its payments service had processed more than $1 billion in South Korea since its August launch – still only a fraction of the country's $500 billion-plus credit card transactions last year.There is no reason why banks can't work with both rivals, since these are not exclusive technologies, but Samsung's approach could help it scale up quickly with banking partners. ""Apple wants more control, and the negotiations are more complex,"" said Christophe Uzureau, Vice President of Digital Payment Strategies at Gartner. ""Samsung is more flexible, so from a bank's perspective there is an ability to have more flexible terms and conditions.""The two have partnerships with a long list of banks and credit card companies in the United States and have many of the same partners in Singapore.Samsung Pay launched in Australia last Wednesday with partners American Express (AXP.N) and Citibank (C.N). Apple Pay has also teamed up with Amex there and with Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ)(ANZ.AX), so far the only major local bank to offer either service to its customers.Australia's large banks all have their own mobile payment services, though National Australia Bank (NAB.AX) said it welcomed strategic partnerships in this space, and Westpac (WBC.AX) said it had discussions with a range of wallet providers and was assessing its options. EXTRA WEAPON Samsung Pay also has an extra technological weapon in its armory.Apple Pay only works with sales terminals equipped with Near Field Communications (NFC) technology, but phones compatible with Samsung Pay use both NFC and the older technology Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), which mimics the magnetic strip on traditional payment cards.That gives Samsung an edge in countries like the United States, where NFC terminals are far from ubiquitous, said Thomas Ko, Vice President of Samsung's Service R&D Team, Mobile communications business.""Mobile payments need at the end of the day to make it available as much as where plastic is acceptable. If the mobile payments cannot match it, it's very difficult for someone to replace their wallet with a mobile,"" Ko said. Both Apple and Samsung, which sell 40 percent of global smartphones, are investing in mobile payment in part to defend their premium product pricing as the industry's growth slows and Chinese rivals bring down average selling prices.Apple Pay is currently available on its late-model iPhones and the Apple Watch. Samsung Pay is available on its newer Galaxy mobile phones and some tablets.Samsung plans to offer the service on its virtual reality headset, and hopes that will enhance sales of the novel device.""Both companies will be looking to their payment solutions to drive loyalty,"" said Foad Fadaghi, managing director of technology researcher Telsyte.Apple has been able to drive loyalty through its unique ecosystem and proprietary operating software, while Samsung, like many makers, runs its phones on Google's (GOOG.O) Android software, making it more difficult to differentiate its offering.""It's more important for Samsung to have services like Samsung Pay so that it can edge out its competitors which are numerous and many in the Android space, particularly the Chinese vendors,"" Fodaghi said.Kim Ki-su, an IT industry worker in Seoul who uses Samsung Pay, has witnessed the marketing power of the service.""I know several people who were trying to decide between Galaxy S7 and LG’s G5, and they ultimately ended up with the S7 because of Samsung Pay,"" he said.

104,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is seeking permission from the Federal Reserve to increase its ownership stake in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), after reaching the 10 percent level that could prompt increased regulatory scrutiny.According to papers obtained by Reuters on Friday, Berkshire said it learned in mid-March that its Wells Fargo stake, including 2.01 million shares held by Buffett, had reached 10.01 percent because of buybacks by the San Francisco-based bank, which decreased the number of shares outstanding.Though the stake later dipped to 9.97 percent, Berkshire said it has again risen above 10 percent because of more buybacks by Wells, which is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. Berkshire said it has bought no Wells Fargo shares since Oct. 21.""Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position in Wells Fargo and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes,"" according to the papers, which were dated June 14 and submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes.Berkshire said it had no dollar value in mind for purchases, had no plans to make significant changes to Wells Fargo's strategy or corporate structure, and was not contemplating changes to the bank's management or board. Bloomberg News earlier reported the paperwork.Berkshire's investment in Wells Fargo is worth more than $23 billion.""We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer, and we appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown,"" Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said an email. Buffett has long been a supporter of Wells Fargo, calling it ""very well run"" and a ""terrific operation,"" and saying that Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a ""fabulous job.""The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes.In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit stakes not designed to exert a ""controlling influence,"" but would review any resulting business relationships ""case-by-case."" The U.S. Treasury Department has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in ""control"" of a big bank if an investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement.Berkshire also owns 15.94 percent of American Express Co (AXP.N), the application and Reuters data show.Based in Omaha, Nebraska, Berkshire also operates close to 90 businesses such as auto insurer Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and various apparel, energy and industrial companies.

113,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has today affirmed American Express  Company's (AXP) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A', Viability Rating  (VR) at 'a' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.  A full  list of ratings is detailed at the end of this release. Today's rating actions have been taken as part of Fitch's periodic peer review  of U.S. consumer lending-focused internet banks, which comprises four publicly  rated firms.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT The rating affirmations reflect AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, peer-superior credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization.  Rating constraints include meaningful erosion in AXP's earnings growth outlook,  a modestly weakened market position and greater earnings volatility stemming  from competitive and regulatory dynamics. Specifically, AXP faces challenges  stemming from the loss of several co-brand card partnerships, most notably the  termination of its co-brand relationship with Costco Wholesale Corporation  (Costco) in the second quarter of 2016 (2Q16), which had represented nearly 10%  of AXP's consolidated revenue. Additional rating constraints include AXP's  concentrated and cyclical business model, potential funding sensitivity  associated with wholesale and internet deposit funding sources, the likelihood  of asset quality reversion from current levels, and continued elevated  regulatory and legislative risk.  The maintenance of the Negative Rating Outlook reflects continued execution risk  as the company engages in strategic initiatives aimed at addressing the  challenges related to its profitability and business model. These initiatives  include a $1 billion cost reduction plan (run rate by the end of 2017),  acceleration of revolving loan growth by expanding its share of loans from its  existing Card Member base, achieving parity of merchant acceptance with Visa and  MasterCard in the U.S. by the end of 2019, and accelerating revenue growth  through increased penetration of the small business and middle market components  of its Global Commercial Services segment. At the same time, AXP is seeking to  respond to rapidly evolving technological developments in the payment space and  a period of, what Fitch views as, elevated management turnover.  Although competitive intensity in the credit card sector has manifested itself  most recently in the bidding process for co-brand partnerships, competition has  also intensified in rewards offerings to premium customers, particularly  cash-back products. Other payment networks have also become more aggressive in  offering lower interchange fees to merchants that produce significant volume,  and emerging payment technologies could further pressure merchant pricing. These  developments could drive more rapid erosion of AXP's discount rate and add  additional pressure to operating margins.  Additionally, the timing over which the company will be able to re-establish its  long-term financial targets is uncertain. Recent earnings guidance which  included an estimated $1 billion pre-tax gain from the expected sale of the  Costco card portfolio, and excluded any restructuring charges related to its  ongoing cost reduction initiatives implies that the company would be unable to  achieve its long-term EPS growth target of 12% - 15% until 2018 at the earliest.  Likewise, revenue growth has fallen short of the company's 8% long-term target  in recent years, which has created uncertainty as to whether such a level of  growth is reasonably attainable over the long term. In addition to the previously mentioned secular headwinds, Fitch believes  several cyclical headwinds could pressure AXP's revenue and EPS growth over the  near term. These include a stronger dollar, higher interest rates, credit  normalization, and weak global economic growth. Over the longer term, Fitch  believes AXP's operating performance should remain strong relative to peers,  supported by the company's largely fee-based business model and scale  advantages, the continued secular shift in global payments away from cash and  checks, a growing card member base, and continued expense discipline. Fitch also  expects the company to continue to seek to innovate and invest in new  opportunities that accelerate growth toward its longer-term financial targets. Credit performance is expected to remain among the strongest of large credit  card issuers, although charge-offs and delinquencies will likely start to  normalize later this year, particularly as balances from new accounts season.  Fitch expects provision expenses to increase over the next several quarters  driven primarily by portfolio seasoning and loan balance growth, as well as some  modest deterioration in credit metrics. Net charge-offs on the lending portfolio  increased 10 basis points (bps) to 1.5% in the first half of 2016 (1H16) but  remained well below other large credit card issuers and are near historical  lows. Reserve coverage remained strong at 1.8% of loans and 160% of loans past  due at June 30, 2016.  Unlike many of its peers, rising interest rates are an earnings headwind for  AXP, although Fitch believes the impact from rising interest rates is likely to  be manageable. At Dec. 31, 2015, assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase  in interest rates, AXP estimates that net interest income (NII) over the  following 12-month period would decrease by approximately $216 million. The  durability of AXP's internet deposits in a rising interest rate environment is  also unproven. The company's already strong regulatory capital ratios improved further from the  prior year end, driven in large part by the sale of the Costco portfolio in June  2016. The company's common equity Tier I ratio increased 110 bps to 13.5% at the  end of 2Q16. Additionally, AXP continued to perform well relative to peers in  the Federal Reserve's most recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  (CCAR), albeit not quite to the degree of outperformance in prior year CCARs. As  part of this review, AXP received a non-objection related to its capital plan  submitted in April 2016, and announced a roughly 10% increase in its quarterly  common dividend and a share repurchase authorization of $3.3 billion over the  four quarters ended 2Q17.  Given a share repurchase program that is significantly below its previous $6.6  billion (over five quarters) authorization, Fitch expects AXP's payout ratio as  a percentage of earnings to moderate from the prior year's level when it  exceeded 100% of net income. Nonetheless, Fitch expects the company's regulatory  capital ratios to trend back toward 2015 levels over the next couple of years as  management emphasizes loan growth as part of its overall growth strategy.  AXP's liquidity profile remains a rating strength. AXP had approximately $34  billion of readily available cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2016, of  which a portion is used to fund daily operating activities. This compared to  $16.7 billion of long-term debt and certificate of deposit maturities over the  next 12 months. Of the $16.7 billion of debt and deposits maturing over the next  12 months, $10.4 billion consisted of unsecured debt maturities. The company is  also subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a liquidity standard imposed  by bank regulators to measure liquidity under a stress scenario, which AXP  reported that it was in compliance with as of June 30, 2016.   The affirmation of AXP's Short-Term IDRs at 'F1' reflects the strongest  intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments and maintains the  correspondence between short-term and long-term IDRs, as the 'F1' short-term IDR  can correspond to both an 'a+' and an 'a' VR under Fitch's criteria. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES AXP's rating on the 3.625% subordinated notes due December 2024 is one notch  below the entity's VR of 'a' in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each  instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile.  The subordinated note rating includes one notch for loss severity given the  subordination of these securities in the capital structure, and zero notches for  non-performance given contractual limitations on interest payment deferrals and  no mandatory trigger events which could adversely impact performance. AXP's preferred stock ratings are rated five notches below AXP's VR of 'a' in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profile. The preferred stock  ratings include two notches for loss severity given these securities deep  subordination in the capital structure, and three notches for non-performance  given that the coupons of these securities are non-cumulative and fully  discretionary. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS AXP Centurion Bank's and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings of 'A+/F1+'  are rated one notch higher than their respective IDR's because U.S. uninsured  deposits benefit from depositor preference in the U.S. Fitch believes depositor  preference in the U.S. gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY AXP's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank subsidiaries, reflecting  its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a  source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized  reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary  failure and default probabilities. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR AXP has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, AXP is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  sovereign support is unlikely. AXP's IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any  support. RATING SENSITIVITIES IVR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT  Negative rating action could be driven by an inability to execute on  management's growth initiatives and cost reduction plan, a material degradation  in credit performance beyond expected normalization, a sharper than expected  erosion in AXP's discount rate, the termination of additional co-brand card  relationships, and/or meaningfully weaker liquidity and capital levels. Negative  rating momentum could also be driven by additional regulatory and/or legal  challenges, technological developments in payments, and increased competitive  intensity that leads to significant erosion in AXP's market share and  competitive position. That said, potential further negative rating actions would be likely to be based  on how several of the aforementioned factors develop rather than a single  factor, and a resolution is more likely to occur toward the outer end of Fitch's  Outlook period given the deliberate pace at which several of these factors are  expected to evolve. The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if the company is able to  demonstrate resiliency in its competitive position and maintain operating  performance that is consistently above peers without meaningfully weakening its  credit profile and/or capitalization levels.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The subordinated debt rating is directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. The preferred stock ratings are directly linked to AXP's VR and would move in  tandem with any changes in AXP's credit profile. LONG-AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS AXP Centurion Bank and AXP Bank, FSB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one  notch higher than each company's IDR and therefore are sensitive to any changes  in their respective IDR's. The deposit ratings are primarily sensitive to any  change in AXP's long- and short-term IDRs. HOLDING COMPANY Should AXP's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential Fitch could notch the holding  company IDR and VR below the ratings of the operating companies. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since AXP's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  American Express Company --Long-Term IDR at 'A'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability Rating at 'a'; --Senior debt at 'A'; --Short-term debt at 'F1' --3.625% subordinated notes due December 2024 at 'A-'; --Preferred shares, series B at 'BB+'; --Preferred shares, series C at 'BB+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and  distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to  three days earlier than to print subscribers.
