0,"  DETROIT Feb 13 BorgWarner Inc, which makes automotive turbochargers and emissions systems, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday on strong demand for all-wheel drive systems, dual clutch transmission modules and other parts in its drivetrain business.The auto parts maker, whose shares rose 1.5 percent in morning trading, also reiterated the full-year profit outlook it provided last month, although Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker called the margin forecast very conservative.""The bad news in the results was the ongoing softness in the core engine business,"" Shanker said in a research note. ""The good news was the continued strength of drivetrain.""The Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company is one of the biggest suppliers of turbocharging technology, which automakers have been using to boost fuel economy and meet upcoming federal standards for mileage.Net income in the fourth quarter rose nearly 17 percent to $141.4 million, or 62 cents a share, from $121.2 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items, BorgWarner earned 79 cents a share, 8 cents more than analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected.Analysts credited some of the earnings beat to a lower-than-expected tax rate as well as low-than-anticipated corporate expenses. Guggenheim Securities analyst Matthew Stover estimated those two factors had aided the bottom line by a combined 5 cents a share. Revenue rose 10 percent to $1.89 billion. Analysts had expected $1.9 billion.In the company's engine segment, adjusted earnings rose 14 percent to $208 million, below expectations of $224 million by Morgan Stanley's Shanker. But the drivetrain segment's profit jumped 43 percent to $71 million, exceeding his estimate of $59 million.BorgWarner affirmed its 2014 outlook, saying it still expected to earn $3.10 to $3.25 a share. Analysts forecast $3.23. As part of that outlook, the company expects net sales growth of 7 percent to 11 percent from 2013, excluding acquisitions, and operating income margins of 12.5 percent or higher.BorgWarner's 2013 margins were 12.4 percent, according to Shanker.The 2014 outlook excludes the impact of the pending acquisition of Gustav Wahler.

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB+' to  BorgWarner Inc.'s (BWA) proposed $1 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes.  The Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for BWA is 'BBB+' and the Rating Outlook is  Stable. The proposed notes will be issued in two tranches, a $500 million 10-year  tranche and a $500 million 30-year tranche. Proceeds from the proposed notes  will be used to term-out outstanding borrowings on BWA's commercial paper (CP)  program and for general corporate purposes. At year-end 2014, BWA had $461  million outstanding on its CP program. Although the proposed notes will increase  BWA's leverage, Fitch expects leverage (debt/Fitch-adjusted EBITDA) to remain in  the low 1x range following the issuance, which remains consistent with the  company's ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS BWA's ratings are supported by the company's strong competitive position as a  key global supplier of engine and drivetrain components, significant free cash  flow (FCF) generation potential, solid consolidated liquidity position and low  leverage. BWA managed through the last economic downturn relatively well, and  with a product portfolio largely focused on technologies that enhance fuel  efficiency, such as turbochargers and dual-clutch transmission components, its  sales growth is likely to continue outpacing global auto production over the  intermediate term. In addition, efficient capacity utilization and a focus on  cost control have resulted in profitability that is high for the industry,  contributing to strong FCF generation and providing the company with significant  financial flexibility. A primary rating concern is the relatively small amount of cash that BWA has  been maintaining in the U.S. Consolidated liquidity at year-end 2014 included  $798 million in cash and cash equivalents, but only $1.8 million of that cash  was in the U.S. About 76% of BWA's revenue in 2014 was generated outside the  U.S. Although the company has a need to maintain a significant level of cash  outside the U.S. to fund its sizeable non-U.S. operations and to potentially  fund overseas acquisitions, it appears that the company has been increasingly  tapping its CP program to partially fund its U.S. operations and to pay for  dividends and share repurchases. As noted above, a portion of the proceeds from  the proposed issuance will be used to refinance BWA's CP balance on a long-term  basis. At year-end 2014, BWA had $461 million in CP outstanding. Following the  issuance of the proposed notes, Fitch expects the company will not have a need  to raise incremental debt in the near term. However, there is a risk that  leverage could rise further over time if the company continues to borrow to fund  its U.S. activities. An increase in EBITDA leverage (debt/Fitch-calculated  EBITDA) above 1.5x for an extended period could result in a negative rating  action. Other concerns include BWA's ongoing interest in acquisitions, which could  result in higher leverage, and an increased focus on shareholder-friendly  activities. BWA recently announced a $1 billion three-year share repurchase  program, a meaningful increase following a total of $661 million in share  repurchases over the past three years. The company also reinstated its dividend  in mid-2013 and paid a total of $116 million in dividends in 2014. These  concerns are mitigated somewhat by the company's consistently positive FCF  generation. FCF totaled $102 million in 2014 even after the company increased  capital spending by $145 million to support its substantial book of future  business. Despite the increase in shareholder-friendly activities, BWA's credit profile  remains among the strongest in the U.S. auto supply sector. EBITDA leverage at  year-end 2014 was only 0.9x, with $1.3 billion in debt and full-year EBITDA of  $1.4 billion. Fitch expects leverage will rise to around 1.3x following the  issuance of the proposed notes. Funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage  was 1.6x at year-end 2014. BWA's consolidated liquidity position is strong,  although as noted, nearly all of its $798 million in cash was outside the U.S.  at year-end 2014. In addition to its cash, BWA has access to a $1 billion  unsecured revolver which backs its $1 billion CP program. The company's next  significant debt maturity is in November 2016 when $150 million in senior  unsecured notes come due. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Global economic conditions improve at a moderate pace, leading to  low-single-digit growth in global auto production; --BWA's revenue growth continues to outpace growth in global auto production; --Annual capital spending runs between 5% and 6% of revenue over the next few  years; --Cash not used for acquisitions is used to fund share repurchases; --Dividends grow annually over the intermediate term; --No material debt reduction over the next several years. RATING SENSITIVITIES BWA's 'BBB+' IDR indicates that a near-term upgrade of the company's ratings is  unlikely. Typically, the inherent cyclicality and potential financial pressures  of the auto supply industry result in a soft cap on IDRs at the 'BBB+' level,  although in rare cases a supplier with a very strong business profile and  unusually strong credit protection metrics could be considered for the 'A'  category. Negative:  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --An unexpected sharp drop in global auto production; --An increase in leverage to above 1.5x for an extended period; --A decline in the company's EBITDA margin to below 12%; --A significant increase in long-term debt to support shareholder-friendly  actions. Fitch currently rates BWA as follows: --Long-term IDR 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Unsecured credit facility rating 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes rating 'BBB+'; --CP rating 'F2'.

21,"   By Jessica Dye  A subsidiary of BorgWarner Inc is off the hook for a massive $32.5 million punitive damage award in an asbestos lawsuit, after a California state appeals court ruled plaintiffs had failed to delve deeply enough into the company's financial condition. California's Second Appellate District Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned punitive damages awarded to the family and estate of Secundino Medina. In a 2010 lawsuit he alleged that he developed mesothelioma after asbestos exposure he blamed on a number of companies, including defendant BorgWarner Morse TEC Inc (BWMT), represented on appeal by Theodore Boutrous of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. The unpublished ruling, however, left intact approximately $6.4 million in economic and non-economic damages.
