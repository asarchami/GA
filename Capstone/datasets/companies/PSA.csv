0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings of  Public Storage (PSA) as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --$300 million unsecured revolving line of credit at 'A+'; --$3.6 billion preferred stock at 'A'. In addition, Fitch assigned an 'A' rating to the company's $225 million 6.375%  series Y preferred stock priced on March 10, 2014. Fitch does not rate the  company's $700 million one-year unsecured term loan as this is a short-term  obligation. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating affirmation reflects the company's minimal debt, which results in low  leverage and limited refinance risk, coupled with Fitch's expectation of  sustained improvements in fixed-charge coverage due to solid performance of the  company's self-storage property portfolio and lower preferred dividends. Credit  strengths also include strong liquidity and a long management track record.  The rating is balanced by the company's focus on a specialty property type and  moderate portfolio concentration in regions such as California and Texas,  although the portfolio includes over 2,200 properties in 38 states and seven  European countries. UNCONVENTIONAL FINANCING STRATEGY LIMITS REFINANCE RISK Fitch expects PSA's net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA  ratio to sustain in the mid-2.0x range over the next 12 to 24 months, which is  solid for the 'A+' IDR. Fitch expects to see modest improvement over the rating  horizon (typically two to three years) due to mid-to-low single-digit same-store  net operating income (NOI) growth and incremental NOI as the company stabilizes  recent developments and acquisitions. In a stress case in which same-store NOI  declines, this metric would approximate 3.0x, which would be consistent with an  IDR of 'A'. PSA's unique financing strategy, which emphasizes preferred equity, results in  minimal refinance risk that supports Fitch's ratings for the company. PSA's  debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA, was 0.6x as of Dec. 31, 2013, compared with  0.3x and 0.2x as of Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011, respectively. While not  indicative of leverage, given the perpetual nature of PSA's preferred stock, the  ratio of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA was  appropriate for the 'A+' IDR at 3.2x as of Dec. 31, 2013, compared with 2.5x and  2.8x as of Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011. STRONG FUNDAMENTALS AIDED BY LOW SUPPLY GROWTH Fitch expects PSA's same-store NOI growth to moderate, but remain solidly  positive through 2016. Conservatively, same-store NOI growth should taper off  but remain in the positive low- to mid-single-digits during the forecast period.  Higher rental rates for new and renewal leases will drive the majority of the  gains. Occupancies are expected to remain flat and are conservatively assumed  that expenses grow by approximately 2% per year, compared to expense decreases  of 1.3% and 2.2% in 2013 and 2012. PSA's U.S. portfolio same-store NOI grew by 8.2% during 2013; Europe decreased  by 3.4% due to moderate oversupply in select markets against the backdrop of  weak macro-economic conditions. Low levels of new supply for the industry are  supporting PSA's operating fundamentals. The company's realized annual rent per  occupied square foot in the U.S. same-store portfolio increased by 3.8% to  $14.13 in 2013 from $13.61 in 2012. Weighted average occupancy for the year rose  by 1.4% to 93.3% in 2013 from 91.9% in 2012. PSA's internal growth has slightly lagged its public REIT peers during the last  five years. Since 2009 the company has averaged 3.8% same-store NOI growth vs.  4.3% growth for the sector. PSA's peers have generally benefited from larger  occupancy gains stemming from a greater amount of vacant space at the trough of  the last cycle. Indeed, PSA's occupancy has averaged a 540-basis point premium  to the sector during the last five years, but the spread has compressed from  6.5% in 2009 to 3.2% in 2013. Differences in calculation methodologies can challenge making same-store NOI  growth comparisons across REITs, including self-storage REITs. For example, some  companies will include tenant insurance in same-store NOI; PSA does not.  Additionally, PSA allocates internet marketing expense at the property level  while some of its peers reflect this expense at the corporate level, in general  and administrative expense.   REFINANCING OF HIGHER-COST PREFERRED BOOSTS COVERAGE Fitch anticipates that fixed-charge coverage (FCC) will approach the mid-6.0x  range by 2016, benefiting from preferred stock transactions during 2013. In a  stress case in which same-store NOI declines by approximately 4%, coverage would  fall to the mid-5.5x range, which would remain consistent with the 'A+' IDR. Fitch expects FCC to sustain at levels appropriate for the 'A+' rating. FCC was  6.3x for 2013, compared with 5.5x and 4.7x in 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Improving fundamentals and lower preferred dividends via lower-coupon issuance  used to redeem higher cost preferred stock have contributed towards improving  coverage. Fitch defines coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less recurring  capital expenditures divided by total interest incurred and preferred dividends  and distributions. NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY PRESSURE PSA's $700 million unsecured term loan that matures on Dec. 2, 2014 is  pressuring its near-term liquidity coverage. The company has taken several  actions subsequent to the year-end to improve its liquidity position. These  include the sale of a 51% interest in its loan to Shurgard Europe ($216 million  of net proceeds) and the issuance of $225 million of preferred equity. Fitch  estimates that the company has paid down $50.1 million of year-end revolver debt  and approximately $300 million under its term loan with the proceeds from these  activities. Pro-forma liquidity coverage has improved to 1.4x from 0.9x at  year-end 2013. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses. Sources  of liquidity include unrestricted cash pro forma, availability from the  unsecured revolving credit facility, and projected retained cash flows from  operating activities after dividends and distributions. Uses of liquidity  include debt maturities and projected recurring capital expenditures. The company has excellent contingent liquidity from a large unencumbered  self-storage property pool. Approximately 97.6% of the company's $12.3 billion  real estate portfolio was unencumbered as of Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch calculates  that based on a 10% capitalization rate on the company's unencumbered property  NOI, unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt and preferred stock was 3.2x  as of Dec. 31, 2013 and 3.5x pro forma for the company's sale of a 51% interest  in its Shurgard Europe loan and $225 million preferred equity issuance. DISCIPLINED AND CYCLE-TESTED MANAGEMENT Public Storage's management team has navigated through various commercial real  estate and capital market cycles with a conservative balance sheet, which is  factored into the 'A+' rating. The company's utilization of preferred stock  provides permanent funding for a specialty property type that may be less liquid  than other commercial real estate sectors. This strategy also insulates Public  Storage from weak capital market environments, which Fitch views favorably. MODERATE GEOGRAPHIC PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK The company has moderate portfolio concentration within certain U.S. regions,  including Southern California at 12% of rentable square feet, Texas at 12% and  Florida at 12%. While not anticipated by Fitch, reduced economic activity and an  increase in price-sensitive customers in geographic regions in which PSA is  concentrated could reduce overall earnings power. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects the company's specialty focus coupled with Fitch's  view that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-6.0x range over the  rating horizon. The Stable Outlook also reflects that the size of the  unencumbered portfolio is also not likely to change materially. The one-notch difference between the company's IDR and preferred stock rating  reflects that unlike the majority of preferred stock issuers in the REIT  industry (which have a two-notch difference between their IDRs and preferred  stock ratings), Public Storage has, and is expected to maintain, limited levels  of debt. Therefore recoveries of preferred stock would likely be stronger than  recoveries of preferred stock of other REITs.  Fitch's ratings for PSA contemplate a moderate level of transitional (i.e.  short-term) unsecured debt in its capital structure used to bridge the timing  gap between completing investments and raising permanent common and/or preferred  equity capital funding. However, the one-notch differential between PSA's IDR  and its preferred obligations has little tolerance for any long-term unsecured  debt in PSA's capital stack.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 7.0x (coverage  was 6.3x in 2013); --Fitch's expectation of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating  EBITDA sustaining below 2.0x (this metric was 3.2x at Dec. 31, 2013). The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 4.0x; --Fitch's expectation of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating  EBITDA sustaining above 3.0x. In addition, a change in PSA's stated financing strategy that included the  issuance of long-term unsecured debt would likely cause Fitch to revise the  company's preferred obligations down two-notches below its IDR, as opposed to  the current one-notch differential.

1,"  (adds value)By Robert HetzMADRID, June 13 Spain will sell up to 49 percent of heavily indebted AENA, the world's biggest airports operator valued at around 16 billion euros ($22 billion), Public Works Minister Ana Pastor said on Friday.The government is expected to net only about 2.2 billion euros from the sale, not enough to make a major dent in Spain's public deficit. Pastor said the aim was to make management of the company more efficient and attract more tourist flights.After years of losses, AENA turned a profit for the first time last year. The 2011 planned sale of AENA by the former Socialist government failed to get off the ground as Spain's deep economic and fiscal crisis made it difficult to get a good price. The government will sell 28 percent of AENA in a public offering on the Spanish stock exchange, Pastor said, and an additional 21 percent will be auctioned to long-term investors. She did not provide financial details.AENA, which owns 46 airports at home and also has international interests such as a stake in London's Luton Airport, is worth up to 16 billion euros ($22 billion) based on valuations of similar companies at 10 times core profit.The government is expected to raise some 2.2 billion euros with the sale of the non-controlling stake in AENA, given the company's debt of some 11.5 billion euros, according to calculations by sector experts. Some government officials are opposed to the state losing control of a strategic asset. Some of Spain's 17 autonomous regions want to be involved in the management of their airports to make sure fees do not rise and to avoid the closure of loss-making airports.Just 13 of the 46 Spanish airports were profitable in 2013, including Madrid, Barcelona and tourist destinations such as Palma de Mallorca, Ibiza and Tenerife. AENA made a profit of 597 million euros in 2013, after huge cost reductions including staff cuts and after benefiting from airport tax hikes, up from a 215 million euro loss in 2011.Spain is the world's third-biggest tourist destination behind France and the United States. AENA is the biggest airport operator in the world in terms of passengers, handling 187.4 million travellers last year.France and Germany have both partially privatised their airport operators.($1 = 0.7345 Euros)   (Writing by Sonya Dowsett; Editing by David Holmes and Elaine Hardcastle)",2014-06-13,PSA,"Fri Jun 13, 2014 | 11:43am EDT",UPDATE 2-Spain to sell 49 pct of debt-laden airport operator AENA,http://www.reuters.com//article/spain-aena-idUSL5N0OU32720140613?type=companyNews
2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed and withdrawn the  following ratings for Public Storage: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Unsecured revolving line of credit at 'A+'; --Preferred stock at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has chosen to withdraw the ratings for Public Storage for commercial  reasons. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A+' IDR reflects the company's minimal debt, which results in low leverage  and limited refinance risk, coupled with Fitch's expectation of sustained  improvements in fixed-charge coverage (FCC) due to solid performance of the  company's self-storage property portfolio and lower preferred dividends.  Factors that balance the rating include the company's focus on a specialty  property type and moderate portfolio concentration in regions such as California  and Texas; the portfolio includes over 2,478 properties in 38 states and seven  European countries.  Fitch's ratings for PSA do not contemplate new long-term unsecured borrowings in  the company's capital stack. The addition of long-term unsecured debt would  likely cause Fitch to rate PSA's preferred stock two notches below its IDR,  rather than one notch.  The one-notch difference between the company's IDR and preferred stock rating  reflects Fitch's view that recovery prospects for PSA's preferred stock would be  stronger than those for the preferred stock of other REITs, given PSA's lack of  senior unsecured borrowings. Fitch typically rates REIT preferreds two notches  below the issuer's IDR given the deeply subordinated nature and loss  characteristics of the instruments, which would likely result in poor recoveries  in the event of a corporate default.  Fitch's IDR for PSA is also supported by the benefit to its liquidity profile  from its funding strategy that relies on common and preferred equity. Fitch's  would consider downgrading the IDR for PSA were the company to issue a material  amount of new long-term unsecured debt, as Fitch would view this as a change in  financial policy, all else equal. PSA has historically limited its unsecured  debt to shorter-term borrowings under its credit facility and a small amount of  unsecured notes it inherited from its 2006 acquisition of Shurgard Storage  Centers, Inc. that the company repaid at maturity. Strategy Limits Repayment Risk Fitch expects PSA's net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA  ratio to sustain in the mid-2.5x range over the next 12 to 24 months, which is  solid for the 'A+' IDR. Fitch anticipates modest improvement through 2017 due to  mid-single-digit same-store net operating income (NOI) growth and incremental  NOI as the company stabilizes recent developments and acquisitions.  PSA's unique financing strategy, which emphasizes preferred equity, results in  minimal refinance risk which supports Fitch's ratings for the company. PSA's net  debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA was 0.1x as of June. 30, 2015, compared with  -0.1x and 0.6x as of Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, respectively.  While not indicative of leverage, given the perpetual nature of PSA's preferred  stock, the ratio of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA  was appropriate for the 'A+' IDR at 2.5x as of June. 30, 2015, compared with  2.6x and 3.1x as of Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, respectively. Refinancing Boost Fixed-Charge Coverage Fitch anticipates that FCC will approach the low-7x range by 2017, benefiting  from same store NOI growth, the stabilization of recent acquisitions and  development deliveries and the refinancing of its $125 million, 6.5% series P  preferred stock in early October, utilizing the company's revolver.  FCC was 6.7x for the TTM ending June 30, 2015, compared with 6.x and 6.3x in  2014 and 2013, respectively. Improving fundamentals and lower preferred  dividends via lower-coupon issuance used to redeem higher-cost preferred stock  have contributed toward improving coverage. Fitch defines coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA less recurring capital expenditures divided by total interest  incurred and preferred dividends and distributions. Adequate Liquidity Position Fitch's stressed liquidity analysis shows PSA's sources of cash exceeding uses  by 1.4x for the July 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016 period. The company's March 2015  amendment of its revolving credit facility has improved its liquidity profile.  PSA expanded the facility size to $500 million from $300 million and extended  the expiration to March 31, 2020. Unfunded development expenses of roughly $333  million are the company's largest use of cash. The company also has $125 million  earmarked to redeem its series P preferreds in October and $97 million of  committed acquisition expenses.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses. Sources  of liquidity include unrestricted cash pro forma, availability from the  unsecured revolving credit facility, and projected retained cash flows from  operating activities after dividends and distributions. Uses of liquidity  include debt maturities and projected recurring capital expenditures. The company has excellent contingent liquidity from a large unencumbered  self-storage property pool. Fitch estimates that approximately 98% of the  company's $12.8 billion operating real estate portfolio was unencumbered at Dec.  31, 2014. The company had only $11 million of unsecured borrowings under its  revolver outstanding at June 30, 2015.  Strong Fundamentals Aided by Low Supply Growth Fitch expects PSA's same-store NOI growth to remain solidly positive through  2017. Conservatively, same-store NOI growth should taper off but remain in the  positive mid-single-digits during the forecast period. Mid-single digit rental  rates for new and renewal leases will drive the majority of the gains. Fitch  expects occupancies to remain flat and has conservatively assumed that expenses  grow by approximately 2% per year, similar to its 1.9% expense growth in 2014. PSA's U.S. portfolio same-store NOI grew by 8.7% year-to-date through June 30,  2015, based on a 6.4% increase in revenues and 1.1% expense growth. Low levels  of new supply for the self-storage industry are supporting PSA's operating  fundamentals.  The company's realized annual rent per occupied square foot in its U.S.  same-store portfolio grew by 5.9% to $15.33 during the first six months of the  year from $14.48 during the comparable 2014 period. Weighted average occupancy  was 95.7% at June 30, 2015 - up 60 basis points (bps) year-over-year. PSA's internal growth has slightly lagged its public REIT peers during the last  five years. The company has averaged 5.9% same-store NOI growth vs. 6.9% growth  for the sector during the last five calendar years. PSA's peers have generally  benefited from larger occupancy gains stemming from a greater amount of vacant  space at the trough of the last cycle. Indeed, PSA's occupancy has averaged a  540-bp premium to the sector during the last five years, but the spread has  compressed from 6.7% in 2010 to 3.2% in 2014. Moderate Geographic Portfolio Concentration Risk The company has moderate portfolio concentration within certain U.S. regions,  including Southern California at 12% of rentable square feet, Texas at 12% and  Florida at 12%. While not anticipated by Fitch, reduced economic activity and an  increase in price-sensitive customers in geographic regions in which PSA is  concentrated could reduce overall earnings power. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects the company's specialty focus coupled with Fitch's  view that FCC will sustain in the mid-6x range over the rating horizon. The  Stable Outlook also reflects that the size of the unencumbered portfolio is also  not likely to change materially. Preferred Stock Notching The one-notch difference between the company's IDR and preferred stock rating  reflects that unlike the majority of preferred stock issuers in the REIT  industry (which have a two-notch difference between their IDRs and preferred  stock ratings), PSA has, and is expected to maintain, limited levels of debt.  Therefore recoveries of preferred stock would likely be stronger than recoveries  of preferred stock of other REITs. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Mid-single digit same-store NOI growth through 2017; --$100 million of acquisitions during the balance of 2015 and $200 million in  2016 and 2017 at going in yields of 6%; --No incremental dispositions during the forecast period; --Development deliveries of $100 million per year through 2017; --Development spending of $100 million during the remainder of 2015 and $150  million in 2016 and 2017; --Repayment of the company's $125 million, 6.5% series P preferred stock in  early October, and no additional preferred refinancings during the remainder of  the forecast period; --$200 million of term loan borrowings in 4Q'15 at a fixed rate of 2.5%; --G&A growth of 2% per year; --Dividend growth of 3% per annum.
