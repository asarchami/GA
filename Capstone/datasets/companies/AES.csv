0,"  * GDF CEO says demand for energy services grows 2.5 pct/yr* Growth comes despite weak economy, falling power demand* Cofely European and global leader in fragmented sector* GDF denies plans for a major acquisition, stock recoversBy Geert De ClercqPARIS, Jan 21 GDF Suez can achieve most of its planned growth without resorting to acquisitions, its chief executive said on Tuesday, after banking and industry sources said Talisman Energy had rebuffed a takeover approach by the French utility.The sources said on Monday that GDF was still seeking acquisitions of up to $20 billion outside Europe and had looked into buying companies including U.S. utility AES Corp  after being rejected by Canadian oil and gas producer Talisman.CEO Gerard Mestrallet denied any such plans on Tuesday and insisted on the strong organic growth prospects of the gas and power utility's existing businesses, notably its energy services provider Cofely.GDF is playing down the prospect of game-changing, multi-billion-dollar tie-ups for now. Cofely said last month it wanted to buy several smaller peers with combined revenue of 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to drive home its advantage as Europe's biggest provider of energy services for buildings. ""In an environment with economic growth around zero and with energy demand falling by 1 to 2 percent per year, we are seeing growth of around 2.5 percent per year in demand for energy efficiency services,"" Mestrallet told reporters in Paris.Alongside its push in energy efficiency services, GDF wants to consolidate its position this year as the biggest independent power producer in emerging economies, in particular by expanding its energy services in those countries too.""I believe efficiency needs will also grow in the emerging world,"" Mestrallet said, adding that this was why GDF last year bought a 51 percent stake in Emac, a Brazilian air-conditioning maintenance company with 850 staff.In 2012, GDF also bought Chilean energy services firm Termika and invested in the urban cooling network of Cyberjaya city in Malaysia.Mestrallet said GDF had no plans for major takeovers, and voiced confidence in the group's current balance of traditional, asset-heavy power generation and labour-intensive and capital-light energy services. NO IPO SEEN FOR COFELY With its 90,000 staff, Cofely represents 60 percent of GDF Suez's headcount but just 15 percent of its 2012 sales and 7 percent of core earnings. It earned 2012 core profit of 1 billion euros on sales of nearly 15 billion euros.Following the 190-million-pound acquisition of the facilities management unit of Britain's Balfour Beatty  last year, Cofely now has turnover of around 16 billion, Mestrallet said. GDF had 97 billion euros of revenue in 2012. In France, Cofely competes with Dalkia, Vinci Energies , Sodexo and privately held Spie, which is considering an IPO later this year.Mestrallet said energy services remained fragmented and unstructured worldwide, effectively making GDF Suez-Cofely the world's number one player in the business, even if the bulk of its activity is in Europe.""This industry is fragmented, and we want to take advantage of that to further develop our energy services,"" he said.Mestrallet said GDF's main competitor in France, state-controlled utility EDF, did not have an energy services activity and was now acquiring one by buying the French arm of Dalkia in a deal with Veolia.""We are years ahead in this business. We do not want to lose this advantage,"" Mestrallet said.He ruled out an IPO for Cofely.""It is out of the question that we would part with this activity. It is an enormous asset,"" Mestrallet said.GDF stock, which had fallen as much as 3 percent on the news of its interest in Talisman and AES, retraced half of that drop and stood 1.6 percent lower in early afternoon trade.",2014-01-21,AES,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 10:26am EST","UPDATE 2-GDF looks to energy services, not big takeovers, for growth",http://www.reuters.com//article/gdf-ceo-idUSL5N0KV21320140121?type=companyNews
1,"  * Offers to buy Pepco for $6.83 bln, or $27.25/share in cash* Deal will help Exelon sell more power at regulated rates* Exelon shares fall 5 pct, Pepco up 18 pct   (Updates share price, adds Breakingviews link)By Swetha Gopinath and Kanika SikkaApril 30 Exelon Corp said it would buy Pepco Holdings Inc for $6.83 billion, helping it overtake Duke Energy Corp as the biggest power distribution company in the United States.The deal will allow Exelon to sell more power at stable rates set by regulators at a time when an abundance of cheap natural gas is dragging down power prices in the open market.Exelon's move to reduce its exposure to the vagaries of the wholesale power market comes as U.S. utilities struggle with falling electricity demand in both the open and regulated markets due to increased energy efficiency and a weak economy.However, Exelon's stock fell as much as 5 percent to $34.22. ""Some investors might question Exelon's desire to increase the company's regulated exposure at a time when power markets appear to be recovering,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton.The company defended the acquisition saying it was maintaining substantial exposure to the recovery in prices.""The acquisition also supports our belief in the value of an integrated utility, with a balanced mix of regulated and non-regulated cash flows,"" Exelon Chief Executive Chris Crane, who will lead the combined company, said on a conference call.Exelon said its earnings from the regulated business is expected to rise to as much as 65 percent after the deal, from about 60 percent now. Pepco's shares rose as much as 18 percent before closing 17.4 percent higher at $26.76, slightly below Exelon's offer price of $27.25 per share, despite fears of severe regulatory scrutiny for the deal.However, two experts said the deal was unlikely to run into serious trouble from regulators, who most likely will include the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and public utility commissions in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia.There is no antitrust issue since the two companies don't have customers in the same areas, said Bruce McDonald, an antitrust expert with Jones Day law firm.Pepco operates utilities in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey, serving about 2 million customers. Exelon's utilities deliver electricity and natural gas to more than 6.6 million customers in Maryland, Illinois and Pennsylvania.The acquisition would not deter Exelon from buying more renewable and conventional power assets, Crane said. At the same time, the company is looking to raise up to $1 billion by selling non-core assets, he said.Weak power prices and consumption have spurred consolidation among utilities in the past three years, with Exelon itself having bought Constellation Energy for $7.9 billion in 2011. Duke Energy and AES Corp have also made acquisitions.Exelon said it expected Pepco to ""significantly"" add to adjusted earnings in the first full year after the deal closed.The company also reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter, hurt by weak energy prices and a fall in nuclear and coal output.Barclays, Goldman Sachs & Co and Loop Capital Markets are Exelon's financial advisers. Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal counsel.Lazard is Pepco Holdings' financial adviser. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Covington & Burling LLP are its legal counsel.

2,"  MANILA, June 4 American power firm AES Corp  said on Wednesday it is planning to invest up to $2 billion to expand its coal-fired power plant in the northwestern Philippines and put up power storage facilities to help stabilise supply in the energy-deficient central provinces.AES will spend $1.2 billion to double the capacity of its 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant in Masinloc in Zambales province, with the project expected to be finished in three years.""Masinloc is very, very advanced. We've got the environmental permits and we are now in the final commercial aspects,"" Andres Gluski, AES president and chief executive, told reporters on the sidelines at the visit to Manila by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker.""We are willing to expand more in the Philippines. We want to expand more,"" Gluski said.Manila is Pritzker's second stop in a three-country tour of Southeast Asia aimed at deepening economic ties and trade in the region as part of the U.S. rebalance to Asia. She visited Vietnam prior to the Philippines and will end her tour in Myanmar. ""Power needs have to match the growth that is occurring, so that creates need and opportunity,"" Pritzker said in a media briefing, noting that the Philippines' 7.2 percent growth in 2013 was one of the fastest in Asia.To support an economic growth forecast to stay above 6 percent annually, the Philippines must add power capacity of at least 2,500 megawatts in the four years to 2017, according to the government's power development plan. AES is also in talks to install energy storage facilities via lithium ion batteries in the central Visayas region, where there is a shortage in power supply, Gluski said.""(They) work particularly well on islands, so we think they are very well adapted to the Philippines,"" he said of the storage facility, adding the project could require investments of $300 million or more. ""It is something that can be done in a relatively short time, 12 to 18 months,"" he said.AES has invested $1 billion in rehabilitating a 630-megawatt thermal power plant it acquired in 2008. It has moved its regional headquarters to Manila from Singapore last year following a decision to increase its investments in the country.Apart from power, chief executives and representatives of U.S. firms travelling with Pritzker are studying investments in infrastructure projects, health care, telecommunications, and information technology, Pritzker said.

3,"   By David Alire Garcia | MEXICO CITY  MEXICO CITY U.S.-based power company AES Corp plans to invest at least $1 billion to double its existing electricity generation capacity in Mexico, and also intends to enter the country's new wholesale power market.Juan Ignacio Rubiolo, head of AES's Mexican unit, said in an interview on the sidelines of a trade mission this week that the company expects to benefit from sweeping energy reform and grow beyond its three existing power plants, which generate a combined 1,050 megawatts.""We have a target of doubling the capacity we have in Mexico,"" said Rubiolo, noting that the company's focus is on plants powered by natural gas.He said the company expects to invest at least $1 billion over the next three to five years to achieve the target.AES (AES.N) is active in power generation and distribution in 20 countries and had revenue of $15.9 billion last year.  Rubiolo, previously AES's top executive in Panama, said the company is also looking to enter a newly created wholesale power market in Mexico. ""That's one of the major changes of the reform,"" said Rubiolo. ""It's definitely one of our main targets."" The country's Congress is putting the finishing touches on an energy overhaul that ends the wholesale monopoly held for decades by national power company CFE [COMFEL.UL].Final approval of so-called secondary laws that are needed to flesh out the fine print of last year's energy reform is expected in August.Rubiolo said the company is closely following the creation of a new independent system operator and that body's independence from the CFE, as well as access to technical data and transparency rules. He emphasized that the post-reform pace of growth in new power generation will depend largely on access to natural gas.""We would like to be more comfortable with how they're going to allow private investors to get access to gas and pipeline capacity,"" he said.

4,"  SAO PAULO, Sept 23 Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA , a Brazilian electricity utility controlled by U.S.-based AES Corp, won a court injunction against an order to pay a 626 million real ($260 million) consumer rebate, the company said on Tuesday.Brazil's electricity regulator ANEEL ordered the rebate for the allegedly improper incorporation by Eletropaulo of 246,000 meters of power cables as company assets.Eletropaulo did not immediately provide further details of the ruling. The company is the principal distributor of electricity to Sao Paulo, Brazil and South America's largest and most industrialized metropolitan area. Half the fine has already been covered by ANEEL when it limited the company's annual tariff adjustment to 18.66 percent in July, 3.3 percent less than Eletropaulo had the right to receive after a drought caused Brazilian power generation costs to soar.Eletropaulo shares fell 1.9 percent in Tuesday trading on the Sao Paulo BM&FBovespa exchange before the ruling was confirmed. The company has lost 17 percent of its value so far in the third quarter, making it the fourth-worst performer on the Bovespa index of the BM&FBovespa's most-traded stocks. Arlington, Virginia-based AES owns 78 percent of Eletropaulo voting shares, according to the Eletropaulo website. When non-voting preferred shares are included, AES owns 31 percent of total Eletropaulo stock.($1 = 2.4065 Brazilian reais)     (Reporting by Leonardo Goy e Alberto Alerigi Jr.; Additional reporting and writing by Jeb Blount in Rio de Janeiro; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2014-09-24,AES,"Tue Sep 23, 2014 | 8:42pm EDT",Brazil unit of AES wins injunction against $260 mln customer rebate,http://www.reuters.com//article/brazil-eletropaulo-aes-idUSL2N0RP01C20140924?type=companyNews

6,"  RIO DE JANEIRO Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA (ELPL3.SA), the Brazilian utility controlled by U.S. power company AES Corp (AES.N), said on Wednesday that third-quarter profit rose nearly five-fold as the company sold excess energy on the spot market at prices driven higher by drought.Net income jumped to 130.6 million reais ($52 million) in the quarter from 27 million reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a statement filed with Brazil's securities regulator, the CVM. The third-quarter profit also reversed a second-quarter loss of 354.4 million reais.Net sales rose 32 percent from a year earlier to 2.93 billion reais, boosted by higher prices paid for excess power on Brazil's spot market. Prices have soared in the last year as Brazil suffered through its worst drought in 80 years.The drought has caused water levels in hydroelectric reservoirs to shrink to their lowest levels in at least 15 years, forcing the use of higher-priced power from natural gas and petroleum.With about two-thirds of Brazil's power normally coming from cheap hydroelectricity, the scarcity caused by the drought drove the price of hydro alternatives higher still. The soaring costs have pushed Brazilian utilities and power generators without secure access to alternative power to near bankruptcy and have forced the government to come up with more than $13 billion in emergency loans to help the affected companies pay for power.As a result, the Brazilian electricity sector has lost its financial independence and is now dependent on Brazil's Treasury, the head of the country's federal audit court said on Oct. 1.  Eletropaulo, which serves more than 20 million people in Metropolitan Sao Paulo, South America's largest and most industrialized urban area, was forced to pay more for some power.

8,"  * MOUs signed, minister hopes for deal by end-March* ContourGlobal says any change should not hurt investment   (Adds ContourGlobal comment)SOFIA Feb 20 Two U.S. power companies have agreed to negotiate lower prices for the electricity they produce in Bulgaria, Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said on Friday.High energy prices are politically sensitive in the European Union's poorest country and sparked protests which toppled the government of Prime Minister Boiko Borisov in February 2013.AES and ContourGlobal sell electricity to public power provider NEK under 15-year contracts. Their two coal-fired plants produce about 20 percent of the country's power.""AES, ContourGlobal and NEK signed today memorandums of understanding to renegotiate the long-term power purchase agreements,"" Petkova told reporters. ""I do hope we will be able to do so by the end of March"". Indebted NEK also agreed to pay about 600 million levs  ($347 million) owed to the two plants.NEK was ordered to renegotiate the power supply deals by the country's energy regulator in May 2014.It was told to secure a price reduction of at least 30 percent to contracts which the regulator said breached European Union competition rules. Petkova told reporters that Brussels has not yet ruled on whether the contracts breach EU rules on state aid.She declined to elaborate by how much the cost can be lowered or whether the contracts would be extended.In a separate statement, ContourGlobal said any change in the deal should safeguard the investment made in a 908-megawatt plant in the Maritza East coal-mining complex in southeastern Bulgaria. It said the company should be compensated if a price reduction is agreed. ""It is ContourGlobal's position that any such agreement, if reached, will not change the economic equilibrium of the contract entered into in 2001 which facilitated the investment of 650 million euros to completely reconstruct the plant,"" it said.ContourGlobal, whose supply contract with NEK is valid through 2024, also said it believed that deal did not breach any national or EU rules.AES has invested 1.2 billion euros ($1.36 billion) in a 670 megawatt thermal power plant in the same coal-mining complex.

9,"   By Nichola Groom | LOS ANGELES, April 27  LOS ANGELES, April 27 AES Corp unveiled plans on Monday to expand its energy storage business into Europe and in new U.S. markets as the power industry aims to boost the reliability of renewable energy.In total, AES has more than 1,000 MW of energy storage projects in development, according to AES Energy Storage President John Zahurancik. Of that total, 260 MW is in construction or late stage development. For comparison, 1,000 MW is about the output of a typical U.S. nuclear reactor.AES would not disclose which companies would supply the batteries for the projects.The announcement is a sign that energy storage has moved beyond being just a handful of small demonstration projects. Energy storage systems such as the lithium ion batteries AES has put up since 2009 can absorb excess power when there is more electricity than demand and can deploy it to the grid when demand increases rapidly, such as on a hot summer day. This is particularly important for solar and wind power, which fluctuate dramatically, depending on the amount of sun and wind.""The pace of change is picking up,"" Zahurancik said in an interview. Projects are getting bigger, replacing traditional fossil fuel plants that are fired up to supplement when demand is high, he added. AES has the biggest fleet of battery energy storage projects in the world, with 86 megawatts in operation in Chile and the United States. Though valued at just $200 million in 2012, the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA.Government mandates for more renewable energy and a sharp drop in the price of lithium ion batteries are driving demand for more energy storage. With more wind and solar power on the grid, storage can help stabilize power flows that can shift dramatically depending on the weather. Storage systems cost less than $1,000 a kilowatt and in some cases are substantially less, Zahurancik said, adding that prices would continue to fall in the coming years.AES is currently building storage projects in Chile, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, and the U.S. state of Maryland. Three more projects are in late stage development in Indiana, California and Northern Ireland.The Alamitos Energy Center battery project in California is the largest new AES storage project at 100 MW. Most of the other projects are 10 or 20 MW in size.

These include a plant that has supplied Penoles with electricity for several years.In February, Grupo Bal announced the creation of oil exploration and production subsidiary Petrobal. The unit aims to take advantage of Mexico's historic energy sector opening finalized last year. The reform allows private companies to produce oil for the first time in decades and completely opens the power sector to private investment.Grupo Bal is owned by billionaire Alberto Bailleres, one of Mexico's richest men.The remainder of the joint venture's five-year investment is likely to be spent on projects focused on liquefied natural gas, water desalination and energy storage, an area where AES is already a global leader, said Rubiolo. AES Chief Executive Andres Gluski first announced the joint venture in a second-quarter earnings call with analysts on Monday, noting that over the next decade Mexico will need 25 gigawatts of new or replacement generation.However, he gave no details on the scope of the plans.Rubiolo said the AES-Grupo Bal tie-up will pay close attention to upcoming auctions by CENACE, Mexico's new independent grid operator, in which bidding terms on new power generation projects are expected in October.""We will play an active role in the auctions,"" he said, adding that ""this alliance in particular is designed to be aggressive and a heavyweight in this market.""

The 2.23 billion debt, Eletrobras said, does not include 348 million reais in court and lawyers fees it also says it is owed by Eletropaulo.

19,"   By Will Caiger-Smith  NEW YORK, Sept 21 (IFR) - AES Distributed Energy, formed through the acquisition of Main Street Power in March, filed documents for a new solar ABS deal on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.When it hits the market, the ABS, being issued through a platform called Aurora Master Funding, would be the first deal backed by solar assets to be sponsored by an utility company.ABS issuers must file an ABS-15G form with the SEC at least five business days before bringing a transaction to market. The collateral portfolio comprises equipment leases and power purchase agreements relating to 43 megawatts of solar assets owned through 15 different project companies. Most are municipal and commercial assets but some are residential. Morgan Stanley, which finances AES Distributed Energy through its MS Solar Solutions subsidiary, is underwriting the ABS.The deal could help broaden the appeal of the nascent solar ABS asset class, which participants say has been held back by inconsistent structures that make investment challenging. Solar power is growing fast in the US - the number of houses with rooftop solar grew 70% year on year in the second quarter of 2014, according to a recent study - and many developers view securitization as a key part of their funding strategy.Solar ABS has seen five public deals to date, totaling US$560.5m, all but one from US market leader SolarCity. SunRun made its debut in July.

25,"  (Adds data, details on sector)SAO PAULO May 11 Brazilian power distribution company Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade de São Paulo SA  risks ""financial collapse"" if rules governing power purchasing contracts are not changed, it said in a letter to regulators last month.AES Eletropaulo, as the company is known, said in the letter dated April 11 it is accumulating losses due to current contract rules that prevent it from reducing the amount of electricity it buys from generators. The company, a subsidiary of U.S.-based AES Corp, is selling excess supply at a loss in the spot market.Asked to comment about possible developments since the letter was sent, AES Eletropaulo said it has not been informed of any regulatory modifications to date. Brazil's electricity watchdog Aneel, which released the letter on its website on Wednesday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Other power distribution companies in Brazil are facing similar problems as consumption falls amid the country's worst recession since the 1930s and power sector regulations fail to address smaller-than-projected demand. The nation's power consumption fell 4.2 percent in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier.Power distribution companies have long-term contracts including fixed amounts of power deliveries. The cost of excess supply of up to 5 percent can be passed on via tariffs but beyond that, the only option is selling the excess power on the spot market at a loss. Last month, AES Eletropaulo sold excess supply at around 48 reais ($13.7) per megawatt hour (MWh) on the spot market. It  paid the generator 147 reais per MWh for the electricity.The company had 5.9 percent of leftover electricity in the first quarter and losses from selling on the spot market amounted to 40.3 million reais. Eletropaulo estimates excess supply will reach 16 percent by the end of the year.""There is an urgent need of revaluation of current rules, otherwise the company would be subject to the risk of a financial collapse,"" it said in the letter.Possible solutions include allowing companies to pass on to consumers the extra cost of excess power purchasing or reducing the amount it buys from generators.Any solutions may take time since Brazil is on the verge of a new administration as the Senate is likely to vote on Wednesday in favor of suspending President Dilma Rousseff as she faces an impeachment trial. Vice President Michel Temer would take the post and form a new cabinet while she is on trial.

32,"   By Marcela Ayres and Guillermo Parra-Bernal | BRASILIA/SAO PAULO  BRASILIA/SAO PAULO The Brazilian government has rescheduled an auction to sell state-controlled Centrais Elétricas de Goiás SA as potential bidders failed to present some requirements within a deadline, signaling feeble interest for the ailing power distributor.In a statement, the Mines and Energy Ministry said some of the companies that had shown preliminary interest in the company known as Celg-D did not present the financial guarantees needed to participate in the auction. The sale, which was scheduled for Friday, was expected to raise at least 2.8 billion reais ($881 million).Two lawmakers with direct knowledge of the sale process told Reuters the government will likely reduce the minimum price for Celg-D to around a minimum 2 billion reais to lure firm bids when the process is resumed, probably in September.  Reuters reported in February that the government and state-controlled power holding company Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, which owns 51 percent of Celg-D, had invited AES Corp, Italy's Enel SpA and several Brazilian power utilities to participate in the auction. Brazil's state development bank BNDES and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation are coordinating the process.The suspension of the Celg-D auction, which some investors saw as a litmus test for investor appetite for state asset sales in Brazil's electricity industry, underscores the difficulties facing an ambitious state asset divestment plan needed to help narrow a record budget deficit this year.  Eletrobras, as the state power holding company is commonly known, has put on the block stakes in several distribution companies to focus on power generation and transmission.  The remaining 49 percent in Celg-D is owned by the state of Goiás through investment holding firm Cia Celg de Participações SA. That stake is also for sale.
