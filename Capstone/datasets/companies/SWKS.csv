Apple shares were down 0.6 percent at $95.87.Apple suppliers' shares have taken a beating ever since reports about slowing iPhone 6S and 6S Plus demand surfaced towards the end of 2015.(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2016-01-07,SWKS,"Thu Jan 7, 2016 | 6:24pm EST",UPDATE 1-Apple suppliers cut revenue estimates amid iPhone shipment fears,http://www.reuters.com//article/cirrus-logic-results-idUSL3N14R5GJ20160107?type=companyNews
34,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from  record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its  average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years. By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly."" A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138. In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying. A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued. ""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

36,"   By Julia Love and Anya George Tharakan  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market.The company's sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues.Its shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple's share buyback and  dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors.Apple's results followed disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and microblog Twitter (TWTR.N) also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations.Apple said it sold 51.2 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down from 61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts' estimates of about 50 million devices. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop  represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple's exponential growth.""Apple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products. This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. ""The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,"" he said.  But Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing, reinforcing wider concerns of saturation. Cook also conceded that the iPhone 6S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the 6. ""I don't mean just a hair lower; it's a lot lower,"" he said. ""If we'd had the same rate on 6S as 6, it would be time for a huge party.""He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales.Cook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come.     ""The future of Apple is very bright,"" he said. ""Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store."" Earnings of $1.90 per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $50.56 billion missed expectations of $51.97 billion.  Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. Apple also said it was raising its capital return program by $50 billion through a $35 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a 10 percent rise in the quarterly dividend.iPHONE SE DEMAND STRONG In March, Apple released the iPhone SE, a smaller, 4-inch-screen phone featuring much of the company's latest technology. Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter, the device is off to a strong start, particularly in emerging markets, Maestri said. ""The situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,"" he said. ""The demand has been very, very strong."" Although Apple's revenue in Greater China fell 26 percent from the year-ago quarter, Maestri stressed that the company was ""extremely optimistic"" about China. ""We continue to make a lot of investment there,"" he said.Cook said that mainland China sales were down only 7 percent in constant currency, attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong, where strength in the local dollar, which is pegged to U.S. currency, deterred tourist shopping. The company did not comment on prospects for its iBooks Stores and iTunes Movie service, which were shut down last week in China.The drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). In reaction to Apple's results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), Qorvo (QRVO.O), Broadcom (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.

38,"   By Rodrigo Campos  U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Wednesday after fears eased that the Federal Reserve would strongly signal it would raise interest rates in June, though a slump in Apple shares weighed on the Nasdaq index.Stocks in the telecom and utilities sectors, seen as proxies for fixed income returns when Treasury yields are expected to remain low, rose sharply after the Fed's announcement. That indicates market participants expect U.S. government yields to remain subdued.""The big takeaway here is they (the Fed) continued to be positive on the domestic economy,"" said John Bailer, senior portfolio manager at The Boston Company Asset Management. ""They have taken out some of the risk on the global economy.""""It is slightly hawkish in my mind but not enough to get the market worried about it.""Economists polled by Reuters expect two rate increases this year but futures prices show traders do not expect a hike until at least September, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The Fed next meets on June 14-15. While the labor market continues to gain strength, inflation remains below the central bank's 2 percent target and mixed economic data could cloud the path to future rate hikes.The technology sector remained the largest weight on the market after Apple slumped more than 6 percent following its first revenue decline in over a decade.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.23 points, or 0.28 percent, to 18,041.55, the S&P 500 gained 3.45 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,095.15 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 25.14 points, or 0.51 percent, to 4,863.14. Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures pared losses after the closing bell as Facebook's shares jumped more than 8 percent after the company beat estimates on both earnings and revenue.During the regular session, Exxon Mobil shares hit their highest level since May 2015 after the energy company raised its quarterly dividend to 75 cents from 73 cents. The dividend hike came a day after Standard & Poor's cut Exxon's credit rating, in part for being too generous with shareholders. Its shares closed up 0.9 percent at $88.46. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.4-to-1 ratio and on the Nasdaq a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 16 new lows.About 7.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with a 6.9 billion daily average over the past 20 sessions.
