3,"  Jan 13 Medtronic Inc on Monday said it will convene an independent panel of experts to make recommendations on the future of its experimental treatment for high blood pressure after the device failed to meet the key goal of a clinical study.     The medical device maker announced last week that the treatment, known as renal denervation, did not meet the goal for demonstrating effectiveness in the study, though it did meet its main safety goal.     The device is aimed at treating high blood pressure in patients who have not responded well to traditional drug therapies and works by deadening nerves in the kidneys.     Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak, speaking at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said the company was likely to take an impairment charge for halting clinical trials of the device in the United States, Japan and India.     The setback will have minimal impact on the company's sales projections, which had included a small additional contribution to revenue beginning in 2016, the CEO said.       Medtronic will continue to sell the device in Europe, where it has been on the market since April 2010, Ishrak said.

5,"  Jan 15 A U.S. jury strengthened Edwards Lifesciences Corp's efforts to protect sales of the company's transcatheter heart valve implants, by ruling that a competing product from Medtronic Inc infringes its patent.Medtronic will appeal the award of more than $390 million in damages made by the jury in a federal court in Delaware and oppose any request for an injunction, the company said on Wednesday.Edwards said later in the day the ruling that Medtronic willfully infringed its patent entitled it to seek increased damages of up to three times the value of the award, in addition to attorneys' fees.It said it would move to enforce the verdict and seek a permanent injunction against Medtronic's CoreValve heart valve implant.""This (type of prolonged dispute) is fairly uncommon,"" Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang said. Unlike the two rivals, most companies would have opted to cross-license their patents after such extended litigation, she said. Wang said continuing the litigation could help Edwards protect its monopoly in the U.S. transcatheter aortic valve replacement market through 2016-2017, when some of its patents face expiry.Edwards will lose protection in December 2017 for its U.S. Cribier transcatheter heart valve patent, which covers its most important product line - the Sapien system.The Sapien system allows surgeons to replace diseased heart valves by threading the new valve into place through an artery via a catheter, sparing patients chest cracking and open heart surgery. Edwards reported transcatheter heart valves sales of $172 million for its third quarter ended Sept. 30.In 2010, a jury in the same Delaware court awarded damages to Edwards after it found that Medtronic infringed Edwards's Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent. That decision was upheld on appeal and Medtronic made an initial payment of $84 million to Edwards last year. However, additional damages are still pending, Edwards said.Last July, a German court also ruled that CoreValve, approved for sale in Europe, infringed Edwards's patent.Medtronic said it expected U.S. approval for the CoreValve implant system by the end of its fiscal year ending April 2014.The U.S. market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements is expected to reach $2 billion by 2016, BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch told Reuters last February.Shares of Irvine, California-based Edwards closed up about 2 percent at $71.89 on the New York Stock Exchange.

News of the early CoreValve approval sent Edwards shares down nearly 5 percent.More than 100,000 people in the U.S. have severe aortic stenosis with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart valve replacement surgery, making them candidates for CoreValve or the rival Edwards Sapien system.The systems, in which the replacement valve is threaded into place through an artery using a catheter - known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR - spares patient's chest-cracking surgery, cutting down on recovery time. CoreValve has been available since 2007 in Europe, where it is not uncommon for medical devices to win approval several years ahead of the United States.""We estimate the U.S. TAVR market will be approximately $450 million in 2014,"" said Glenn Novarro, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.""With approval earlier than expected, share loss for Edwards will likely occur sooner than expected,"" added Novarro, who sees Medtronic grabbing 20 percent of the U.S. TAVR market this year, rising to more than 30 percent by 2016. But CoreValve's U.S. sales prospects may hinge on further legal proceedings after a U.S. jury earlier this week found that the Medtronic system infringes a patent held by Edwards and awarded Edwards more than $390 million in damages.Medtronic vowed to appeal the decision and oppose any request for an injunction. Edwards, meanwhile, said the patent infringement ruling entitled it to seek increased damages of up to three times the value of the award.The FDA approved CoreValve without first requiring an expert advisory panel to review the device and make recommendations to the agency.

12,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of medical devices maker Medtronic Inc in its dispute with privately owned Mirowski Family Ventures LLC over whether the larger company infringed on Mirowski's patents in making certain pacemakers.The case stems from Medtronic's decision to ask a judge to rule that some of its pacemakers do not infringe on technology patented by Mirowski and licensed to Boston Scientific as well as Guidant Corp, part of Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories.A court in Delaware ruled for Medtronic, saying that even though Medtronic requested the ruling, or declaratory judgment, it was up to Mirowski to prove infringement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, saying it was up to Medtronic to prove its case.The Supreme Court reversed that decision, arguing that the patent holder, in this case Mirowski, ordinarily must prove infringement and that this case was no different.

15,"  (In Jan. 21 story, corrects name of Medtronic hypertension product to Symplicity, not Ardian, paragraphs 9, 12)By Susan KellyJan 21 Covidien Plc said it would stop making a device for treating high blood pressure due to weak demand for the product, raising more doubts about the future of the novel technology.The decision comes less than two weeks after Medtronic Inc  said it was halting clinical trials for its high blood pressure device after the treatment, known as renal denervation, failed to prove effective in a key U.S. study.  Medtronic's move surprised many observers.The devices, which are not available in the United States, take a new approach to treating hypertension and are aimed at patients resistant to traditional drug-based therapies. Some analysts had predicted the technology, which works by deadening nerves in the kidneys, could evolve into a $2 billion market by providing an alternative to drug therapy.Covidien said the decision to exit the business was a result of its regular review of strategic programs. ""The company took a close look at the renal denervation market and realized it really is growing much slower than expected,"" said Covidien spokesman Peter Lucht. He declined to comment on whether Medtronic's study outcome played a role in his company's decision.S&P Capital analyst Phillip Seligman said the failed clinical trial of Medtronic's product likely influenced Covidien's decision but noted sales of the device were modest. He maintained a ""strong buy"" rating on Covidien shares.Covidien's device, called OneShot, was sold in Europe and the Middle East. In Europe, where the product was approved in February 2012, adoption of such devices has run into reimbursement hurdles as governments have been reluctant to pay for the new technology. The devices work by creating tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys - organs that play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict.Following its decision to halt clinical studies of its renal denervation system, Medtronic said it would form an independent panel of experts to make recommendations on the future of the product, called Symplicity. Medtronic continues to sell the product in 85 countries. It has been approved in Europe since April 2010.St Jude Medical Inc and Boston Scientific Corp  also sell renal denervation products in Europe and other markets. Boston Scientific acquired its system through the purchase of Vessix Vascular Inc in November 2012.A Medtronic spokeswoman said it was too soon to determine the next steps for Symplicity. ""We don't know if we would consider another clinical trial. We don't know anything yet,"" said  spokeswoman Wendy Dougherty.Covidien said it expects to record after-tax charges of $20-$25 million as a result of exiting the program.The company's shares fell 1 cent to $68.19 on Tuesday.

16,"   By Susan Kelly  Medtronic Inc's stumble in its U.S. medical device study to treat high blood pressure could create an opportunity for other device makers to pick up where their rival has left off, Boston Scientific Corp Chief Executive Mike Mahoney said on Tuesday.Called the silent killer, high blood pressure affects as many as one in three American adults, and medical device makers were racing to develop a procedure to treat it before the failure of Medtronic's major clinical trial.Boston Scientific is still forging ahead with plans to develop its own blood-pressure-lowering device, called a renal denervation system, for sale in the United States, Mahoney said in an interview.Renal denervation devices create tiny scars along nerves in the kidneys, which play a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure by sending signals to the brain that can cause blood vessels to constrict.The procedure currently is intended as an alternative to drug therapy for patients whose blood pressure is not well controlled by traditional medications.Boston Scientific will examine data from Medtronic's halted study, in which the company's device failed to prove effective, as it designs the U.S. clinical trial for its own product, Mahoney said. ""Right now it's going to be a slower market until BSC or another company delivers on a trial. When that happens, the market will open up, and it has the potential to be a multi-billion-dollar market,"" he said.Medtronic had a jump start on the U.S. market in the development of a treatment, but the failure of its Symplicity device in the study, announced in January, caught many observers by surprise.Less than two weeks later, Covidien Plc said it would stop making its hypertension device, which was approved for sale in Europe in February 2012, due to weak demand. Mahoney said repercussions from Medtronic's failed U.S. study will be felt in Europe, where cardiologists will be less inclined to recommend the treatment until more evidence of its effectiveness can be demonstrated in more clinical trials.Medtronic continues to sell its device there, and Boston Scientific in December launched its own offering.

22,"  (Adds study details, background, analyst, doctor comment)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonWASHINGTON, March 29 Medtronic Inc's  minimally invasive CoreValve system for replacing diseased aortic heart valves led to a significantly higher survival rate after one year than traditional open heart surgery in patients deemed at high risk of death during surgery, according to data from a study presented on Saturday.One year after receiving the CoreValve in the 795-patient Phase III trial, the rate of death was 14.2 percent compared with a 19.1 percent death rate in the surgery group, researchers said. The result, presented at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington, was deemed to be statistically significant.There was also no increased risk of stroke seen with CoreValve compared with surgery, which had been one of the main concerns of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) early on in clinical testing.""I think the results were outstanding,"" said Dr. David Adams, a co-principal investigator of the CoreValve trial.TAVR systems use a catheter threaded through an artery to the heart to put the new valve in place, sparing patients chest-cracking open-heart surgery and typically longer hospital stays associated with the invasive surgical procedure.Early on, Adams explained, the question was could TAVR be an alternative as good as surgery. ""Now, it might be better,"" he said. ""We're making continual progress. It's not only an alternative but may be a preferable alternative.""CoreValve won U.S. approval in January, three months earlier than expected, to treat patients deemed too frail to endure open heart surgery, known as extreme-risk patients. The latest results in high-risk, or less ill, patients should help expand the approval to treat a larger group as Medtronic competes with Edwards Lifesciences Corp's  Sapien valve replacement, the first to gain U.S. approval.Both have been available for several years in Europe, where medical devices tend to get approved far more quickly.""A positive outcome in the CoreValve high-risk trial should lead to approval in this patient population in the U.S. by the end of 2014,"" Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note prior to release of the data.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has determined that data from the study would be sufficient to make an expanded approval decision without first convening an expert advisory panel to discuss it, Medtronic said. In addition to the survival result, the rate of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events was significantly lower with CoreValve - 20.4 percent versus 27.3 percent for surgery. That was a combination of death from any cause, heart attack, stroke or need for another procedure.More than twice as many patients in the surgery group went on to develop atrial fibrillation, a potentially dangerous irregular heart beat, researchers reported.More than 100,000 people in the United States have severe aortic stenosis with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart surgery, making them potential TAVR candidates. Patients are typically older than 80 years old.Glenn Novarro, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, estimated the U.S. TAVR market to be worth about $450 million in 2014. As positive clinical trial results mount in less extreme risk patients and physician acceptance increases, sales of the systems could provide important growth drivers for Medtronic and Edwards. ""I think TAVR is going to have broader acceptance for increased risk patients,"" said Adams, chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Mt Sinai Hospital in New York.The primary difference between the two systems is that Sapien uses a balloon, such as those employed in angioplasty procedures, to expand the valve once it is in place. The Medtronic system uses a special alloy that self expands as it reacts to body heat once the valve is in place. CoreValve also uses a smaller catheter than the currently approved Sapien. But the next generation Sapien XT device with a smaller catheter is expected to gain U.S. approval in the coming months.Doctors and investors may get a glimpse of how the competition will shape up later at the ACC meeting, when German researchers present results of a head-to-head study comparing CoreValve with the Sapien XT.Quality of life measures with those who received CoreValve were deemed to be non-inferior, or about as good, as those whose valves were surgically replaced.There were some disadvantages reported in the CoreValve patients, including a low but significantly higher rate of valve leakage and a higher rate of need for permanent implantation of a pacemaker.Adams said those issues were minor given the survival advantage demonstrated in the trial.""The message is very clear,"" he said. ""It was a superior outcome.""

23,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A non-surgically implanted heart valve meant to delay open heart surgery in children with congenital heart defects worked well for all but a few patients during a year of follow-up observation, in line with favorable results seen in original clinical trials of the Medtronic Inc product.The Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve was approved in 2010 under a U.S. humanitarian device exemption, which allowed it on the market as long as a follow-up study was conducted to assess the product's reliability and safety. The valve is guided to the heart by a catheter, a minimally invasive procedure.In the study of patients who had been implanted with the valve there was no narrowing of the valve, or stenosis, after six months in some 96.7 percent of the 90 patients for whom data was available.After a year, there was no narrowing, significant leakage or need for additional intervention in 94 percent of patients, researchers said on Sunday.""The valves had excellent function during the first year, judged by no more than mild leakage and very few patients had narrowing of the valve,"" said Dr. Aimee Armstrong of the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children's Hospital Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories, who was lead investigator for the follow-up study sponsored by Medtronic.The mean age of patients in the trial was 20, with ages ranging from 5 to 45. The valve is made from a cow's jugular vein that is sewn into a metal stent, and then inserted into the patient's leg and advanced to the heart.Within the first year of the study, eight adverse events were seen, including three cases of heart infections, two abnormal heart rhythms and one case each of bacterial infection, major stent fracture and blood clot in the lung. Patients will continue to be followed for five years.Results of the multi-center study were released at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Washington.Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect in the United States, affecting an estimated 1 million adults and 800,000 children.Some 40,000 babies with the defects are born each year in the United States. Many have no pulmonary valve, which carries blood from the heart's right ventricle to the lungs, or only a very small pulmonary valve. Some patients receive a connecting tube, or conduit, early in life, to provide blood flow. The conduits, typically made from cadaver pulmonary valves, from pig valves or bioprosthetic materials, are implanted during open heart surgery and essentially bypass the missing or inadequate pulmonary valve.But the conduits over time can become leaky and narrowed, putting stress on the right ventricle and preventing it from squeezing properly. As a result, patients can develop abnormal life-threatening heart rhythms and symptoms such as inability to exercise.At that point, patients have traditionally required open heart surgery to replace the pulmonary valve. But such surgery, which requires cutting open the rib cage to get direct access to the heart, causes scar tissue that makes future surgery much more difficult. Medtronic's Melody valve is meant to provide additional blood flow when conduits become faulty, and thereby delay the need for more open heart surgery.""Every time you do open heart surgery, more scar tissue develops, with more potential damage to the heart"" in subsequent surgery, said lead investigator Armstrong.She said it was too early to determine just how long the Melody valve would last, or how long it would delay the need for more open heart surgery. But she said patients in other trials have had the Medtronic valve for five to seven years, with no need for surgery.To date, over 6,000 patients have received the Melody valves, more than half of them children having congenital heart defects.Melody was the world's first approved transcatheter valve, and such valves could help speed recovery times and spare great expense.""This is an overnight procedure,"" Armstrong said.

25,"  (Adds independent doctor comments)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonWASHINGTON, March 30 The minimally invasive aortic heart valve replacement system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp performed better than a rival product sold by Medtronic Inc in the first head-to-head study of the two, according to data from a small German trial presented at a major heart meeting on Sunday.The results are unlikely to be seen as decisive given the size and limited scope of the study. But they could provide the Edwards sales force with a valuable marketing tool as the two companies vie for market share with their competing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, systems.Both systems employ a catheter to thread the new valve through an artery into place in the heart, sparing patients too frail for open heart surgery from the invasive chest cracking procedure. The Edwards Sapien XT uses a balloon to expand the compressed valve once it is in position in the diseased valve, while the Medtronic CoreValve has a special self expanding valve using an alloy that reacts to body heat to open.The results were presented at the American College of Cardiology's annual scientific sessions in Washington.In the 241-patient study conducted at five German hospitals, doctors using the Edwards balloon expandable system reported a success rate of 95.9 percent compared with a 77.5 percent success rate for those using the Medtronic alternative.A successful procedure was defined as one in which the valve was implanted in the correct position and provided a tight enough seal to prevent blood leakage across the valve.Patients receiving the Edwards valve also reported improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness, chest pain and dizziness 30 days after the procedure at a higher rate than those in the Medtronic group: 94.3 percent versus 86.7 percent.""We have two main types of valves available for this procedure, and until now, there was no conclusive data about their relative effectiveness,"" Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Wahab, the study's lead investigator, said in a statement. NO DIFFERENCE IN DEATH OR STROKE RATES But the definitions of effectiveness used as the primary goals for the German study may be viewed as limited in value.Virtually all doctors who perform heart valve replacements, typically in patients aged 80 and older, agree that the most important clinical results for these procedures are rates of death and stroke. By those all-important measures, there was no significant difference between the two TAVR systems 30 days after the procedure. ""Medtronic believes that physicians will look to more rigorous trials with hard clinical endpoints when evaluating these valves to provide reliable guidance on TAVR device selection,"" Medtronic said in a statement.Medtronic also took issue with the method used to assess aortic valve leakage in the independent German study, calling the angiography readings ""the least effective measure for determining aortic regurgitation.""The researchers plan to follow the patients for five years to compare the longer-term health outcomes of the two groups, which is likely to yield more meaningful information.""It's possible some of these differences might not persist over time,"" said Dr. Saul Vizel, a cardiologist with Cambridge Memorial Hospital in Cambridge, Ontario, who was not involved in the study. ""The jury is still out for sure, because they're doing one-year and two-year follow-ups and people will wait for those.""Dr. Patrick O'Gara, incoming president of the American College of Cardiology from Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, also was not ready to declare a  winner based on the German study. ""I would like to see a larger trial with more endpoints,"" O'Gara said. ""It would be premature to overinterpret these findings.""Not surprisingly, Edwards Lifesciences had a more favorable view of the findings than Medtronic.""This independent, multi-center randomized study is consistent with the experience in Europe, where more clinicians choose Sapien XT over CoreValve for the treatment of their patients,"" Edwards spokeswoman Sarah Huoh said in an emailed statement. ""These data are reflective of the findings of multiple, real-world European registries.""TAVR procedures have been performed in Europe since 2007 but are relatively new in the United States. The first Sapien system gained U.S. approval in 2011, and Medtronic's CoreValve was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January.The CoreValve uses a smaller, potentially easier-to-maneuver, catheter than the original Sapien. Edwards expects U.S. approval of the next-generation Sapien XT with a similarly smaller catheter in the coming months.More than 100,000 people in the United States have severe aortic stenosis, with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart surgery, making them potential TAVR candidates.Industry analysts expect the Sapien XT and CoreValve to be important future growth drivers for Edwards and Medtronic.""We now have new valves coming out that will probably be even better,"" Abdel-Wahab said.

26,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot | WASHINGTON, March 30  WASHINGTON, March 30 A non-surgically implanted heart valve meant to delay open heart surgery in children with congenital heart defects worked well for all but a few patients during a year of follow-up observation, in line with favorable results seen in original clinical trials of the Medtronic Inc  product.The Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve was approved in 2010 under a U.S. humanitarian device exemption, which allowed it on the market as long as a follow-up study was conducted to assess the product's reliability and safety. The valve is guided to the heart by a catheter, a minimally invasive procedure, and patients typically go home after only one night in the hospital.In the study of patients who had been implanted with the valve there was no narrowing of the valve, or stenosis, after six months in some 96.7 percent of the 90 patients for whom data was available.After a year, there was no narrowing, significant leakage or need for additional intervention in 94 percent of patients, researchers said on Sunday.""The valves had excellent function during the first year, judged by no more than mild leakage and very few patients had narrowing of the valve,"" said  Dr. Aimee Armstrong of the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children's Hospital Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories, who was lead investigator for the follow-up study sponsored by Medtronic.The mean age of patients in the trial was 20, with ages ranging from 5 to 45. The valve is made from a cow's jugular vein that is sewn into a metal stent, and then inserted into the patient's leg and advanced to the heart. Within the first year of the study, eight adverse events were seen, including three cases of heart infections, two abnormal heart rhythms and one case each of bacterial infection, major stent fracture and blood clot in the lung.Patients will continue to be followed for five years.Results of the multi-center study were released at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Washington. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect in the United States, affecting an estimated one million adults and 800,000 children. Many patients are born with no pulmonary valve, which carries blood from the heart's right ventricle to the lungs, or only a very small pulmonary valve.Some patients receive a connecting tube, or conduit, early in life, to provide blood flow. The conduits, typically made from cadaver pulmonary valves, from pig valves or bioprosthetic materials, are implanted during open heart surgery and essentially bypass the missing or inadequate pulmonary valve.But the conduits over time can become leaky and narrowed, putting stress on the right ventricle and preventing it from squeezing properly. As a result, patients can develop abnormal life-threatening heart rhythms and symptoms such as inability to exercise. At that point, patients have traditionally required open heart surgery to replace the pulmonary valve. But such surgery, which requires cutting open the rib cage to get direct access to the heart, causes scar tissue that makes future surgery much more difficult.Medtronic's Melody valve is meant to provide additional blood flow when conduits become faulty, and thereby delay the need for more open heart surgery.""Every time you do open heart surgery, more scar tissue develops, with more potential damage to the heart,"" said lead investigator Armstrong.She said it was too early to determine just how long the Melody valve would last, or how long it would delay the need for more open heart surgery. But she said patients in other trials have had the Medtronic valve for 5 to 7 years, with no need for surgery.To date, over 6,000 patients have received the Melody valves, with more than half of them having congenital heart defects.

27,"  WASHINGTON The minimally invasive aortic heart valve replacement system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp performed better than a rival product sold by Medtronic Inc in the first head-to-head study of the two, according to data from a small German trial presented at a major heart meeting on Sunday.While the results are unlikely to be seen as decisive, given the size and limited scope of the study, they could provide the Edwards sales force with a valuable marketing tool as the two companies vie for market share with their competing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) systems.Both systems employ a catheter to thread the new valve through an artery into place in the heart, sparing patients too frail for open heart surgery from the invasive chest cracking procedure. The Edwards Sapien XT uses a balloon to expand the compressed valve once it is in position in the diseased valve, while the Medtronic CoreValve has a special self expanding valve using an alloy that reacts to body heat to open. In the 241-patient study conducted at five German hospitals, doctors using the Edwards balloon expandable system reported a success rate of 95.9 percent compared with a 77.5 percent success rate for those using the Medtronic alternative.A successful procedure was defined as one in which the valve was implanted in the correct position and provided a tight enough seal to prevent blood leakage across the valve. Patients receiving the Edwards valve also reported improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness, chest pain and dizziness 30 days after the procedure at a higher rate than those in the Medtronic group - 94.3 percent versus 86.7 percent.

40,"   By Susan Kelly | June 2  June 2 Managed care company Humana Inc  has filed a lawsuit against Medtronic Inc accusing the medical device maker of falsely representing its Infuse bone growth-stimulation product as safe and effective in spinal fusion surgeries.The suit, filed on Friday in federal court in Tennessee, alleges that Medtronic paid for academic literature that fraudulently portrayed the product as safe and effective for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Humana said it paid for the use of Infuse, a bioengineered bone protein, when less expensive and more medically sound alternative procedures were available.It said Medtronic engaged in a ""sophisticated and deeply deceptive marketing strategy"" to expand the market for Infuse, paying and encouraging spine surgeons to use the product by overstating its benefits while minimizing serious risks. Medtronic, in a separate statement, said the product's label has reflected its risks from the time of FDA approval in 2002.""Medtronic strongly believes that the safety profile reported to the FDA and detailed in product labeling support the continued safe use of Infuse Bone Graft for approved indications,"" the company said.Medtronic also said it ""vigorously disagrees with any suggestion that the company improperly influenced peer-reviewed published manuscripts."" Physicians are compensated for intellectual property rights and for legitimate and documented consulting services provided to the company, Medtronic said.Independent reviews of the product initiated by Medtronic last year determined that Infuse works as well as traditional bone grafts taken from patients, but may not be as safe. The reviews were prompted by questions raised by spine experts and U.S. lawmakers about the safety of the product, which contains a genetically engineered protein known recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 to promote bone growth.Infuse was once hailed as a major advance in spinal fusion surgery, offering an alternative to painful bone harvesting from other parts of the body to perform a bone graft.But in 2011, Infuse became the subject of investigations by the U.S. Senate and Department of Justice over off-label use of the product and omissions of safety problems from its clinical trial data.The product also drew intense public scrutiny after the influential Spine Journal ran an entire issue criticizing it in June 2011, charging that surgeons who were paid tens of millions of dollars by Medtronic failed to report serious complications such as male sterility, increased risk of cancer, infections, pain and bone dissolution.

44,"   By Susan Kelly  Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) said on Thursday it is focused on driving faster revenue and profit growth after several sluggish years and would expect any acquisitions it considers to support a plan for returning value to shareholders.   Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that the world's largest standalone medical device maker was considering a takeover of London-based Smith & Nephew (SN.L), which specializes in hip and knee implants, in a move to help lower its taxes.  Last week, orthopedic device maker Stryker Corp (SYK.N) said it did not intend to make an offer for Smith & Nephew, following a Financial Times story that suggested it was preparing a bid.Medtronic executives, speaking Thursday at the company's analyst meeting, said they would not answer questions about potential acquisitions. Instead, the company emphasized it would adhere to a set of guidelines for any future deals, including a goal for minimal negative impact on earnings per share.Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said the company would look to build on its track record for acquisitions that added $1.4 billion in revenue with no net earnings dilution in the last fiscal year. The company has completed 16 acquisitions in the past five years. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen said he does not believe Medtronic is preparing a bid for Smith & Nephew, which holds a 12 percent share of the hip and knee market. Acquiring the smaller device maker would not give Medtronic the heft it seeks when entering a new market, Biegelsen said in a note to clients.""Management indicated that deals would be primarily based on strategic fit, not financial reasons such as tax inversion,"" Bielgelsen said.Ishrak, at the analyst meeting, reiterated the company's long-term goals of accelerating revenue growth to the mid-single digits, with earnings per share growing 200 to 400 basis points above that.  Medtronic also expects to generate more than $25 billion in free cash flow over the next five years and remains committed to returning 50 percent of it to shareholders. Like many of its peers in the medical device sector, Medtronic has struggled with weaker demand for treatments, especially elective procedures, due to high unemployment and changing insurance policies that require patients to shoulder more of their healthcare costs. Hospital cost-cutting efforts are pressuring prices on products such as orthopedic devices as well as heart stents and implantable defibrillators and pacemakers.Medtronic said it would improve revenue growth through a combination of new therapies, sales in emerging markets and a focus on providing hospitals with integrated health strategies surrounding the products it sells.Shares of Medtronic were down 1.9 percent at $62.01 in afternoon trading.

49,"  June 12 Medtronic Inc said on Thursday its minimally invasive heart valve replacement system received U.S. approval to treat patients deemed at high risk for surgery, expanding the eligible patient population for its CoreValve device.CoreValve won initial U.S. approval in January for use in patients with severe aortic valve disease deemed too frail to endure traditional open heart surgery, so-called extreme risk patients.The expanded approval follows results of a pivotal clinical trial that demonstrated less ill high risk patients fared better with the CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) after one year than those who had heart valves replaced via open heart surgery. CoreValve competes directly with the Sapien TAVR system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp. Medtronic agreed last month to pay $1 billion to Edwards to settle patent infringement litigation, keeping CoreValve on the U.S. market.The TAVR systems, which use a catheter to thread the new valve into place, sparing patients chest cracking surgery, are seen as important growth drivers for both companies. The U.S. market for TAVR procedures is expected to top $500 million this year and double in size by 2018, Jefferies analysts forecast. ""With this approval, we can treat more patients due to the broad range of CoreValve sizes, and we have an option compared to surgery that provides a greater chance for a longer life while minimizing the risk of stroke,"" Dr. David Adams, one of the lead investigators of the pivotal U.S. clinical trial from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said in a statement.Patients suffering from severe aortic stenosis tend to be elderly, often 80 or older.

The medical device industry is seeing more mergers such as Zimmer Holdings Inc's recently announced $13.4 billion takeover of smaller rival orthopedic device maker Biomet Inc as companies in the sector move to cut costs and become more efficient.Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca, which was rejected, was one of a few recently launched major deals that have looked to take advantage of an increasingly popular tax-lowering strategy known as an inversion. Several smaller transactions have succeeded, drawing the attention of U.S. lawmakers in Congress who are targeting legislation that would make it much more difficult for U.S. companies to do profitable inversions.

Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca, which was rejected, was one of a few recently launched major deals that have looked to take advantage of an increasingly popular tax-lowering strategy known as an inversion.Several smaller transactions have succeeded, drawing the attention of U.S. lawmakers in Congress who are targeting legislation that would make it much more difficult for U.S. companies to do profitable inversions.A Reuters review showed about 50 such deals had been done in the past 25 years, with half occurring since the 2008-2009 credit crisis abated.Officials at Medtronic and Covidien declined to comment on the news, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Depending on the results, they will consider other areas for collaboration, the companies said in a statement.Financial terms were not disclosed. ""We see our diabetes franchise as a growing franchise even beyond the patent expiry of Lantus and this (partnership) will be an element which helps continue that growth,"" Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher told Reuters, declining to provide detailed forecasts.The alliance, which covers type 2 diabetes, will bring together Sanofi's insulin portfolio and Medtronic's insulin pumps and glucose monitoring, with a focus on sufferers unable to achieve glucose control despite multiple daily injections of insulin, the companies said.An estimated 382 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation, with type 2 diabetes, often associated with obesity, accounting for 90 percent to 95 percent of all cases.

54,"  June 14 Medical-device maker Medtronic Inc  and rival Covidien PLC are in advanced talks to combine in a deal that could be worth more than $40 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.The Journal said the deal, which could be announced on Monday, would be structured as a so-called tax inversion, according to one of the people.In such deals, acquirers buy companies based in countries with lower corporate tax rates than their own as a means of lowering their overall rate. Covidien is based in Ireland, which is known for having a relatively low tax rate. Minneapolis-based Medtronic, which makes cardiovascular and orthopedic devices, has a market value of about $61 billion. Covidien, which makes devices used in surgery, is valued at about $32 billion.

58,"   By Susan Kelly and Bill Berkrot  Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) $43 billion deal for Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N should accelerate already intense efforts by medical device rivals to seek merger partners, industry analysts and bankers said on Monday.Medtronic announced the transaction on Sunday, saying it would re-base the combined company in Ireland, where it can take advantage of lower corporate tax rates and easier access to cash generated overseas. The purchase also gives Medtronic more products, as well as  greater leverage in negotiating with hospital clients that are taking a much harder line on device spending.  The intensified competition will bring new pressure on large device makers such as Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Stryker Corp (SYK.N) and St Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) to seek acquisitions, industry watchers say. Medtronic plus Covidien will rival industry leader Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) $28.5 billion in annual device revenue.UK-based Smith & Nephew Plc (SN.L), which has already attracted takeover interest from companies seeking better tax rates overseas, remains high on the list of targets, they said. Device makers such as  Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) should feel more pressure to get bigger or face being left out in the cold.The merger mania is a product of pressures on the healthcare systems in the United States and in Europe, where hospitals are getting paid less to deliver care. U.S. hospital systems are consolidating and buying doctor practices to cope with the changes.""It becomes more necessary for the medical device companies to have a broader product line in order to be able compete and have economies of scale,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based healthcare fund StockDoc Partners.Medtronic said its own appetite for deals does not end with absorbing Covidien. It expects to use some of the additional cash flow from the deal on acquisitions and minority investments, and internal research and development. ""There still are plenty of opportunities for us to focus on other acquisitions, other innovation. That momentum doesn't need to stop, even in this integration period,"" Medtronic Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said in a conference call with analysts.Medtronic has been especially eager to expand beyond selling devices to providing advisory services to hospitals.  ""To the degree we can bring in other acquisitions to support that further, we will look closely at that,"" Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said.EMULATING MEDTRONIC  The latest consolidation wave in the medical device arena began in April when Zimmer Holdings Inc ZMH.N reached a deal to buy rival Biomet Inc for more than $13 billion, expanding its orthopedic product offerings.Rival orthopedics maker St Jude Medical ""could be an acquirer of a smaller company to emulate what Medtronic is doing,"" Yaffe said.Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang has Stryker atop her list of potential acquirers.""That company is a serial acquirer and CEO Kevin Lobo has indicated that it is trying to move the company in the direction of becoming a larger partner with its hospital customers, the same strategy that Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic are taking to heart,"" Wang said.       Wang sees Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW.N) as a target whose specialty in heart valves would fit in with a number of companies interested in cardiac products.  Yaffe listed Hospira Inc HSP.N, Becton Dickson and Co (BDX.N), Baxter International Inc (BAX.N) and Massimo Corp (MASI.O) as attractive takeover candidates that could help a larger company become more of a one-stop shop for hospitals.While several industry experts pointed to Boston Scientific as an acquirer, it could still be wary in the wake of its $27 billion purchase of Guidant in 2006. The deal left it heavily in debt and struggling with a depressed stock price for years.Medtronic is acquiring Covidien in a so-called inversion transaction that allows it to reincorporate in Ireland.       Analysts said the strategy will give Medtronic access to cash generated through sales outside the United States and now held overseas without paying a penalty for repatriating the money. This benefit overshadows the modest reduction in the overall corporate tax rate that the company is forecasting.Medtronic also said Monday it would maintain its prior forecast for fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $4 to $4.10 a share. Its shares were off 1.4 percent at $59.87, while those of Covidien were up 20.7 percent at $86.93.

By 2007, medical device sales had slowed dramatically from double-digit percentage growth to the low-single-digits, and hopes for a rebound have since faded.U.S.-based Medtronic on Sunday said it would buy Covidien and moving its executive headquarters to Ireland to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates. The combination of their product lines will make them a leader in six out of the top 10 hospital purchasing categories. Medtronic hopes that will add to its leverage in device sales as hospitals narrow down the number of vendors they buy from.In interviews with Reuters in recent weeks, executives from both companies said they were also focused on providing more advisory services to hospitals, suggesting how doctors could save money and improve care with data on standardizing surgical procedures and management of chronic disease. “The company realized back in the late 2000s that the world was changing,” said Dr. Michael Tarnoff, chief medical officer for Covidien. “You can’t just take the physicians out to dinner and build relationships and expect to build your sales.”Covidien is trying to help hospitals create protocols for procedures ranging from hysterectomies to weight-loss surgery, based on evidence of what would work best for most patients. “Covidien sees itself as a company that wants to move toward being a partner and not just a vendor,” Tarnoff said. Medtronic in March launched a two-year pilot program with insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) to help improve blood sugar control and lower costs for diabetic patients using its insulin pumps. It also has arranged consulting contracts in Europe that focus on cardiac catheterization laboratories, where heart procedures such as stent implants are performed.“It is a services business model we have started to participate in and one we see further traction in going forward,” Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said. “We think we can be a leader in this shift to value-based healthcare.”Some industry experts are not yet convinced that hospitals will involve device makers in decisions affecting clinical practice. “My sense is hospitals still view these companies as vendors,” said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy.     MAKING THE SHORT LIST In the United States, President Barack Obama’s health reform law is accelerating an overhaul of the $3 trillion healthcare system. U.S. doctors have traditionally been paid for the number of services they perform, rather than whether a patient’s health improves. In the past, that encouraged physicians to order the newest, most expensive medical technology and, critics argue, perform procedures on many more patients than necessary. Now hospitals and insurers want to restructure how they compensate doctors based on a patient’s health outcome. The impact is felt even more broadly now because as many as 30 percent of U.S. doctors now work directly for hospitals or in hospital-owned practices after a wave of consolidation.With hospitals exerting more control over device spending, they are directing physicians to switch from device brands they preferred to use in the past, said Deloitte consultant Paul Kreder. On big-ticket items such as implantable defibrillators, Kreder also advises hospital clients to cut back the number of vendors they use to just two or three companies.“Companies are trying to broaden their product portfolios and trying to broaden the services and solutions they offer. The advantage to that is they become potentially more of a one-stop shop,” said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.

64,"   By Susan Kelly and Bill Berkrot  Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) $43 billion deal for Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N should accelerate already intense efforts by medical device rivals to seek merger partners, industry analysts and bankers said on Monday.Medtronic announced the transaction on Sunday, saying it would re-base the combined company in Ireland, where it can take advantage of lower corporate tax rates and easier access to cash generated overseas.The purchase also gives Medtronic more products, as well as  greater leverage in negotiating with hospital clients that are taking a much harder line on device spending.  The intensified competition will bring new pressure on large device makers such as Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Stryker Corp (SYK.N) and St Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) to seek acquisitions, industry watchers say. Medtronic plus Covidien will rival industry leader Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) $28.5 billion in annual device revenue.UK-based Smith & Nephew Plc (SN.L), which has already attracted takeover interest from companies seeking better tax rates overseas, remains high on the list of targets, they said. Device makers such as  Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) should feel more pressure to get bigger or face being left out in the cold.The merger mania is a product of pressures on the healthcare systems in the United States and in Europe, where hospitals are getting paid less to deliver care. U.S. hospital systems are consolidating and buying doctor practices to cope with the changes.""It becomes more necessary for the medical device companies to have a broader product line in order to be able compete and have economies of scale,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based healthcare fund StockDoc Partners.Medtronic said its own appetite for deals does not end with absorbing Covidien. It expects to use some of the additional cash flow from the deal on acquisitions and minority investments, and internal research and development. ""There still are plenty of opportunities for us to focus on other acquisitions, other innovation. That momentum doesn't need to stop, even in this integration period,"" Medtronic Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said in a conference call with analysts.Medtronic has been especially eager to expand beyond selling devices to providing advisory services to hospitals.  ""To the degree we can bring in other acquisitions to support that further, we will look closely at that,"" Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said.EMULATING MEDTRONIC  The latest consolidation wave in the medical device arena began in April when Zimmer Holdings Inc ZMH.N reached a deal to buy rival Biomet Inc for more than $13 billion, expanding its orthopedic product offerings.Rival orthopedics maker St Jude Medical ""could be an acquirer of a smaller company to emulate what Medtronic is doing,"" Yaffe said.Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang has Stryker atop her list of potential acquirers.""That company is a serial acquirer and CEO Kevin Lobo has indicated that it is trying to move the company in the direction of becoming a larger partner with its hospital customers, the same strategy that Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic are taking to heart,"" Wang said.       Wang sees Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW.N) as a target whose specialty in heart valves would fit in with a number of companies interested in cardiac products.  Yaffe listed Hospira Inc HSP.N, Becton Dickson and Co (BDX.N), Baxter International Inc (BAX.N) and Massimo Corp (MASI.O) as attractive takeover candidates that could help a larger company become more of a one-stop shop for hospitals.While several industry experts pointed to Boston Scientific as an acquirer, it could still be wary in the wake of its $27 billion purchase of Guidant in 2006. The deal left it heavily in debt and struggling with a depressed stock price for years.Medtronic is acquiring Covidien in a so-called inversion transaction that allows it to reincorporate in Ireland.       Analysts said the strategy will give Medtronic access to cash generated through sales outside the United States and now held overseas without paying a penalty for repatriating the money. This benefit overshadows the modest reduction in the overall corporate tax rate that the company is forecasting.Medtronic also said Monday it would maintain its prior forecast for fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $4 to $4.10 a share. Its shares were off 1.4 percent at $59.87, while those of Covidien were up 20.7 percent at $86.93.

73,"   By Tessa Walsh and Leela Parker | LONDON  LONDON U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) is raising a $16.3 billion senior unsecured bridge loan to finance its $42.9 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N, banking sources said on Tuesday.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) is the sole initial bookrunner of the deal, which is one of the bank’s biggest loan underwriting commitments to date, and is also acting as the sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, a senior banker close to the deal said.Medtronic agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc and shift its executive headquarters to Ireland on June 15 in the latest move by U.S. firms to access lower corporate tax rates abroad.Medtronic was not immediately available for comment. BoAML’s $16.3 billion sole underwriting is bigger than its $15.25 billion share of the $61 billion bridge loan that backed Verizon’s (VZ.N) acquisition of Verizon Wireless in September 2013, which was underwritten by four banks.BoAML was also the sole underwriter of a $4 billion loan for Swiss engineering group ABB’s ABBN.VX acquisition of US electrical connectors manufacturer Thomas & Betts in March 2012. LIQUID DEBT MARKETS A sole underwriting of this size shows confidence in liquid debt markets, which are giving rise to hopes of an M&A renaissance, several bankers said.“The credit markets are very strong at the moment, which gives comfort around the debt capital markets takeout and the bank market is strong and deep, which gives comfort on the ability to syndicate the risk if needed,” the senior banker said. The deal has been structured in two tranches.

Medtronic will pay $35.19 in cash plus 0.956 shares of Medtronic stock for each Covidien share.

74,"   By Tessa Walsh and Leela Parker | LONDON, June 17  LONDON, June 17 U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc is raising a $16.3 billion senior unsecured bridge loan to finance its $42.9 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien Plc, banking sources said on Tuesday.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) is the sole initial bookrunner of the deal, which is one of the bank's biggest loan underwriting commitments to date, and is also acting as the sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, a senior banker close to the deal said.Medtronic agreed to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc and shift its executive headquarters to Ireland on June 15 in the latest move by U.S. firms to access lower corporate tax rates abroad.Medtronic was not immediately available for comment.BoAML's $16.3 billion sole underwriting is bigger than its $15.25 billion share of the $61 billion bridge loan that backed Verizon's acquisition of Verizon Wireless in September 2013, which was underwritten by four banks.BoAML was also the sole underwriter of a $4 billion loan for Swiss engineering group ABB's acquisition of US electrical connectors manufacturer Thomas & Betts in March 2012. LIQUID DEBT MARKETS A sole underwriting of this size shows confidence in liquid debt markets, which are giving rise to hopes of an M&A renaissance, several bankers said. ""The credit markets are very strong at the moment, which gives comfort around the debt capital markets takeout and the bank market is strong and deep, which gives comfort on the ability to syndicate the risk if needed,"" the senior banker said.The deal has been structured in two tranches. One tranche is a bridge loan to bond issues, which are expected to be issued quickly, as is typical of acquisition bridge financings.The second tranche is a bridge loan to cash which will allow Metronic to source cash from different parts of its business, the senior banker said.

78,"  (Adds CEO comments, earnings details)By Susan KellyAug 19 Medtronic Inc Chief Executive Omar Ishrak defended his company's plan to acquire Dublin-based Covidien Plc in a so-called inversion deal, saying the medical device maker will be able to create more U.S. jobs while still paying substantial taxes once the transaction closes.Medtronic, which announced its $42.9 billion acquisition of Covidien in June, is among a number of U.S. corporations that have unveiled inversion deals in recent months to establish a tax domicile abroad.President Barack Obama has criticized the strategy as a rush by companies to avoid U.S. corporate taxes, and the administration is weighing executive actions.Medtronic has maintained the main rationale for the deal is strategic, combining the two companies' complementary product lines, and will free up cash generated overseas for reinvestment in the United States. Ishrak, in remarks during the company's earnings conference call on Tuesday, said Medtronic expects to invest ""much more aggressively"" in the United States after the deal closes, resulting in accelerated creation of high-paying U.S. medical technology jobs.""Acquiring Covidien is good for Medtronic, for our shareholders, for patients, for the medtech industry and ultimately good for the U.S. economy,"" he said.In an interview, Ishrak said the company's effective tax rate on global income will fall to about 16-17 percent after the deal from 18-19 percent now. Medtronic on Tuesday reported the strongest quarterly U.S. sales growth for its medical devices in five years and said it was committed to completing the Covidien acquisition by the end of the year or early 2015.The Minneapolis-based company also confirmed its full-year profit and revenue outlook. The company's shares were flat at $63.60 in midday trading.Net earnings fell to $871 million, or 87 cents a share, in the first quarter ended July 25 from $953 million, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and costs related to the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic earned 93 cents a share. Analysts on average expected 92 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 4 percent to $4.27 billion, while analysts had forecast $4.25 billion.U.S. revenue increased 6 percent to $2.33 billion, buoyed by new products, including an implanted diagnostic monitor for the heart called Reveal, that offset weakness in its core markets for spinal devices and implantable cardioverter defibrillators.The company's new CoreValve replacement heart valve in the two quarters since its launch has captured 40 percent of the U.S. market for valves that can be implanted in a less-invasive procedure than traditional open-heart surgery, Medtronic said. It competes against Edwards Lifesciences Corp's Sapien heart valve.Medtronic reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2015 profit of $4.00 to $4.10 a share, excluding special items, and revenue growth in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent adjusted for currency fluctuations.

82,"  * U.S. moves against tax-avoidance ""inversion"" deals* Burger King-Tim Horton deal to proceed* Action may deter Pfizer from returning to bid for AstraZeneca   (Recasts with Medtronic comments, update stock moves)By Kevin Drawbaugh and Soyoung KimWASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 23 Tough new U.S. rules on corporate ""inversions"" on Tuesday sent a chill through the market for the tax-avoidance deals, both pending and potential, with share prices falling sharply in nearly a dozen companies on both sides of the Atlantic.As investors sold stocks involved in inversions, in which U.S. companies escape high taxes at home by redomiciling abroad, analysts and tax lawyers were surveying the damage to deals currently in the works and the outlook for future transactions.Despite new rules that will make some inversions costlier and others more difficult to do, Burger King Worldwide Inc  said it will proceed with its $11.5 billion deal with Canada's Tim Hortons Inc, stressing that the transaction was not about tax benefits.In announcing their intention to proceed, the two companies said in a statement: ""This deal has always been driven by long-term growth and not by tax benefits.""The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled harsher-than-expected changes late on Monday to the existing rule book for inversions, which have surged this year and caused concern in Washington about the threat posed to the U.S. corporate income tax base.Effective immediately, the rules will mean little for companies that have already inverted. But for at least 10 companies in the midst of completing such deals, and for those considering inversions, the impact will be significant.Most pending deals could become more costly for the buyers, such as AbbVie Inc and its $54.7 billion deal to acquire Ireland's Shire Plc, as well as Medtronic Inc  and its $42.9 billion takeover of Covidien Plc.Neither of these transactions, the biggest of the year, was expected to fall apart completely, partly because paying a break-up fee to walk away would likely be even more costly. AbbVie would have to pay Shire a $1.6 billion penalty if it were to renege on their merger agreement, for instance. Medtronic has a contract that lets it or Covidien walk away from their deal if the U.S. Congress changes tax law. The Treasury's new rules fall short of that, so a break-up fee likely would loom in this case, too, if the merger were called off.'HOPSCOTCH' LOANS TARGETED With a grid-locked Congress failing to act, investors had been expecting an Obama administration clamp-down on inversions. But the rules it announced were more far-reaching than anticipated, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.""Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities.An inversion typically involves a U.S. company buying a smaller, foreign rival and reincorporating in its home country, where taxes are lower, opening a range of options for the combined business to lower its U.S. and global tax bills. About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but the pace has picked up, with half of them completed since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review.A key target of the Treasury's actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a tax rule that defers taxes on profits until they are brought to the United States.One of the new Treasury rules will prevent inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping tax-deferred foreign profits.Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to  offshore profits by using ""decontrolling"" strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled.The Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U.S. investors can have in an inverted company for it to qualify for foreign tax treatment under U.S. law, a move that will make it harder to do the deals.The U.S. Treasury has acknowledged that one of the new rules is broad enough to hit companies that are not inverting. A senior official, who asked not to be named, said some cash transfers from foreign corporations to U.S. subsidiaries could now be taxed, even if not involved in an inversion. ""There's a relatively small provision ...which would affect both inverted and non-inverted, basically any foreign-owned firms,"" the official told reporters on Monday.Treasury officials said on Tuesday that the rules were effective immediately and that any deals completed as of Monday were not affected, while deals completed later would be. Despite this, some investment bankers on Tuesday expressed uncertainty about the finality and timing of the rules.Bankers and analysts also said they expect more from the Treasury Department. ""This move is a good and necessary start toward discouraging corporate inversions, which cost U.S. taxpayers billions in lost revenue,"" said Thomas Hungerford, a tax expert at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank.SHARES REACT No two inversions are exactly alike, so the impact of the rules will depend on the aspects of inversion each deal emphasizes, whether it is protecting foreign profits from U.S. taxation or gaining access to foreign profits already deferred.In London, AstraZeneca, which had been the target of a failed inversion bid by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, slid 3.6 percent. The Treasury rules were seen as possibly deterring Pfizer from making another bid after a $118 billion takeover attempt failed in May.AbbVie slid 2.3 percent in midday U.S. trading, while Pfizer, the biggest U.S. pharmaceutical company, dipped 0.3 percent. Burger King was down 2.2 percent in New York.AbbVie officials did not have any immediate comment on the latest developments.Other U.S.-listed issues under pressure from the Treasury actions included Abbott Laboratories, down 1.6 percent; Covidien, down 2.4 percent; Medtronic, down 3.1 percent; and Mylan, down 0.1 percent.

83,"  (Adds Obama, Medtronic, Durbin, Hatch comments, links)By Kevin Drawbaugh and Jason LangeWASHINGTON, Sept 22 Moving against tax avoidance by corporations, the Obama administration took several actions on Monday to curb  ""inversion"" deals that allow companies to escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad.The Treasury Department announced new rules, effective immediately, that will reduce the tax benefits available to companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding.Because they took effect on Monday, the new rules might raise issues for some of a handful of companies that have  agreed to do inversions, but have not yet completed them.Fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc is in the midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with coffee-and-donuts vendor Tim Hortons Inc. A spokeswoman for Burger King said the company declined to comment.Asked about the impact on pending deals, a senior Treasury official told reporters on a conference call: ""If they are closed and done as of today, then they are not subject to this. If they are closed tomorrow or after, they are subject to this.""President Barack Obama, who has sharply criticized inverting companies, said the Treasury Department's steps would ""discourage companies from taking advantage of corporate inversions - moving their tax residence overseas on paper to avoid paying their fair share in taxes here at home.""The announcement of the rules followed months of growing concern on Capitol Hill, with Democrats urging prompt legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the problem later, perhaps in 2015, as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole-riddled federal tax code.Companies that do inversions, which are legal and already subject to certain restrictions, say they are only trying to minimize their tax bills, which investors expect.About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but half of those have been completed just since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review. MEDTRONIC DEAL PENDING Inversions have surged in the past year, pursued by big companies such as Burger King and medical technology group Medtronic Inc, which is working to close an inversion deal into Ireland with rival Covidien Plc.Medtronic spokesman Fernando Vivanco late on Monday told Reuters: ""We are studying Treasury's actions. We will release our perspective on any potential impact on our pending acquisition of Covidien following our complete review.""Medtronic has said it expects to close the Covidien acquisition by the end of this year or early 2015. Inversions usually involve a U.S. corporation buying a smaller, foreign rival and redomiciling in its home country, where taxes are lower, even though core operations typically remain in the United States.(Graphic on corporate inversions: reut.rs/1tWc9p7)Treasury Secretary Lew said in a statement: ""These first, targeted steps make substantial progress in constraining the creative techniques used to avoid U.S. taxes, both in terms of meaningfully reducing the economic benefits of inversions after the fact, and when possible, stopping them altogether.""A key target of Treasury's actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the United States.One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deferred foreign profits. Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using ""decontrolling"" strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled. Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U.S. owners can have in an inverted company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS, a move that will make it harder to do these deals.Some companies had feared that new rules might be imposed retroactively, but they were not.Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group, said the administration ""may succeed in chilling the climate for further deals, but this was not as strident as it could have been, especially in that they don't do anything retroactively.""SIDE-STEPPING CONGRESS The rules were the administration's latest effort to tackle what it sees as a pressing issue by taking executive actions that side-step a gridlocked Congress.""When corporations choose to invert and don't pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab,"" said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin in a statement.""Today, the Obama administration put these corporate tax deserters on notice: we are not going to stand by while they game the tax code and avoid their responsibility to our country,"" Durbin said.Though in disagreement about the issue's urgency, both Democrats and Republicans have said inversions are a symptom of a broken tax code that needs a thorough overhaul, a job that has eluded Congress and successive presidents since 1986.Senator Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement: ""In the end, any solution that permanently addresses inversions must be legislated by Congress.""

84,"   By Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) is likely to try to renegotiate the structure and terms of its $42.9 billion deal to buy Ireland's Covidien Plc COV.N in response to new U.S. tax rules, according to people familiar with the situation.The U.S. Treasury this week reduced the ease and benefits of U.S. companies buying foreign rivals so they can move their tax domicile abroad, a practice known as inversion. Concerns that U.S. companies were using the strategy to avoid paying taxes spurred the action. The new rules make it more expensive for Medtronic to buy Covidien, by potentially requiring it to take out a loan instead of using cash held abroad, according to the people familiar with the matter and a Reuters analysis of the contract. Covidien, which originally approached Medtronic, could be asked to consider a lower price, and to take more stock and less cash, these people said. Increasing the stock component of the deal would be needed to meet the new government threshold for an inversion and resulting dip in U.S. taxes. It remains unclear how receptive Covidien will be to that possibility, and it has some leverage, since Medtronic faces an $850 million breakup fee if it abandons the deal. While Covidien allowed Medtronic to freely walk away from a deal in the event of a U.S. tax law change, the new Treasury guidelines fall short of a U.S. law change. If shareholders of either company vote down the deal, there is no breakup fee.Medtronic did not respond to requests for comment, but it said earlier this week that it was studying Treasury's actions and would release its position following a review. Covidien could not be immediately reached for comment.RECORD INVERSIONS  The allure of smaller tax bills in countries such as Ireland and Britain has prompted at least 10 U.S. companies to attempt inversions this year, a record.Medtronic and AbbVie (ABBV.N), which has agreed to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP.L) for $54.7 billion, are both subject to the new restrictions, raising questions about this year's two largest announced inversions.Lawyers and bankers say Medtronic appears to be the biggest victim of the rules, not only for the size and structure of its deal, but also given the fact that a key target of Treasury's actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals.Medtronic has roughly $14 billion of cash held overseas, the most among the nine companies with pending inversion deals. AbbVie, meanwhile, has a significant portion of its $10 billion cash held in foreign subsidiaries. A big draw of the Covidien takeover was the potential to access substantially all of Covidien’s cash without subjecting it to U.S. tax. Under U.S. tax law, Medtronic has to pay a U.S. corporate tax of 35 percent if it brings home foreign earnings, for purposes such as distributions to shareholders.Many inversions are driven by the promise of lower tax rates, but Medtronic already has an effective tax rate of 18 percent, similar to that of Covidien. It has said the combined company's tax rate would decline by one or two percentage point.One new tax rule prevents inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deterred foreign profits. Another rule bars inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using ""decontrolling"" strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S. controlled.Those guidelines mean Medtronic may now have to rely on a roughly $13.5 billion bridge loan to finance the cash portion of its Covidien deal. Medtronic had planned to lend some of its foreign money to its new Irish parent to help pay for the deal, according to the merger document, but that plan is now potentially exposed to the anti-hopscotch rule.While the cash would have been a zero cost, drawing on the loan would incur Medtronic an initial interest expense of around 1.15 percent, which would rise further depending on the duration of the loan, according to calculations by Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp.

85,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Soyoung KimNEW YORK, Sept 26 U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc is likely to try to renegotiate the structure and terms of its $42.9 billion deal to buy Ireland's Covidien Plc in response to new U.S. tax rules, according to people familiar with the situation.The U.S. Treasury this week reduced the ease and benefits of U.S. companies buying foreign rivals so they can move their tax domicile abroad, a practice known as inversion. Concerns that U.S. companies were using the strategy to avoid paying taxes spurred the action.The new rules make it more expensive for Medtronic to buy Covidien, by potentially requiring it to take out a loan instead of using cash held abroad, according to the people familiar with the matter and a Reuters analysis of the contract.Covidien, which originally approached Medtronic, could be asked to consider a lower price, and to take more stock and less cash, these people said. Increasing the stock component of the deal would be needed to meet the new government threshold for an inversion and resulting dip in U.S. taxes.It remains unclear how receptive Covidien will be to that possibility, and it has some leverage, since Medtronic faces an $850 million breakup fee if it abandons the deal.While Covidien allowed Medtronic to freely walk away from a deal in the event of a U.S. tax law change, the new Treasury guidelines fall short of a U.S. law change. If shareholders of either company vote down the deal, there is no breakup fee.Medtronic did not respond to requests for comment, but it said earlier this week that it was studying Treasury's actions and would release its position following a review. Covidien could not be immediately reached for comment. RECORD INVERSIONS The allure of smaller tax bills in countries such as Ireland and Britain has prompted at least 10 U.S. companies to attempt inversions this year, a record.Medtronic and AbbVie, which has agreed to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire Plc for $54.7 billion, are both subject to the new restrictions, raising questions about this year's two largest announced inversions.Lawyers and bankers say Medtronic appears to be the biggest victim of the rules, not only for the size and structure of its deal, but also given the fact that a key target of Treasury's actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals. Medtronic has roughly $14 billion of cash held overseas, the most among the nine companies with pending inversion deals. AbbVie, meanwhile, has a significant portion of its $10 billion cash held in foreign subsidiaries.A big draw of the Covidien takeover was the potential to access substantially all of Covidien's cash without subjecting it to U.S. tax. Under U.S. tax law, Medtronic has to pay a U.S. corporate tax of 35 percent if it brings home foreign earnings, for purposes such as distributions to shareholders.Many inversions are driven by the promise of lower tax rates, but Medtronic already has an effective tax rate of 18 percent, similar to that of Covidien. It has said the combined company's tax rate would decline by one or two percentage point.One new tax rule prevents inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deterred foreign profits. Another rule bars inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using ""decontrolling"" strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S. controlled. Those guidelines mean Medtronic may now have to rely on a roughly $13.5 billion bridge loan to finance the cash portion of its Covidien deal. Medtronic had planned to lend some of its foreign money to its new Irish parent to help pay for the deal, according to the merger document, but that plan is now potentially exposed to the anti-hopscotch rule.While the cash would have been a zero cost, drawing on the loan would incur Medtronic an initial interest expense of around 1.15 percent, which would rise further depending on the duration of the loan, according to calculations by Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp.Morgan Stanley analyst David Lewis this week estimated that raising debt would cut earnings-per-share accretion from the deal by 3-4 percent, or 14-18 cents per share, and would nearly double a key debt load ratio, pro forma total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.Further, in order to make the merged company an Irish-domiciled entity under the new U.S. tax rules, Medtronic will have to increase the stock component of the cash-and-stock offer such that Covidien shareholders end up with more than 40 percent of the combined company.Currently, Covidien shareholders are set to own 30 percent of the merged company.The merger, if successful, would create a close competitor in size to the medical device business of industry leader Johnson & Johnson Co.

91,"   By Caroline Humer and Soyoung Kim  U.S. medical equipment maker Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) said it would still buy Covidien Plc COV.N but would use $16 billion in debt rather than cash held overseas, reacting to new U.S. Treasury guidelines designed to cut the benefits of such ""inversion deals.""The U.S. government has tried to clamp down on deals in which U.S. companies move their headquarters to Ireland and other low-tax countries. New rules are aimed at making it harder for these companies to avoid paying taxes when they use cash held overseas. With more certainty about how Medtronic would respond to the new tax rules, analysts raised their expectations for its shares and dividends. Medtronic stock rose 3.6 percent to $65.06, while Covidien gained 5.6 percent to $93.78.Medtronic in June announced plans to buy Ireland's Covidien for cash and stock worth $43 billion.

97,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is investigating about two dozen cases of suspected cybersecurity flaws in medical devices and hospital equipment that officials fear could be exploited by hackers, a senior official at the agency told Reuters. The products under review by the agency's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, or ICS-CERT, include an infusion pump from Hospira Inc and implantable heart devices from Medtronic Inc and St Jude Medical Inc, according to other people familiar with the cases, who asked not to be identified because the probes are confidential.These people said they do not know of any instances of hackers attacking patients through these devices, so the cyber threat should not be overstated. Still, the agency is concerned that malicious actors may try to gain control of the devices remotely and create problems, such as instructing an infusion pump to overdose a patient with drugs, or forcing a heart implant to deliver a deadly jolt of electricity, the sources said.The senior DHS official said the agency is working with manufacturers to identify and repair software coding bugs and other vulnerabilities that hackers can potentially use to expose confidential data or attack hospital equipment. He declined to name the companies.""These are the things that shows like 'Homeland' are built from,"" said the official, referring to the U.S. television spy drama in which the fictional vice president of the United States is killed by a cyber attack on his pacemaker. ""It isn't out of the realm of the possible to cause severe injury or death,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitive nature of his work. Hospira, Medtronic and St Jude Medical declined to comment on the DHS investigations. All three companies said they take cybersecurity seriously and have made changes to improve product safety, but declined to give details. CONNECTED DEVICES ICS-CERT's mandate is to help protect critical U.S. infrastructure from cyber threats, whether they are introduced through human error, virus infections, or through attacks by criminals or extremists.According to the senior DHS official, the agency started examining healthcare equipment about two years ago, when cybersecurity researchers were becoming more interested in medical devices that increasingly contained computer chips, software, wireless technology and Internet connectivity, making them more susceptible to hacking.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the sale of medical devices, recently released guidelines for manufacturers and healthcare providers to better secure medical devices and is holding its first public conference on the topic this week.""The conventional wisdom in the past was that products only had to be protected from unintentional threats. Now they also have to be protected from intentional threats too,"" said William Maisel, chief scientist at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. He declined to comment on the DHS reviews.The senior DHS official said the two dozen cases currently under investigation cover a wide range of equipment, including medical imaging equipment and hospital networking systems. A DHS review does not imply the government thinks a company has done anything wrong - it means the agency is looking into a suspected vulnerability to try to help rectify it. One of the cases involves an alleged vulnerability in a type  of infusion pump, a piece of hospital equipment that delivers medication directly into a patient's bloodstream. Private cybersecurity researcher Billy Rios said he discovered the alleged bug but declined to identify the manufacturer of the pump. Two people familiar with his research said the manufacturer was Hospira.    Rios said he wrote a program that could remotely force multiple pumps to dose patients with potentially lethal amounts of drugs. He submitted his analysis to the DHS.    ""This is a issue that is going to be extremely difficult to patch,"" said Rios, a former Marine platoon commander who has worked for several Silicon Valley technology firms and recently founded security startup Laconicly.     Reuters was not able to independently review his research or identify the type of pump Rios studied from Hospira's line, which includes multiple models.Hospira spokeswoman Tareta Adams, while declining to comment on specifics, said the company is working to improve the security of its products. ""Hospira has implemented software adjustments, distributed customer communications and made a commitment to evaluate other changes going forward, while ensuring we are not adversely impacting the ability of our devices to meet hospital and patient needs, and maintain compliance with FDA product requirements,"" Adams said in the statement. MORE AWARENESS Hospital security officers say there is increasing awareness about cyber threats, and medical centers around the country have been shoring up networks to better defend against hackers.At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, all medical devices will soon need to be tested to make sure they meet security standards before they can be put on the hospital's network, according to Lessley Stoltenberg, the center's chief information security officer.""I'm pretty concerned,"" said Stoltenberg. ""Coming out of the block, medical devices don't really have security built into them.""The DHS is also reviewing suspected vulnerabilities in implantable heart devices from Medtronic and St Jude Medical, according to two people familiar with the matter.They said the probe was based in part on research by Barnaby Jack, a well-known hacker who died in July 2013. Jack had said he could hack into wireless communications systems that link implanted pacemakers and defibrillators with bedside monitors. Medtronic spokeswoman Marie Yarroll said in an email that the company has ""made changes to enhance the security"" of its implantable cardiac devices, but declined to give specifics ""in the interest of patient safety."" St. Jude Medical spokeswoman Candace Steele Flippin also declined to discuss specific products but said the company has ""an ongoing program to perform extensive security testing on our medical devices and networked equipment. If a risk is identified, we will issue patches for any known issues.""CHENEY'S DEFIBRILLATOR  Experts said it is important that security vulnerabilities in medical devices are exposed so manufacturers can fix them, but many said there was no need for patients to panic. ""It's very easy to sort of sensationalize these problems,"" said Kevin Fu, who runs the Archimedes Research Center for Medical Device Security at the University of Michigan.Still, worries about cybersecurity have made some individuals wary of medical devices with wireless and Internet connections.In 2007, then-U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney ordered some of the wireless features to be disabled on his defibrillator due to security concerns. When asked if he would recommend other patients do the same, Cheney said not necessarily.""You've got to look at all eventualities and do whatever you have to safeguard the capabilities of the individual,"" Cheney told Reuters on Tuesday. ""In terms of how it would affect others, I think the president and vice president are in relatively unique circumstances.""Cyber researcher Jay Radcliffe used to be among the hundreds of thousands of diabetics relying on computerized insulin pumps. He said he stopped using his Medtronic pump after he found that he could hack into its wireless communications system and potentially dump fatal doses of insulin into his body.""I don't feel safe wearing these devices,"" said Radcliffe, who works for Rapid7, a security software maker. ""It's better for me to stick myself with a needle.""Medtronic said it has made security improvements to its insulin pumps, though the company declined to give specifics.George Grunberger, who has led the insulin pump management task force of the American Association of Clinical Endocrynologists, said he believes the benefits of pumps far outweigh any cyber risks, so he would not advise patients to follow Radcliffe's example.

101,"   By Susan Kelly  Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) posted a quarterly profit that was in line with analyst expectations, helped by sales of new heart devices, and said its $42.9 billion purchase of hospital products maker Covidien Plc COV.N remains on track to close early next year.Changes in U.S. tax rules aimed at curbing a spate of so-called tax inversion acquisitions have caused investors to question whether the deal would proceed after companies such as drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) and Irish competitor Shire Plc (SHP.L) dropped plans to merge.But Medtronic executives said they remain fully committed to buying Dublin-based Covidien and are focused on integration planning.""We changed our financing, but we didn't change our plan to go forward with the transaction. It didn't affect us as much as the other companies,"" Medtronic Chief Financial Gary Ellis said in an interview.The largest stand-alone medical device maker on Tuesday said its second-quarter net earnings fell to $828 million, or 83 cents a share, from $902 million, or 89 cents, the year before. Excluding costs for the Covidien acquisition and a charitable donation, Medtronic earned 96 cents a share, in line with the average analyst forecast. Revenue rose 4 percent to $4.37 billion, boosted by new products including a miniature implantable diagnostic monitor for the heart called Reveal and the CoreValve replacement heart valve. The Minneapolis-based maker of defibrillators, spinal implants, insulin pumps and other products reiterated its full-year profit outlook of $4.00 to $4.10 a share, excluding items, but raised the lower end of its revenue forecast to predict a new range of 4 percent to 5 percent growth, adjusted for currency fluctuations. Medtronic in recent years has struggled with slowing growth in maturing markets for heart and spine devices. Although acquiring Covidien is expected to reduce its overall tax burden, it will also broaden its product offerings.""We're in this environment with tough price competition, tough competitors, hospital consolidation.

102,"  (Adds CFO, analyst comments)By Susan KellyNov 18 Medtronic Inc posted a quarterly profit that was in line with analyst expectations, helped by sales of new heart devices, and said its $42.9 billion purchase of hospital products maker Covidien Plc remains on track to close early next year.Changes in U.S. tax rules aimed at curbing a spate of so-called tax inversion acquisitions have caused investors to question whether the deal would proceed after companies such as drugmaker AbbVie Inc and Irish competitor Shire Plc  dropped plans to merge.But Medtronic executives said they remain fully committed to buying Dublin-based Covidien and are focused on integration planning. ""We changed our financing, but we didn't change our plan to go forward with the transaction. It didn't affect us as much as the other companies,"" Medtronic Chief Financial Gary Ellis said in an interview.The largest stand-alone medical device maker on Tuesday said its second-quarter net earnings fell to $828 million, or 83 cents a share, from $902 million, or 89 cents, the year before.Excluding costs for the Covidien acquisition and a charitable donation, Medtronic earned 96 cents a share, in line with the average analyst forecast. Revenue rose 4 percent to $4.37 billion, boosted by new products including a miniature implantable diagnostic monitor for the heart called Reveal and the CoreValve replacement heart valve.The Minneapolis-based maker of defibrillators, spinal implants, insulin pumps and other products reiterated its full-year profit outlook of $4.00 to $4.10 a share, excluding items, but raised the lower end of its revenue forecast to predict a new range of 4 percent to 5 percent growth, adjusted for currency fluctuations. Medtronic in recent years has struggled with slowing growth in maturing markets for heart and spine devices. Although acquiring Covidien is expected to reduce its overall tax burden, it will also broaden its product offerings.""We're in this environment with tough price competition, tough competitors, hospital consolidation. You want to be able to offer a complete package and win the business,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.New U.S. tax rules aimed at deterring tax inversion deals mean Medtronic will need to borrow more money than it originally planned, rather than use overseas cash, to fund the deal.On Monday, Medtronic and Covidien said their shareholders will vote Jan. 6 on the buyout.

103,"  WASHINGTON U.S. antitrust regulators on Wednesday approved a pair of major deals in the medical field, including Medtronic's purchase of Covidien, which will allow it to take advantage of tax breaks in Ireland.The Federal Trade Commission said it would allow medical technology company Medtronic Inc's $42.9 billion deal to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc on condition that it sell its drug-coated balloon catheter business.The commission also approved two parts of a three-way deal between GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Novartis AG, which reflects an industry trend in which companies focus on their strongest businesses.The transaction, announced in April, calls for Britain's GSK to buy most of the vaccines business of Novartis, the Swiss company to purchase GSK's cancer drugs, and the two groups to team up in consumer healthcare.The FTC approved the vaccines portion of the deal and the consumer healthcare part on the condition that Novartis sell its Habitrol nicotine patch, the companies said on Wednesday. Novartis and GSK, which has Nicoderm CQ, are two of only three companies that sell nicotine patches to U.S. retailers, the FTC said.The FTC's approval of the Covidien deal takes Minnesota-based Medtronic a step closer to moving to Ireland, where it could have access to revenues earned outside the United States without paying U.S. taxes on them. The merger, which was announced in June, will create a company close in size to the medical device business of industry leader Johnson & Johnson. The European Union and China must still approve the deal, while Canada approved it on Wednesday, Medtronic said.Medtronic, which makes defibrillators, spinal implants, insulin pumps and other products, said previously that it expected the deal to close in early 2015.

112,"  By Danielle Robinson     NEW YORK, Dec 1 (IFR) - Medical device maker Medtronic has pulled in guidance on a jumbo acquisition finance bond by 10-20bp, after receiving at least US$45bn of orders, according to investors.     Market participants expect the deal to be about US$15bn-US$16bn, which would cover the cash portion of the financing for Medtronic's US$42.9bn acquisition of Covidien in the UK.      That would make it the biggest investment-grade corporate bond issue of the year, trumping Apple's US$12bn offering in April, Oracle's US$10bn transaction in June and Alibaba's US$8bn debut last month.      Originally, Medtronic intended to issue just US$2.8bn of debt for a tax-inversion purchase of Covidien, which would have given it tax efficient access to its offshore cash to pay for the deal.     Its debt needs ballooned, however, after the US plugged the tax loophole, which had sparked a rush of US companies looking to move their tax home offshore by acquiring non-US entities in jurisdictions with much lower tax rates.      Despite the surge in debt, however, investors are still enamoured with the strong single-A rating of the pro-forma company.     Some investors still think the spreads indicated at the guidance stage were still attractive.      ""It's a pretty attractive deal,"" said one market participant on the buy-side. ""Medtronic is a single-A rated name and if you are trying to operate as a long-term investor, it's a strong credit.""     Moody's said in October that Medtronic's A2 senior unsecured rating was likely to fall to A3, and its commercial paper rating to Prime-2.     Meanwhile, S&P said it may downgrade Medtronic's AA- rating by two notches to A once the acquisition closes.     Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan expect to price the bond on Monday afternoon. The transaction is broken into seven tranches including six fixed-rate bonds of three, five, seven, 10, 20 and 30-year notes, and a five-year floating rate note.

113,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings maintains its Negative Watch on  Covidien plc's (Covidien's) ratings, including the 'A' Issuer Default Rating  (IDR), following Medtronic Inc.'s (Medtronic) recent bond issuance. The ratings  apply to approximately $5 billion of Covidien's debt outstanding at June 27,  2014.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this press release. The proceeds of Medtronic's bond issuance will be used to partially fund the  company's planned acquisition of Covidien, anticipated to close in late 2014 or  early 2015. Fitch believes it is likely that most of Covidien's $5 billion in  notes will remain outstanding and that these notes will receive downstream  guarantees from the parent company after the acquisition. Independent of the  anticipated legal guarantees, strategic and operational linkages between  Medtronic and Covidien will be strong. Since the credit risk associated with the  Covidien notes will be substantially similar to the rest of the unsecured debt  in the capital structure, the ratings are likely to be equalized.  Fitch currently rates Covidien as follows, with all long- and short-term ratings  on Negative Watch: Covidien plc --IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'. Covidien International Finance S.A. (CIFSA) --IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'.  --Commercial paper program 'F1'; --Credit facility 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A'. CIFSA, which is the obligor of Covidien's debt, is a wholly owned subsidiary of  Covidien plc. CIFSA directly or indirectly owns all of the operating  subsidiaries of Covidien, issues debt, and performs treasury operations for  Covidien, otherwise it conducts no independent business operations of its own.  CIFSA's senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by both Covidien  Ltd. and Covidien plc. Covidien plc replaced Covidien Ltd. as the ultimate  parent company in June 2009.

117,"   By Susan Kelly  CHICAGO Feb 17 Medical device maker Medtronic Plc said on Tuesday it planned to seek approval from U.S. regulators to begin a new study of its version of a hypertension treatment in which nerve connections between the heart and kidney are disrupted.Called renal denervation, the treatment involves creating tiny scars along the nerves and is intended for patients whose high blood pressure cannot be controlled with drugs.Medtronic had a jump start in developing the catheter-based renal denervation treatment for the U.S. market but discontinued an initial study last year when its device failed to demonstrate effectiveness. On Tuesday, company officials said they were discussing a new design for a clinical trial with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and plan to formally submit a request to begin the study with a next-generation device.The plan was disclosed as Medtronic reported better than expected quarterly earnings, driven by growth in its cardiac and vascular business. Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said the company has analyzed what went wrong in the previous trial and remains confident in its leadership in the field.""The fact is that uncontrolled hypertension is a serious problem. Patients need help. The concept of renal denervation is a sound concept,"" Ishrak said in an interview. The company has been working with numerous experts on the study design, which will be used to apply to the FDA for an investigational device exemption, said Michael Coyle, who heads Medtronic's cardiac and vascular group.""We still have work to do, but I think we know what we want to do with the next IDE study, and we will see if we can come to agreement with the agency on moving forward with it,"" Coyle said on the company's earnings conference call.Medtronic competitors St Jude Medical Inc and Boston Scientific Corp also are developing renal denervation devices.

118,"   By Susan Kelly and Amrutha Penumudi  Medical device maker Medtronic Plc (MDT.N), which last month completed the $49.9 billion purchase of Ireland-based Covidien Plc, reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, driven by solid growth in its cardiac and vascular business.Its shares climbed 3.4 percent to $77.82 in midday trading. The medical device industry has struggled with sluggish growth in recent years as a soft economy discouraged people from seeking healthcare and hospitals pressed suppliers for lower pricing. Medtronic said on Tuesday its heart devices including implantable defibrillators, artificial valves and devices to treat atrial fibrillation, an irregular rhythm, contributed to a 5 percent increase in sales in the cardiac and vascular business, its largest unit. Excluding the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, sales in the division were up 10 percent.""That's pretty strong growth given the market dynamics we are in,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.  Medtronic acquired Covidien to expand the range of products it can offer to hospitals, lower its global tax burden and improve access to its cash outside the United States.It forecast revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent for the combined company in the fourth quarter ending in April. If the dollar remains at its current foreign exchange rate, the impact would be a $420 million to $480 million reduction in reported fourth-quarter revenue, Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said on a conference call.Looking ahead to its 2016 fiscal year, the company is projecting revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis, Ellis said.  Medtronic said it will transition to providing its earnings per share on a cash basis, which excludes amortization, starting in the fourth quarter, when it reports results for the combined company for the first time.        In the third quarter ended Jan. 23, Medtronic said its net profit rose to $977 million, or 98 cents per share, from $762 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Excluding charges primarily for the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic earned $1.01 per share, above the average analyst estimate of 97 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Third-quarter revenue increased to $4.32 billion from $4.16 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.25 billion. U.S. revenue rose 8 percent to $2.46 billion. International revenue fell 2 percent to $1.86 billion, hit by the stronger dollar.

Much of the advance came on signs of progress for the debt deal in Greece, as well as reduced tension between Russia and Ukraine. Both situations appeared less stable over the long weekend as U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. Still investors were not spurred to sell, with equities supported by crude oil, which rose for the third straight day.In Europe, European Union finance ministers pressured Greece to remain in an international financial rescue program after talks collapsed on Monday. U.S.-listed shares of the National Bank of Greece fell 11 percent to $1.44 in heavy premarket trading.Pro-Russian separatists said they would not carry out an agreement to pull back heavy guns in eastern Ukraine, putting a shaky peace deal at risk. While the United States has little direct exposure to either Greece or Ukraine and Russia, any breakdown in either place could lead to continued volatility in Europe, a major trading partner.Crude oil rose 0.2 percent to $52.86, while Brent crude  was up 0.9 percent at $61.96 on expectations that lower prices may prompt a slowdown in U.S. output. Separately, bombings by Egypt against Islamic State targets in Libya raised concerns about a threat to Middle East supplies.Despite the rise crude oil remained sharply down from a high hit in June, severely pressured energy stocks. On Monday, offshore drilling company Transocean Ltd slashed its dividend, and its chief executive officer stepped down.  Transocean shares rose 1.7 percent to $19.38 in heavy premarket trading. Medtronic Plc added 2.3 percent to $77 premarket after the medical device maker reported earnings growth of 28 percent, boosted by higher sales of its cardiac devices.Corporate earnings have also supported the equity gains. Of the 391 S&P 500 companies reporting results so far this quarter, about 71.1 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, while 57.5 percent have beaten on revenue. The earnings growth rate for the quarter is 6.6 percent, down from the 11.2 percent expected on Oct. 1, but up from 4.2 percent expected on Jan. 1.Futures snapshot at 8:04:* S&P 500 e-minis were down 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, with 209,701 contracts changing hands.* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 6.75 points, or 0.15 percent, in volume of 39,776 contracts.* Dow e-minis slipped 1 points, or 0.01 percent, with 42,359 contracts changing hands.

The medical device industry has struggled with sluggish growth in recent years as a soft economy discouraged people from seeking healthcare and hospitals pressed suppliers for lower pricing. Medtronic said on Tuesday its heart devices including implantable defibrillators, artificial valves and devices to treat atrial fibrillation, an irregular rhythm, contributed to a 5 percent increase in sales in the cardiac and vascular business, its largest unit. Excluding the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, sales in the division were up 10 percent.""That's pretty strong growth given the market dynamics we are in,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.  Medtronic acquired Covidien to expand the range of products it can offer to hospitals, lower its global tax burden and improve access to its cash outside the United States.It forecast revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent for the combined company in the fourth quarter ending in April. If the dollar remains at its current foreign exchange rate, the impact would be a $420 million to $480 million reduction in reported fourth-quarter revenue, Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said on a conference call.Looking ahead to its 2016 fiscal year, the company is projecting revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-currency basis, Ellis said.  Medtronic said it will transition to providing its earnings per share on a cash basis, which excludes amortization, starting in the fourth quarter, when it reports results for the combined company for the first time.        In the third quarter ended Jan. 23, Medtronic said its net profit rose to $977 million, or 98 cents per share, from $762 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Excluding charges primarily for the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic earned $1.01 per share, above the average analyst estimate of 97 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Third-quarter revenue increased to $4.32 billion from $4.16 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.25 billion. U.S. revenue rose 8 percent to $2.46 billion. International revenue fell 2 percent to $1.86 billion, hit by the stronger dollar. Excluding the dollar's impact, international sales increased 7 percent.

The company expects to generate $850 million in annual cost reductions over the next three years from the deal.  Savings will be found in consolidating its corporate headquarters as well as regional administrative offices and training centers where there is overlap around the globe, Ishrak said. Human resources and purchasing are additional areas where duplication can be eliminated.

The DOJ said the company will change its manufacturing process and will not be required to recall existing devices.The medical device maker and two top executives agreed to terms of the consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the DOJ said.

The proposed consent decree also requires Medtronic to retain an expert to help the company correct the regulatory violations.Medtronic said it is focused on implementing design changes to the pump and improving its neuromodulation quality system.     The implanted pump sends pain medication directly to the fluid around the spinal cord. The company said it is not required to retrieve any products currently in use, and patients using the system do not need to change their course of therapy or have the pump removed.Medtronic does not disclose sales of individual product lines but said more than 230,000 patients have used the SynchroMed system since its introduction more than 25 years ago. BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch estimated the SynchroMed pump generated $204 million in U.S. sales last year.

The deal, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, marks Bayer's second attempt to divest the blood glucose monitoring business which has brands such as Contour, Breeze, Elite and Microlet.Bayer tried to find a buyer for the business in 2012 and revived efforts to sell it in November. The industry as a whole has been grappling with increased competition and pressure to cut reimbursements from public-sector medical insurers. The company's annual report said the Diabetes Care unit was hit by reimbursement pressure and price decreases in the United States last year. The business had 909 million euros in sales last year and collaborates with U.S. medical technology company Medtronic. Panasonic Healthcare, also a maker of blood glucose meters, said in a statement the combined business would use its size to offer more affordable devices in response to a overall decline in prices and growing volumes in the industry.Rivals in the market for glucose meters include Abbott , Roche's diagnostics division and Johnson & Johnson's Lifescan unit.The sale is part of Bayer's efforts to overhaul its structure, which includes plans to list its plastics business on the stock market to free up money for investments and acquisitions in healthcare, veterinary drugs and crop protection products.

Medtronic said it is well positioned to benefit from the Medicare bundle payment program, which aims to link payments for multiple services during an episode of care rather than pay providers separately for each service.The $50 billion Covidien deal, which closed in January, helped expand the range of products Medtronic offers hospitals, as well as cut its tax burden.Medtronic's revenue rose to $7.27 billion in the first quarter, which included an extra week, from $4.27 billion a year earlier.Sales in its cardiac and vascular business, which makes pace-makers, heart valves and stents, climbed 14 percent to $2.57 billion in the quarter ended July 31. In the United States alone, sales jumped about 33 percent.Sales of ICDs, used to treat irregular heartbeat, increased in the high single digit percentage range, adjusting for the extra week, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said.The growth was in stark contrast to the soft results reported by the company's peers, Kumar noted.Medtronic's revenue from the minimally invasive therapies group, created after the Covidien deal, raked in sales of $2.46 billion, challenging the cardiac business as the company's top revenue contributor. The company's diversified position allows them to expect a ""sort of double-digit type"" growth in emerging markets, Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said in a conference call.""We had low double-digit growth in China which actually is better than what we've been seeing in most quarters last year,"" he said.

153,"   By Susan Kelly | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Dec 2 Top medical device makers are investing heavily in a new way to treat leaky mitral heart valves, a serious condition affecting millions of people, but it will be at least four years before the technology reaches the U.S. market.The minimally invasive treatment, called transcatheter mitral valve replacement, lets a doctor implant an artificial valve using a catheter inserted through the arteries. The technique spares the patient from open-heart surgery, the traditional approach to valve replacement that is considered too risky for many people, especially the elderly.Medtronic Plc, Abbott Laboratories, Edwards Lifesciences Corp and HeartWare International Inc  in recent months have spent a total of $2 billion to buy young companies developing versions of the technology.Boston Scientific Corp has an option to buy an early-stage company developing a mitral replacement system.Nearly 6 million people in the United States may suffer from mitral disease, and Wall Street analysts say it could be the next multibillion-dollar market. But the rush by leading device makers into mitral replacement has raised questions for some investors and heart doctors.Fewer than 100 people worldwide have undergone the procedure, and it is far from clear whether this technique will be significantly better than other treatments or how many patients would be candidates for the surgery.""All these things are still several years away, especially from the U.S. market,"" said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of Medtronic. Mitral disease is ""something that very gradually develops. A ton of people may have it, but a smaller number have it at a life-threatening stage."" The mitral valve helps regulate blood flow from the heart's left atrium into the left ventricle. Mitral valve regurgitation occurs when the valve does not close properly to prevent backflow. It can cause extreme fatigue and shortness of breath and increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death.""If we have a way where we can replace the valve without surgery, that is where all the excitement is,"" said Dr. Mathew Williams, chief of cardiac surgery at New York University's Langone Medical Center.REPAIR, OR REPLACE Abbott's MitraClip is the only minimally invasive product on the U.S. market for the condition. It repairs, rather than replaces, a patient's own mitral valve. It is approved for a limited group of severely ill patients and its performance improves when certain anatomical characteristics are present. Annual sales are about $250 million worldwide. Abbott sees room for both repair and replacement in treating mitral disease and projects strong double-digit annual growth for the MitraClip over the next several years, said John Capek, a company executive vice president.Rivals Edwards and Medtronic have found huge success with a minimally invasive technique for replacing malfunctioning aortic valves, and some see that as a benchmark for the mitral market.Edwards projects the aortic market will grow to $3 billion in worldwide sales in five years, double its 2014 sales, driven by advancements in the technology and approvals to treat additional patient populations. Some Wall Street analysts, including Morgan Stanley's David Lewis, predict the mitral market could be two to three times larger because more patients have mitral valve disease than aortic.""What you've got is this huge market opportunity. But the challenges are huge, and it's going to take some time,"" said Edwards Chief Executive Michael Mussallem. Edwards may be the first to launch a transcatheter replacement product in Europe, possibly by late 2017, with a U.S. approval possible by 2019.Replacing a mitral valve is particularly tricky, partly due to the valve's asymmetrical structure, which varies by patient and is more difficult to address than the circular aortic valve, according to doctors. It can also be tougher to guide a mitral valve to the heart through the arteries because of its larger size, and harder to reach the original valve due to its location.Results will not come until the end of 2017 from a key study enrolling up to 430 patients to determine whether repairing the valve using Abbott's MitraClip is better than medications alone.Doctors say the research could bolster the case for minimally invasive approaches if the results support the procedure's effectiveness. Patients with mitral valve regurgitation often take medicines used to treat heart failure, but these do not correct the valve condition.""It is a very interesting space, and there is a need for mitral valve replacement,"" said Dr. Saibal Kar, director of interventional cardiac research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. But he cautioned it is much too early to predict it will become the industry's next multi-billion-dollar market.""It is unbridled enthusiasm,"" he said.

The company's adjusted profit of $1.03 per share beat the average analyst estimate by 3 cents.The adjusted profit included a charge of 4 cents per share related to the integration of Covidien's business, which Medtronic calls its Minimally Invasive Therapies Group.Medtronic's net profit fell to $520 million, or 36 cents per share, from $828 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier, mainly due to higher restructuring charges.The company's shares were trading at $77.25 in premarket trading, after closing at $76.11 on Wednesday.

179,"   By Susan Kelly  Medtronic Plc, the world's largest standalone medical device maker, said on Monday it expects a robotic surgical system it is developing to make a meaningful contribution to company revenue beginning in fiscal 2019.Medtronic will launch the surgical robot before the 2019 fiscal year, with the first systems to roll out in India, said Bryan Hanson, head of the minimally invasive therapies group.The robot will generate ""material revenue"" in fiscal 2019, Hanson said in the company's investor day presentation. In robotically assisted surgery, the surgeon guides the robot's mechanical arms from a computer console. The approach requires smaller incisions than traditional open surgery and is increasingly used in procedures such as prostate removal and hysterectomy.When launched, Medtronic's robot will compete with Intuitive Surgical Inc's da Vinci system, the only robot for abdominal surgery now on the market. It is also expected to face competition from Verb Surgical, a startup backed by Johnson & Johnson and Alphabet Inc's Google that is developing its own robot.  Medtronic's offering will aim to lower costs associated with robotic surgery. ""It is costly today. We are going to be looking to eliminate that as a barrier,"" Hanson said.  Minneapolis-based Medtronic has 150 employees working on its robotic system across locations in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Colorado, and Germany, he added. The company, whose products range from pacemakers and heart valves to spinal implants, also announced plans to introduce its first hip and knee replacement devices as part of an Orthopedic Solutions offering for hospitals adjusting to a new Medicare bundled payment program. The Medicare plan ties reimbursement to quality and spending targets for the procedure and a recovery period after the patient leaves the hospital.Medtronic said it has acquired a company, Responsive Orthopedics, that will make the devices. It expects to have a knee available in the first half of 2017 and a hip the following year. The company is providing input to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on a possible bundled payment plan for cardiovascular surgery, with the aim of reducing hospital re-admissions through better patient monitoring, executives said.In diabetes management, Medtronic said it plans to apply by the end of June for U.S. approval to sell the first ""hybrid closed loop"" insulin pump that adjusts insulin delivery when a high glucose reading is detected and suspends it in response to a low level.

Cisco Systems, it could not be found to have induced infringement because it did not have sufficient knowledge that surgeons using its device would infringe NuVasive's patent.

204,"   By Bill Berkrot and Akankshita Mukhopadhyay  Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) on Tuesday reported quarterly sales below Wall Street's expectations for virtually all its major product lines and cut its full-year earnings forecast, and the medical device maker's shares fell more than 8 percent.Medtronic now expects adjusted earnings of $4.55 to $4.60 per share for the fiscal year ending April 28, 2017, down from its prior view of $4.60 to $4.70. It sees percentage revenue growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 in the mid-single digit range. Chief Executive Omar Ishrak acknowledged that the quarterly results were ""disappointing,"" placing the blame on a confluence of what he said were temporary factors. But investors were not in a forgiving mood, taking the company's share price down $6.98, or 8.7 percent, to $73.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.Ishrak cited weak sales in the Middle East as governments there deal with diminished purchasing power caused by low oil prices, as well as limits imposed by UK regulators on bulk purchases.Sales of cardiovascular and diabetes products and minimally invasive therapies all missed analysts' expectations.

205,"   By Bill Berkrot and Akankshita Mukhopadhyay  Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) on Tuesday reported quarterly sales below Wall Street's expectations for virtually all its major product lines and cut its full-year earnings forecast, and the medical device maker's shares fell more than 8 percent.Medtronic now expects adjusted earnings of $4.55 to $4.60 per share for the fiscal year ending April 28, 2017, down from its prior view of $4.60 to $4.70. It sees percentage revenue growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 in the mid-single digit range. Chief Executive Omar Ishrak acknowledged that the quarterly results were ""disappointing,"" placing the blame on a confluence of what he said were temporary factors. But investors were not in a forgiving mood, taking the company's share price down $6.98, or 8.7 percent, to $73.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.Ishrak cited weak sales in the Middle East as governments there deal with diminished purchasing power caused by low oil prices, as well as limits imposed by UK regulators on bulk purchases.Sales of cardiovascular and diabetes products and minimally invasive therapies all missed analysts' expectations. The cardiac and vascular unit, whose products include defibrillators, pacemakers, heart valves and stents, posted sales of $2.58 billion for the quarter, below expectations of $2.64 billion.""Top line growth slowed fairly dramatically,"" said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy, noting that the company was coming off more than two years of strong demand for newer products.""We're seeing those really strong product cycles start to wane and it's going to be a couple of quarters again before some of the new things will start to contribute,"" Denhoy said.
