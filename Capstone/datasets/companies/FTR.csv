0,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 30 The arctic cold sweeping across the United States has caused rare winter power interruptions for U.S. spinning mills in North and South Carolina, including Frontier Spinning Mills, the second-largest yarn producer in the United StatesFrontier, located in Sanford, North Carolina, the heart of the country's textile industry, has had to stop operating following requests from their power supplier, Duke Energy Corp., John Bakane, chief executive officer, told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. cotton traders, ginners, and buyers were already dealing with tight supplies and the late processing of a small crop in the world's top exporter.""You've seen mills have to shut down so power companies can heat houses,"" Bakane said.The stoppages have lasted for several hours at most, affecting spinning of about 2,000 bales of cotton, Bakane said.That represents just a sliver of Frontier's annual demand for some 940,000 480-lb bales, but it also means opportunity cost and other production strains.""Whenever you have to shut down a mill and then restart, you have all kinds of efficiency problems,"" he said. Duke Energy, the nation's largest utility, has twice asked industrial customers in the Carolinas curtail power usage this month as snow and cold gripped the region, a spokeswoman said.Industrial users can opt into contracts with utility providers in which they agree to power interruptions for rebates, said Paige Layne, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy.""When we're looking at historic lows, this is one of the tools our grid operators have available instead of rolling blackouts or other load-shed programs,"" Layne told Reuters.Traditionally, industrial users are asked to crimp demand during heat waves, as most residents use air-conditioning. Duke Energy saw a record energy usage peak on Jan. 7 of 20,246 megawatt-hours, surpassing December 2010's record of 18,985 megawatt-hours.A LOGISTICS 'DISASTER' While the impact on the textile industry has so far been small, hampering but not halting operations, it comes at a significant time for the U.S. textile industry. Companies around the world are setting up shop in the United states, drawn as much by lower-cost and reliable energy as by shifting trade flows and improving technology.""If it were to happen every week, that would be an issue,"" said a source at another U.S. mill, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak with the press.He said that his milling operation had lost two days of production altogether.The increased demand for electricity is just one example of how this winter's historic cold has roiled industry.Natural gas prices have spiked 20 percent so far this year as demand has surged.Extreme cold, ice, and snow drifts have congested up rail, port and road travel.""Logistics are a disaster this week,"" said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of Eastern Trading in South Carolina.

1,"  * UAE and Qatar recently upgraded to emerging market status* Investors still see frontier characteristics in the two* Both markets rose strongly before upgrade, then fell sharply* Middle East still carries high political risk, access barriersBy Carolyn CohnLONDON, July 16 Despite their recent upgrade to the more mainstream emerging market league, United Arab Emirates and Qatar are considered risky enough by many investors that they still treat them like frontier markets.Erratic price moves, difficulties of accessing the market, and deep political risks, alongside strong growth, are common characteristics of frontier markets, which are less developed emerging markets, and the two Middle Eastern countries still tick those boxes for many.UAE and Qatar stock markets rallied sharply over the past year in anticipation of the upgrade to emerging market status by index compiler MSCI, with the expectation that more risk-averse investors would buy in.But since the upgrade took place at the end of May, the markets have fallen sharply.Problems at Dubai-listed construction firm Arabtec  fuelled the market rout. The spiky price action reminded investors why these markets had so recently been categorised as frontier.""The stocks should not have moved up so much, they should not have dropped so much - we have sat on the sidelines and watched,"" said Andrew Brudenell, frontier fund manager at HSBC Global Asset Management.""This is sometimes how frontier markets behave.""HSBC Global Asset Management categorises UAE and Qatar as ""crossover"" markets within its frontier fund, alongside some existing emerging markets where there may be issues about how easily foreign investors can enter, such as Peru and Egypt.A frontier classification within investors' portfolios is not necessarily a bad thing. Frontier stocks have consistently outstripped the more mature emerging markets, jumping 19 percent this year compared with a 6 percent gain in emerging markets . Their higher growth makes them an appealing investment, and a lower starting base in economic development gives them more upside room.But frontier markets also tend to have more limited market access, often leading to greater volatility, and greater political risk - geopolitical risk can make western investors cautious about the whole Middle East region.""We do not believe there is much of a difference between UAE and Qatar and the rest of the MENA region,"" said Slim Feriani, executive chairman at Advance Emerging Capital. ""They are all 'growth' markets - investible and interesting markets.""VALUATION OVERLOAD MSCI announced its plan to upgrade UAE and Qatar just over a year ago, driving a furious rally in these markets.The MSCI UAE index jumped by 100 percent, though it has since fallen by as much as 20 percent.Non-Arab foreign investors make up a relatively small proportion of these markets - an estimated 15 percent of the total UAE market capitalisation, for example. They have remained loyal to the UAE, though stock exchange data shows outflows in the past month from Qatar.EPFR data shows $30 million in inflows to UAE equity funds last month, their largest monthly inflow this year. Lipper data shows inflows of $114 million into Gulf equity funds over the first five months of 2014.Favoured stocks include First Gulf Bank and Emaar Properties, though some investors are once more getting worried about a property bubble, as Dubai saw in 2008.""Concerns about the property market being overheated may well be valid,"" said Asha Mehta, lead portfolio manager for frontier equity strategy at Acadian Asset Management.""We are advocating a diversified approach to the UAE market; the market is bigger than just property.""Mehta said she would continue to hold, but not add to, UAE and Qatar in her frontier strategy after the countries also get an upgrade in S&P indexes later this year. Oliver Bell, fund manager for Middle East and Africa at T Rowe Price, says he has a 7 percent overweight position in the UAE, though this is down from 12 percent in May.But for frontier and emerging market investors, valuations are starting to look high, despite the recent correction.Investors point to valuations of 16 times earnings for the MSCI Dubai index, compared with 12 times for the emerging index.""We are fairly positive on both UAE and Qatar, but valuations are no longer as good as they were compared with 12-18 months ago,"" said Hedi Ben Mlouka, CEO of Duet MENA.SAUDI COMPETITION? Other risks to these markets include the potential loss of Qatar's role as host to the 2022 soccer World Cup following allegations of bribery, along with conflict in Syria, Iraq and the Gaza Strip.""It's not impossible things could collapse in Syria or Iraq. Now it's become a real risk,"" said Feriani.""There is a lot of geopolitical uncertainty. You should not be putting all your eggs in one basket.""A potential removal of sanctions in Iran could also draw financial capital out of Dubai, a traditional safe-haven market within the Middle East.But as UAE and Qatar adapt to their new emerging market status, they could face another competitor - Saudi Arabia, which attracts similar investors even though it is not typically considered even to have frontier status, due to the difficulties that foreign investors have in accessing it.Saudi Arabia's market capitalisation of more than $500 billion is larger than the UAE and Qatar combined. That means that any opening up could take Saudi Arabia straight to the emerging index, joining UAE and Qatar, though investors say the timing of such a liberalisation is hard to predict.According to Nina Lagron, senior EMEA fund manager at Amundi: ""The stock exchange says it is absolutely ready, but no one other than the king is going to make the decision.""

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) and long-term debt ratings of Frontier Communications Corporation  (Frontier; NYSE: FTR) on Rating Watch Negative as follows:  --IDR at 'BB'; --Senior unsecured $750 million revolving credit facility due 2018 at 'BB';  --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'BB'.  In addition, Fitch has placed the ratings of other Frontier subsidiaries on  Rating Watch Negative as listed at the end of this release. The Negative Watch arises from Frontier's plans to acquire certain wireline  operations in California, Texas and Florida from Verizon Communications Inc. for  approximately $10.5 billion, including $600 million of assumed debt. The  transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, after all necessary  regulatory approvals are obtained. Frontier intends to finance the transaction primarily with debt and equity, with  the equity consideration potentially consisting of common stock and  equity-linked securities. The company may also consider a modest level of  secured debt financing. Financing plans are backed by an 18-month bridge  facility. In reviewing the transaction, Fitch will focus on the financing of the  transaction, a review of potential synergies, and the outcome of the regulatory  review process, among other factors. In evaluating the proposed financing of the  transaction, Fitch will review the potential for secured debt in the capital  structure, as well as Frontier's plans for equity financing. The company has  indicated equity financing could approximate $3 billion, and that the Verizon  acquisition will be relatively neutral to its leverage. With respect to the  equity-linked securities, Fitch would apply its criteria 'Treatment and Notching  of Hybrids in Non-Financial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', which could  lead to less than 100% equity credit depending on the terms of the securities.  Fitch anticipates resolving the Negative Watch around the time of the closing of  the transaction, with an earlier resolution a possibility upon the conclusion of  its anticipated equity offering.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Increased in 2014: At Sept. 30, 2014, Frontier's gross leverage was  4.5x, which included debt issued to fund the October 2014 close of the AT&T line  acquisition for approximately $2 billion. Net leverage excluding transaction  financing was 3.8x. Acquisitions Improve Scale: Fitch believes the acquisition of the Connecticut  operations and the proposed acquisition of the Verizon properties will increase  the scale of Frontier, and lead to improved free cash flow (FCF, defined as net  cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends). In  Fitch's view, the two acquisitions will not require material additional capital  spending given past network upgrades by AT&T and Verizon. Revenue Pressures Slowly Abating: Through the first nine months of 2014,  business and residential customer revenue declines have moderated and are  approaching stability, although potential headwinds from competitive pressures  and the economy remain in place.  Manageable Maturities: Excluding the Verizon transaction financing, Frontier is  not expected to need to access the capital markets to refinance maturing debt  through at least 2016. Existing principal repayments of approximately $611  million over 2015 and 2016 can be managed with cash expected to be on the  balance sheet plus FCF.  Liquidity Solid: Supporting the rating is Frontier's ample liquidity, which is  derived from its cash balances and its $750 million revolving credit facility.  At Sept. 30, 2014, Frontier had $809 million in balance sheet cash.    Credit Facility and Debt Maturities: The $750 million senior unsecured credit  facility is in place until May 2018. The facility is available for general  corporate purposes but may not be used to fund dividend payments. The main  financial covenant in the revolving credit facility requires the maintenance of  a net debt-to-EBITDA level of 4.5x or less during the entire period. Net debt is  defined as total debt less cash exceeding $50 million.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Frontier's revenues on a stand-alone basis are expected to decline in the low  single digits pro forma for the October 2014 AT&T transaction; --2015 EBITDA margins are in the low to mid 40 percent range --Capex is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million in 2015; --Frontier issues approximately $3 billion in equity to fund the Verizon  wireline operations, out of the total transaction value of approximately $10.5  billion.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating could be affirmed at the current level if in Fitch's view Frontier  will be able to sustain post-transaction net leverage below 4x.  The rating could be downgraded if net leverage is expected to be above 4x due to  a number of factors, primarily a smaller than expected equity component in the  Verizon transaction financing, lower synergy realization or assumptions, and  competitive pressures on EBITDA. Fitch has also placed the following ratings on Negative Rating Watch: Frontier North Inc. --IDR at 'BB'; --$200 million unsecured notes due 2028 at 'BB+'. Frontier West Virginia --IDR at 'BB'; --$50 million private placement notes due 2029 at 'BB+'. Contact: Primary Analyst John Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

12,"  (Adds analyst comment, details; updates shares)By Devika  Krishna KumarSept 17 Verizon Communications Inc said earnings may ""plateau"" next year as evolving consumer habits drive changes to its wireless business model and as the telecom company forays into new markets such as mobile video amid stiff competition.Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless service provider, said the results would also be hit by the planned sale of some wireline assets and a focus on new business models for wireless video and ""Internet of Things"".Analysts on average were expecting Verizon's net profit to grow about 2 percent in 2016. The company said it would return to growth in 2017, but still investors sent the company's shares down as much as 3.6 percent on Thursday.Customers are increasingly moving away from traditional two-year contracts for subsidized mobile devices to monthly installment plans that have lower service fees. ""The goal is future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world,"" Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference.But Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon had been a ""laggard"" in adapting to changing needs. Smaller players such as T-Mobile US Inc lured away customers offering heavy promotions and discounts on subscription plans. "" ... And that's where I think you're going to see at least a good 4-6 quarters of really sluggish ARPA growth (at Verizon) which is obviously going to be an impact the EPS,"" McCormack said. ARPA is average revenue per account.McCormack said AT&T Inc, the No. 2 U.S. carrier, had moved customers to new plans last year ahead of Apple Inc's  iPhone upgrade. AT&T shares fell as much 1.6 percent.Apple's own financing plan for the new iPhones is expected to pile more pressure on U.S. carriers. But, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said Apple's move was not a near-term threat and could even help Verizon's cash flow. Verizon's 2016 results will also be affected by the sale of some wireline assets to Frontier Communications Corp, a  expected to close in the first half of 2016.These assets generate good margin and cash flow for Verizon, said Morningstar analyst Michael Hodel.The company has also been betting on ""Internet of Things"", the concept of connecting household devices to the Internet, to drive revenue and profit.""Ultimately, we don't believe Verizon's long-term potential and competitive position has changed much despite the changes taking place across the company and across the industry,"" Hodel said.

19,"   By Malathi Nayak and Aishwarya Venugopal  Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) disappointed Wall Street on Tuesday by reporting a smaller-than-expected subscriber gain for its main wireless business, while its CEO gave few details about plans to increase revenue from its planned purchase of Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) internet assets. Shares of the No. 1 U.S. wireless company, which had risen about 21 percent this year, fell 2 percent shortly after midday.Verizon is focused on combining the media and advertising technology assets of Yahoo and AOL, which it acquired last year, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. ""This is about scale, this is about building viewers, which drives advertisers, and we believe there is a lot of revenue synergy here,"" Shammo said. Verizon had said on Monday that it would buy Yahoo's core internet properties for $4.83 billion to expand its digital advertising and media business and compete with Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google. The company is looking for new revenue by distributing content and selling ads as its wireless business matures.On a call with investors, Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said advertisers and content partners such as the National Football League were already expressing interest in distributing video to millions of AOL and Yahoo users who visit sites such as the Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance.  The company will disclose details on cost savings from the Yahoo acquisition before the deal closes in the first quarter of 2017, McAdam added. ""All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market, and this will be a success for us,"" McAdam said. ""And we certainly expect to do better than that."" Some analysts were less optimistic, however. ""The core growth engines of the business are sputtering,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said. ""Their wireless revenue growth is negative, the wireline business hasn't been a growth engine for a decade, and they've just acquired Yahoo, whose revenues are shrinking double-digits.""Verizon added a net 615,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers in the second quarter. Analysts on average had expected 784,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Total operating revenue fell to $30.53 billion from $32.22 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $30.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Verizon cited a nearly seven-week strike by 40,000 network technicians and customer service representatives at its Fios high-speed internet, telephone and television services. The work stoppage ended in June.Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $702 million, or 17 cents per share, from $4.23 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. The strike reduced earnings by about 7 cents per share, the company said. Excluding special items, earnings of 94 cents per share exceeded the analysts' average estimate of 92 cents.
