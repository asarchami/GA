2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  senior unsecured notes due 2026 issued by Boston Properties LP (NYSE: BXP). The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS BXP's superior portfolio asset quality, management and capital access support  the ratings. The ratings also reflect BXP's adequate liquidity position that is  supported by its large unrestricted cash balance, retained free cash flow, near  full availability under its $1 billion revolving credit facility and its large  unencumbered pool of high-quality assets in markets with excellent investment  and financing liquidity characteristics. The company's moderately concentrated geographical footprint and related  exposure to finance, legal and government and defense industry tenants, which  currently have relatively soft operating fundamentals, balance the ratings.  Execution and liquidity risks associated with the company's development platform  are also perennial credit elements. SUPERIOR ASSET QUALITY BXP owns a high-quality portfolio of predominantly class 'A' office properties  located in supply-constrained central business district (CBD) markets. The  company's CBD properties are often leading properties in their submarkets that  compete for the highest-profile tenants, and have historically attracted  significant investor and lender interest. The latter enhances BXP's contingent  liquidity profile, including during challenging property and capital market  environments. APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE AND COVERAGE Fitch expects BXP's leverage to be in the mid 5x-low-6x range through 2017,  which is strong for a 'BBB+' rated office REIT with BXP's large size, superior  portfolio asset quality and excellent track record of capital access and  financial discipline. BXP has opportunistically sold assets to take advantage of  strong investor demand for core properties in high-barrier markets and build  liquidity for its development platform, which has helped drive the company's  leverage lower.  Fitch's ratings for BXP assume that it will continue to manage leverage closer  to its 6.5x-7.0x target through-the-cycle despite the projections of lower  leverage through the rating horizon. Fitch views a large, opportunistic  acquisition or additions to the development pipeline as the most likely causes  for the company's leverage to move higher, although Fitch has not assumed them  in its rating case forecast. BXP's net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA for  the trailing 12 months (TTM) was 5.3x as of June 30, 2016, and its annualized  second-quarter 2016 (2Q16) leverage was 5.4x.  Fitch does not calculate BXP's metrics on a look-through basis for JVs. All of  the company's pro rata unconsolidated JV debt is nonrecourse to BXP. Although  BXP has contributed equity to right-size mortgages at times, it has also been  willing to offer deeds in lieu of foreclosure on assets where it believes the  value of the assets is permanently impaired below the value of the mortgage.  Fitch expects BXP's fixed-charge coverage will improve to the mid-to-high 2.0x  range through 2017, aided by low-single-digit cash same store net operating  income (SSNOI) growth, incremental NOI from new developments and interest  savings from refinancing upcoming debt maturities. BXP's fixed-charge coverage  was 2.4x for the TTM ended June 30, 2016. Fitch defines fixed charge coverage as  recurring operating EBITDA, including recurring cash distributions from joint  ventures, less straight line rents and maintenance capital expenditures and  leasing costs, divided by interest incurred plus preferred dividends. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY BXP maintains an adequate liquidity position. For the period July 1, 2016 to  Dec. 31, 2017, the company's base case liquidity coverage ratio is 0.5x (0.7x  pro forma for its $1 billion unsecured notes offering). BXP's liquidity coverage  would improve to 0.9x (1.4x pro forma) assuming the company refinances maturing  mortgages at 80% of current balances. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as  sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash, availability under the company's  unsecured credit facility, and expected retained cash flows from operating  activities after dividends) divided by uses of liquidity (pro rata debt  maturities, expected recurring capital expenditures, and development costs). Fitch-estimated development spending of roughly $850 million (representing just  over half of its $1.6 billion of unfunded development commitments at 2Q16)  through the rating horizon is the largest anticipated use of capital in our  stressed liquidity analysis. BXP likely has some flexibility to defer spending  if market conditions weaken unexpectedly and materially. The company  demonstrated its willingness to stop development (when possible) in response to  changing market conditions when it capped its 250 W. 55th Street development at  grade level during the last downturn.  BXP paid out approximately 71% of its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) as  dividends to common shareholders during 2Q16. The company has historically kept  its pay-out ratio below 75% - a credit positive. BXP's policy is to pay the  minimum 90% of taxable net income dividend required to maintain REIT status. As  such, BXP retains approximately $180 million of cash flow per annum that can be  used to meet its liquidity obligations including funding new investments and  satisfying debt maturities. EXCELLENT CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY BXP holds a large, high-quality pool of unencumbered assets with well  above-average financeability and saleability characteristics. As of June 30,  2016, BXP owned or had interests in 145 unencumbered assets that generate  annualized cash NOI of approximately $1.189 billion, or 77.5% of its  consolidated NOI. The company's unencumbered pool includes a number of trophy  assets such as 399 Park Avenue and Times Square Tower in New York, Embarcadero  Center One, Two, and Three in San Francisco, the Prudential Center complex in  Boston (including three office towers, one of the most productive retail centers  in the U.S., and a supermarket), and the Capital Gallery complex in Washington,  D.C., among others.  BXP's unencumbered pool also benefited from the addition of the John Hancock  Building in Boston when the mortgage encumbering the property was legally  defeased in December 2015. The delivery and stabilization of BXP's high-quality  development portfolio also will further bolster the company's unencumbered  portfolio quality.  The company's unencumbered assets cover unsecured debt 3.2x based on a direct  capitalization approach of unencumbered NOI using a stressed 7.5% capitalization  rate. Fitch views this level of coverage as strong for the rating, and is one of  the highest coverages in Fitch's rated universe. BXP has maintained UA/UD  coverage between 2.6x-4.0x since 2009. ELEVATED 2017 DEBT MATURITIES  Fitch views BXP's debt ladder as reasonably well balanced and manageable,  notwithstanding the unusually high (24% of its pro rata debt) amount of debt  that matures during 2017. The company has historically been able to go to market  with sizable unsecured notes offerings to refinance its debt maturities, and  $2.1 billion of $2.4 billion in 2017 maturities consists of mortgages which  Fitch expects can be easily refinanced with secured debt as well. The company's 2017 maturities are mostly secured property-level mortgages and,  therefore pose limited risk to the corporate entities that Fitch rates. The  majority ($1.3 billion; 54%) of its 2017 maturities relates to the company's 767  5th Avenue (GM Building) consolidated JV that Fitch expects will be refinanced  with secured mortgage debt. The superior asset quality and conservative existing  leverage on the asset limit the refinance risk. BXP has entered into a handful of forward-starting interest rate swaps to lock  in interest rates for a portion of its planned refinancings of the $750 million  mortgage loan at 599 Lexington Avenue in New York (matures on March 1, 2017 and  can be prepaid without penalty beginning in September 2016), as well as the $1.3  billion mortgage loan at 767 Fifth Avenue (matures on Oct. 7, 2017 but can be  prepaid without penalty beginning in June 2017). BXP also plans on refinancing  its remaining maturing mortgage loans that are not being targeted by its  interest rate swap strategy in late 2016 and early 2017. Fitch expects the  company to monitor opportunities to accelerate these financings, despite  associated prepayment penalties. BXP proactively renegotiated and expanded its unsecured revolving line of credit  in July 2013 - well ahead of the prior line's June 2014 expiration - partly to  ensure adequate liquidity to handle its large maturities in 2017. At that time,  BXP increased the capacity on its line to $1 billion from $750 million and  purposefully set the expiration date beyond its 2017 maturity wall at July 2018.  The company also negotiated an expanded $500 million accordion feature as a  potential source of additional contingent liquidity, up from $250 million  previously. TENANT INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION RISK The company has a high proportion of financial, legal and government-related  tenants in its portfolio. Tenants in these segments comprised approximately 27%,  24% and 4% of gross rent, respectively, for a combined total of 55% as of June  30, 2016. Lower trading volumes and increased regulation are  causing companies  to delay leasing decisions and in many instances have reduced space demand.  Legal tenants continue to optimize their space needs and are often shrinking  their office footprints when leases expire. Finally, the U.S. Government (BXP's  largest tenant at 4% of gross rent) and related government contractors are  demanding less space due in large part to the impact of sequestration,  particularly in the Washington D.C. metro area. DEVELOPMENT RISK  Development is a key component of BXP's strategy and the company has  historically allowed its pipeline of projects under construction to become a  large percentage of its portfolio on both a relative and absolute basis. For  example, the pipeline grew to 20.3% of total undepreciated book assets in 2Q08,  with the unfunded portion representing 11% of total assets.  The total estimated investment of BXP's development pipeline was $2.1 billion at  June 30, 2016, which represented 9.2% of total assets, with the unfunded portion  comprising a smaller 5.3% of total assets. Fitch would view cautiously a  pipeline that grows close to 20% of total assets or approaching 10% of remaining  funding, absent significant pre-leasing. PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between BXP's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch's research on 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis,' these preferred securities are deeply  subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor  recoveries in the event of a corporate default. STABLE RATING OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that fixed-charge coverage and  leverage will sustain at current levels over the next 12-24 months, but that the  company will target higher through-the-cycle leverage of roughly 6.5x to 7.0x. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --SSNOI is flat- to slightly down during 2016 and grows at a low single-digit  rate during 2017; --Development completions of $500 million and $400 million during 2016 and 2017,  respectively; --G&A growth of 2% per annum through 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Although Fitch does not expect positive rating momentum, the following factors  could result in an upgrade to BXP's ratings and/or Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 6.0x for several quarters  (leverage was 5.3x for the TTM ended June 30, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x for several  consecutive quarters (coverage was 2.4x for the TTM ended June 30, 2016). Conversely, the following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings  and/or Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA sustaining above  7.5x;  --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.0x; --A liquidity coverage ratio of below 1.0x.
