0,"  Health insurer Centene Corp reported a nearly six-fold rise in quarterly profit, helped by new contract wins and expansion of existing contracts.Net earnings attributable to Centene rose to $53.2 million, or 93 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $9.1 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding discontinued operations, profit was 84 cents per share in the quarter ended December 31, ahead of analysts' estimates of 83 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Premium and services revenue rose about 31 percent to $2.86 billion as Centene won new contracts in Kansas, California and New Hampshire, and expanded existing contracts in Mississippi, Ohio and Florida.The company, which has posted better-than-expected profit every quarter in the last fiscal year, said it began serving members enrolled in health insurance exchanges in nine states in January. Centene raised its full-year premium and service revenue forecast due to the health insurer fee under the Affordable Care Act and to account for the benefit from its acquisition of a majority stake in home health services provider U.S. Medical Management LLC.The company now expects full-year premium and service revenue of $13.8-$14.3 billion, compared with the $13.5-$14.0 billion it forecast in December.

6,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published a new report detailing  key credit metrics of nine-publicly-traded U.S. health insurance and managed  care companies that are either rated or followed by Fitch: Aetna, Inc., Centene  Corp., Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc., Humana, Inc., Molina Health Care Inc.  UnitedHealth Group, Incorporated, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. and WellPoint,  Inc.  The report is meant to be used as a desktop guide, providing financial data and  rankings, key credit strengths and concerns, and current ratings levels and  rating sensitivities. Fitch views the key credit metrics of these nine publicly traded health insurers  as improving in the first half of 2014 compared to the prior year period. Strong  revenue growth driven by the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchanges and Medicaid  expansion, continuing popularity of Medicare Advantage products and  acquisition-related growth generated increases in EBITDA that more than offset  declining margins. Interest coverage ratios improved, and leverage ratios  declined modestly. The first section of the report includes company rankings based on revenue  growth, EBITDA margin and returns on capital as well as capitalization measures  such as debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage. The second section of the report  provides a more detailed discussion of the nine individual companies including  credit strengths and concerns, ratings and rating triggers (where applicable),  and detailed information about each company's capital structure. The report 'U.S. Health Insurance: Credit Metrics Update' is available on the  Fitch web site at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

11,"  Aetna Inc (AET.N), the third largest U.S. health insurer, raised its 2015 profit forecast after negotiating a price cut from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) on hepatitis C treatments for this year. Aetna said the increased outlook was also due to momentum in its business early in the year after a strong finish to 2014. It boosted its full-year operating earnings forecast to at least $7.00 per share, up from $6.90. Aetna also reported quarterly profit in line with estimates.The stock rose more than 1 percent.Aetna reported an improved medical benefit ratio of 83 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with 83.9 percent a year earlier. The ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums.The company said the costs of medical care have remained moderate and that it expects its medical benefit ratio to be between 82 percent and 83 percent. Its comments on spending were in line with larger competitors UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N). The company said the medical benefit ratio for commercial plans, its largest business, deteriorated to 82 percent from 81.7 percent, due to higher-than-expected medical costs in small businesses and expenses associated with the new hepatitis C treatments.Last year Aetna was among insurance companies and other payers who said that the $84,000 cost per treatment for Gilead's new hepatitis C drug, which hit the market late in 2013, was unaffordable. When AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) launched a competing drug at the end of 2014, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and others started negotiating for discounts from Gilead. Aetna said last month it had secured a lower cost and would back Gilead's Harvoni drug as its preferred treatment over AbbVie's.Aetna's membership rose to 23.5 million at the end of 2014 from 22.2 million a year earlier, helped by growth in new insurance created by the national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare. Aetna said it added 560,000 members from the Obamacare exchanges at the end of 2014 and expects that to increase to 800,000 by the end of the first quarter, helped by expansion into Georgia.The company reported operating earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter, largely in line with average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $14.77 billion beat the average estimate of $14.60 billion.The company's shares rose $1.01 to $93.23 on the New York Stock Exchange.

16,"   By Vidya L Nathan and Amrutha Penumudi  U.S. health insurer Centene Corp will buy smaller rival Health Net Inc for $6.3 billion, underscoring the healthcare industry's rush to bulk up to negotiate better prices with suppliers and hospitals, and attract new customers.Health Net's shares touched a record high of $76.67 on Thursday, but stayed shy of Centene's offer of $78.57, which is at a 21 percent premium. Centene shares were down 3 percent at $78.42.The deal comes a week after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld subsidies for individuals under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, keeping a large chunk of patients intact under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.Insurers have said subsidies are key to bringing in new customers and the ruling has removed uncertainty for insurers looking for acquisitions. It could also spur more deal making in the health insurance sector, which has already seen a blitz of merger activity this year.Aetna Inc, the third largest insurer is looking to buy smaller rival Humana Inc. No. 2 Anthem Inc has offered to buy Cigna Corp to create the largest insurer in the country, toppling UnitedHealth Group Inc . Media reports have also said UnitedHealth could be eyeing Cigna and Aetna. Health insurers are not alone in trying to beef up.Drugmakers, retailers and pharmacy benefit managers have contributed to the wave of healthcare acquisitions since 2014, pushing deal-making in the industry to record levels.    Also, an expected increase in federal interest rates, which will make borrowing costly, is expected to push companies to close deals over the next few months.UnitedHealth could bid for either Health Net or Centene, or even the combined company, Leerink & Co analyst Anagha Gupte said. Gupte said she now expects other smaller insurers such as WellCare Health Plans Inc and Molina Healthcare Inc to merge.Centene's buyout of Health Net will catapult it to the top of the government insurance heap, ahead of bigger rivals who dominate the private insurance market. The combined company will serve more than 10 million members across the country, but will still be small in terms of total membership. Market leader UnitedHealth, for example, has nearly 46 million members.Centene, which will also assume $500 million in Health Net debt, said the deal is expected to boost adjusted profit by more than 20 percent in the first year.

22,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Health insurer Centene Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would consider buying the Medicare Advantage plans its rivals are likely to divest during the current phase of consolidation in the managed care industry.U.S. health insurers are consolidating in an attempt to cut costs and improve their bargaining power with doctors and hospitals.Anthem Inc said last week that it would buy Cigna Corp for about $54.2 billion, creating the largest U.S. health insurer, while Aetna Inc agreed to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion this month.Antitrust regulators have said both deals could result in the sale of Medicare Advantage plans in U.S. counties where the combined companies' market share is seen as anti-competitive.Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private health insurers, which are in turn paid by the government.Centene is more likely to buy the divested plans if they are in the company's existing markets, Chief Executive Michael Neidorff said on a conference call on Tuesday. ""If it's in a new market, it has to have significant size and scale to make it worthwhile,"" he said.Centene currently runs Medicare Advantage plans in nine states, but will expand its footprint once it completes its merger with smaller rival Health Net Inc.Centene, which agreed to buy Health Net for $6.3 billion this month, said net profit rose to $88 million, or 72 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $49 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.The earnings per share figure includes a 1 cent per share charge associated with the Health Net merger. Analysts on average were expecting net earnings of 69 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company also said it added 1.3 million members during the quarter compared with a year earlier.However, Centene's health benefits ratio, or the amount it spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums, deteriorated to 89.1 percent from 88.9 percent a year ago, due to a rise in costs as it entered two new states. Centene forecast full-year earnings of $2.74-$2.82 per share. Analysts were expecting $2.79 per share.Total revenue rose 37 pct to $5.51 billion, but missed the average estimate of $5.53 billion.The company's shares were flat in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

34,"  U.S. health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower medical costs in certain patient populations and the acquisition of rival Health Net.The company's health benefits ratio, or the amount it spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums, improved to 88.7 percent in the first quarter from 89.9 percent a year earlier.This decrease was driven by lower medical expenses in higher acuity patients, who need more care, the company said.The ratio, which is closely watched by investors for increased medical costs and usage, was 80 basis points below what Susquehanna Financial analysts were expecting.The company’s membership increased by 7.1 million to 11.5 million, primarily due to the Health Net acquisition.Centene has benefited from the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, like other health insurers who focus on government-sponsored plans for the under-insured or uninsured. The company served 984,900 members in Medicaid expansion programs in nine U.S. states in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with 331,800 in seven states in the year-earlier quarter.Centene, which closed the Health Net acquisition last month, cut its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $4.00-$4.35 per share from $4.05-$4.40. The forecast was updated to account for a later close of the Health Net acquisition.Centene's revenue rose to $6.95 billion in the first quarter from $5.13 billion a year earlier.It posted a net loss of $17 million, or 14 cents per share, due to acquisition-related expenses.

42,"   By Carl O'Donnell and Caroline Humer  WellCare Health Plans Inc (WCG.N) and Centene Corp (CNC.N) have made competing offers for the Medicare Advantage insurance plans  that Aetna Inc (AET.N) looks to shed in seeking clearance for its acquisition of Humana Inc (HUM.N), people familiar with the matter said.The potential divestiture is a central pillar of Aetna's efforts to win over regulators for its $34-billion Humana deal. The health insurer met U.S. Department of Justice officials on Friday in a bid to address their antitrust concerns.WellCare and Centene submitted bids this week for a portfolio of Aetna's Medicare Advantage plans that covers around 350,000 patients, the people said. Wall Street analysts have said that for Aetna to appease antitrust concerns, the company would need to sell Medicare Advantage plans in geographies where combined market share is greater than 35 percent. Aetna and Humana combined will still have more than 4 million Medicare Advantage customers if the deal goes through, making it one of the largest players. Overlap in other parts of the companies' businesses is small. Aetna, the third largest health insurer, sells individual, small business and large corporate plans as well as other government plans, while two-thirds of Humana's business is Medicare Advantage. Reuters first reported earlier in July that Aetna had launched the sale of the Medicare Advantage portfolio, which has a $2.5-billion book of business and could be valued at around $1 billion. The portfolio has also attracted interest from other companies, and there is no certainty that WellCare or Centene will prevail should Aetna go ahead with the divestiture, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Aetna declined to provide any comment, while Humana and WellCare did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""It is Centene's policy not to comment on rumors,"" a Centene spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. ""Additionally, it is a long-term policy of Centene not to participate in auctions."" The potential deal would more than double the size of WellCare's and Centene's Medicare businesses.WellCare, which primarily sells Medicaid plans, had 326,000 members in Medicare Advantage plans at the end of March, including in Florida, New York, Georgia, Texas, California and Mississippi.  Centene had 303,000 members in Medicare plans, including Medicare Advantage and new pilot programs serving those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Centene closed on an acquisition of Health Net this year.The U.S. Department of Justice has simultaneously been scrutinizing Anthem Inc's ANTHM.N acquisition of Cigna Corp (CI.N). Both deals were announced within a month of one another last summer. If both deals were to be approved, the number of national health insurance companies would shrink to three from five. Some doctors, hospitals and consumers fear the deals could lead to higher premiums for patients and lower payouts to healthcare providers. The companies have argued they need to merge in order to bring down medical costs for consumers.So far this year, regulators and government departments have treated large deals with a heavy hand, effectively shooting down the planned mergers of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Allergan Plc (AGN.N), Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), and Staples Inc (SPLS.O) and Office Depot Inc (ODP.O).",2016-07-11,CNC,"Mon Jul 11, 2016 | 1:24pm EDT","Exclusive: WellCare, Centene make offers for Aetna assets - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-aetna-divestiture-idUSKCN0ZP0TG?type=companyNews

So I guess somebody was spreading some rumors,"" he said.Centene's shares fell 13.3 percent to $65.16 despite the company reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit and increasing its forecast for full-year earnings.

This reserve did not impact results given the nuances of accounting, but analysts said investors could grow frustrated over Health Net's performance, which has been below expectations so far. The company raised its full-year earnings forecast range to $2.65-$3.00 per share from $2.45-$2.80.Centene's health benefits ratio, or the amount it spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums, improved to 86.6 percent from 89.1 percent.The ratio, watched closely by investors for increased medical costs and usage, improved largely due to a higher mix of commercial and Medicare patients who have lower expenses.The company's revenue nearly doubled to $10.90 billion.

48,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON For the second time in less than a week, U.S. securities regulators on Tuesday filed civil charges against a company for inserting language into its severance agreements that prevents outgoing employees from reaping the benefits of government whistleblower awards.The Securities and Exchange Commission said Health Net Inc will pay $340,000 to settle the charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing. A statement issued by the health insurer, which has since merged with Centene Corp, said that Centene was not a party to the issues at the heart of the SEC's case.The SEC said it did not have any evidence that Health Net employees were deterred from reporting to the agency as a result of the severance agreements. However, the SEC said the agreements, signed by about 600 employees, removed ""the critically important financial incentives"" designed to encourage would-be whistleblowers to come forward by requiring them to waive ""any right to any individual monetary recovery"" arising from a government proceeding.The case comes on the heels of another matter the SEC filed against Atlanta-based building products maker BlueLinx Holdings Inc., also in connection with severance agreements that required departing employees to waive their rights to government bounties.BlueLinx agreed to pay a $265,00 penalty, settling also without admitting or denying the charges, the SEC announced on Aug. 10. A spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.The SEC in 2011 adopted rules designed to encourage people to come forward with tips about possible corporate wrongdoing.Those rules protect whistleblowers from retaliation and also ban companies from taking any action that could ""impede an individual from communicating directly"" with the SEC, including through confidentiality agreements. Early last year, the SEC warned companies that it was on the lookout for potentially troublesome severance agreements.In April 2015, it filed a case against KBR for using restrictive confidentiality agreements, which muzzled employees who had been interviewed in connection with internal investigations.KBR at the time said it was pleased to resolve the case and that it had never tried to enforce its confidentiality agreements.Later that same month, SEC Chair Mary Jo White announced that more cases could be in store, after the agency uncovered severance agreements that forced employees to forgo their whistleblower awards.""You can imagine our Enforcement Division's view of those,"" she said at the time.  In June of this year, the SEC also penalized Bank of America's Merrill Lynch for using agreements that barred employees from reporting to the SEC without first alerting the company attorneys.The charges against Merrill Lynch over its severance agreements were part of a much bigger case involving allegations it misused customer cash. The company agreed to modify how its severance agreements are worded.The SEC's cases against BlueLinx and Health Net, however, are the first two which specifically take aim at agreements requiring outgoing employees to waive their rights to collect government bounties. ""These twin actions against BlueLinx and Health Net show that the SEC means business when it comes to efforts by corporations to impede their employees from participating in the SEC whistleblower program,"" said David Marshall, an attorney with Katz, Marshall and Banks who represents whistleblowers. More cases against companies with restrictive severance agreements could still be in store.On Monday, SandRidge Energy [SDOCQ.PK] disclosed it had received a subpoena from the SEC in connection with its employment agreements. It said it was cooperating with the inquiry.According to a defense attorney familiar with the matter, the SEC has been working on similar cases and some settlements have been pending for months now. The attorney said the SEC had intended to file the cases simultaneously as a sweep. It was unclear why the cases were not filed concurrently, and an SEC spokesman declined to comment.Shayne Stevenson, an attorney at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP who represents whistleblowers, said he expects companies will try new tactics over time to give themselves legal cover, while still trying to silence whistleblowers.""As someone who has seen these contracts evolve since last year’s settlement with KBR, we have seen ever more devious ways that corporations try to undermine the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program,"" he said.
