0,"   By Philip Pullella | VATICAN CITY  VATICAN CITY Pope Francis will not show leniency towards pedophile priests because truth and justice are more important than protecting the Church, the Vatican's former sex crimes prosecutor said on Saturday.Monsignor Charles Scicluna, the most authoritative Catholic official on the Church's abuse crisis, also told Reuters that the number of clerics defrocked by the Vatican was likely to have fallen to about 100 in 2013 from about 125 in 2012.Scicluna said Francis, despite his merciful nature, would be very tough on pedophile priests after an abuse crisis that the pope on Thursday called ""the shame of the Church.""""I have met with Francis and he has expressed great determination to continue on the line of his predecessors,"" said Scicluna, who served in the Vatican for 17 years before he was named an auxiliary bishop in his native Malta in 2012.""His gospel of mercy is very important but it is not cheap mercy. It has to respect the truth and the demands of justice,"" Scicluna said in a telephone interview.The pope, who was elected last March, set up a commission of experts last month to address the sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church, in his first major step to tackle a crisis that has plagued it for two decades.The group will consider ways to better screen priests, protect minors and help victims in the face of charges the Vatican has not done enough to guard the vulnerable or make amends. Scicluna, who served in Rome for 17 years, was the Vatican's expert last Thursday in Geneva when United Nations child protection experts pushed Holy See delegates to reveal the scope of the decades-long sexual abuse of minors by Roman Catholic priests.A BLESSING Despite the unprecedented grilling of Vatican delegation, he said the experience was very helpful for the Church.""We have a great responsibility to our people ... I think it was a blessing that we had this meeting (in Geneva) before the commission is set up,"" he said. The commission is still in the process of being formed and its members chosen. Scicluna confirmed that published Vatican records show that in 2011 the number of priests defrocked hit a recent peak of some 260.He said the rise was due to ""contingent backlog problems with some historical cases"" and that he expected the numbers were ""stabilizing"" at about 100 in 2013.Scicluna said the numbers for most years are made up of about 50 percent by priests who were actively defrocked and the rest by those who had asked to leave the priesthood after they ""admit their crimes"". ""Dismissal is imposed and dispensation presupposes the request of the priest but the effect is the same,"" he said.In 2012, while he was still in his previous job at the Vatican, he created a stir when he uttered the word ""omerta"" - usually used to describe the Sicilian Mafia's code of silence - in relation to the sexual abuse crisis in the Church.He used it again on Saturday in response to a question.""I think there is a clear signal that 'omerta' is not the way the Church should respond,"" he said. ""I am convinced that the best thing for the institution is to own up to the truth whatever it is.""The Church has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation in sexual abuse cases worldwide, bankrupting a string of dioceses. Last Thursday the pope said it was right to pay damages to victims.Victims groups have said more has to be done to protect children and that bishops who have been accused of covering up crimes by shuttling priests from parish to parish should be held accountable.(Reporting By Philip Pullella)",2014-01-18,CHD,"Sat Jan 18, 2014 | 10:04am EST",Pope won't be lenient with predator priests: ex-prosecutor,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pope-abuse-idUSBREA0H0D720140118?type=companyNews
1,"   By Philip Pullella | VATICAN CITY  VATICAN CITY A commission advising Pope Francis on the sexual abuse crisis will recommend that negligent clerics be held accountable regardless of their rank in the Church, Boston's Cardinal Sean O'Malley said on Saturday.In many cases of abuse, most of which took place decades ago but surfaced in the past 15 years, bishops seeking to protect the Church's reputation moved priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking them or handing them over to police. The commission, made up of four men and four women from eight countries including an Irish woman who was a victim of abuse, met for the first time since its formation in March, holding talks with the pope and Vatican officials.""We see ensuring accountability in the Church as especially important,"" the commission said in a statement.O'Malley, known as a pioneer for a more open and forceful approach to tackling the scandal since he published a database of Boston clergy accused of sexual abuse of minors online in 2011, said a person's rank in the Church should not be cause for special treatment or protection.""Our concern is to make sure that there are clear and effective protocols to deal with superiors in the Church who have not fulfilled their obligations to protect children,"" he told reporters.Victims' groups have pressed the Vatican to hold bishops who either shielded abusers or were negligent in protecting children to account, along with abusers themselves. IGNORANCE AND DENIAL O'Malley said accountability should apply to ""every one in the Church regardless of what their status is ... both for those who perpetrate the crime of sexual abuse and those who are negligent in child protection"".The commission, which includes Baroness Sheila Hollins of Britain, will draw up protocols for the pope to consider. O'Malley said they would ""lead to an open process that will hold people accountable to their responsibility to protect children"" around the world.Procedures to protect children and punish abusers are most advanced in countries such as the United States and Ireland.But O'Malley said there was still ""so much ignorance, so much denial"" in some parts of the Church about sexual abuse.""There are a lot of people who think it's limited to certain countries and that it's been dealt with and now we can move on to something else and that is simply not true,"" he said. ""The Church needs to always be reviewing what we have done, trying to improve what we have done, monitoring what we have done because it's possible to have beautiful policies but if they are not implemented it's only window dressing,"" he said.Last month, Pope Francis sought forgiveness for the ""evil"" committed by priests who molested children.In February, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child accused the Vatican of systematically turning a blind eye to decades of abuse and attempting to cover up sex crimes. The Vatican called the report unfair and ideologically slanted.One key member of the Church commission is Marie Collins, a victim of abuse by a priest in her native Ireland and who has campaigned for the protection of children and for justice for victims.""I know there are many, many survivors around the world who are hoping and have great expectations of this commission,"" she said.

3,"  * Cyprus LGBT community becomes visible with gay pride* Cyprus decriminalised homosexuality in 1998* Church describes homosexuality as an illnessBy Michele KambasNICOSIA, May 29 Cyprus's first Gay Pride march on Saturday will highlight the lack of legal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) citizens 16 years after homosexuality was decriminalised.Gay couples in Cyprus do not have the same rights to social housing and other benefits as heterosexuals and miss out on other entitlements such as being consulted over medical treatment if a partner is ill. ""Nothing has happened to improve the legal rights of LGBT since 1998,"" said Costas Gavrielides, head of Accept LGBT Cyprus, a group representing some 700 people.He noted that the government, elected in early 2013, had still not made good on a campaign pledge to submit legislation to allow gay civil partnerships to parliament within a year.""We are strongly pushing for this to materialise ... We believe that society has moved on much more than politicians,"" Gavrielides said, adding that many heterosexual supporters were also expected to join the march through the capital Nicosia. Some sections of Cypriot society still consider homosexuality taboo, and the island's conservative Orthodox Church has described it as an ""illness which needs treatment"".The Church's ruling body said in a recent statement that it opposed the ""institutional and social acceptance"" of homosexuality, which was not a ""normal way of life"".A religious group said it plans a counter march on Saturday. Cyprus only repealed laws criminalising homosexuality in 1998, five years after a lone activist won a damning judgement against the country from the European Court of Human Rights.Authorities in the island's Turkish Cypriot north, a self-declared state recognised only by Ankara, repealed a similar law  left over from British colonial times in February. A gay pride march was held there on May 17.The International Gay and Lesbian Association (ILGA) ranks  Cyprus among the lowest of all European countries for rights extended to the LGBT community.But Gavrielides said social attitudes were changing, and that the Pride march would bring the island's gay community ""into the limelight"" and stimulate wider debate about the rights of minorities.""Society in general is more accepting to LGBT than many think they are,"" he said.
