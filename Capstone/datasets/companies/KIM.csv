0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a credit rating of 'BBB+'  to the $500 million of 3.2% senior unsecured notes due 2021. The notes were  priced at 99.8% of par to yield 3.232% to maturity at a 105 bps spread to the  benchmark Treasury. The company intends to use the net proceeds for general  corporate purposes including reducing borrowings under the revolving credit  facility and to pre-fund certain near-term debt maturities.  Fitch currently rates Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM) and its two-wholly  owned subsidiaries (collectively, Kimco) as follows:  Kimco Realty Corporation: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured term loans 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock 'BBB-'. Kimco North Trust III (as the issuing entity for Kimco's Canadian unsecured  notes offerings): --IDR 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'. KRC Lending S.A. de C.V. SOFOM ENR (as the issuing entity for Kimco's Mexican  unsecured notes offerings):  --IDR 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured term loan 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Kimco's appropriate leverage and fixed-charge coverage  metrics, its solid track record owning a large and diversified pool of community  and neighborhood shopping centers, its experienced leasing and management team  and its high-quality, diversified tenant mix with a well-laddered lease  expiration schedule. The ratings also factor in the company's track record of  accessing a wide variety of capital sources and the long-term benefits of its  ongoing portfolio simplification strategy. These positive rating elements are balanced by slightly low unencumbered asset  coverage of unsecured debt for the rating category and a U.S. retailer  environment where market share defensibility remains a key challenge for many  traditional retailers. SIMPLIFYING PORTFOLIO; SAVE FOR 'PLUS' STRATEGY Since 2010, Kimco has streamlined its portfolio by selling non-core and  non-retail assets and reinvesting the proceeds into higher quality retail  properties. The latter includes the acquisition of selected partners' interests  in managed joint ventures. Pro forma for the most recent portfolio sale in  Mexico, Kimco will hold only 36 properties in Latin America and is currently  negotiating contracts for their sale. Fitch expects Kimco will continue to sell  non-core properties and recycle the capital into core properties going forward.  The simplification strategy recognizes that shareholders and creditors discount  the value of non-retail and/or non-recurring cash flows. However, Kimco  differentiates its 'Plus' business, where it seeks to act opportunistically with  retailer-controlled real estate, from its simplification efforts by showing the  relationship to its core neighborhood and community center properties and  historical returns. Thus, Fitch views Kimco's participation in the deal to buy  Safeway Inc. as neutral to the credit given its negligible effect on metrics.  DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO Kimco owns and operates a large and diversified portfolio of consolidated and  unconsolidated interests in 852 properties aggregating 86 million square feet of  pro-rata gross leaseable area (GLA), located primarily throughout the United  States and Canada. The company's portfolio is well-diversified with the largest  tenant accounting for 3% of annualized base rent (ABR) and the top 10 tenants  collectively accounting for less than 19% of ABR. Lease maturities are  well-laddered with no more than 14% of annual base rent expiring in any one year  and less than 4% expiring in any one year when assuming the exercise of tenant  renewal options. APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE AND COVERAGE Leverage was 5.4x at Dec. 31, 2013, down from 5.8x at both Dec. 31, 2012 and  2011. Fitch expects leverage to approximate 6x through 2015, primarily due to  modestly positive same store net operating income (NOI) growth, partially offset  by redevelopment expenditures and the acquisition of higher quality, but lower  yielding, properties. Fitch defines leverage as net debt-to-trailing 12 months  (TTM) recurring operating EBITDA (including estimated recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures). Kimco's fixed-charge coverage is adequate for the 'BBB+' rating level and has  improved to 2.5x for the year ending 2013, from 2.1x and 2.2x for 2012 and 2011,  respectively. However, Fitch projects fixed-charge coverage will remain below  that of other 'BBB+' rated REITs. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as  recurring operating EBITDA plus estimated recurring cash distributions from  unconsolidated joint ventures less recurring capital expenditures and non-cash  straight-line rental income divided by total interest incurred and preferred  stock dividends. POSITIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE Despite a generally constrained economic environment, Kimco has generated  modestly positive same-store NOI (SSNOI) growth due to the lack of new supply  nationally. SSNOI for the U.S. portfolio grew by 4.1% in 4Q'13 and 3.8% for  2013. Strong demand and positive releasing spreads for the company's anchor  space (79% of leased GLA) have been the primary source of its SSNOI growth over  the past several years. Fitch expects the company's SSNOI to grow by 2%-4% per  year through 2015.  STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL & LIQUIDITY Kimco's liquidity position is appropriate for the rating at 1.5x through 2015  pro forma for the bond issuance and recently announced acquisitions and  dispositions subsequent to the end of 4Q'13. Fitch calculates liquidity as  sources (unrestricted cash, availability under the unsecured revolving line of  credit and retained cash flows from operations) divided by uses (secured and  unsecured debt maturities, pro-rata joint venture debt maturities,  development expenditures and maintenance capex). Kimco's liquidity coverage  would improve to 2.3x, assuming it refinances 80% of its maturing secured debt. Kimco maintains a large unencumbered asset pool to support its unsecured  borrowings. As of Dec. 31, 2013, unencumbered asset coverage of net unsecured  debt was 2.3x assuming an 8% capitalization rate. Kimco's UA/UD ratio is  slightly low for the 'BBB+' IDR. Lastly, Kimco's dividend payout policies do not  inhibit its financial flexibility with an AFFO payout ratio of 74% for 2013. PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between Kimco's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch's criteria report, 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis,' dated Dec. 23, 2013, the  company's preferred stock is deeply subordinated and has loss absorption  elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate  default. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that metrics will remain relatively  unchanged and the company's demonstrated access to capital will offset a  slightly low liquidity coverage ratio. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Kimco's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 2.5x (coverage  was 2.5x for 2013); --Fitch's expectation of net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA sustaining below  5x (leverage was 5.4x as of Dec. 31, 2013). The following factors may have a negative impact on Kimco's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.0x;  --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.5x.

1,"  MEXICO CITY, June 5 Mexican real estate investment trust (REIT) Fibra Shop said its shareholders had approved the purchase of three shopping centers in the country worth around 1.5 billion pesos ($116 million).The shopping centers belonged to U.S. REIT Kimco Realty Corp  and were in the states of Morelos next to Mexico City, Chiapas in the south and Sonora in the northwest, Fibra Shop said in a statement on Thursday.  The cost of the purchase could vary somewhat depending on the final audit of the transaction, Fibra Shop said.

2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Kimco Realty Corporation's  (NYSE: KIM; Kimco or the company) Issuer Default rating (IDR) at 'BBB+' and  maintained the Stable Outlook. See the full list of ratings at the end of this  release.  Fitch also assigns a 'BBB+' rating to the $350 million of 4.25% senior unsecured  notes due 2045 issued in March 2015.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Kimco's large, diversified portfolio, its consistent and  conservative headline credit metrics over the past five years and its  demonstrated strong access to capital. The largest constraint on the rating is  leverage, which Fitch expects will be high as a result of the Kimstone  transaction. However, the Stable Outlook recognizes that the issuer's long-term  target capitalization is unchanged despite the protracted amount of time that  may be required for KIM to reduce leverage back to the mid-5x range.  KIMSTONE TRANSACTION INITIALLY STRESSES LEVERAGE & LIQUIDITY In February 2015, Kimco acquired Blackstone's 67% interest in an unconsolidated  joint venture (Kimstone) for $925 million including assumed debt. Fitch  estimates the transaction was effected at a 5.5%-6% cap rate with a gross value  of $1.4 billion. The transaction causes leverage to increase by approximately a  full turn to 6.3x pro forma at Dec. 31, 2014, which is at the high end of the  5x-6.5x range considered appropriate for Kimco's 'BBB+' rating and compares to  5.4x for both 2014 and 2013.  Fitch projects leverage could sustain above 6x through 2017 though the issuer  has stated plans to reduce leverage before then. Fitch defines leverage as debt  minus readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA including Fitch's  assumption for recurring cash distributions from joint venture operations.  Kimco's liquidity is adequate at 1x for the period Jan. 1, 2015-Dec. 31, 2016  pro forma for the recent unsecured bond issuance, although below the sector  median. Liquidity was initially stressed by the Kimstone transaction. Fitch  calculates liquidity coverage as sources (unrestricted cash, availability under  the unsecured revolving credit facility, completed unsecured debt financings  subsequent to Dec. 31, 2014 and retained cash flow from operations after  dividends) divided by uses (debt maturities, development expenditures, recurring  maintenance capital expenditures and the cash payment for Kimstone). Liquidity  coverage should improve further should Kimco issue equity and sell assets. In  general, Fitch views Kimco as having above-average access to capital  through-the-cycle, which is a key qualitative factor supporting the ratings.  Fixed charge coverage (FCC) is projected to remain strong at 2.8x through 2017,  consistent with recent periods. Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating EBITDA  including Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from joint venture  operations less straight-line rent and recurring maintenance capital  expenditures to interest and preferred stock dividends.  DURABLE OPERATING CASHFLOWS FROM ENVIRONMENT & DIVERSIFICATION The scale, diversification and lease staggering of Kimco's portfolio provide for  generally durable cash flows from operations. Approximately 10.6% of leases  mature on average over the next three years and only 3.8% on average assuming  tenant extension options are exercised before considering month-to-month leases.  Moreover, limited new supply for shopping centers and a generally accommodative  economic backdrop have supported positive growth as measured by same-store net  operating income (SSNOI) and same-store occupancy. Fitch has assumed SSNOI will  grow 3.5% in both 2015 and 2016 as compared to 3.3% in 2014 and 3.8% in 2013 for  the U.S. same-space portfolio. Leasing spreads in the U.S. same-space portfolio  accelerated in 2014 to a blended 8.8% as compared to 7.7% in 2013. Partially  offsetting these improvements were increases in tenant improvement costs.  Reported costs in 2014 reflect certain redevelopment expenses without which they  would have been $29.12/sf as compared to $26.69/sf in 2013.  ADEQUATE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY Kimco maintains adequate contingent liquidity in the form of unencumbered assets  which covered unsecured debt net of readily available cash by 2.5x at a stressed  8% cap rate. Kimco's UA/UD ratio has steadily increased over the past few years  as non-income producing/non-real estate assets were replaced primarily with  income producing unencumbered assets, and as unencumbered assets in joint  ventures were consolidated. In addition to unencumbered assets, Fitch estimates  Kimco can retain approximately $115 million to $150 million per year of cashflow  from operations based on its dividend payout ratio (77% of adjusted funds from  operations ). Kimco's payout ratio is consistent with the median in  Fitch's rated universe.    INCREASING DEVELOPMENT EXPOSURE Kimco's development pipeline has increased after being curtailed significantly  in past years and initially focused on redevelopment and expansion projects in  2012 and 2013. At Dec. 31, 2014, development costs remaining (including  redevelopment) comprised 3.3% of gross assets and were 64% development versus  redevelopment. Of the five projects, one is 100% leased, one is 76% leased and  the remaining three are 0% pre-leased. Further, Kimco acquired the land parcels  for four of the aforementioned future developments in fourth quarter 2014 for  $114 million.   STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the issuer's long-term  capitalization target is unchanged and that it will restore leverage back to the  mid-5x range. The Outlook also reflects the accommodative operating environment  for the sector being offset in part by increasing development exposure.  PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between Kimco's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch's criteria report, 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis,' dated Nov. 25, 2014, the  company's preferred stock is deeply subordinated and has loss absorption  elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate  default. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --SSNOI growth of 3.5% in 2015 and 2016 and 1.7% in 2017; --General and administrative expenses growth to approximate 12%-13% of recurring  operating EBITDA; --Recurring maintenance capital expenditures grow to approximate 11%-12% of  recurring operating EBITDA; --Development expenditures of approximately $260 million and redevelopment  expenditures of $225 million through 2017; --The disposition of $750 million of assets at a 7% yield in 2015. Fitch has not  explicitly assumed any net transactional activity in 2016 or 2017, noting that  volume over the past three years has generally balanced acquisitions and  dispositions; --Equity issuance of $500 million in 2015 and dividends per share of $0.97,  $1.01 and $1.05 in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively; --Unsecured debt issuances of $300 million in the second half of 2015 and $600  million in 2016 and 2017 to repay secured and unsecured maturities. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not envision positive momentum on Kimco's ratings and/or Outlook;  however, the following factors may have a positive impact: --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 2.5x (coverage was 2.7x for 2014  pro forma for Kimstone); --Fitch's expectation of net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA sustaining below  5x (leverage was 6.3x at Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma). The following factors may have a negative impact on Kimco's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2x;  --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.5x. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:   Kimco Realty Corporation: --IDR at 'BBB+'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured term loan at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'. Kimco North Trust III: --Senior unsecured guaranteed notes at 'BBB+'.  In addition, Fitch has withdrawn the ratings on the senior guaranteed term loan  issued by KRC Lending S.A. de C.V. SOFOM ENR as the debt instrument was repaid.

4,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del  WILMINGTON, Del Oct 22 First Data Corp's Chief Executive Officer Frank Bisignano hailed a $3.5 billion fund-raising in July 2014 for drawing a ""who's who in equity investing"" and paving the way for the payment processor's huge IPO last week.The 2014 deal included one unusual investor: Lehman Brothers, the bank that collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.Lehman may be long gone from Wall Street, but its bankruptcy estate still manages a portfolio of more than $10 billion in assets, exceeding the market capitalization of fashion house Ralph Lauren Corp or property investment firm Kimco Realty Corp.From an office in Manhattan, Lehman's staff manage piles of cash and securities, interests in real estate and private equity investments, including a stake in Formula One motor racing.While bankruptcy estates focus on liquidating assets for the benefit of creditors, Lehman dusted off its investing expertise last year and spent $151 million on private placement of stock in First Data.According to a court filing, the money was spent on a ""pro-rata"" share of the private placement, indicating Lehman had a previous relationship with First Data. Lehman provided financing in 2007 for the buyout of First Data, which was led by KKR & Co.""When you get a $3.5 billion vote of confidence by some fabulous investors,"" Bisignano told an analysts call in July 2014, ""the who's who in equity investing in it gives your customers great confidence in your ability."" The private placement of stock was credited by Bisignano for providing cash to pay down First Data's debt and returning the company to profit after years of losses.Lehman's management can make investments if they determine it will likely benefit creditors.Lehman and First Data declined to comment on the Lehman stake.Lehman did not disclose how the First Data investment performed. KKR, which was the lead investor in the 2014 private placement, has estimated in securities filings the value of its investment in First Data rose about 13 percent from the private placement through June 30. However, those gains may have been offset after First Data cut the IPO price by 20 percent from the top of its target range.Shares in First Data were little changed at $15.36 on Thursday, below the $16 IPO price.COMPLEX CASES  Lehman emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 with a new board selected by creditors, overseen by Chairman David Pauker, formerly the executive managing director of Goldin Associates, a financial consultancy. Christopher O'Meara, a former chief financial officer of Lehman, is the chief executive.""I do think it's remarkable both how significant Lehman's assets have turned out to be and how much they still have,"" said David Skeel, a professor at University of Pennsylvania Law School.The First Data deal is not even the largest investment by the bankrupt firm. In 2012, it ponied up about $3 billion to buy two minority positions held by other banks in Archstone, an owner of apartment complexes, giving it full ownership. It later sold Archstone for $6.5 billion.Lehman had teamed up with Tishman Speyer to acquire Archstone for $22.2 billion, including debt, in 2007.In total, Lehman's bankruptcy estate has distributed $105.4 billion to creditors. Of that, $77.2 billion was paid to third-party claims, with the rest paid to other Lehman affiliates. While more than $1 trillion of claims were filed, the estate will recognize about $330 billion, according to court documents.Jonathan Lipson, a professor at Temple University School of Law, said the case could still require years of work as the estate pursues lingering litigation and awaits overseas affiliates to complete their liquidations.""Enron's estate lasted forever and ever,"" Lipson said, referring to the power company that filed in 2001 and closed its bankruptcy case only last year. ""That's what happens with really complex cases.""

13,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  senior unsecured notes due 2026 issued by Kimco Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM).  Net proceeds are expected to be used for the redemption of the $290.9 million  aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.70% senior notes due May 1, 2017  (the 2017 notes), with the remainder, if any, to be used for general corporate  purposes. A full list of Fitch's current ratings on KIM follows at the end of  this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Kimco's large, diversified portfolio, its generally  consistent and conservative credit metrics over the past five years and its  demonstrated strong access to capital. Kimco has made progress reducing the  elevated leverage after the Kimstone transaction.  RESTORING HEADLINE METRICS Kimco has reduced leverage over the past few quarters with 5.4x leverage for  both the quarter and trailing 12 months (TTM) ended June 30, 2016, respectively.  This compares to 6.3x immediately after the close of the Kimstone transaction  (for the quarter ended March 31, 2015). In February 2015, Kimco acquired  Blackstone's 67% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture (Kimstone) for $925  million including assumed debt. When including 50% of preferred stock in total  debt, KIM's leverage was 5.9x for both the quarter and TTM ended June 30, 2016.  Fitch defines leverage as debt minus readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including Fitch's assumption for recurring cash distributions  from joint venture operations.  Fitch expects Kimco will reduce leverage further over the next few years as the  issuer is targeting net debt / EBITDA as adjusted (on its calculations) of 5x -  5.5x versus its calculation of 5.7x at June 30, 2016.  Kimco's liquidity is sufficient at 1.6x for the period July 1, 2016 - Dec. 31,  2017 pro forma for the note issuance. Fitch views Kimco as having above-average  access to capital through-the-cycle, which is a key qualitative factor  supporting the ratings.  Fitch calculates liquidity coverage as sources (unrestricted cash, availability  under the $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, estimated proceeds  from ATM issuance subsequent to the end of 1Q16 and retained cash flow from  operations after dividends) divided by uses (debt maturities, development  expenditures and recurring maintenance capital expenditures).  Fitch projects that Kimco's fixed charge coverage (FCC) will remain strong  around 3x through 2017, consistent with recent periods (3.2x and 3x for the  quarter and TTM ended June 30, 2016). Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating  EBITDA including Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from joint  venture operations less straight-line rent and recurring maintenance capital  expenditures to interest and preferred stock dividends. DURABLE OPERATING CASHFLOWS FROM ENVIRONMENT & DIVERSIFICATION The scale, diversification and lease staggering of Kimco's portfolio provide for  generally durable cash flows from operations. Approximately 8.6% of leases  mature on average in 2016 through 2018 and only 3.2% on average assuming tenant  extension options are exercised before considering month-to-month leases.  Leasing spreads in the U.S. same-space portfolio remained strong in 2015 and  2Q16 at 11.1% and 16.2%, respectively as compared to 8.8% in 2014. Limited new supply for shopping centers and a generally accommodative economic  backdrop have supported positive growth as measured by same-store net operating  income (SSNOI) and same-store occupancy. Fitch assumes SSNOI will grow 3.5% in  2016 before the effects of tenant defaults and 1.7% in 2017 as compared to 3.1%  in 2Q16, 3.1% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2014 for the U.S. same-space portfolio. ADEQUATE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY Kimco maintains adequate contingent liquidity in the form of unencumbered assets  which covered unsecured debt (UA / UD) net of readily available cash by 2.4x at  a stressed 8% cap rate. Kimco's UA/UD ratio has steadily increased over the past  few years as it replaced non-income producing/non-real estate assets with income  producing unencumbered assets, and as unencumbered assets in joint ventures were  consolidated or purchased outright. Fitch also estimates Kimco will retain approximately $75 million to $150 million  per year of cashflow from operations based on its dividend payout ratio (80.8%  of adjusted funds from operations for the TTM ended June 30, 2016).  Kimco's payout ratio is consistent with the median in Fitch's rated universe.  INCREASING DEVELOPMENT EXPOSURE Kimco has increased its development exposure after curtailing its activities  during the last downturn and focusing on redevelopment and expansion projects  until recently during this recovery. At June 30, 2016, unfunded development  costs remaining (including redevelopment) comprised 2.7% of gross assets which  remains manageable but is increasingly focused on development projects.  STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the issuer's long-term  capitalization target is unchanged and that it will restore leverage back to the  mid-5x range. The Outlook also reflects the accommodative operating environment  for the sector being offset in part by increasing development exposure.  PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between Kimco's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch's criteria report, 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis,' dated Feb. 29, 2016, the  company's preferred stock is deeply subordinated and has loss absorption  elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate  default. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for KIM include: --SSNOI growth of 3.5% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017 before tenant defaults; --General and administrative expenses growth to approximate 12%-13% of recurring  operating EBITDA; --Recurring maintenance capital expenditures grow to approximate 11%-12% of  recurring operating EBITDA; --Development expenditures of approximately $260 million and redevelopment  expenditures of $225 million through 2017; --Fitch has not explicitly assumed any net transactional activity in 2016 or  2017, noting that volume over the past three years has generally balanced  acquisitions and dispositions; --Unsecured debt issuances of $600 million in 2016 and 2017 to repay secured and  unsecured maturities (including the rated issuance). RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not envision positive momentum on Kimco's ratings and/or Outlook;  however, the following factors may have a positive impact: --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 2.5x (coverage was 3.2x for 2Q16); --Fitch's expectation of net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA sustaining below  5x (leverage was 5.4x for the TTM ended June 30, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on Kimco's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2x;  --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.5x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates KIM as follows:  Kimco Realty Corporation --Issuer Default Rating 'BBB+'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured term loan 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock 'BBB-'.

17,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Kimco  Realty Corporation (NYSE: KIM), including the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings  (IDR), at 'BBB+'. Fitch has also withdrawn all ratings for Kimco North Trust III  as the company has redeemed the senior unsecured guaranteed notes. A full list  of Fitch's rating actions follows at the end of this release KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Kimco's large, diversified portfolio, its generally  consistent and conservative credit metrics over the past five years and its  demonstrated strong access to capital. Kimco has made progress reducing the  elevated leverage after the Kimstone transaction, and the issuer is targeting  net debt / EBITDA as adjusted (on its calculations) of 5x - 5.5x versus its  calculation of 5.7x at June 30, 2016. We could see positive ratings momentum,  should the company delever beyond our expectations. RESTORING HEADLINE METRICS Kimco has reduced leverage over the past few quarters with 5.4x leverage for  both the quarter and trailing 12 months (TTM) ended June 30, 2016.

Fitch projects that Kimco's fixed charge coverage (FCC) will remain strong  through 2018, reaching the high 3x range, slightly higher than recent periods  (3.2x and 3x for the quarter and TTM ended June 30, 2016). Fitch defines FCC as  recurring operating EBITDA including Fitch's estimate of recurring cash  distributions from joint venture operations less straight-line rent and  recurring maintenance capital expenditures to interest and preferred stock  dividends.

20,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  expected senior unsecured notes due 2024 and 2046 issued by Kimco Realty  Corporation (NYSE: KIM). Net proceeds are expected to be used for debt repayment  and general corporate purposes. A full list of Fitch's current ratings on KIM  follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Kimco's large, diversified portfolio, its generally  consistent and conservative credit metrics over the past five years and its  demonstrated strong access to capital. Kimco has made progress reducing the  elevated leverage after the Kimstone transaction, and the issuer is targeting  net debt/EBITDA as adjusted (on its calculations) of 5x-5.5x versus its  calculation of 5.8x at Sept. 30, 2016. We could see positive ratings momentum,  should the company delever beyond our expectations. RESTORING HEADLINE METRICS Kimco has reduced leverage over the past few quarters with 5.4x and 5.5x  leverage for the trailing 12 months (TTM) and quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016,  respectively. This compares to 6.3x immediately after the close of the Kimstone  transaction (for the quarter ended March 31, 2015). In February 2015, Kimco  acquired Blackstone's 67% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture (Kimstone)  for $925 million including assumed debt. When including 50% of preferred stock  in total debt, KIM's leverage was 5.9x for the TTM ended Sept. 30, 2016. Fitch  defines leverage as debt minus readily available cash to recurring operating  EBITDA including Fitch's assumption for recurring cash distributions from joint  venture operations. Kimco's liquidity is sufficient at 1.9x for the period Oct. 1, 2016-Dec. 31,  2018 pro forma for the note issuance. Fitch views Kimco as having above-average  access to capital through-the-cycle, which is a key qualitative factor  supporting the ratings.  Fitch calculates liquidity coverage as sources (unrestricted cash, availability  under the $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, estimated proceeds  from debt issuance subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2016 and  retained cash flow from operations after dividends) divided by uses (debt  maturities, development expenditures and recurring maintenance capital  expenditures).  Fitch projects that Kimco's fixed charge coverage (FCC) will remain strong  through 2018, reaching the high 3x range, slightly higher than recent periods  (3.1x and 3.0x for the quarter and TTM ended Sept. 30, 2016). Fitch defines FCC  as recurring operating EBITDA including Fitch's estimate of recurring cash  distributions from joint venture operations less straight-line rent and  recurring maintenance capital expenditures to interest and preferred stock  dividends. Fitch believes that the company will pay off its preferreds through  the rating horizon, improving FCC. DURABLE OPERATING CASHFLOWS FROM ENVIRONMENT & DIVERSIFICATION The scale, diversification and lease staggering of Kimco's portfolio provide for  generally durable cash flows from operations. Approximately 7.4% of leases  mature on average in 2016 through 2018 and only 3.1% on average assuming tenant  extension options are exercised before considering month-to-month leases.  Leasing spreads in the U.S. same-space portfolio remained strong in 2015 and  3Q16 at 11.1% and 12.9%, respectively as compared to 8.8% in 2014. Limited new supply for shopping centers and a generally accommodative economic  backdrop have supported positive growth as measured by same-store net operating  income (SSNOI) and same-store occupancy. Fitch assumes SSNOI will grow 3% from  2016-2018 as compared to 3.3% in 3Q16, 3.1% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2014 for the  U.S. same-space portfolio. ADEQUATE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY Kimco maintains adequate contingent liquidity in the form of unencumbered assets  which covered unsecured debt (UA/UD) net of readily available cash by 2.3x at a  stressed 8% cap rate. Kimco's UA/UD ratio has steadily increased over the past  few years as it replaced non-income producing/non-real estate assets with income  producing unencumbered assets, and as unencumbered assets in joint ventures were  consolidated or purchased outright. Fitch also estimates Kimco will retain approximately $75 million to $150 million  per year of cashflow from operations based on its dividend payout ratio (80.3%  of adjusted funds from operations for the TTM ended Sept. 30, 2016).  Kimco's payout ratio is consistent with the median in Fitch's rated universe. INCREASING DEVELOPMENT EXPOSURE Kimco has increased its development exposure after curtailing its activities  during the last downturn and focusing on redevelopment and expansion projects  until recently during this recovery. At Sept. 30, 2016, unfunded development  costs remaining (including redevelopment) comprised 2.5% of gross assets which  remains manageable but is increasingly focused on development projects.  STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the issuer's long-term  capitalization target is unchanged and that it will maintain leverage in the low  to mid-5x range. The Outlook also reflects the accommodative operating  environment for the sector being offset in part by increasing development  exposure.  PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between Kimco's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch's criteria report, 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis,' dated Feb. 29, 2016, the  company's preferred stock is deeply subordinated and has loss absorption  elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate  default. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for KIM include: --SSNOI growth of 3% in 2016-2018. These increases reflect contractual rent  escalations and improved leasing spreads; --General and administrative expenses growth to approximate 12%-13% of recurring  operating EBITDA; --Recurring maintenance capital expenditures grow to approximate 11%-12% of  recurring operating EBITDA; --Development expenditures of $700 million and redevelopment expenditures of  $550 million through 2018; --Fitch has not explicitly assumed any net transactional activity in 2016 or  2017, noting that volume over the past three years has generally balanced  acquisitions and dispositions; --Sufficient unsecured debt issuances through the rating horizon to repay  secured and unsecured maturities; --Equity issuances used to redeem preferreds and reduce leverage; --Acquisitions of $350 million, $250 million and $250 million in 2016, 2017 and  2018, respectively; --Divestments of $850 million, $150 million and $150 million in 2016, 2017 and  2018, respectively. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Kimco's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA sustaining below  5x (leverage was 5.4x for the TTM ended Sept. 30, 2016). --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 2.5x (coverage was 3.1x for 3Q16). The following factors may have a negative impact on Kimco's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.5x. --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2x.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report.
