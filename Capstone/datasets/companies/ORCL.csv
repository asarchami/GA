""It's so secure, there are people that complain,"" he added.Oracle, Salesforce.com and other major Silicon Valley companies are increasingly offering Internet-based business services for things like human resources, accounting and sales management, in a trend known as cloud computing. Entrusting software and data management to cloud services can save companies the expense of maintaining their own servers and other IT infrastructure.Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden's revelations about U.S. government surveillance have increased companies' concerns about privacy and may cost U.S. technology vendors billions of dollars in lost sales, analysts say.

8,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen raised the possibility of an earlier- than-anticipated increase in interest rates.The central bank dropped the U.S. unemployment rate as its definitive yardstick for gauging the economy's strength and made clear it would rely on a wide range of measures in deciding when to raise interest rates.Equities extended declines after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the ""considerable period"" between the end of its quantitative easing program, known as QE, and the first rate increase from the central bank could be six months.With QE forecast to wind down sometime near the end of the year, a six-month lag would move up the timetable for the Fed's first hike, which many market participants had been expecting in the second half of 2015.""She certainly moved it up a little bit, and I don't think the market was expecting that at all because she is widely viewed as being more on the dovish side of the aisle than she is on the hawkish side,"" said Peter Kenny, CEO of Clearpool Group in New York. ""That is not a particularly hawkish comment, but the fact of the matter is, it was not expected.""The Fed also said it would cut its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $55 billion, from $65 billion.The S&P 500 was within 1 percent of its record closing high, though economic bellwether FedEx Corp (FDX.N) hit a sour note in its outlook. Geopolitical concerns related to Ukraine also stayed in focus. FedEx posted results below expectations and gave a weak full-year profit forecast, but the package shipper said it had been significantly hurt by winter storms, and the stock slipped 0.1 percent to close at $138.38.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 114.02 points or 0.70 percent, to end at 16,222.17. The S&P 500 .SPX slipped 11.48 points or 0.61 percent, to finish at 1,860.77. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 25.711 points or 0.59 percent, to close at 4,307.602.Equities had rallied to start the week, buoyed by easing geopolitical concerns, though trading volume has been light. The S&P 500 .SPX has climbed 1.7 percent over the previous two days, the best back-to-back performance for the benchmark index since early February. First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) surged 20.6 percent to $69.40 and ranked as the S&P 500's best performer after the company forecast a rise of up to 21 percent in revenue this year. First Solar also said it was developing cost-effective solar plants with General Electric Co (GE.N).Volume was light, with about 6 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expiration takes place alongside multiple index rebalances. Credit Suisse estimates $14 billion in gross trading will stem from the S&P 500 index rebalance, with another $6 billion coming from rebalancing in other indexes.Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 3 to 1.

""They're playing catch up, but they're working quickly and they're starting to make some progress.""On Tuesday's call, Catz said revenue from cloud software subscriptions was up by about 24 percent in the quarter to $292 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of Oracle's total revenue.On the conference call, President Mark Hurd said Oracle is getting better at selling cloud services, thanks partly to a reorganization of the company's salesforce last year. ""We thought we knew a lot a year ago or a couple years ago. We just know a lot more now,"" Hurd said. ""We obviously have more feet on the street than we had and ... they've been in place longer.""Cloud computing, which refers to the delivery of services via the Internet from remote data centers, is becoming popular with corporate buyers because it is faster to implement and has lower upfront costs than traditional software.Most of Oracle's business relies on selling database software and hardware that customers install in their own data centers. Customers pay extra maintenance contracts that are highly profitable to Oracle and provide a steady stream of cash.Global IT spending is likely to increase just 3 percent this year, while spending on cloud services is expected to grow 18 percent, according to market research firm Gartner.For the third quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 4 percent to $9.31 billion. That was a little below the $9.36 billion analysts had expected on average.Net income was $2.56 billion, up 2 percent. Earnings per share, which reflected a decrease in the number of shares outstanding, rose 8 percent to 56 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 68 cents per share.Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $37.32 in extended trade, after closing at $38.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler, Cynthia Osterman and Richard Chang)",2014-03-19,ORCL,"Wed Mar 19, 2014 | 2:27am EDT",Oracle quarterly results disappoint Wall Street; shares fall,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-oracle-results-idUSBREA2H22520140319?type=companyNews

15,"   By Jonathan Stempel  May 12 Three Lawson Software Inc founders agreed to pay about $5.8 million to settle U.S. insider trading charges that they took advantage of incorrect media and analyst reports to trade stock ahead of the company's 2011 merger.Monday's accord resolves U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that former Co-Chairman Richard Lawson, 70, tipped his brother William Lawson, 72, and friend John Cerullo, 71, that the company was not the object of a bidding war, and that a lone bidder was offering less than the market price.The defendants did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Lawson Software on March 14, 2011 announced it had received an unsolicited offer, which it later accepted, to be acquired by Infor Global Solutions and an affiliate of private equity firm Golden Gate Capital for about $1.8 billion, or $11.25 per share.According to the SEC, media and analyst reports, including from Reuters, were speculating at the time that suitors including Hewlett-Packard Co, International Business Machines Corp, Oracle Corp and SAP AG  might offer higher bids, but that Richard Lawson told his brother and Cerullo this was not the case. The SEC said William Lawson, a third party tipped by him and Cerullo together made over $2 million by selling more than 1.8 million shares at prices inflated by the speculation.It said that when a definitive $11.25 per share merger for Lawson Software was announced on April 26, 2011, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company's stock price fell 8.8 percent. ""When news surfaces about the possibility of a merger and details of the media reports are incorrect, it is illegal for insiders who know the true facts to trade and profit,"" Stephen Cohen, an associate director in the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement.In settling with the SEC, Richard Lawson agreed to pay a $1.56 million fine; William Lawson, who was once Lawson Software's chief executive, agreed to pay $3.87 million, including a $1.85 million fine; and Cerullo agreed to pay about $373,000, including a roughly $178,000 fine.Charles Gall, a lawyer for Richard Lawson, declined to comment. Terrence Fleming, a lawyer for William Lawson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. James Langdon, a lawyer for Cerullo, declined to comment.

16,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. appeals court appeared skeptical on Tuesday about reinstating a $1.3 billion jury verdict won by Oracle Corp against SAP, in a case where the European software company admitted massive copyright infringement.At a court hearing on Tuesday, two 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges also suggested Oracle may deserve more than the roughly $300 million it had been assigned by a lower court.A Northern California jury awarded Oracle $1.3 billion in 2010 over accusations that SAP AG subsidiary, TomorrowNow, wrongfully downloaded millions of Oracle files. SAP had acquired TomorrowNow as part of a strategy to provide software support to Oracle customers at lower rates than what Oracle charged, and eventually convince some of those companies to become SAP customers.The trial between the two enterprise software competitors was widely watched at the time, as top Oracle executives Larry Ellison and Safra Catz testified. However, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California ruled that Oracle had proven actual damages of only $272 million.Oracle has asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse that ruling. At a court hearing on Tuesday before a three-judge 9th Circuit panel, Oracle attorney Kathleen Sullivan said internal SAP documents showed SAP had expected about $900 million in new revenue by using TomorrowNow to poach Oracle customers. That, and other evidence, was sufficient for the jury to arrive at its $1.3 billion figure, Sullivan argued.However, 9th Circuit Judge Susan Graber questioned whether those SAP revenue figures were objective evidence of the value of the copyrighted material.""It's hypothetical revenue information, which is not the same,"" Graber said. ""These may be pie in the sky dreaming,"" Judge William Fletcher added.The judges did not issue a formal ruling from the bench. SAP eventually shuttered TomorrowNow, which pleaded guilty to criminal copyright infringement and other charges.SAP admitted liability for the downloads just prior to the 2010 trial, so the only issue in dispute was how much SAP would pay Oracle in damages. Oracle said that figure should be calculated based on what SAP would have paid Oracle had it licensed the materials, instead of downloading them without permission. Oracle estimated that amount in the billions. In her lower court ruling, however, Hamilton decided Oracle is only entitled to profits it had lost as a result of the downloads, as well as any profits SAP gained.

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Oracle Corp.  (Oracle) at 'A+', including the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  press release. The rating actions affect approximately $27 billion of total debt, including the  company's undrawn $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The Ratings and Outlook reflect: --Significant financial flexibility, with cash and investments totaling $37.2  billion as of Feb. 28, 2014, an undrawn $3 billion RCF due 2018 and sustained  annual free cash flow (FCF) after dividends in excess of $9 billion in the past  three fiscal years (FYs). Fitch projects FCF of nearly $12.5 billion in FY 2014,  compared with $12.1 billion in FY 2013 (ended May 31).  --Strong customer attach-and-renewal rates for software maintenance, resulting  in a steadily increasing, highly profitable (93% gross margin) recurring revenue  stream that significantly reduces FCF volatility.  --Strong competitive position, especially in database and middleware software. --Conservative financial policies and strong credit protection metrics, with  historical leverage peaking at 1.3x. Oracle's external financing requirements  were historically limited to acquisition funding due to strong internal cash  generation, staggered debt maturities and materially lower cash payments for  share repurchases and dividends prior to FY 2012. --Size and diversity with respect to its installed software base and significant  switching costs associated with mission-critical enterprise software. --Established track record of integrating acquisitions. Fitch's rating concerns are:  --Competition from open-source software and long-term profitability of Oracle's  software as a service (SaaS) relative to traditional on-premise software. In the  first nine months of fiscal 2014 (ended Feb. 28), the direct controllable margin  on new software licenses and cloud subscriptions (L&C), excluding stock-based  compensation, declined to 26.2% from 31.2% in the year-ago period, despite  relatively flat new software license revenue. Fitch believes Oracle has and will continue to make significant investments,  both organic and inorganic, to retain its long-term competitiveness relative to  SaaS providers. Oracle's SaaS revenue was $1.1 billion, or more than 10%, of  total L&C software revenue over the LTM ending February 28, compared with $823  million in the year-ago period. Cloud subscription revenue increased 24.2%  year-over-year to $287 million in the quarter ended Feb. 28, 2014. --Aggressive acquisition strategy; however, Fitch expects the company will  remain disciplined with its strategy and, in the event of a major debt-financed  acquisition, will reduce leverage using FCF in lieu of meaningful share  repurchases. --Material and sustained growth in cash returned to shareholders via stock  repurchases and dividends since fiscal 2012 as well as U.S. acquisitions  increase Oracle's external U.S. funding requirements due to significant offshore  cash and FCF generation that is subject to incremental taxation upon  repatriation. As of Feb 28, 2014, $32.9 billion, or 88%, of Oracle's total cash  and investments of $37.2 billion was held offshore.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive:  Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a higher  rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for acquisitions limits  further positive rating actions. Negative: --A shift to more aggressive financial policies, including a material sustained  increase in leverage;  --Inability to adapt to major technology transitions, such as SaaS or any  emerging database technologies. Fitch believes Oracle's liquidity is strong, supported by a sizable cash  position, the vast majority of which is held offshore, an undrawn $3 billion RCF  due April 2018, and strong and consistent FCF. The significant offshore cash  position is attributable to a considerable portion of FCF being derived outside  the U.S., while significant funding is required in the U.S. for share  repurchases, acquisitions and dividends.  Oracle's credit protection metrics remained relatively stable in the past year.  Leverage (debt/operating EBITDA) increased to 1.3x as of Feb. 28, 2014 compared  with 1.1x in the year-ago period, while interest coverage (operating  EBITDA/interest expense) was decreased to 20.1x compared with 23.1x in the  year-ago period. Fitch forecasts leverage below 1.3x and interest coverage in  excess of 20x in fiscal 2015. As of Feb. 28, 2014, total debt was $24.2 billion and consisted primarily of: --$1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July 2014; --$2 billion of 5.25% senior notes due January 2016; --$2.5 billion of 1.20% senior notes due October 2017; --$2.5 billion of 5.75% senior notes due April 2018; --$500 million of floating rate senior notes due January 2019; --$1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019; --$1.75 billion of 5% senior notes due July 2019; --$1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due July 2020; --$1.62 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021; --$2.5 billion of 2.50% senior notes due October 2022; --$1 billion of 3.625% senior notes due July 2023; --$975 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025; --$1.25 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038; --$1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due July 2039; --$2.23 billion of 5.375% senior notes due July 2040. Fitch affirms Oracle's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Revolving credit facility 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

22,"   By Shelby Sebens | PORTLAND Ore.  PORTLAND Ore. Oregon's Democratic governor wants the state's attorney general to sue the technology vendor that developed the embattled Cover Oregon website to recover payments, while officials from Oracle said on Friday any claims were unfounded. A state that fully embraced the Affordable Care Act, Oregon endured one of the rockiest rollouts of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, requiring tens of thousands of applicants to use paper forms since launching on Oct. 1. The state decided in April to move the troubled state exchange to the federal system.The announcement by Governor John Kitzhaber seeking legal action comes as federal prosecutors have subpoenaed documents from Oregon's health exchange agency as part of a grand jury investigation into how the state used federal money to set up the now-failed health insurance exchange. ""The time has come to hold Oracle accountable for its failure to deliver technology that worked on the timelines the company committed to,"" Kitzhaber said in a statement on Thursday. ""Today I have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to immediately initiate legal action to recover payments and other damages from Oracle."" ""Oracle did not deliver,"" Kitzhaber said. ""The poor quality of its work is obvious in the many bugs that are still not fixed, in missed deadlines (and) in the fundamental flaws in the system’s architecture."" Oracle Corp., which the state paid about $134 million, defended its work and called Kitzhaber’s move political. ""OHA and Cover Oregon were in charge and badly mismanaged the project by consistently failing to deliver requirements in a timely manner and failing to staff the project with skilled personnel,"" company officials said in a statement. ""We understand the political nature of the announcement just made and that the governor wants to shift blame from where it belongs. We look forward to an investigation that we are confident will completely exonerate Oracle."" Several Cover Oregon officials, including two past directors, have resigned in recent months amid an independent investigation ordered by the governor's office that found mismanagement and a failure to report problems from the start.The state has received roughly $300 million in federal grants and paid Oracle to create technology for the website. Federal prosecutors have also asked for all purchase orders, invoicing and statements of work by Oracle. Rosenblum’s office released a letter sent to Kitzhaber saying her office was exploring legal options. ""I share your determination to recover every dollar to which Oregon is entitled,"" Rosenblum said. Kitzhaber, who is up for re-election in November against Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, also made requests to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate Oracle's work and to ""consider the full range of legal options.""

The state decided in April to move the troubled state exchange to the federal system.The announcement by Governor John Kitzhaber seeking legal action comes as federal prosecutors have subpoenaed documents from Oregon's health exchange agency as part of a grand jury investigation into how the state used federal money to set up the now-failed health insurance exchange.""The time has come to hold Oracle accountable for its failure to deliver technology that worked on the timelines the company committed to,"" Kitzhaber said in a statement on Thursday. ""Today I have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to immediately initiate legal action to recover payments and other damages from Oracle."" ""Oracle did not deliver,"" Kitzhaber said. ""The poor quality of its work is obvious in the many bugs that are still not fixed, in missed deadlines (and) in the fundamental flaws in the system's architecture.""Oracle Corp., which the state paid about $134 million, defended its work and called Kitzhaber's move political.""OHA and Cover Oregon were in charge and badly mismanaged the project by consistently failing to deliver requirements in a timely manner and failing to staff the project with skilled personnel,"" company officials said in a statement. ""We understand the political nature of the announcement just made and that the governor wants to shift blame from where it belongs. We look forward to an investigation that we are confident will completely exonerate Oracle.""Several Cover Oregon officials, including two past directors, have resigned in recent months amid an independent investigation ordered by the governor's office that found mismanagement and a failure to report problems from the start. The state has received roughly $300 million in federal grants and paid Oracle to create technology for the website.Federal prosecutors have also asked for all purchase orders, invoicing and statements of work by Oracle. Rosenblum's office released a letter sent to Kitzhaber saying her office was exploring legal options.""I share your determination to recover every dollar to which Oregon is entitled,"" Rosenblum said.Kitzhaber, who is up for re-election in November against Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, also made requests to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate Oracle's work and to ""consider the full range of legal options.""

26,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday charged four San Francisco-area men with insider trading in Ross Stores Inc stock options, and one of the four with insider trading in stock options of a company that was later bought by Oracle Corp.The alleged scheme resulted in more than $12.6 million of illegal profit and was centered on Saleem Khan, a former finance manager at a healthcare nonprofit, according to the regulator.Khan will begin a 1-3/4 year prison term on June 23 after pleading guilty in an unrelated case, court records show.According to the SEC, former Ross finance executive Roshanlal Chaganlal from 2009 through 2012 routinely tipped Khan about the apparel retailer's monthly sales results.Khan allegedly used the tips to make $11.4 million by trading Ross stock options for himself and his brother-in-law, and through intermediaries kicked $130,000 back to Chaganlal. The regulator said Khan also provided inside tips about Ross to his supervisor Ranjan Mendonsa and colleague Ammar Akbari, who made a respective $800,000 and $2,000 in Ross stock options.Khan was also accused by the SEC of making $450,000 by using tips from an Oracle insider to trade Taleo Corp stock options in the six days before Oracle agreed on Feb. 9, 2012 to buy that software company for $1.9 billion, an 18 percent premium.The SEC said Khan, Chaganlal and Akbari live in Dublin, California, where Ross is based, while Mendonsa lives in nearby San Ramon. It said they invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the agency's probe. Khan's lawyer, Chris Cannon, said: ""Saleem has made hundreds of short-term trades in Ross, many of which were unprofitable, and if he were trading on inside tips he would have been able to avoid the unprofitable trades.""Martin Sabelli, a lawyer for Chaganlal, declined to comment.

43,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Oracle Corp on Thursday posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that disappointed investors looking for more progress against rivals selling web-based services, sending its shares lower.Reflecting expectations of a pickup in its software business and progress in cloud computing, shares of Oracle had gained 10 percent over the past three months, double the S&P 500's increase.But Thursday's results cast doubt onto Oracle's execution in an industry facing increasingly tight competition.""It's a bit of a jaw-dropper, in terms of Oracle missing results across the board in its historically strong fiscal year-end quarter,"" said FBR analyst Dan Ives. ""It's like Spain getting knocked out of the World Cup in its first week.""Smaller, aggressive companies like Salesforce.com Inc and Workday Inc have been offering competitive software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.Oracle's meager quarterly results underscore soft spending across the enterprise technology industry. Spending could become even more restrained as companies around the world move away from operating their own IT departments in favor of cloud services that cost less, said Summit Research analyst Richard Williams.       ""As it moves to the cloud, overall tech spending becomes worse than a zero-sum game,"" Williams said. ""There's going to be a lot of pain."" Four-decade-old Oracle has been rolling out its own cloud-based products but they remain under 5 percent of its overall revenue. A string of acquisitions fueling Oracle's growth has slowed of late although the company is in talks to buy software maker Micros Systems Inc, according to a Bloomberg report this week. “One thing that's clear is they need to get this M&A engine started again,"" Ives said. For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle expects software and cloud revenue to grow between 6 percent and 8 percent, Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz told analysts on a conference call. That forecast includes expectations for software- and platform-related cloud services to grow between 25 percent and 35 percent. Oracle said it expects its hardware system revenue to be in a range of down 1 percent to up 3 percent. For its latest fourth quarter, Oracle said overall revenue rose 3 percent to $11.3 billion. That was less than the $11.48 billion analysts had expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Net income fell 4 percent to $3.6 billion. Earnings per share were unchanged at 80 cents. On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned 92 cents per share, less than the 95 cents expected on average by analysts.Revenue from Oracle's hardware systems products grew 2 percent to $870 million. Shares of Oracle fell more than 5 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.70 percent at $42.51 on the New York Stock Exchange.

57,"  (Adds forecast, analyst comment, shares, details)By Soham ChatterjeeAug 21 Salesforce.com Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by an increase in demand for its web-based sales and marketing software, and raised its full-year profit and revenue forecast.Businesses are increasingly moving toward cloud software services that cost less and are easier to manage, helping companies such as Salesforce and human resource management software provider Workday Inc.Spending on enterprise resource management and customer relationship management has been particularly strong. Research firm IDC expects ERM and CRM software sales to grow 20 percent at a compounded annual rate every year from 2013 to 2018. (bit.ly/1n8p3gF)Salesforce said on Thursday it expects an adjusted profit of 50-52 cents per share on revenue of $5.34-$5.37 billion for the year ending Jan. 31.

The company said unbilled revenue rose by about a third to $5 billion at the end of the second quarter.""We continue to see greater upside potential in the second half as our checks suggest there are mega-deals in the pipeline that could close, aided by the maturing efforts of CRM's new vertical-led strategy,"" Susquehanna analyst J. Derrick Wood said in a pre-earnings note.Salesforce, which competes with Germany's SAP SE  and Oracle Corp among others, is investing in software targeted at specific sectors such as healthcare to boost growth. In June, Dutch healthcare and lighting company Philips  said it was teaming up with Salesforce to offer online management of chronic diseases.Salesforce has also been buying providers of data analytics and marketing software to boost growth.The company bought data analytics firm RelateIQ Inc for about $390 million last month, its largest deal since its $2.5 billion acquisition of e-mail marketing firm ExactTarget last year. Salesforce reported net loss of $61.1 million, or 10 cents per share, for the second quarter ended July 31, compared with a profit of $76.6 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 13 cents per share.Revenue rose to $1.32 billion from $957.1 million.Subscription and support revenue, which accounts for 93 percent of total revenue, rose 37 percent. Professional services revenue rose 58 percent.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 12 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Salesforce's shares up slightly in extended trading on Thursday after closing at $55.71 on the New York Stock Exchange.

59,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Dan Levine  Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) failed to revive a $1.3 billion jury verdict in its long-running copyright dispute with German software company SAP SE (SAPG.DE) as a U.S. appeals court said Oracle must choose to accept a lower amount or face a new trial.In a ruling on Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said jurors used ""an undue amount of speculation"" in awarding $1.3 billion in damages in 2010.But the court found U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California, had erred in concluding that Oracle deserved only $272 million of damages, a sum Oracle rejected. Writing for a three-judge 9th Circuit panel, Judge William Fletcher directed Hamilton to offer Oracle a choice of $356.7 million of damages or a second trial.In a statement, Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley said the company is ""thrilled about this landmark recovery."" Asked whether Oracle will accept the $356.7 million or proceed to another trial, a company spokeswoman declined to comment.

Oracle sued SAP in 2007 after noticing thousands of suspicious downloads of its software. SAP later conceded that its employees were illegally downloading Oracle files, but it couldn't agree with Oracle on damages. The 2010 trial between the two enterprise software competitors was widely watched at the time, as top Oracle executives Larry Ellison and Safra Catz testified.Subsequently, SAP agreed to pay Oracle $306 million, but that agreement allowed Oracle to seek to restore the jury verdict, or win a retrial based on its own damages theories.During the 2010 trial, Oracle had said internal SAP documents showed the German software company expected over $1 billion in revenue from TomorrowNow. However, the 9th Circuit rejected that reasoning given that SAP had paid much less to buy TomorrowNow.

The move comes earlier than expected by many investors, and appears designed to address concerns about the company's direction under Ellison, 70, who has been the Oracle's only CEO in its 37-year history.""While there was some speculation Larry could step down, the timing is a bit of a head scratcher and the Street will have many questions,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""Investors have a mixed view of Safra and especially Hurd as co-CEOs given the missteps we have seen from the company over the past few years.""Oracle shares fell 2 percent to $40.70 in after-hours trading after it reported the management shake-up and profit below Wall Street's average forecast, hurt by weak hardware sales.

But they have worked closely together, and with Ellison. We don’t see the day-to-day changing.""

His step back from the top job mirrors his friend Bill Gates at Microsoft, who stepped down as chairman of the software giant earlier this year but remains a board member and adviser to new CEO Satya Nadella.

79,"  * Financials lead gains; Goldman gains 1.7 pct* Oracle shares down after hours* Indexes up: Dow 0.64 pct; S&P 0.49 pct; Nasdaq 0.68 pctBy Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK, Sept 18 U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept intact its pledge to keep interest rates low, providing a backstop for investors that helped lift both the Dow and S&P to record highs.The Fed said Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting it would keep interest rates near zero for a ""considerable time,"" language supportive of equities which some had expected to be dropped from the statement.The central bank's outlook on Wednesday included forecasts for higher-than-expected rates in 2015 and 2016, which helped financial stocks rise 1.1 percent, leading the day's gains on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs rose 1.7 percent to $187.89, the biggest boost to the Dow. U.S. equity markets have rallied for three consecutive sessions as the Fed's stance eased investor worries the central bank was ready to pivot away from its years-long policy of holding rates at rock bottom levels, which stimulated demand for risk assets like stocks.That support has lifted the benchmark S&P 500 to 34 records in 2014, and has helped markets sidestep a 10-percent ""correction"" for almost three years, even while individual market sectors have seen multiple pullbacks.The climb to repeated record highs has coincided with steadily improving economic data, while the Fed's support has allowed investors to shrug off occasional weak numbers, like the August payrolls report. At the same time, low Treasury interest rates have pushed yield-hungry investors into equities. U.S. housing starts and permits fell in August, but upward revisions to the prior month's data indicated gradual improvement in the housing market. A sharp drop in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week suggested the slowdown in job growth last month was probably an anomaly.""Things are starting to get a little better for the banks in general and that really does help the financials,"" said Patty Edwards, managing director for investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle.""You are seeing low growth starting to improve some, you are starting to see all the things that would turn in an economy."" The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 109.14 points, or 0.64 percent, to 17,265.99, the S&P 500 added  9.79 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,011.36, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 31.24 points, or 0.68 percent, to 4,593.43.After the closing bell, Oracle Corp shares fell 2.2 percent to $40.64.

83,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Sam Adams | NEW YORK  NEW YORK If Larry Ellison sailed off on his yacht for good tomorrow, who would really run Oracle Corp (ORCL.N)?Reuters asked a cast of Wall Streets analysts, and the verdict is dealmaker and finance guru Safra Catz. The question is on investors' minds after Ellison, 70, promoted both Catz and sales leader Mark Hurd to the CEO position on Thursday, while taking on the role of executive chairman and chief technology officer himself. The move appears to be the first stage of Ellison's gradual withdrawal. But what if Ellison disappeared immediately?Of 12 analysts who replied to an anonymous poll, five said Catz would likely run Oracle, while only one voted for Hurd, 57. Four said both would continue to run the company, one said neither, and one plumped for dark-horse internal candidate  Thomas Kurian.  Oracle did not respond to a request for comment. Votes in favor of Catz, the 52-year old former Wall Street banker who orchestrated Oracle's multibillion dollar acquisitions and has been Ellison's de facto deputy for the last few years, stressed her 15 years of experience at the company.Hurd, who only joined Oracle in 2010 after leaving Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) under the cloud of a business ethics breach, has a larger public presence but is still seen as a newcomer.""In a CEO cage match it's pretty even, but I give Safra extra credit for her years of service with the company,"" said Kim Forrest at Fort Pitt Capital. ""She likely knows the lay of the land better."" Only one analyst said Hurd was the more likely to lead the company, chiefly because he is the one with experience of being the CEO of a large technology company. One analyst said neither would likely be CEO, echoing sentiments that Ellison does not fully back either candidate to solely run the company he co-founded 37 years ago and built into a $40 billion-a-year giant. ""It’s pretty clear that part of the board doesn’t fully trust Mark Hurd and part of the board doesn’t think she (Catz) has the technology depth,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, professor at the Yale School of Management, who was not part of the poll.  Most analysts think the co-CEO arrangement should work in the short term, but questions remain over how long it will last.  ""I don't know the timing - it could be three, it could be five years - there may be one (CEO) down the road,"" said  Gartner analyst Chad Eschinger. He would not be drawn on who that might be. One figure not mentioned in Thursday's reshuffle was 47-year-old Kurian, Oracle's executive vice president in charge of product development, who reports directly to Ellison and has been seen as a rising power in the company. ""Perhaps he did not feel comfortable in the role as a front man, although he does do a solid job in his presentations,"" said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""He’s a few years younger (than Catz and Hurd), so perhaps his time will come.""

Shares of Yahoo , which is selling part of its Alibaba stake but will remain a top shareholder, were volatile in heavy volume and closed down 2.7 percent at $40.93. ""Alibaba was awesome. The Alibaba deal was done correctly, which is, you leave something on the table for investors to enjoy,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.""So the market got to focus on Alibaba, which was a positive.""But technology shares weighed on the S&P 500 with Oracle  down after Larry Ellison, co-founder and leader for 37 years, stepped aside as chief executive.

85,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO By promoting its two presidents to serve as co-chief executives instead of founder and CEO Larry Ellison, database-and-software behemoth Oracle (ORCL.N) is setting itself a course that has confounded other big companies.The move seemingly marries the product oversight of Mark Hurd, former chief executive of Hewlett Packard, with the legal and financial expertise of Safra Catz, a 15-year Oracle veteran.With Ellison remaining executive chairman and in a position to call the final shots, the company may be able to avoid some of the challenges that have mired other co-CEOs, who often end up in an unhappy ""two’s-a-crowd"" situation, analysts say. At Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, for example, Wenda Harris Millard was supposed to oversee media, while co-CEO Robin Marino held responsibility for marketing.

86,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 19  SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 19 By promoting its two presidents to serve as co-chief executives instead of founder and CEO Larry Ellison, database-and-software behemoth Oracle  is setting itself a course that has confounded other big companies.The move seemingly marries the product oversight of Mark Hurd, former chief executive of Hewlett Packard, with the legal and financial expertise of Safra Catz, a 15-year Oracle veteran.With Ellison remaining executive chairman and in a position to call the final shots, the company may be able to avoid some of the challenges that have mired other co-CEOs, who often end up in an unhappy ""two's-a-crowd"" situation, analysts say.At Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, for example, Wenda Harris Millard was supposed to oversee media, while co-CEO Robin Marino held responsibility for marketing. That lasted just 10 months, with Millard quitting in early 2009 after frequent clashes with Marino and company founder Stewart.At Citigroup, a co-CEO arrangement between John Reed and Sandy Weill, two strong personalities who publicly jousted, fell apart when Reed left in 2000.""Co-CEO structures are typically not ideal,"" said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones, who says most companies need the decisiveness that a single strong-willed leader offers.

92,"  (Adds background on Catz and Hurd)By Noel Randewich and Bill RigbySAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, Sept 18 Larry Ellison, co-founder and leader of Oracle Corp for 37 years, stepped aside as chief executive officer on Thursday, to be replaced by co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, raising questions about a job-sharing arrangement that has had a fraught record elsewhere.Ellison and the two new co-CEOs each stressed that nothing would change under the new management structure, with Ellison staying on as executive chairman and chief technology officer.But Oracle shares fell 2 percent to $40.70 in after-hours trading after it reported the management shake-up and that profit had fallen below Wall Street's average forecast, hurt by weak hardware sales.The move immediately attracted criticism from management  experts.""In almost all cases, these co-CEO configurations are a jerry-rigged solution to a political problem,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management.The move comes earlier than expected by many investors, and appears designed to address concerns about the company's direction under Ellison, 70, who co-founded the database company that became Oracle in 1977 and has been Oracle's only CEO.""While there was some speculation Larry could step down, the timing is a bit of a head scratcher and the Street will have many questions,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""Investors have a mixed view of Safra and especially Hurd as co-CEOs given the missteps we have seen from the company over the past few years.""On a conference call with analysts, Ellison said: ""I'm going to continue doing what I've been doing over the last several years. They're going to continue what they've been doing over the last several years,"" referring to Hurd, 57, and Catz, 52. ""Mark and Safra have done a spectacular job and I think they deserve the recognition of their new titles.""Catz and Hurd echoed that mantra on the call.""I want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes,"" said Catz. ""No changes whatsoever."" For his part, Hurd stressed that Oracle was not hierarchical. ""We're pretty flat in terms of the way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way,"" he told the conference call.The creation of two CEO roles, which has largely been unsuccessful when tried at other companies, raises questions of how Catz and Hurd, both strong personalities, will work together at the top.""Co-CEO structures are typically not ideal,"" said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""They're both very independent thinkers who have strong wills. At times they won't agree. But they have worked closely together, and with Ellison. We don't see the day-to-day changing.""The two have very different histories. Catz, trained in finance and law, was a Wall Street banker from 1986 until she joined Oracle in 1999, and has been a central figure in Oracle's many acquisitions.Sales-oriented Hurd spent 25 years at computer and ATM pioneer NCR Corp before joining Hewlett-Packard, where he was CEO from 2005 until 2010, when he resigned in the wake of sexual harassment claims by a female contractor. HP concluded that its harassment policy had not been violated but that Hurd had made inaccurate expense claims concealing entertainment for the contractor. He was courted by Ellison and joined Oracle later that year. STEPPING BACK, BUT STILL PRESENT Under the new arrangement, manufacturing, finance and legal functions at Oracle will continue to report to Catz, while sales and service units will continue to report to Hurd. Software and hardware engineering will continue to report to Ellison.The major difference is that Catz and Hurd will now report to Oracle's board, rather than to Ellison himself, although Ellison is now executive chairman of that board.Ellison will keep working full time, Oracle said in a statement. His step back from the top job mirrors Bill Gates at Microsoft, who stepped down as chairman of the software giant earlier this year but remains a board member and adviser to new CEO Satya Nadella.Ellison has recently been edging back from his role as the face of Oracle. Last year, he skipped a quarterly conference call to be out on the water to watch his Oracle Team USA compete in sailing's America's Cup, and he also skipped his widely followed keynote speech at Oracle's OpenWorld conference as the regatta got down to its nail-biting final races.But he promised to appear on the company's quarterly earnings calls with analysts. ""You'll have to wait a little while longer before you get me off the calls,"" he told analysts on Thursday. ""I apologize to everyone for that."" Marc Benioff, CEO of Oracle competitor Salesforce.com, commented on Twitter that Ellison will remain in power.""There always has been, & always will be, one CEO at Oracle,"" Benioff tweeted in reaction to the news.RAGS TO RICHES Raised in a rough Chicago neighborhood, Ellison built Oracle into one of Silicon Valley's most successful technology companies, whose databases have become the technology backbones of the world's largest corporations.Ellison took the company public in 1986, the same year as Microsoft, with revenue of $55 million. This fiscal year revenues are expected to top $40 billion.Through dozens of acquisitions, Ellison widened Oracle's portfolio of business software to include tools for customer service, human resources and business intelligence, investing tens of billions of dollars to acquire PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and other tech companies.But in recent years, Ellison has stumbled. Investors widely criticized his $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 after sales of Sun servers and other equipment fell after the deal.Ellison famously mocked cloud computing as ""complete gibberish"" in a 2008 tirade after a Wall Street analyst asked him to comment on the new phenomenon, a broad term referring to the delivery of computer services via the Internet from remote data centers.Since his remarks, cloud computing has become a driving force in enterprise software and Oracle is struggling to build out its own cloud offerings to catch up with smaller rivals.Ellison, who battled big rivals IBM and SAP  for most of his tenure, appeared to change his tune this year, when he called Amazon.com and Salesforce.com  the company's most immediate threat.

94,"  Oracle Corp's (ORCL.N) Larry Ellison, who is stepping aside as chief executive officer, took less money home in fiscal 2014 that the year before following criticism of his compensation and concerns about the software company's struggles against smaller rivals.Ellison received $67.3 million as compensation in 2014, a 15.5 percent drop from a year earlier, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Oracle surprised Wall Street last week with the announcement that Ellison, who the cofounded the company four decades ago and owns a quarter of it, would be replaced by Presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. Compensation for Catz and Hurd stood at $37.7 million each for the fiscal year ended May 2014, also less than in the previous year, according to the filing.For fiscal 2015, Oracle is reducing the number of stock options granted to the three senior executives and introducing performance stock units, which will be awarded based on Oracle's success against rivals including SAP and IBM (IBM.N). Ellison, whose 2013 compensation was $79.6 million, will take over as executive chairman and chief technology officer. In recent years, some investors have opposed Ellison's pay packages, complaining that the world's fifth-richest man makes too much money as his company struggles.While Ellison, Catz and Hurd took home less total pay last year, their stock options and other incentives are still generous, said Michael Pryce-Jones, an analyst at CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds and has been a critic of Ellison's compensation.  ""Careful scrutiny and caution are warranted because we’re still looking at awards with huge economic value. You’ve got Catz and Hurd on a huge number and Ellison hasn’t taken a huge dip either,"" Pryce-Jones said. Oracle's compensation committee reduced Ellison's stock option awards for 2015 to 2.25 million shares from 7 million shares in fiscal 2014, the filing showed. Catz and Hurd were granted a special one-time stock option award for 500,000 shares each, taking the options for 2015 to 2.75 million shares each, down from 5 million the year before.  Last year, a  majority of shareholders opposed Ellison's pay in a non-binding vote. While the voting result requires no changes from the company, it underscored concern among shareholders about high pay as the company struggles to fend off smaller, aggressive companies offering software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle. ""The issues remain the same. Oracle has misexecuted and shown disappointing numbers to the street for the better part of the last few years,"" said FBR analyst Daniel Ives.In fiscal 2014 Ellison collected a salary of $1, with the rest of his compensation coming mostly from stock options.

(1.usa.gov/ZcjMN1)Oracle surprised Wall Street last week with the announcement that Ellison, who the cofounded the company four decades ago and owns a quarter of it, would be replaced by Presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd..Compensation for Catz and Hurd stood at $37.7 million each for the fiscal year ended May 2014, also less than in the previous year, according to the filing.For fiscal 2015, Oracle is reducing the number of stock options granted to the three senior executives and introducing performance stock units, which will be awarded based on Oracle's success against rivals including SAP and IBM. Ellison, whose 2013 compensation was $79.6 million, will take over as executive chairman and chief technology officer.In recent years, some investors have opposed Ellison's pay packages, complaining that the world's fifth-richest man makes too much money as his company struggles. While Ellison, Catz and Hurd took home less total pay last year, their stock options and other incentives are still generous, said Michael Pryce-Jones, an analyst at CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds and has been a critic of Ellison's compensation.""Careful scrutiny and caution are warranted because we're still looking at awards with huge economic value. You've got Catz and Hurd on a huge number and Ellison hasn't taken a huge dip either,"" Pryce-Jones said.Oracle's compensation committee reduced Ellison's stock option awards for 2015 to 2.25 million shares from 7 million shares in fiscal 2014, the filing showed. Catz and Hurd were granted a special one-time stock option award for 500,000 shares each, taking the options for 2015 to 2.75 million shares each, down from 5 million the year before.Last year, a  majority of shareholders opposed Ellison's pay in a non-binding vote. While the voting result requires no changes from the company, it underscored concern among shareholders about high pay as the company struggles to fend off smaller, aggressive companies offering software and Internet-based products at prices that often undercut Oracle.""The issues remain the same. Oracle has misexecuted and shown disappointing numbers to the street for the better part of the last few years,"" said FBR analyst Daniel Ives.In fiscal 2014 Ellison collected a salary of $1, with the rest of his compensation coming mostly from stock options.

98,"  (Adds source-based information about state of EMC deal talks, additional comment from Chambers, share movement)By Christian Plumb and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK, Sept 24 Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers on Wednesday said the networking company was not among the potential suitors for data storage products maker EMC Corp, which the Wall Street Journal has said is exploring options that include a sale.Chambers, speaking at a Wall Street Journal breakfast, said he usually avoided commenting on potential deals but would make an exception in this case. Cisco typically gets ""the opportunity for almost every move in the industry"" in terms of potential deals, he added.""If Joe and I were going to do something here we would have done it a year or two ago,"" he said, referring to EMC CEO Joe Tucci, who is expected to retire in February. EMC has held merger talks with Hewlett-Packard Co  that have since ended and are unlikely to resume, according to people familiar with the matter.No talks are under way between EMC and any other big technology companies with the firepower to make a sizeable acquisition, including Oracle Corp, Dell Inc  and Cisco, the people said. People with knowledge of the approaches say Elliott Management, an activist investor in EMC, has spoken to various technology companies, including Dell, Cisco and Oracle, to discuss various options, including a sale. The people said those companies were not interested in those options at this time.EMC, which has a market capitalization of nearly $61 billion, has rebuffed pressure from Elliott to spin off software maker VMware Inc, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this month.Shares of EMC were down 0.6 percent at $29.66 in late-morning trading, while Cisco rose 0.7 percent to $24.88.

The Fed said it would take a ""patient"" approach in deciding when to bump borrowing costs higher, which Fed Chair Janet Yellen, at a news conference, defined as ""at least a couple of meetings.""The statement from the Fed, which has kept benchmark rates near zero since 2008, came against a backdrop of solid domestic economic growth but trouble overseas.""This is the market saying, 'Ah, I get it,' the Fed does not want to be in the business of disruption, this is a steady monetary policy and the Fed will continue to be supportive of asset prices,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Private Banking in New York.

112,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked the state of Arizona from enforcing a policy that denies driver's licenses to young immigrants granted legal status by President Barack Obama in 2012.The court denied the request by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to place a hold on a ruling from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the policy had no legal basis. The state must now let roughly 20,000 eligible immigrants apply for driver's licenses.""This is the best day ever,"" said Phoenix-based activist Dulce Matuz. ""This will mean a lot to so many people.""Matuz, whose Arizona Dream Act Coalition was among the groups that challenged the policy in court, said the decision saves taxpayer dollars and would have an immediate impact. ""This is going to open the door for people to begin living a more normal life,"" she said. It was not clear when the licenses will be available. The Supreme Court's brief order noted that three conservative members among the nine justices - Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito - would have granted Arizona's request.The affected residents were granted legal status under a 2012 federal program that critics called amnesty. A similar program announced by President Barack Obama last month would grant legal status to 4.4 million immigrants.Brewer, a Republican who is about to leave office, and fellow Republican governors have said they will contest that program in court. Brewer's spokesman, Andrew Wilder, said the state was waiting for a lower court to issue the injunction needed to bring the Supreme Court ruling into force. To be eligible under the 2012 program called ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,"" or DACA, immigrants must have come to the United States before the age of 16 and had to be below 31 as of June 15, 2012.

Success on that front is a gauge for how well the company can fight off competition from cloud-software companies such as Salesforce.com Inc.""Oracle has been going through a transition as it rationalizes the hardware business and moves their software business to the cloud,"" said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle. ""This good evidence that they're making some progress there.""Total revenue rose to $9.6 billion from $9.28 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $9.51 billion. Revenue from cloud services totaled $516 million. The company broke a string of disappointing quarters in which revenue grew more slowly than expected.In September, the company promoted co-presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd to co-chief executives.Ellison, the co-founder, remains executive chairman and chief technology officer, and spoke extensively on a conference call with analysts Wednesday, particularly on Oracle's growth in the cloud. ""We think we will be number one in the cloud and will be number one in cloud very quickly,"" Ellison said, interjecting after Hurd briefly answered an analyst's question about cloud revenue.In 2008, Ellison called cloud computing ""complete gibberish,"" but in recent years, the company has tried to catch up by making a string of acquisitions. Hurd cited several new customers for Oracle's cloud business, including Siemens,  Honeywell International Inc, and Johnson & Johnson.Nevertheless, ""the company has some ""wood to chop"" in 2015 to accelerate top-line growth as its bread and butter database business remains under pressure,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Oracle's net income slipped to $2.50 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Nov. 30, from $2.55 billion a year earlier. On that basis, it earned 56 cents a share, the same as in the year-earlier quarter.  Before one-times items, it earned 69 cents per share, also the same as a year ago.Oracle built its name by selling on-premises hardware and software. New software license updates and supports remain by far the company's biggest business, with revenue of $4.77 billion last quarter, followed by new software licenses and hardware systems.(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru and Deepa Seetharaman in San Francisco; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Richard Chang)",2014-12-18,ORCL,"Wed Dec 17, 2014 | 7:41pm EST",UPDATE 2-Oracle revenue rises 3.5 pct on strong growth in cloud,http://www.reuters.com//article/oracle-results-idUSL3N0U15G520141218?type=companyNews

128,"   By Nadia Damouni | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Every Tuesday and Wednesday at around 2 pm, Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle Corp, gathers his lieutenants in the board room on the top floor of the software giant's headquarters in Redwood City, California to hear engineers present new products and strategies.Several people who have attended the meetings over the years said all the top Oracle executives have assigned seats – including Ellison himself, the two co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, and Thomas Kurian, who was appointed president of software development last week.But sometimes during these meetings, which last several hours, it is as if Ellison, 70, and Kurian, 47, are the only ones in the room, the people said. Ellison turns to Kurian for a second opinion and affirmation on product decisions, conversations that one former Oracle executive described as ""rapid-fire exchanges"".""He always looks back at Thomas and says, 'Thomas what do you think? Thomas let's do that.' It was something to watch them,"" said the former executive.Kurian's sway within Oracle, as evidenced by the dynamic in these meetings as well as his growing responsibilities, has some current and former company executives convinced that he will one day succeed Ellison and run the technology company, which has a market cap of about $190 billion.Even after Ellison named Hurd and Catz as co-CEOs in September, insiders said they believed Kurian was the man to watch at Oracle. One senior Oracle executive said that after Hurd and Catz were promoted, top executives worried about keeping Kurian motivated and happy. He continued to report directly to Ellison, now executive chairman of the board, along with Hurd, Catz and two others. ""He has Larry's ear. He is his trusted soldier,"" said another former Oracle executive.Oracle declined to comment for this story or make Ellison and Kurian available for interview.OTHER INTERESTS Ellison seems to be in no hurry to take a back seat. The billionaire is currently very actively involved with the company, and was even appointed Oracle’s chief technology officer in September, but he has in recent years spent an increasing amount of time on other interests, including his sailing team, and as he develops the Hawaiian island he largely controls into an eco-tourism destination. Appointing the co-CEOs helps him delegate administrative and sales tasks that he has little interest in, the sources said. The sources say that when Ellison does eventually hand over the reins, he will want to entrust Oracle to someone who lives and breathes technology, and Kurian is seen fitting that job description best among the top executives.Kurian has always kept his plans close to his chest, and would often brush off rumors about succession with a smile, one of the sources said.  He is already well compensated. For the last fiscal year, Catz and Hurd made $37 million each. Kurian made $26.7 million, mainly through stock option awards, regulatory filings show.     NO SMALL TALK Outside technology circles and Oracle little is known about Kurian. In interviews, current and former Oracle executives provided insights into how the India-born engineer rose up the ranks and what may have kept him back from getting the corner office already. They painted a picture of a smart technologist who understands Oracle's products inside out, works long hours, executes Ellison's vision and has such little patience for small talk that some people think he is uncomfortable in one-on-one conversations.His biggest achievement so far is seen as building Oracle's middleware business, the software plumbing that connects different parts of a computer network - such as the link between an operating system and applications used by businesses – into a substantial enterprise. He is also credited for overseeing Oracle's vast and still rapidly evolving suite of products, from business software applications to servers and databases. Now, Ellison has put him in charge of the company's move to the cloud – the use of the Internet to run applications or store data - where it lags competitors. Success in the endeavor could give Kurian even more influence at the company, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, who says the executive is extremely well regarded in technology circles.At the same time, the sources said Kurian's management style has sometimes turned people off. People who have worked with him over the years said he does not sufficiently delegate responsibility, which has increasingly become a problem as his mandate has grown over the years. Although his responsibilities have grown a lot, he still likes to get involved in the minutia of various projects, these people said.        A QUICK RISE     Kurian was born in the southern Indian state of Kerala and was raised in Bangalore. He came to the United States in 1986, and went to Princeton for graduate school in electrical engineering. He joined Oracle in 1996 after a brief stint as an associate at McKinsey & Co, the management consultancy firm.From there, Kurian quickly rose to become one of Ellison's closest confidants. By the mid 2000s, Oracle was making a big push to build middleware into its next billion-dollar business, and Ellison picked Kurian to lead that effort.By fiscal 2006, the business achieved its goal and Kurian established himself as an executive to watch within Oracle, the sources said.His next project, however, was not that successful. Oracle had made several multibillion-dollar acquisitions over the same period, including human resource software maker PeopleSoft and customer management applications maker Siebel, and plugged those assets under its applications business. In 2007, Ellison put Kurian in charge of integrating these different products.   But the project called Fusion, which cost billions of dollars, was marred by a series of delays, the sources said. And by the time Oracle was able to get its Fusion applications available to customers in 2011, the software world had started moving onto the cloud. Vendors such as Workday and Salesforce.com, for example, started taking market share from Oracle and other tech giants in human resource and customer relationship management applications. Kurian’s new responsibilities for Oracle’s cloud business will put him in a position to even that score.

129,"  * Q4 op profit up 1 pct, broadly in line with Reuters poll avg* Says reaches goal for revenue from cloud services* Shares rise 4.5 pct to top of sector index   (Rewrites first paragraph, adds background, analyst comment)By Harro Ten Wolde and Eric AuchardFRANKFURT, Jan 12 Germany's SAP on Monday reported an accelerating shift by business customers to internet-delivered cloud software, as it eked out a 1 percent rise in operating profit for the fourth quarter thanks to stable demand for its more classic software.SAP reported operating profit, excluding special items, of 2.13 billion euros ($2.5 billion), broadly in line with an average forecast of 2.15 billion according to a Reuters poll of analysts. Shares of Europe's largest software firm extended gains to close up 4.5 percent, leading a 1.7 percent rise in the European technology sector.SAP unnerved investors in October by cutting its profit forecast, blaming the higher initial costs required to deliver its software via the cloud, where revenue is realised over time rather than upfront as for packaged software.The shift to cloud software sales cut profit margins for the fourth quarter by 2.1 percentage points to 38.9 percent, below  company forecasts and analyst expectations. This was partly offset by strength in its mainstay packaged software, especially for maintenance services. ""It seems that SAP was able to keep the balance between cloud growth and a stable software/support business,"" Commerzbank analyst Thomas Becker wrote in a note to clients.The corporate software industry is undergoing a shift away from packaged software which customers run on their computers to software run via the Internet in remote datacenters, making data easier to manage, analyse and use not just on computers but also mobile phones and other devices.The German company needs to boost the proportion of its software sold via the cloud to defend its customer base from cloud-based competitors such as Salesforce.com and Workday Inc and better compete with arch-rival Oracle Corp. SAP said it had reached its full-year target for cloud-based software revenue, which rose 45 percent to 1.1 billion euros, suggesting that, at least for now, it is capable of expanding in the cloud market without further damaging its margins.Fourth-quarter cloud-based revenue jumped 72 percent, or 59 percent at constant currencies, fuelled by sales from Concur, the cloud-based travel-expenses software maker SAP bought last year for $7.3 billion.SAP's cloud revenue accounted for 6.2 percent of 2014 sales.Oracle also reported a jump in cloud software sales of 45 percent to $516 million for its second quarter through November. That amounted to around 6 percent of total revenue.SAP will publish detailed results on Jan. 20. It has promised to spell out a growth plan for its major business lines through 2020.

By the mid 2000s, Oracle was making a big push to build middleware into its next billion-dollar business, and Ellison picked Kurian to lead that effort.By fiscal 2006, the business achieved its goal and Kurian established himself as an executive to watch within Oracle, the sources said.His next project, however, was not that successful.Oracle had made several multibillion-dollar acquisitions over the same period, including human resource software maker PeopleSoft and customer management applications maker Siebel, and plugged those assets under its applications business. In 2007, Ellison put Kurian in charge of integrating these different products.But the project called Fusion, which cost billions of dollars, was marred by a series of delays, the sources said. And by the time Oracle was able to get its Fusion applications available to customers in 2011, the software world had started moving onto the cloud. Vendors such as Workday and Salesforce.com, for example, started taking market share from Oracle and other tech giants in human resource and customer relationship management applications.Kurian's new responsibilities for Oracle's cloud business will put him in a position to even that score.

134,"   By Sarah McBride and Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Onetime highflying tech executive Ray Lane testified on Monday during a sex discrimination trial involving his former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, that he made a mistake in judgment involving the harassment of a female venture capitalist at the firm.Lane, who previously served as executive chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and president of Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), told the court that he erred in not immediately informing others that Trae Vassallo told him about unwanted advances by her colleague, Ajit Nazre, during a 2011 business trip.""I made a mistake,"" he said. ""It was my mistake. I cared more about her feelings than anything else. I thought it should be her choice"" whether to tell others at the firm and start an investigation, he said.Whether Kleiner reacted appropriately to allegations of sexism is at the heart of the suit, filed by former partner Ellen Pao.The case, brought in 2012, helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion about gender issues in Silicon Valley. In the suit, Pao alleges she suffered discrimination and retaliation after Nazre pressured her into a 2006 affair which she soon ended.     Pao alleged in her lawsuit that Lane and other partners did not initially respond to her complaints. Eventually, Lane told her to consider marriage to Nazre, she said in her suit. The discriminatory conduct spread to other partners, leading her to miss out on a key promotion, she alleges.Vassallo, who testified in the case last week, said Lane had told her to be ""flattered"" by Nazre's advances, although she later said she believed he was joking. But Kleiner did eventually start an investigation into Nazre's actions after she told more partners.The firm has vehemently denied Pao’s allegations. Kleiner’s lawyer, Lynne Hermle, said in court last week that the firm treated women fairly and did not promote Pao because she lacked talent.  But Pao’s attorney, Alan Exelrod, said the firm systematically failed to promote women to senior investing partner. He said Pao excelled at her work, lining up patent firm RPX, which raised $160 million in an initial public offering, as an investment.Lane joined Kleiner Perkins in 2000, after leaving software giant Oracle. He championed Fisker Automotive, which raised $1.5 billion before declaring bankruptcy in 2013.Lane is now a partner emeritus at the firm. The case is Pao v. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers LLC, CGC-12-520719, in California Superior Court, in the County of San Francisco.

137,"   By Andrew Chung  While a highly contentious copyright dispute between Oracle Corp and Google Inc gets most of the attention, the battle over patents between the tech heavyweights continues as a U.S. appeals court on Friday resurrected part of an Oracle patent that had been successfully invalidated by Google. A unanimous, three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday agreed with Oracle attorney Marc Hearron of Morrison & Foerster in ruling that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office should not have invalidated all of the Oracle patent's claims. The panel said the agency's interpretation of the patent was faulty and sent it back for reconsideration.

148,"  (Adds Oracle and Copyright Office declined to comment, background, paragraphs 14 and 17-18)By Dan Levine and Lawrence HurleySAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON May 15 The Obama administration has been locked in internal wrangling over what position to take in high profile litigation between two American technology giants, Google and Oracle, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. It faces an end-of-May deadline to decide whether to take sides in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court that will have wide implications for the technology industry.The case involves how much copyright protection should extend to the Java programming language. Oracle won a federal appeals court ruling last year that allows it to copyright parts of Java, while Google argues it should be free to use Java without paying a licensing fee.Google, which used Java to design its Android smartphone operating system, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court then asked the Obama administration in January for its opinion on whether it should take the case.The nine justices request that U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, Jr., the government's top lawyer before the Supreme Court, weigh in on about 20 cases a year in which the federal government has a strong interest. The justices generally give greater weight to what he or she says than other third parties that take a side in a case, an influence which has caused the solicitor general to be dubbed the ""tenth justice.""According to Google, an Oracle victory would obstruct ""an enormous amount of innovation"" because software developers would not be able to freely build on each others' work. But Oracle says it is effective copyright protection that's the key to software innovation.It is unclear what position the administration will ultimately take. Deliberations within the Obama administration have mirrored the larger debate in the technology world about how broadly copyright should apply to software, the sources said. ANTITRUST IMPLICATIONS Charles Duan, a lawyer for interest group Public Knowledge, that backs Google in the case, said he met with officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice antitrust division to advance the view that Oracle is seeking a monopoly on software.""They were very interested in the competition implications of the case,"" Duan said of the antitrust regulators. An FTC representative declined to comment.Another source briefed on the discussions said the solicitor general's office has pushed back on pro-Google arguments. The debate is coming down to the wire as the solicitor general's office, a division of the DOJ, usually files its opinions by the end of May to give the Supreme Court time to make a decision by the conclusion of its term at the end of June. A Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment.Google's Android operating system is the world's best-selling smartphone platform. Oracle sued Google in 2010, claiming that Google had improperly incorporated parts of Java into Android. Oracle is seeking roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims.The case examined whether computer language that connects programs (known as application programming interfaces, or APIs) can be copyrighted.A San Francisco federal judge decided that the Java APIs replicated by Google were not subject to copyright protection and were free for all to use. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed that, saying it was bound to respect copyright protection for software ""until either the Supreme Court or Congress tells us otherwise."" Google has a close relationship with President Barack Obama's administration, and executive chairman Eric Schmidt has long been a high profile supporter of the president's. However, there is no indication that the internal debate on software copyright involves any issues beyond legal policy.Legal teams from both Oracle and Google made separate presentations to government officials in March, a third source familiar with the meetings said.

Stocks with higher dividend yields attract investors when there is an expectation that Treasury yields will fall, or in this case, remain relatively low.""The Fed is talking about the labor market tightening somewhat, which seems to be a hint that it is a step closer to raising rates. At the same time, it seems like there was a notching down of the magnitude of rate hike expectations,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco PowerShares in Downers Grove, Illinois.""Those two things are what is causing stocks to go back and forth.""Major indexes were volatile following the Fed statement. Stocks initially added to losses, then hit session highs as Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke to the media in a follow-up to the statement. They lost more than half the day's gains at the close. The S&P 500 has hovered near the 2,100 level for more than a month as sentiment shifts between hopes for a stronger economy and fears of the effect of rising rates coupled with high valuations.At the closing bell on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.26 points, or 0.17 percent, to 17,935.74, the S&P 500 gained 4.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,100.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.33 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,064.88.At its session high, the S&P had been up 0.5 percent. Adding to support for equities, investors have seen the proximity of rising rates as a trigger for more M&A activity, with mergers and acquisitions already at record levels.Away from the Fed, FedEx fell 3 percent to $176.73 after the package delivery firm reported a quarterly net loss.Oracle shares fell nearly 7 percent in after-hours trading after the enterprise software and computer hardware company missed revenue expectations.During regular market hours, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,606 to 1,446, for a 1.11-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,441 issues fell and 1,301 advanced for a 1.11-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 34 new lows.About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 5.94 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets.(Additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Nick Zieminski)",2015-06-17,ORCL,"Wed Jun 17, 2015 | 4:30pm EDT",US STOCKS-Wall St ends higher in choppy post-Fed trading,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-usa-idUSL1N0Z32KR20150617?type=companyNews

174,"  July 22 Oracle Corp has asked a U.S. judge for permission to update its copyright lawsuit against Google Inc to include the Android operating system's current market dominance.The move by Oracle is its first since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the case to continue and suggests the litigation could be far from over.The closely watched case involves how much copyright protection should extend to Java programming language, which Google used to design its Android smartphone operating system. Google's Android operating system is the world's best-selling smartphone platform. Oracle sued Google five years ago and is seeking roughly $1 billion in copyright claims.Oracle said it wants to update the copyright lawsuit, filed in October 2010, to add that Google continues its copyright infringement through updated versions of Android in both existing and new markets and this is resulting in harm to Oracle and benefit to Google. ""The record of the first trial does not reflect any of these developments in the market, including Google's dramatically enhanced market position in search engine advertising and the overall financial results from its continuing and expanded infringement,"" Oracle wrote in a letter to Judge William Alsup on Wednesday. A Google representative declined to comment.Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an appeals court's ruling that allows Oracle to seek licensing fees for the use of some of the Java language. Google had said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee.

175,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Business planning software start-up Anaplan is nipping at the heels of industry leaders SAP, Oracle and IBM, with sales of its cloud-based service tripling in each of the past three years as it seeks to shake up the market. Customers are demanding more flexible ways to use business planning software, which crunches corporate data to allow companies to forecast growth and set performance goals.While major players like SAP, Oracle's Hyperion business and IBM's Cognos and Applix units have been forced to offer cloud-based products, their focus has remained on packaged software as it makes up the bulk of their revenue.This has opened the door to nimbler rivals focused solely on cloud-based software in the fast-growing market. ""There is a major shift going on and Anaplan is at the forefront,"" Forrester business apps analyst Paul Hamerman said. ""It appears to be the fastest-growing vendor in this space and the one which already has good traction with large companies.""Anaplan is backed by cloud market leaders Salesforce and Workday, both as investors and by integrating their sales and marketing and human resource products.The company, which was founded in a north England farmhouse in 2006, is considering a stock-market listing in the coming year, although it said its rapid growth in customers and revenue gave it room to be patient.""We are really going after 'global 2,000' companies,"" Laurent Lefouet, Anaplan's managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa said in an interview. As of January, it had signed up users at 300 companies, two-thirds of them global firms, he added. Lefouet said Anaplan was on track to sign up 150,000 users this year, and should triple that number in 2016, putting it in reach of 1 million users by 2017 or 2018, he said. By contrast, SAP and Oracle count tens of million of cloud software users, although these numbers include a far broader set of products.While Anaplan, now based in San Francisco, could consider an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming year, it is focused on its next milestone of signing up 1 million users, or an average of 1,000 users across 1,000 global accounts, Lefouet said.However, business software analyst Hamerman said it was more likely that small cloud players would be bought up by bigger rivals than go public. HIGH COSTS  Traditional, non cloud-based, planning software suffers from high costs and inflexible design, while customers are ""locked in"" by vendors as software switching costs are high, Hamerman said. But customer demands are changing rapidly, he added.Anaplan offers users a cloud-based service that processes billions of spreadsheet cells of corporate data on central computers, then illustrates the results in charts and graphics within a user's web browser. Its closest rivals are U.S.-based Adaptive and Host Analytics.Industry experts say that what separates Anaplan from many of its competitors - both large and small - is the way it twins sophisticated data analysis and modeling with a relatively simple interface that allows its software to be used by managers across corporate departments, without lots of tech support.Hamerman said the business planning market was currently worth around $3 billion in annual sales, spread across 15 to 20 players. But Anaplan said its potential audience was 20 percent of all corporate employees, a far bigger market that it said could be worth upward of $20 billion in the long run.  Business planning tools, an outgrowth of accounting systems finance teams use to manage corporate budgets, are now being used by sales and marketing teams to forecast targets, and human resources or operations to set performance goals.Anaplan said it had recently begun to see adoption of such software by thousands of users in big corporate names such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel's McAfee unit, VMware and consumer groups Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Kimberly-Clark.Anaplan and its peers decline to disclose revenue figures. But a calculation based on the 45,000 customers Anaplan says it has signed up combined with an estimated average annual subscription fee comparable to Salesforce.com's roughly $1,000, suggests revenue is nearing $50 million (45 million euros).The Yorkshire-founded, Silicon Valley-financed and French executive-led firm has raised around $150 million to date, with its latest funding round of $100 million led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson and including Sands Capital, Brookside, Bain Capital, along with Salesforce and Workday.

180,"   By Abhirup Roy  Oracle Corp's (ORCL.N) sales fell more than expected in the first quarter, hurt by a strong dollar and a continued drop in licensed software sales and the company warned revenue could fall in the current quarter even on a constant currency basis.Like its rivals such as SAP (SAPG.DE), IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Oracle is striving to boost Internet-based software sales to head off fast-growing competitors such as Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).But, analysts have said Oracle's cloud software business has not been growing fast enough to make up for declines in the 38-year-old company's licensed software business due to reasons ranging from slow customer adoption to tough competition.Oracle's revenue declined 1.7 percent to $8.45 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 31, missing analysts estimates for the third quarter in a row.The company said sales increased 7 percent on a constant currency basis. However, it forecast revenue to range between a fall of 2 percent to growth of 1 percent in the current quarter.""On an apples-to-apples basis, that's disappointing.

183,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Oracle Corp's (ORCL.N) beleaguered shares jumped 1.1 percent on Wednesday after an analyst upgraded them ahead of the fiscal first-quarter report card that will shed light on the enterprise software heavyweight's shift toward cloud computing.SunTrust upgraded Oracle's stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report due after the bell.Four decade-old Oracle faces ruthless competition from more youthful companies flogging inexpensive enterprise services delivered via the Internet, including Salesforce.com (CRM.N), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Workday (WDAY.N).   Analysts have applauded Oracle's attempts to quickly expand its own cloud offerings but some have worried that new focus may hurt the company's traditional, lucrative business of charging customers to run Oracle software in their own data centers.That fear was underscored in June, when Oracle's fourth-quarter results showed revenue dropped 5 percent even as cloud services grew about 29 percent, but still accounted for only 5 percent of overall revenue. ""We believe that the market confusion surrounding Oracle's emerging cloud business and its impact on its existing businesses, while warranted, is clouding Oracle's long-term potential,"" wrote SunTrust analyst John Rizzuto in a note to clients explaining his upgrade. For its first quarter, which ended in August, analyst on average expect EPS of 52 cents and a 1 percent dip in revenue to $8.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Oracle has missed earnings estimates by at least 3 percent in half of the past eight quarters. After fourth-quarter results fell short of consensus, chief executive Safra Catz told analysts on a conference call they ""missed the boat"" on the effect of the strong dollar, which has cut into the revenue of U.S. companies that sell abroad.Oracle shares jumped as high as $38.52 on Wednesday, but retraced some of those gains to trade at $38.31, up 32 cents or 0.84 percent at 1:40 p.m. EDT. Shares of Oracle have lost 7 percent over the past year while Salesforce.com (CRM.N) has gained 24 and Netsuite N.N has risen 8 percent. Oracle trades at 14 times expected earnings, compared to 82 for Salesforce.com. Of older tech companies also trying to break into cloud computing, Microsoft (MSFT.O) trades at 16 times earnings and International Business Machines (IBM.N) trades at 9 times earnings.  Oracle options were busy on Wednesday with about 29,000 contracts traded by 12:15 p.m. ET, about twice the normal pace, according to Trade Alert. September puts at strike prices of $38 and $37 were the busiest near-term contracts, suggesting options traders may expect the stock to fall after it reports.

The complaint said research shows that companies that spend heavily on political contributions often perform poorly. Oracle, the world's biggest database firm, is struggling to move its business toward an Internet-enabled model. Its shares are down about 14 percent this year.The lawsuit cited as a potential concern Ellison's fundraising for Republican presidential candidates, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.Oracle had in 2007 reached an agreement with shareholder activists to disclose political contributions.But the lawsuit charges that the company violated that accord last year by failing to identify the person deciding political donations, or disclose whether corporate funds were channeled through intermediaries such as trade groups. The pension fund said Oracle refused its request for that information.The case is New York State Common Retirement Fund v Oracle Corp, Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 11642.

Both revelations offer a rare peek into the financial details of Android, a critical product for Google as users shift their search efforts from desktop PCs to mobile devices.When Oracle's attorney discussed details about Google's relationship with Apple at the Jan. 14 hearing, Google's attorney objected and argued that information should be sealed. Five days later, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu denied Google's request.Google asked Ryu to reconsider her ruling on Thursday, which has not yet been decided. However, a copy of the transcript became available at the courthouse on Thursday. The court removed it from public view a few hours after posting it as a Reuters reporter was reviewing it, presumably to allow Google to litigate its request to rehear the secrecy issue.A court official was not immediately available for comment.In its story, Bloomberg reported that a Google witness had revealed that the revenue share between Google and Apple was 34 percent at one point. However, it was not clear whether that percentage represented the amount kept by Google or paid to Apple, the report said.

All three were ultimately purchased by private equity firms.With market volatility taking a heavy toll on the private equity financing market, Elliott's thesis for its Qlik investment shows how the hedge fund will lean more on strategic buyers for an exit opportunity rather than a leveraged buyout. Elliott started buying Qlik shares earlier this year, paying an average of $23.50 per share, for a total of 8.3 million shares, according to its filing. Qlik, which began as a Sweden-based company and is now headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania, saw its shares jump 7 percent on Wednesday to $25.88 on the Nasdaq. Its stock is down more than 40 percent since mid-August. ""This situation is as classic as an Elliott activist situation gets - small to mid-cap technology company that has strategic opportunities,"" Ken Squire, of 13D Monitor, said in a note. Squire, who runs an activist mutual fund and also monitors activist investor filings, said that Elliott could also offer to buy Qlik itself.

216,"   By Mia Shanley | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Every start-up hopes for a lucky break. Swedish company Neo Technology only found out it was getting one the day the Panama Papers made headlines around the world.Journalists with access to the vast trove of data used the firm's open-source database to make sense of 11.5 million documents, including emails, images and spreadsheets, leaked from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.Neo Technology's ""graph database"" literally connected the dots for them, helping find names of the rich and powerful and linking them to offshore accounts. ""I was blown away,"" co-founder and CEO Emil Eifrem said of the moment he discovered, just hours before publication, that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) had been using his product for the Panama Papers.""It's such a sweet spot for our technology, that we have a very stark example,"" the 37-year-old Swede, who released his first free software project at just 16, told Reuters.""It's been for a long time sexy for geeks. But now all of a sudden we can talk about it even to other people.""        An ICIJ team had worked in secret for an entire year on the documents covering a period of almost four decades, revelations from which have shone a light on the financial schemes of the world's elites and caused public outrage.While most databases use tabular searches which can find all the documents in which a name is mentioned, graph databases -- imagine a spider web of lines -- help reveal all the connections between those names and documents.""You may have a prime minister connected to an address, and at that address someone else is living there who is connected to an account which is suspicious in some way,"" said Eifrem, speaking from Silicon Valley amid morning rush hour traffic. ""That's 1,2,3,4 hops which is impossible to do with any other technology.""TECHNOLOGY THE KEY The ICIJ's data and research unit editor Mar Cabra said in a statement that Neo Technology's database had been key to its investigation of the Panama Papers.The 2.6 terabyte data drop was so big that science news website Live Science has said it would take more than 41 years of nonstop operation to print out on an office laser printer. Technology was essential to find news leads in the mountain of data. Nuix Pty Ltd, a little-known Australian developer, provided software that made millions of the scanned documents text-searchable.Founded in 2007 in the southern Swedish city of Malmo, Neo Technology is now headquartered in San Mateo, California and employs about 120 people. It currently has around 200 paying clients, ranging from Walmart and eBay (EBAY.O) to banking groups like UBS (UBSG.S).Its technology is especially popular with online retailers who use it to give customers personal recommendations based on their own purchases and those of others. In banking, it is used for identity and access management and fraud prevention.Eifrem lets investigative journalists use the free version of his software. ""I'm not in the business to make money out of eight journalists who are trying to save the world -- that's not my business model,"" he said, laughing. While the firm is not yet profitable, it is generating revenues from its enterprise edition, which has higher security and offers massive scalability and availability.Eifrem said he believes the company can achieve profitability in 2017 and will probably not need more money to get there. It raised $20 million last year from the likes of Nordic venture capital firm Creandum, Fidelity Growth Partners Europe and Sunstone Capital.Eifrem's dream is to take the company public on the Nasdaq or the NYSE, possibly in two or three years' time, although he is aware it could be an acquisition target for software giants like Oracle or Microsoft which are moving into graph databases.""We are not for sale,"" he said. ""We may very well get acquired one day, but that's not a dream.""Eifrem, whose wife is a journalist, is a big fan of the movie The Matrix, whose main character is Neo, a computer hacker who tries to free humanity from a virtual reality.He speaks passionately about the future of investigative journalism lying largely in data-mining.""I look forward to seeing it unfold,"" Eifrem said.

222,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON The usually close-mouthed Capital Group is speaking up on executive pay - throwing more brickbats than bouquets. In a recent interview, leaders of the $1.4 trillion Los Angeles-based investment manager said they worry about the magnitude of pay for chief executives and question whether corporate boards are using the right benchmarks to determine compensation. ""There has been this continued escalation where everybody wants to be in the upper quartile,"" Alan Berro, senior portfolio manager at Capital Group, told Reuters.""Once one guy raises it, they all want those raises, and we are willing to say no,"" he said.Berro's comments are important because Capital Group, which oversees the big American Funds mutual fund family, is one of the largest holders of U.S. stocks and is emerging as one of the toughest critics of corporate compensation.A measure is its voting record on what are known as ""say-on-pay"" resolutions - non-binding measures which let shareholders vote on whether to approve compensation for top executives.Last year, big mutual fund providers including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group voted in support of say-on-pay resolutions of S&P 500 companies at least 96 percent of the time, according to research firm Proxy Insight. Capital Group, however, was less generous in its support, with its funds supporting the pay 86 percent of the time, one of the lowest rates among big U.S. fund managers. Executive pay, which has been a source of controversy for some time, has drawn more scrutiny amid stagnant U.S. wages for the typical worker. Median pay among S&P 500 CEOs rose to $11.3 million in 2014 from $9.4 million in 2010, according to pay consultant Farient Advisors.Capital Group has rarely spoken about its proxy voting before, but decided to offer more explanation because of growing interest in the area, including from financial advisers and institutional investors, executives said.Like other asset managers, Capital Group says executive pay should be linked to performance. But proxy voting principles Capital recently posted online also have an unusual caveat about ""preventing excess"" pay. In making pay judgments, Berro said, ""We always come back to fairness, and what makes sense in the given circumstances.""Berro and others at Capital declined to single out individual companies whose pay packages they view as problematic. A  securities filing shows the $140 billion Growth Fund of America mutual fund voted ""against"" pay at two of the fund's 10 largest holdings last year: Broadcom Corp and Oracle Corp, historically among the higher-paying technology firms. (Broadcom is now part of Broadcom Ltd.)Top holdings of its Capital World Investors unit include Microsoft Corp, Amazon Inc and Home Depot Inc, according to securities filings tracked by edgar-online.com. Capital World has a stake of at least 4.5 percent in each of those companies, and other Capital Group units hold additional shares.Lately, the firm has been building up a database to track topics like how companies' executive pay compares to peers, and to what extent stock grants to executives have diluted outside shareholders, Berro said. Berro helps oversee investment selection among a wide range of blue-chip companies that are now entering the season for annual meetings.Not all of Capital Groups' votes will please corporate critics. Its funds opposed nearly all proposals calling for companies to report on climate change, for instance. Berro said regulators are better-positioned than shareholders to oversee such matters.    Capital Group has also gained a reputation in some quarters as being activist-friendly - for instance, backing some  dissident nominees to DuPont's board last spring.But Capital Group senior counsel Walt Burkley said his firm does not recruit activists to target companies for changes. ""There is no call to activism from us,"" he said.

223,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Even if a jury orders Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to pay the full $8.8 billion sought by Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) in an upcoming San Francisco copyright trial over the Android operating system, shareholders and analysts say it will likely have little impact on the search giant's bottom line.Oracle claims Google's Android violated its copyright on parts of the Java programming language, while Google says it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law. The case previously went to trial in 2012, but a jury deadlocked. If the new jury, in the trial starting on Monday, rules against Google on fair use, then it will consider damages. Google took in $75 billion in revenue in 2015, so even a large verdict for Oracle would have little impact on investors because it would be a one-time charge, said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, which holds shares in Alphabet, Google's parent company.  Oracle is also seeking an injunction against Google's future use of Java in Android, which would give Oracle more leverage to negotiate an ongoing royalty. However, such an injunction would have to be issued by a judge, not a jury, and legal experts believe that is a remote possibility.After the first trial, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that the material at issue in the case should not be subject to copyright at all. A federal appeals court reversed that ruling, however, saying that the structure of the computer language that connects programs can be protected. An Oracle representative did not respond to a request for comment, and a Google spokesman declined to comment. A damages expert hired by Oracle estimated that Google has taken in $29 billion in gross advertising and search revenue from Android devices since their inception, according to court documents, plus an additional $11.6 billion in sales of apps and Android phones.Oracle's expert then calculated Android profits at $11.4 billion, of which he concluded Oracle is entitled to $8.8 billion.  However, Google says Oracle has vastly overstated Java's role in the success of Android.   In a ruling this week, Alsup said Oracle's damages expert will be allowed to testify about the $8.8 billion figure but cannot tell jurors they should award the entire amount.

224,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Ford Motor Co (F.N) is investing $182.2 million in San Francisco-based Pivotal Software, underscoring the pressure carmakers face to boost their technology platforms given the rise of connected and self-driving cars.The investment in Pivotal, a cloud-software company which provides tools that make it easier for developers to build software, will help Ford boost its own software capabilities. As part of the deal, Ford and Pivotal will jointly open labs in the United States and Europe where their engineers will work side by side.While Pivotal does not make the software at the heart of self-driving car technology, Ford chief executive Mark Fields said he expected benefits from the partnership to flow to all product-development and information-technology teams at Ford, including those working on autonomous cars.For example, Pivotal can help Ford speed up its software-development times, he said in an interview.Ford's investment, part of a $253 million funding round into Pivotal, comes a day after Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) said they would collaborate on creating autonomous minivans. In March, General Motors Co (GM.N) spent $1 billion on Cruise Automation, whose best-known product aims to add self-driving technology onto traditional cars.  “This is not about catching up or one upping the competition,” Fields said. “We have had leadership in (autonomous vehicles) for some time now.” Ford is on track for a fleet of 30 autonomous cars by year end, a Ford spokesman said, second only to Google’s test fleet of autonomous cars. In general, Ford has provided few public details on its plans for self-driving cars. Software maker Microsoft Corp.(MSFT.O) is also investing in the funding round for Pivotal, which had been considered a 2016 IPO candidate when this year's market for initial public offerings looked more promising.Pivotal’s tools are popular with software developers who use the Oracle-owned (ORCL.N) Java platform, so a tighter relationship with Pivotal could give Microsoft’s Azure cloud developer-tools service an advantage among that group, often software developers at big businesses. IBM’s (IBM.N) cloud business, also attractive to Java users, could now face tougher competition as a result of the deal. Existing Pivotal investors General Electric Co (GE.N), EMC Corp EMC.N and VMWare Inc (VMW.N) are participating in the funding round, which gives Pivotal a valuation of $2.8 billion after the new cash infusion, a person familiar with the funding round said. Besides its Cloud Foundry developer-tools business, Pivotal also provides data analytics and runs a consulting arm called Pivotal Labs.

In a trial at San Francisco federal court, Oracle Corp has claimed Google's Android smartphone operating system violated its copyright on parts of Java, a development platform. Alphabet Inc's Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law.Oracle acquired Sun in 2010 and sued Google after negotiations over its use of Java broke down. The jury was deadlocked in a trial in 2012, and if the current jury rules against Google on fair use, then it would consider Oracle's request for $9 billion in damages.The case has been closely watched by software developers who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits. In court on Tuesday, Catz said the decision by Google to distribute Android for free to phone manufacturers like Samsung undercut traditional licensing revenue those manufacturers paid for Java. ""It had a very negative impact,"" Catz said.Samsung, for instance, reduced payments from about $40 million to about $1 million, Catz said.  Amazon had traditionally used Java to develop its Kindle reader, Catz said, but switched to Android for the Fire. When Amazon was developing a new reader, the Paperwhite, Catz said Oracle was forced to offer a 97.5 percent discount to entice Amazon to use Java.Google has attempted to portray itself as a true innovator and claims Oracle only turned to the courts because it could not succeed in the market. Under questioning from a Google attorney, Catz acknowledged that Oracle had considered developing its own phone but did not pursue the project.  Jurors viewed an internal Oracle memo on its phone project, which concluded that Oracle had ""very limited internal expertise to make smart decisions.""Oracle has argued that Google violated basic moral principles by using elements of Java without a license.

239,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) filed a multibillion-dollar copyright lawsuit against Google because Oracle failed in its own attempts to enter the smartphone market, a Google attorney said in closing arguments on Monday.However, an Oracle attorney accused Google of taking its intellectual property without permission and reaping huge profits as a result.In a retrial at U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Oracle Corp has claimed Google's Android smartphone operating system violated its copyright on parts of Java, a development platform. Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law.A trial in 2012 ended in a deadlocked jury, and if the current jury rules against Google on fair use, then it would consider Oracle's request for about $9 billion in damages.The case has been closely watched by software developers, who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits. However, investors see little risk for Google because the company could afford to pay a onetime fine, and the possibility of an injunction that would force Google to pay ongoing royalties to Oracle appears remote.In court on Monday, Google attorney Robert Van Nest played a video of a speech by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison praising ""our friends at Google"" for building devices that use Java. Ellison then suggested Oracle should also build similar hardware. But Oracle was never able to build a smartphone of its own, Van Nest said, so it decided to accuse Google of unfair copying instead.""They now want all the credit and a whole lot of money,"" Van Nest said.

Alphabet Inc's Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law.A trial in 2012 ended in a deadlocked jury, and if the current jury rules against Google on fair use, then it would consider Oracle's request for about $9 billion in damages. The case has been closely watched by software developers, who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits.However, investors see little risk for Google because the company could afford to pay a onetime fine, and the possibility of an injunction that would force Google to pay ongoing royalties to Oracle appears remote. In court on Monday, Google attorney Robert Van Nest played a video of a speech by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison praising ""our friends at Google"" for building devices that use Java.

257,"  Business software maker Oracle Corp reported a higher-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales in its cloud business surged due to more customers.Shares of the Redwood City, California-based company rose as much as 3.8 percent to $40.10 in extended trading on Thursday.Like its rivals such as SAP SE, IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp, Oracle has focused on moving its business toward the cloud-computing model, essentially providing services remotely via data centers rather than selling installed software.Total revenue from the company's cloud-computing software and platform service rose 49.1 percent to $859 million in the fourth quarter ended May 31. It contributed 8 percent of Oracle's total revenue during the quarter.Oracle expects the business to grow more than 65 percent in fiscal 2017, higher than the 52 percent growth it saw in 2016, co-Chief Executive Safra Catz said on a conference call.The company also expects first quarter adjusted profit of 56-60 cents per share and revenue to grow between 2-5 percent in constant currency, Catz said.

268,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Oracle Corp.  (Oracle), including the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at  'A+'/'F1', respectively. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's affirmation  affects $57.1 billion of debt, including the $3 billion undrawn revolving credit  facility (RCF) expiring 2018 and $3.75 billion outstanding under a separate RCF  that was repaid at maturity in June 2016. A full list of rating actions follows  at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings and Outlook reflect the following expectations: Resumption of Revenue Growth: Fitch expects operating performance will  strengthen from robust Oracle cloud adoption driving the resumption of overall  top-line growth. Cloud represented only 8% of consolidated revenues in fiscal  2016 but Fitch's Rating Case incorporates hyper-growth through the intermediate  term. Layered on top of update and support revenue growth (more than 50% of  consolidated revenue) offsetting continued double-digit revenue declines for new  on-premise licenses (20% of consolidated revenue ), Fitch expects  mid-single-digit software growth. Hardware and Services (20% of consolidated  revenue combined) should reduce consolidated revenue by 100-200 basis points  through the forecast period.  Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects Oracle's financial flexibility will  remain solid from robust recurring free cash flow (FCF) and significant overseas  cash, despite increasing debt over the intermediate term to fund domestic cash  shortfalls. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $56.4 billion  as of May 31, 2016, $7.9 billion of which was held in the U.S. The company also  has an undrawn $3 billion RCF expiring 2018 that fully backstops a commercial  paper (CP) program and Fitch expects roughly $10 billion of annual FCF over the  intermediate term, just under half of which Fitch estimates is in the U.S. Significant Recurring Revenue: Fitch expects significant recurring revenue from  Oracle's large installed customer base, high attach-and-renewal rates (ARR) and  software support. Despite our expectations for ongoing double-digit declines for  New Software License revenue through the intermediate term, Software License  Updates & Product Support (more than half of fiscal 2016 total revenues) should  continue its positive low- to mid-single-digit growth, driven by application  modernization (on-premise to SaaS) and support. Strong Competitive Position: Fitch believes Oracle's strong positions across key  as-a-service markets (enterprise resource, human resource, supply chain and  manufacturing, data and marketing), significant database and middleware  installed base capable of running on-premise and in the cloud uniquely positions  Oracle as a one-stop-shop cloud service provider. Oracle faces significant  competition from strong and fast-growing but more focused as-a-service players,  including Salesforce.com, Inc. (Salesforce), currently the largest SaaS provider  with a significant lead in sales and service clouds, and Workday, Inc.  (Workday), as well as historical on-premise competitors, including SAP AG, also  rapidly expanding cloud offerings. As a result, Fitch believes accelerating  cloud revenue growth to be first to $10 billion in cloud revenues from $2.9  billion for fiscal 2016 is critical to Oracle's longer-term success, given  Fitch's expectations for secular declines in on-premise, significant switching  costs and high customer retention rates for cloud services and customer and  product diversification. Lower Cloud Profit Margins: While Fitch expects the resumption of top-line  growth in fiscal 2017 will drive operating EBITDA expansion, an increasing mix  of lower gross margin cloud sales will weigh on profit margins. Fitch expects  Oracle's recent cloud investments in growth capacity and sales efficiency to  drive gross margin from a Fitch estimated 48% in fiscal 2016 (versus 96% for  on-premise). Still, Oracle may be challenged to achieve its 80% cloud gross  margin target in the intermediate term, which, if successful, would put it  meaningfully ahead of competitors, Salesforce (mid-70%s) and Workday (low-70%s). Significant Shareholder Returns: Fitch expects shareholder returns will remain  significant and approximate annual pre-dividend FCF, in the absence of large  domestic acquisitions. Mid-single-digit annual dividend growth is expected with  the remainder of pre-dividend FCF for share repurchases. Oracle has $8.8 billion  remaining under the current $10 billion share repurchase authorization approved  on March 15, 2016, and has bought back $28.3 billion of common stock over the  last three years ($22.9 billion net of proceeds from the issuance of common  stock). Fitch anticipates the company will fund shareholder returns with  incremental borrowing, given a Fitch-estimated 55% of FCF is overseas. Historically Acquisitive: Despite expectations for strong organic cloud growth,  Fitch believes acquisition risk remains elevated, given management's focus on  winning the cloud and premium valuations for as-a-service companies. Fitch  expects smaller tuck-in acquisitions aimed at strengthening cloud capabilities  are more likely than blockbuster deals, although aggregate spending could be  significant. Most cloud targets are in the U.S., potentially resulting in  debt-financed deals that may not be meaningfully additive to profitability in  the 12-18 months following the transaction's close. Fitch expects Oracle will  curtail share repurchases if acquisitions are expected to result in elevated  leverage beyond the near term. Supplemental Adjusted Net Leverage: Fitch expects incremental borrowing to plug  domestic cash shortfalls will weigh on gross credit protection measures over  time. We expect Oracle will avoid repatriating meaningful offshore cash to the  U.S., given it would trigger significant tax liabilities. Pro forma for today's  $14 billion senior notes issuance, Fitch estimates total leverage (debt to  operating EBITDA) will be roughly 3x, up from 2.6x for fiscal 2016. However,  supplemental adjusted net leverage (total debt netted against adjusted  cash/operating EBITDA) will be and remain near 1.5x through the forecast period,  compared to 1.1x for fiscal 2016. Fitch expects Oracle will use a portion of the  senior notes issuance to refinance upcoming maturities, which include $3.75  billion of bank debt expiring in the current quarter and $6 billion of bond  maturities in fiscal 2018.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Robust cloud services growth of more than 65% for fiscal 2017 and the addition  of $1.5 billion of cloud revenues through the remainder of the forecast period.  --Mid-teen revenue declines in new on-premise licenses through the forecast  period from ongoing migration to the cloud. --Low-single-digit revenue growth in Software License Updates and Product  Support revenue from support adoption for cloud services growth. --Hardware and Services revenue reduce overall top-line growth by 100-200 bps  from ongoing cloud adoption. --Flat Fitch estimated gross profit margin at just under 80% despite increasing  mix of lower gross profit margin cloud service sales. --Operating EBITDA expands to the high 40%s, versus a Fitch estimated 45% for  fiscal 2016, from operating leverage, given the company's rapid growth and more  efficient go-to-market sales strategy. --Capex is roughly 3% of revenue, driven primarily by the company's investments  in land acquisition. --Shareholder returns approximate annual FCF, with dividend growth of 5% and the  remainder for share repurchases. --Incremental debt will plug domestic cash shortfalls. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions are unlikely, given what Fitch believes is a strategic  rationale for a higher rating at the expense of financial flexibility required  for acquisitions and shareholder returns. However, management's commitment to  maintain supplemental adjusted net leverage below 1x over the longer term and  Fitch's expectations Oracle will be first to achieve $10 billion of cloud  services, which Fitch believes would support the company's win the cloud  strategy, could result in positive rating action. Negative rating actions could occur if: --Fitch expects Oracle will sustain supplemental adjusted net leverage above 2x  and total leverage above 3x from incremental borrowings to fund domestic cash  shortfalls in conjunction with lack of profitability growth;  --Fitch expects annual FCF sustained near or below $5 billion due to negative  revenue growth or structurally lower profitability from less competitive cloud  service offerings. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Oracle's liquidity will remain solid. As of May 31, 2016 liquidity  was supported by: --$56.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which  all but $8 billion was located outside the U.S. and would be subject to  significant taxation if repatriated;  --$3 billion CP program fully back-stopped by a $3 billion RCF. Fitch's expectations for $10 billion of annual FCF through the intermediate term  also supports liquidity, of which Fitch assumes just under half is generated  inside the U.S. Total debt at May 31, 2016 was $43.9 billion and consisted of: --$3.75 billion of RCF due June 2016; --$2.5 billion of 1.20% senior notes due October 2017; --$1 billion of floating rate senior notes due July 2017; --$2.5 billion of 5.75% senior notes due April 2018; --$500 million of floating rate senior notes due January 2019; --$1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019; --$1.75 billion of 5% senior notes due July 2019; --$750 million of floating rate senior notes due October 2019; --$2 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019; --$1 billion of 3.875% senior notes due July 2020; --$1.7 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021; --$1.5 billion of 2.8% senior notes due July 2021; --$2.5 billion of 2.5% senior notes due May 2022; --$2.5 billion of 2.50% senior notes due October 2022; --$1 billion of 3.625% senior notes due July 2023; --$2 billion of 3.4% senior notes due July 2024; --$2.5 billion of 2.95% senior notes due May 2025; --$1 billion of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025; --$500 million 3.25% senior notes due May 2030; --$1.75 billion of 4.3% senior notes due July 2034; --$1.25 billion of 3.9% senior notes due May 2035; --$1.25 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038; --$1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due July 2039; --$2.25 billion of 5.375% senior notes due July 2040; --$1 billion of 4.5% senior notes due July 2044; --$2 billion of 4.125% senior notes due May 2045; --$1.25 billion of 4.375% senior notes due May 2055. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch affirms Oracle's ratings as follows: --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --RCF at 'A+'; --Senior Unsecured Debt at 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --CP at 'F1'. Fitch also rates today's $14 billion senior notes issuance 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

270,"   By Hillary Flynn  NEW YORK, June 30 (IFR) - The US high-grade market roared back to life this week with big deals from Molson Coors and Oracle that got a warm welcome from investors clamoring for paper after a bit of a drought.Investors piled US$31bn of orders into Tuesday's US$5.3bn offering from Molson Coors, the first deal in the US primary market after Britain's vote to leave the European Union.The trade ended what had been a week-long hiatus and did so with a bang, as the brewer was able to price some of the bonds through its curve - and then see them tighten in secondary.Software giant Oracle jumped in the following day, pricing a US$14bn mega-deal in a session that saw more than US$20bn of deals in all, helping soothe worries about a Brexit contagion.In fact, borrowers locked in some of the lowest levels in months thanks to a sharp drop in underlying Treasury yields and a less than commensurate widening in corporate spreads.And that should mean issuance will keep rolling next week after syndicate desks return from the US July 4 holiday.""Overall, issuers are paying lower coupons by and large than they were before the Brexit vote,"" a syndicate banker on the Oracle deal told IFR.Molson pulled in pricing by 30bp-45bp across all four tranches, offering negative 10bp to flat concessions.Oracle's deal, its biggest ever, also came very cheap.The Oracle 10-year priced with a coupon of 2.65% - 30bp lower than the 2.95% it paid on 10-year debt that priced just over a year ago.The 30-year came with a coupon of 4%, also below the 4.125% it paid on a similarly dated deal last year. ""[Oracle's strategy] was to focus on the coupons,"" said the syndicate banker.""It's the lowest has ever printed.""MORE PLEASE In part because of the negative yields on offer elsewhere - especially in Europe and Japan - the US high-grade market appears to be the buyside's current destination of choice. And the strong levels of demand are helping provide a cushion for spreads, which immediately blew out 10bp in the wake of the Brexit vote to T+164bp.By Wednesday they had narrowed back in to T+162bp, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, even after the week's US$31.4bn supply.That should also help spur new volume, which syndicate desks say will be some US$85bn-$95bn in July.The primary also looks to get a boost from what have been consistently strong technicals.US high-grade funds saw a net outflow of nearly US$639m for the week ended June 29, according to Lipper data, but that was the first time cash has left the asset class since early March.And more foreign buyers are expected in the market after the Brexit vote. Bank of America Merrill Lynch credit strategists said Wednesday was the most active day of foreign buying in June. ""There's no question there was strong demand from outside the US before,"" one investor said.""But since Brexit, investors buying in regions are looking wherever they can find yield. US dollar credit is definitely one place to find it.""TICKING CLOCK The Brexit vote seems to have eradicated worries about a Fed rate hike, with Fed fund futures now pricing in zero chance of a hike this year and just one rate hike in 2017.But issuers sill have some urgency about bringing new deals sooner than later, not least because of the potential volatility as the US presidential election in November draws near.A second syndicate banker said he expected July to be volume heavy ""because there will be a volatile second half of the year with the election and the Fed"".And the typical August slowdown may not take place either, said the investor.""This year may be different than prior years because the first [presidential election] debates start in September,"" the investor said.""This fall we'll be talking about nothing but the election unless someone pulls ahead in the polls.""

279,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes the acquisition of NetSuite,  Inc. (NetSuite) does not affect the ratings for Oracle Corp. (Oracle), including  the 'A+' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'F1' Short-Term IDR. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of  this release. Fitch believes the acquisition of NetSuite strengthens Oracle's cloud-based  enterprise resource planning (ERP) offerings and, as a result, the company's  hybrid-cloud environment solutions for enterprise customers. For NetSuite, the  acquisition by Oracle bolsters investment in engineering and distribution, given  Oracle's significantly greater scale and distribution platform. The $9.3 billion  price tag is significant, given NetSuite's relatively small size and only modest  impact on Fitch's expectations for Oracle's operating results and financial  profile. Revenue for the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended March 31, 2016 was $793 million,  although Fitch expects NetSuite's top line will continue growing near 20%  through the intermediate term, driven by strong product offerings and increasing  customer penetration. Fitch estimates TTM operating EBITDA of $72 million,  although we expect deferred revenue within the context of NetSuite's high  recurring-revenue model should also continue growing by double digits and added  $111 million to cash flow for the TTM. NetSuite's operating EBITDA margin is in  the high single digits, although Fitch anticipates some standalone margin  expansion from top line-driven absorption. While the transaction fits Oracle's strategy to build its as-a-Service (aaS)  capabilities, the NetSuite deal's size exceeds Fitch's previous expectations for  annual acquisitions and roughly equal's Fitch's free cash flow (FCF) forecast.  Oracle has yet to announce proposed funding for the acquisition but Fitch  believes Oracle will have sufficient available cash and domestic FCF, although  this may reduce amounts available for share repurchases for at least the near  term.  The NetSuite deal also may require debt-financing incremental acquisitions, some  of which may not provide sufficient profitability to reduce elevated leverage  metrics within 12-18 months. Fitch continues to expect supplemental adjusted net  leverage (SANL) at or below 1.5x through the forecast period and that negative  rating actions could occur if Fitch expects Oracle to sustain SANL above 2x.  Oracle announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Netsuite, a  cloud-based ERP provider, for $9.3 billion in cash, or $109 per share. Oracle  expects the transaction will close in 2016, subject to customary conditions,  including regulatory approvals and NetSuite's stockholders tendering a majority  of NetSuite's outstanding shares in the tender offer. In addition, closing is  subject to a majority of NetSuite's outstanding shares not owned by NetSuite  officers or directors, or affiliates of Larry Ellison being tendered in the  offer. Fitch currently rates Oracle: --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --Revolving Credit Facility at 'A+'; --Senior Unsecured Debt at 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --CP at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

285,"  Oracle Corp forecast lower-than-expected quarterly profit as growth in its cloud-based business fails to make up for weakness in its traditional software offerings.The company's shares fell nearly 2.7 percent in extended trading on Thursday.Like rivals SAP SE, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, Oracle is making an aggressive shift to the cloud as customers increasingly shun the costlier licensing model.The company in July agreed to buy NetSuite Inc for $9.3 billion to better compete with nimbler rivals such as Workday Inc and Salesforce.com Inc that specialize in cloud-based offerings.Total cloud revenue rose 59 percent to $969 million in the first quarter ended Aug. 31.However, the company's traditional software business, which offers higher margins, continued to suffer. Sales of new software licenses fell 10.5 percent to $1.03 billion. For the second quarter, the company said it expected adjusted earnings of 59 cents to 62 cents per share and revenue growth of up to 3 percent. The company had reported revenue of about $9 billion for the same period a year earlier.Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share and revenue of $9.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said its latest quarter was also weighed down by a strong dollar, which reduced revenue from various businesses by 1 to 3 percent.      Effects of currency movements in the quarter were more than the company's expectations due to the surprise Brexit vote in June, co-Chief Executive Safra Catz said on a conference call.Total revenue edged up 1.7 percent to $8.6 billion. However, it rose 3 percent on a constant currency basis.Oracle's net income rose to $1.83 billion, or 43 cents per share, from $1.75 billion, or 40 cents per share. Excluding items, Oracle earned 55 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $8.7 billion and a profit of 58 cents per share.Oracle's shares closed at $40.86 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen nearly 12 percent this year.
