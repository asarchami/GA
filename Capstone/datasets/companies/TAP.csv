0,"  LONDON Feb 13 SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co reported sharply higher fourth-quarter profit for their U.S. joint venture MillerCoors on Thursday, due in part to lower advertising, pension and employee benefit costs.The company that sells beers such as Miller Lite and Coors Lite in the United States said underlying profit jumped 30 percent to $241.9 million in the fourth quarter. It cited a 12 percent decline in marketing, general and administrative costs due to a shift in timing of advertising spending and employee benefit related expenses. For the full year, profit rose 5.5 percent, while net sales rose 0.5 percent.

14,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Rating  and corresponding issue-level ratings of Molson Coors Brewing Company (Molson  Coors) and its related entities at 'BBB' and 'BBB/F2'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A complete list of rating actions is provided at the end of this  release. Molson Coors had approximately $3.2 billion of total debt at the end of  2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS:  Market Position Molson Coors' ratings are supported by its well-known respected brands and  strong-to-competitive market share positions in primarily large profitable  mature beer markets. Molson Coors brands are some of the most recognizable and  valuable in the world. Molson Coors has the second leading market share in the  U.S. (through its MillerCoors LLC joint venture ) with Coors Light and  Miller Lite, respectively the number 2 and number 4 best-selling brands. In  Canada, Molson Coors has the number 2 and number 3 brands - Coors Light and  Molson Canadian - and the number 1 brand in the U.K., Carling. In Central  Europe, the company has top-three market share positions across the regions  where Molson Coors operates. Molson Coors also has increasing exposure to the faster growing craft beer and  above-premium portfolio in its developed markets. Molson Coors' craft segment,  while still relatively small compared to their overall beer portfolio, is an  important and growing offset to the declines experienced within its premium and  value brands. Demand for mainstream lager beer in the U.S., despite the  continuation of the economic recovery, could remain under pressure as the  millennial generation shifts preferences into spirits and wine. The MillerCoors  above-premium portfolio grew high single digits in 2014 and includes Blue Moon,  the largest craft beer brand in the U.S. Molson Coors' market share gives the firm appropriate scale to better leverage  fixed costs and take advantage of on-going cost efficiencies that provide  substantial flexibility for brand reinvestment to bolster their competitive  position, although profitability is less than peers. Molson Coors remains at a  structural disadvantage in the U.S. relative to the greater scale of Anheuser  Busch InBev NV/SA. The MillerCoors current JV ownership structure limits  additional meaningful synergy opportunities in the areas of procurement, supply  chain, distribution and back office.  Challenging Operating Environment: Molson Coors' ratings further consider the difficult and soft global operating  environment illustrated by slight declines in beer volumes in the company's key  markets of the U.S., Canada and Europe. The volume declines are driven by  competitive pressures including the shift in consumer preferences, lackluster  economic conditions, termination of certain JVs, and weak consumer spending.  Molson Coors' sales to retailers (STRs) of beer in 2014 declined 2.5% and 4.7%  in the U.S. and Canada, respectively. Europe sales volume decreased 0.3% in  2014, as demand and effects from flooding were partially offset by improved  performance in the U.K., as well as several Central European regions. MillerCoors JV Performance Equity income in MillerCoors increased 4.3% to $562 million driven by pricing,  mix and cost reduction. MillerCoors generated cost savings of approximately $143  million along with a 2.8% increase in domestic net revenue per barrel. The cost  savings and price increases helped to offset the volume declines across  MillerCoors' premium light, premium, and value portfolios. This included a low  single-digit decrease in the largest segment in the U.S., premium light, which  is an improvement from the mid-single-digit decline in 2013.  The premium light segment has been negatively affected by unemployment rates for  young, lower income men that have not been reemployed as the economy recovers.  The lack of a long-term recovery for this key demographic segment is leading to  headwinds as GDP, consumer sentiment and unemployment levels return to  normalized levels. Overall, volumes in the U.S. beer industry have declined in  five of the six past years. Growth in top-line revenue will focus on innovation,  above-premium share and repositioned core brands. Good Liquidity, FCF Headwinds for 2015 In addition to $625 million in cash at the end of 2014 that is primarily held  offshore, Molson Coors has a $750 million five-year multicurrency credit  facility that expires in 2019. The credit facility supports the company's $750  million commercial paper (CP) program. Molson Coors did not have any CP  borrowings at year-end. Molson Coors' maturities during the next three years are  CAD900 million unsecured notes due in 2015 and $730 million due in 2017  including CAD500 unsecured notes and $300 million unsecured notes. Fitch expects  Molson Coors to target longer-term cash balances in the range of $250 million to  $300 million. FCF (calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures,  pension contributions and dividends) for 2014 was substantially ahead of Fitch's  expectations of $735 million, driven by several factors including the timing of  working capital payments. FCF expectations for 2015 are for less than $50  million due to pension plan contributions of $260 million-$270 million,  increased capital investment, higher cash taxes, and foreign exchange pressure.  Fitch views Molson Coors longer-term normalized FCF generation to be at least  $350 million. Molson Coors has changed its capital allocation focus by targeting increased  shareholder distributions, since the company has reduced leverage to pre-StarBev  levels. For 2012 and 2013, Molson Coors did not increase the dividend or  repurchase any shares. Since 2013, Molson Coors has increased its annual  dividend by 28% to $1.64 per share which represents a dividend payout of 21% of  2014 underlying EBITDA, within management guidance of 18% to 22%. In 2015,  Molson Coors announced a four-year $1 billion share repurchase program that will  be weighted toward the back half of the period as free cash generation  increases. Improved Credit Metrics, Deleveraging Complete Fitch includes the equity income from MillerCoors within its calculated credit  measures, since Molson Coors has a significant stake in the JV with 42%  ownership and 50% voting control, and cash distributions from MillerCoors are  regular and roughly equal Molson Coors' equity income in any period. For the  year ended 2014, Molson Coors leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA plus  equity income of $562 million) was 2.3x, modestly ahead of 2014 expectations of  2.4x-2.5x. EBITDA-to-interest was 9.2x. This compares to leverage of 3.8x and  EBITDA-to-interest of 6.2x at the end of 2012. Fitch does not expect any further  debt reduction as Molson Coors has reduced total debt by $1.5 billion during the  past two years with leverage within Molson Coors' targeted range.  Funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage improved to 2.5x at the end of  2014 compared with 4.4x in 2012. Given the previously mentioned FCF headwinds  for 2015, Fitch expects FFO adjusted leverage will weaken to the mid-to-high-3x  range by year-end before strengthening to less than 3x in 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Additional key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --FCF of less than $50 million (including pension contribution and dividend) in  2015 due to a material increase in cash taxes, foreign exchange headwinds of  approximately $75 million and expected pension plan contributions of $260  million-$270 million; --The forecast does not assume any further debt reduction; --FFO adjusted leverage will increase to 3.7x (including UK pension  contribution) before decreasing back below 3x in 2016; --Cash levels will reduce over the long term to $250 million-$300 million with  the focus on the PACC model. --EBITDA margins will remain stable at current levels. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Sustained FFO adjusted gross leverage under 3x; --Demonstrated ability to sustain FCF margin above 5%, adjusted for MillerCoors; --FFO margin in the 13% range adjusted for MillerCoors; --EBITDAR margin sustained in the low 20% range adjusted for MillerCoors; --Relatively stable volume and pricing trends for their brands in their largest  markets, the U.S., UK and Canada, driven by key flagship brands with growing  contributions from above-premium brands. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Increased debt and leverage such that FFO adjusted leverage is maintained  above 4x for an extended period; --While not anticipated, pressure could also be placed on the ratings through  sustained material declines in EBITDA due to volume and/or margin contraction; --The inability to offset volume declines with price increases due to heightened  competition;  --A large debt-funded acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in the MillerCoors  joint venture. Fitch views a potential MillerCoors acquisition as event risk; --A change in financial policy that would result in debt-funded shareholder  returns through share repurchases and increased dividends. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Molson Coors Brewing Company (Parent) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F2'; --Bank credit facility rating at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'BBB'.

19,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Lauren Hirsch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A deal between the world's two biggest brewers gives smaller rival Molson Coors Brewing Co a rare chance to bulk up in the United States, provided it can come up with the cash, according to industry bankers and analysts.Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller PLC  agreed on Tuesday to create a company making almost a third of the world's beer, bringing together such brands as AB InBev's Budweiser and Corona with SABMiller's Peroni and Grolsch.To win over regulators, the combination would almost certainly have to exit from SABMiller's U.S. business, which it operates through a joint venture with Molson Coors.Molson Coors is widely expected to make a bid for SABMiller's 58 percent stake in their jointly owned MillerCoors, known for such brands as Coors Light, Miller Lite and Blue Moon. Their venture agreement gives Molson Coors the right to name new  management in a the event of a change in control and the right to make the first and last bid for the remaining stake, both of which could deter other potential bidders.Full ownership of the joint venture would give Molson an opportunity to cut costs by streamlining back office functions such as legal and finance,  as well as build scale procurement and supply chain, analysts say. Taking over SABMiller's stake would give Molson a U.S. market share of close to 28 percent, based on 2014 data from Euromonitor International. Nomura analysts predicted a 28 percent increase in Miller Coors earnings per share.Assuming the SABMiller acquisition gets done, Molson Coors is the ""ultimate buyer"" of the U.S. operations, said Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck. He estimates SABMiller's 58 percent stake would cost Molson Coors $9 billion to $10 billion, based on the valuation model of about 9 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). AB InBev used it when it sold off Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business. Other analysts and industry bankers have said the MillerCoors stake could be worth anywhere from $8 billion to $11 billion.The catch, however, is that Molson's own market capitalization was about $16 billion as of Tuesday, and the company had $3.1 billion in debt on its balance sheet as of June 30, raising questions over how it could fund a deal.One option is leverage, with Molson Coors using the free cash flow from MillerCoors to pay down debt quickly. Molson  Coors could partner with another entity to buy SABMiller's stake, or use a rights issue to finance it, industry bankers said. Molson Coors shares rose 10 percent to $86.58 on Tuesday after AB InBev and SABMiller announced their deal, showing that investors are supportive of the company making a bigger bet on MillerCoors, they said. ""You could lever up the entire enterprise to slot in the extra 58 percent,"" Fleck said.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.The Times- The Insolvency Service is targeting businesses that fail to follow proper procedure when making staff redundant during an administration, marking a serious development for company directors. The government body has begun criminal proceedings against three directors at City Link, the courier company that collapsed last Christmas Day, and the chief executive of Sports Direct International PLC over the failure of its fashion retailer USC in January. (thetim.es/1NI31Qq)- Hundreds of workers at HSBC Holdings PLC's  investment banking division in London have had their pay cut by 10 percent and been ordered to take two weeks of unpaid leave by the end of the year. The bank, which is under intense pressure to reduce costs, broke the news to staff last week and instructed managers that there would be ""0 percent exceptions"". (thetim.es/1PtZFQp)The Guardian - The latest official snapshot of the jobs market, covering June to August, showed a 79,000 decline in unemployment to 1.77 million, taking the jobless rate to 5.4 percent, the lowest since 2008. The employment rate, at 73.6 percent, was the highest since records began in 1971. (bit.ly/1Luyh3a)The Telegraph - EDF and its Chinese partners are on the brink of a deal to build the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant and are preparing to sign a heads of terms agreement during next week's visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping. Although the deal is not yet done, with negotiations expected to go to the wire, sources say they are optimistic they will be ready to unveil a major pact that will make clear the first new United Kingdom nuclear plant in a generation will go ahead. (bit.ly/1QukYj8)- Anheuser-Busch InBev SA is exploring a potential exit from SABMiller PLC's American joint venture in a deal that could be worth $10 billion.

Molson Coors said on Thursday it is focusing on selling more craft-style brews, a fast-growing market, and higher-priced beers.Consumers in Europe and the United States are increasingly preferring craft brews made by independent players, pushing major beer makers to buy or invest in craft brews.Molson Coors also named David Heede, chief financial officer of its Europe business, as its interim CFO, effective Nov. 16. Heede succeeds Gavin Hattersley, who was named chief executive of MillerCoors in September.The net profit attributable to Molson Coors was $16.6 million, or 9 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a net loss of $34.4 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.    Net sales fell 13 percent to $1.02 billion, as a strong dollar reduced the value of its sales. Net sales have risen only once in the last nine quarters.

The combination would almost certainly have to exit from SABMiller's U.S. business to win regulatory approval, analysts have said.Molson Coors has the right to name new management in the event of a change in control and the right to make the first and last bid for the remaining stake in MillerCoors, both of which could deter potential bidders.Molson Coors said on Thursday it is focusing on selling more craft-style brews, a fast-growing market, and higher-priced beers. Consumers in Europe and the United States are increasingly preferring craft brews made by independent players, pushing major beer makers to buy or invest in craft brews.Molson Coors also named David Heede, chief financial officer of its Europe business, as its interim CFO, effective Nov. 16.Heede succeeds Gavin Hattersley, who was named chief executive of MillerCoors in September. The net profit attributable to Molson Coors was $16.6 million, or 9 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a net loss of $34.4 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.Net sales fell 13 percent to $1.02 billion, as a strong dollar reduced the value of its sales.

33,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed Molson Coors Brewing  Company's (Molson Coors) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior  unsecured ratings at all Molson Coors entities on Rating Watch Negative. The  rating actions follows the announcement by Molson Coors that it has entered into  a definitive agreement with Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) to purchase  SABMiller plc's (SABMiller) 58% stake in MillerCoors for $12 billion.  The agreement also includes the ownership of the Miller Brand Family globally,  an estimated $2.4 billion present value of cash tax benefits, and perpetual,  royalty-free U.S. rights to all imported and licensed brands including Peroni,  Pilsner Urquell, Foster's and Redd's. Transaction value is approximately 11.5x  pro forma 2014 EBITDA of the combined 58% stake in MillerCoors ($965 million)  and the Miller global business ($70 million) without consideration for expected  tax benefits and cost synergies.  Molson Coors will finance the deal with a combination of existing cash, new debt  (75%-80% of transaction value) and new equity (20%-25%). The transaction is  conditioned upon the closing of AB InBev's acquisition of SABMiller and  necessary regulatory approvals that is expected to occur in the second half of  2016.  Fitch currently rates Molson Coors long-term IDR 'BBB'. As of Sept. 30, 2015,  Moslon Coors had $3 billion of debt outstanding. A full list of ratings is shown  below. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Increase in Leverage The Rating Watch Negative reflects the projected significant increase in Molson  Coors' financial leverage. On a pro forma basis, Fitch expects pro forma  leverage (toal debt to EBITDA) in the low-to-mid 5x range at the time of  transaction closing. This compares to expectations for Molson Coors leverage of  2.4x (total debt-to-operating EBITDA plus LTM equity income) for 2015. Based on preliminary projections, Fitch expects Molson Coors leverage to improve  to the low-4x range within 24 months post transaction close, due largely to the  expected debt repayment from the signficant FCF generation that will continue to  benefit from on-going cost reductions. Given the significant increase in  leverage, Molson Coors plans to discontinue share repurchases, maintain the  current dividend per share level and suspend its dividend payout target of  18-22% in order to focus on debt reduction.  Upon completion of the transaction, the potential exists for a downgrade of up  to two notches for the ratings of Molson Coors. The final ratings will depend on  actual debt/equity financing mix, pro forma leverage at close, volume and  pricing trends for Molson Coors flagship brands in their largest markets (U.S.,  UK and Canada), macroeconomic outlook within key geographic regions, and the  degree of visibility for a sustainable de-leveraging path using cash flow during  the first two years post-completion. Molson Coors has a good track record of meeting deleveraging expectations  following signficant acquisitions. The deleveraging following the 2012 StarBev  transaction was ahead of Fitch's expectations, thus demonstrating a strong  commitment for a disciplined financial policy. The lower excution risk of this  transaction, familiarity with the MillerCoors joint venture and the good history  on executing cost savings initiatives at both MillerCoors and Molson Coors  should benefit cash generation.  Material Strategic Benefits Up to now, the MillerCoors joint venture ownership structure has limited further  meaningful synergy opportunities between MillerCoors and Molson Coors in the  areas of procurement, supply chain, shared services, distribution and back  office. This has resulted in lower profitability relative to its larger peers  with the only clear path for significant synergy opportunity through full  ownership. Molson Coors' base case projection expects $200 million in annualized  synergies delivered by the fourth year in addition to the cost savings expected  within the enbedded business thus increasing Molson Coors' ability to reinvest  behind the core brands. Over $1.3 billion of annualized cost savings have been  delivered since the formation of Molson Coors in 2005 which includes 42% of  MillerCoors annualized cost savings.  The transaction provides material strategic benefits including improved market  position, increased scale to drive better efficiencies, expanded global reach  and full ownership control of the U.S. business. Molson Coors' presence in the  U.S market will grow to roughly two thirds of total revenue which should dampen  the negative effects from foreign exhange headwinds. According to the company,  Molson Coors will be the number two brewer in the U.S. with approximately 27%  total market share including the number 2 and 4 brands. However, Molson Coors has experienced declines with beer volumes in the  company's key developed markets of the U.S., Canada and Europe. The past volume  declines in the low single-digit range are driven by competitive pressures  including the shift in consumer preferences, lackluster economic conditions,  termination of certain JVs, and weak consumer spending. The demand for  mainstream lager beer in the U.S., despite the economic recovery, has been  negatively affected by unemployment rates for young, lower income men and as the  millennial generation shifts preferences into spirits, wine and craft beers.  MillerCoors' Tenth and Blake above-premium portfolio provides an important  growth offset to the structural declines within the economy segment. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's current key assumptions assuming that the deal closes in the second half  of 2016: --Combined 2015 pro forma revenue of $11.5 billion and EBITDA of $2.4 billion.  --Pro forma leverage at acqusition close in the low-to-mid 5x range assuming  mainly a debt financed deal (75-80%). This compares to approximately 2.4x for  Molson Coors estimated leverage at the end of 2015. --Leverage to improve to the low-4x range within 24 months post the closing of  the transaction, due primarily to expected debt repayment from the signficant  FCF generation that will continue to benefit from on-going cost reductions. --Molson Coors would discontinue share repurchases, maintain the current  dividend per share level and suspend its current dividend payout target for at  least 24 months following transaction close in order to focus on debt reduction. Fitch's key assumptions for Molson Coors on a standalone basis in 2016: --Revenue growth at 2.5% and EBITDA margins remain stable at current levels in  the 19-20% range. --FCF of at least $275 million (calculated as cash flow from operations  less capital expenditures, pension contributions and dividends). --Leverage of approximately 2.4x (total debt-to-operating EBITDA plus LTM equity  income), assuming no further debt reduction. --Cash levels will reduce over the long term to $250 million-$300 million with  the focus on the PACC model. RATING SENSITIVITIES Upon completion of the transaction, the potential exists for a downgrade of up  to two notches for the ratings of Molson Coors. The final ratings will depend on  actual debt/equity financing mix, pro forma leverage at close, volume and  pricing trends for Molson Coors flagship brands in their largest markets (U.S.,  UK and Canada), macroeconomic outlook within key geographic regions, and the  degree of visibility for a sustainable de-leveraging path using cash flow during  the first two years post-completion. A positive rating action is currently not expected. If the transaction does not  proceed, this will likely translate into Molson Coors ratings being affirmed. LIQUIDITY - for Molson Coors on a Standalone Basis At Sept. 30, 2015, liquidity was $1.1 billion, comprised of $393 million in cash  and $740 million availability on the $750 million revolver that matures in 2019.  The credit facility supports the company's $750 million commercial paper (CP)  program that had $10 million outstanding at the end of the third quarter 2015.  Molson Coors' maturities during the next two years are $730 million due in 2017  including CAD500 unsecured notes and $300 million unsecured notes. Fitch expects  Molson Coors to target longer-term cash balances in the range of $250 million to  $300 million. Fitch expects FCF for 2015 (calculated as CFFO less capital expenditures,  pension contributions and dividends) to be approximately $40 million. In 2016,  Fitch expects FCF of at least $275 million.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has placed the following ratings for Molson Coors on Rating Watch  Negative: Molson Coors Brewing Company (Parent) --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper rating 'F2'; --Bank credit facility rating 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt rating 'BBB'.

""I hope the increase is giving everyone room to breathe.""The United States and Germany are the world's top growers of  hops.In 2015, sales volume of U.S. craft beer rose 12.8 percent domestically and 16.3 percent for exports, while overall U.S. beer sales eased 0.2 percent, according to Brewers Association in Boulder, Colorado.Small brewers have feared a hops shortage after adverse weather blighted last summer's European harvest. Lager producers such as Anheuser-Busch InBev also use hops, but in smaller amounts. Craft beer premiums cover rising hops prices, but Li Yu said finding enough supplies has been the biggest challenge.MillerCoors, owned by SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co, has absorbed higher hops costs for some beers, like Blue Moon, said Warren Quilliam, senior director of brewing, malting and materials. But those costs are offset by low aluminum and fuel prices, and long-term contracts smooth out highs and lows, he said.It is likely that small breweries, who buy hops on the spot market, are paying the highest prices, said Viv Jones, brewmaster at Saskatchewan-based Great Western Brewing Company. The company has hops supplies secured for the next three harvests at price increases in line with inflation. U.S. average prices have climbed four straight years, hitting a record $4.38 per pound last year, up 19 percent, according to USDA. The U.S. vine-growing crop, which produces small green cones, is mainly grown in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.While U.S. farmers have fretted about sagging incomes, Idaho hop grower Nate Jackson is enjoying the high prices.He bought a 60-acre hop farm in 2008 and has expanded plantings tenfold. ""(I'm) definitely lucky,"" Jackson said. ""I'm not sure anybody saw that (price hike) coming.""  Even so, hops farming is an expensive business, and prone to busts due to over-supply, said Tom Marsh, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at Washington State University.  Unlike hops, malting barley prices are flat this year, due to ample global supplies, according to Rod Green, a malt barley broker at Central Ag Marketing in Alberta.

40,"   By Ben Hirschler and Martinne Geller | LONDON, June 24  LONDON, June 24 Shocked chief executives from Mumbai to Denver woke up on Friday to face tough decisions over how to respond to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.In Britain itself, businesses as diverse as engineering group Rolls-Royce, drugs giant AstraZeneca,  housebuilders and makers of Scotch whisky were braced for disruption in the short and long term as the pound plunged to its lowest level since 1985.Big business -- with a very few exceptions -- has been strongly in favour of remaining in the world's biggest trading bloc, primarily because of ease of access to 500 million European consumers.""The weeks and months ahead are going to be a nervy time for business leaders,"" Simon Walker, director general of British business lobby the Institute of Directors, said on Friday.Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's biggest carmaker, has estimated its annual profit could shrink by 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) by 2020 if Britain returns to World Trade Organization rules for trade with Europe.Shares in the company's owner, India's Tata Motors , slumped more than 10 percent.Makers of Scotch whisky, who export about 90 percent of what they produce, have stressed the importance of the EU, which swallows about a third of those exports, but also the clout EU membership gives in negotiations with fast-growing markets such as India, which has a 150 percent tariff on imported spirits.Some investors warned of a coming British or even global recession as sterling collapsed to hit its lowest since 1985, while FTSE futures fell 8 percent. The president of Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal , the world's second-largest steelmaker, said the vote was extremely disappointing. ""We are greatly concerned for the negative impact this will have, not only on Britain and the EU but also on the global economy,"" said Kosei Shindo.Martin Sorrell, the boss of the world's biggest advertising group WPP, said: ""This decision will create tremendous uncertainty, which will slow economic activity and decision making.""STERLING HEADACHE Big swings in sterling will be a headache for some international companies, with a fall in the currency hitting profits earned in Britain. International companies with sizeable sterling exposure include Denver-based Molson Coors, owner of Carling beer, which is heavily reliant on the UK.Aside from market access, streamlining of regulations within the EU has made life simpler.Pharmaceutical companies, for example, enjoy a one-stop shop in the form of the European Medicines Agency -- based in London - which approves new drugs for all EU countries, while the EU's open airspace deals have fostered a surge in air travel and common policies on agriculture and food safety have allowed for smoother supply chains and richer eating.Companies in those sectors have fretted that Britain outside the bloc would disrupt the regulatory landscape. ""This creates immediate challenges for future investment, research and jobs in our industry in the UK,"" said Mike Thompson, CEO of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.AstraZeneca said it was concerned for the competitiveness of the British life sciences industry and would work to ensure patient access to medicines, amid worries that leaving the EU could delay drug approvals.Access to workers is another important factor for companies. Automotive industry executives, who are heavily reliant on exports, ranked tapping a skilled workforce a close second to accessing EU markets in a survey on reasons to remain in March.Ahead of the vote, some British-based multinationals such as Diageo, Unilever and Rolls-Royce had expressed their support for ""Remain"" directly to employees, although most stopped short of this.Government figures show 12.6 percent of Britain's economic output is linked to exports to the EU's 27 other members, for whom only 3.1 percent of output is linked to exports to Britain. And 80 percent of British businesses trading overseas do so with the EU.The Confederation of British Industry has estimated there could be between 550,000 and 950,000 fewer jobs by 2020 in the event of Brexit.For banks, a huge concern has been the threat that financial institutions based in London could lose their EU ""passports"", or the automatic right to sell services across the bloc under single low-cost system. That has made bank shares particularly volatile in the run-up to the referendum.Brexit uncertainty has also helped push British merger and acquisition activity this year at its lowest as a proportion of global activity since records began in 1980.

45,"   By Abhinav Ramnarayan, Mariana Ionova and Laura Benitez  LONDON, June 29 (IFR) - The European bond market cranked back into action on Wednesday, putting an end to almost a week of no supply as issuers made the most of the better tone to raise new financing.New issues from public sector, corporate and ABS borrowers have been met with an enthusiastic response from investors even though volatility remains high after the UK voted to leave the EU in last week's referendum.Financial issuers are notable in their absence however, with bankers saying it was too early for a reopening.The German state of Hessen found just short of 1.3bn of demand for a 875m trade, the biggest of the day, that was initially meant to be a 250m tap of its July 2026 bonds.As a result, lead managers Deka, Deutsche Bank, DZ, Helaba and UniCredit tightened pricing from the less 5bp area IPTs for less 7bp""That's one of the biggest books we've seen for a deal of this kind,"" said one SSA banker away from the deal. ""It helps that there's no other paper out there and there would be a huge domestic bid, but it also does show that Brexit wasn't a Lehman Brothers moment or like the sovereign debt crisis [of 2011].""US-based Molson Coors, which sold a US$5.3bn four-part bond and a two-part C$1bn trade on Tuesday, began marketing an eight-year euro benchmark at mid-swaps plus 145bp area IPTs. It was tightened to mid-swaps plus 115-120bp.""A lot of the volatility is UK-specific so Molson is largely isolated from this, and while there is a global impact, spreads on comparable credits such as Mondelez and Heineken haven't been too badly impacted,"" a banker said. Heineken Dec 2024s were bid at 55bp over mid-swaps, from plus 51bp at Thursday's close before the referendum results were known.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (B&D), Citigroup and UBS are leads. Molson Coors is rated Baa3/BBB- by Moody's and S&P.ECB LENDS HELPING HAND  Mercedes-Benz Bank is also in the market for about a 1bn German auto loans trade on Wednesday, reopening the ABS market just three days after the vote.The German group's Silver Arrow Compartment 7 is expected to price the bond by the end of the week.The price talk on the deal was in line with the ultra-tight levels seen in the asset class before the Brexit vote, which were driven by a fierce bid for paper from both real-money euro buyers and the ECB.The central bank is expected to buy the Silver Arrow deal, which is eligible for its asset-backed securities purchase programme, sources said. Societe Generale is sole arranger and joint lead together with UniCredit. Co-managers are BNP Paribas, DZ Bank and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.TOO EARLY FOR FIG The reopening of the public sector and corporate markets were not quite enough to cheer FIG bankers, however, who are still waiting to see a primary trade from a financial institution.""There is demand for bonds in secondary but we've have had quite a bit of a repricing and that always tends to cause a stalemate until we either see a retracement or issuers adjust to new levels. I don't think we will get anything this week. I would say next week is the earliest and it will be a safe trade from a jurisdiction not hit by market jitters,"" said a FIG syndicate banker.UK and peripheral banks have been the hardest hit by the UK referendum though they have staged a recovery as markets have stabilised.Indices have also retraced some of their lost ground. The Senior Financial index is almost 10bp tighter than Tuesday while the Subordinated Financial has tightened by 17bp.""We need to see stock prices recover, a lot of bank stocks have been totally smoked which makes it tricky. The problem is that we've wondered back into an environment where we are at the mercy of the political space and that's when everything gets super messy,"" said a second FIG syndicate banker.Financial issuers have not issued anything since June 15, the slowest pace of issuance in 2016 according to IFR data.

49,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Foreign exchange volatility and economic uncertainty after Britain's vote to leave the European Union have imperiled a projected profit rebound in the United States, where companies have been stuck in an earnings recession since last year.U.S. companies doing business abroad are at particular risk because of a jump in the dollar since last week's referendum and expectations of a potential stumble in European economies.A strong dollar and plummeting oil prices slammed U.S. corporate earnings starting in 2015, but the stabilization of crude prices and the dollar in recent months has led investors to bet on a return to modest growth starting in the third quarter.As the second-quarter reports gets underway in the coming weeks, executives' comments about the so-called Brexit's potential effects could alter Wall Street's expectations of when the profit slump will end.""This adds more fuel to the fire, that the so-called spurt in growth in the second-half of the year is going to be really tough to achieve,"" said Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who believes analysts are too optimistic.This week, the average estimate for S&P 500 company third-quarter earnings edged down to 2.2 percent growth from 2.4 percent growth the day before the vote, according to Thomson Reuters data. That could slip further as second-quarter reports get under way, which has been the case in recent history. Second-quarter earnings are forecast to decline 3.9 percent from a year ago.Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Citigroup (C.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) will be among the earliest U.S. heavyweights to post second-quarter results, all reporting in mid-July. Some U.S. companies are already voicing caution about Brexit.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corp (CCL.N) warned in its quarterly report on Tuesday that Britain's withdrawal from the European Union could affect global consumer confidence.Chief Financial Officer David Bernstein estimated on a conference call that weakness in the pound and euro would have an eight-cent impact on Carnival's full-year earnings per share, although he said higher customer demand would make up for that and he did not reduce his outlook.BACK TO A RECORD? NOT SO FAST  While Carnival and other multinationals rely heavily on Europe, including Molson Coors Brewing (TAP.N), which depends on Britain for a third of its sales, the exposure of most U.S. companies is limited.S&P 500 corporations overall depend on Europe for 8 percent of their revenue, with just 1.9 percent of revenue flowing from Britain, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  And while some economists warn of a European recession, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi told EU leaders on Tuesday that Britain's decision to leave the bloc could reduce euro zone growth by as much as 0.5 percent over the next three years. Earlier this month, the ECB said the euro zone would grow 1.6 percent in 2016 and 1.7 percent in 2017 and 2018. For investors hoping improved profits would help push stock prices to record highs for the first time in 2016, Brexit has muddied the picture. The S&P 500 fell 5 percent following the vote, but has since regained most of that loss. It now trades at 16.6 times expected earnings, above its long-term average of about 15, according to Thomson Reuters data. The recent slump in the euro and other currencies will affect companies dependent on foreign sales.A U.S. dollar index .DXY is up 2.6 percent since Thursday's close, although it remains down 2.7 percent for the year so far.""That's really the factor that we have to watch,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co.Helped by higher crude prices, earnings in the energy sector on average are seen falling 78 percent in the second quarter and then 54 percent in the following quarter.
