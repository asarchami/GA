7,"  * Brands looking to improve speed, flexibility of sourcing* Puma will not abandon Cambodia, Bangladesh despite problems* Adidas, H&M also looking to diversify sourcing* Technology like 3D printing may make Puma less driven by labour costsBy Emma ThomassonHERZOGENAURACH, Germany, Feb 20 German sportswear firm Puma SE is looking to produce more goods closer to customers in Europe and the Americas, but will not abandon Asia in the next few years despite rising labour costs and political unrest, its chief executive said.Puma, which has 178 suppliers in 32 countries, sources 79 percent of its goods from Asia, mostly from China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia - the latter where a violent crackdown on garment workers striking over pay has disrupted production at its suppliers.CEO Bjoern Gulden expressed frustration that industry lead times are so long, with ranges being designed now only going on sale in autumn 2015.Puma is looking into producing more goods closer to consumers to be more responsive to demand, including in Turkey and eastern Europe, and in Mexico to serve the Americas, he said, without giving further details. Over 70 percent of the firm's sales were in Europe and the Americas last year. But the chief executive said his first priority was to revamp Puma's products before overhauling its supply chain.""Everybody is looking at how to improve the speed and flexibility of sourcing but for the next three to four years the majority will come out of Asia because of the infrastructure,"" Gulden told Reuters on Thursday after Puma's annual news conference.""Yes, there are issues in Cambodia and Bangladesh but to run away from it and pull out of the country cannot be the answer,"" he said. ""You can't say this is a very poor country and so we shouldn't go there. It's the opposite.""Rising labour costs in China in recent years have prompted brand to seeks lower-cost markets in Asia such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia, countries where demands are now mounting for better pay.A factory collapse in Bangladesh last year that killed more than 1,100 people has put pressure on big brands to improve working conditions for those making products for the West. Election-related violence there earlier this year also disrupted the garment sector.3D PRINTING Puma, which ranks a distant third in the sports apparel industry in terms of sales behind Nike Inc and Adidas AG , reported that sales slumped in the last quarter of 2014. Adidas has set up a ""Speedfactory"" team to look into setting up mini plants closer to consumers, the Handelsblatt daily reported on Thursday.Hennes & Mauritz, the world's second biggest fashion chain which sources most of its clothes from Asia, said last month it is considering producing more goods in Africa.Gulden, a 48-year-old who joined Puma last July from Danish jewellery company Pandora, started his career at Adidas, working in apparel design and sourcing, spending months visiting factories in Asia.""The factories we work in are clean, nice. They cannot be compared to what we saw in Asia 20 years ago,"" he said.""In this industry we all go to the same places because we are dependent on the infrastructure ... We all have the same interests. We don't want to be dependent on one or two countries.""Rather than shifting production to Africa to take advantage of lower labour costs, Gulden expects the future to be driven by innovative technology such as 3D printing, which the company is already using for prototype shoes.""Technology is changing so we are more independent of labour,"" he said, adding that many of the latest soccer boots no longer need stitching.(Editing by Pravin Char)",2014-02-20,NKE,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 11:27am EST",INTERVIEW-Puma seeks to source goods closer to Western consumers,http://www.reuters.com//article/puma-sourcing-idUSL6N0LP33P20140220?type=companyNews

10,"  * Adidas and Nike step up marketing campaigns ahead of World Cup* Two companies dominate $5 billion plus soccer kit market* ""Knitted"" boots, lightweight shirts to tempt fansBy Keith Weir and Emma ThomassonLONDON/BERLIN, March 10 With the soccer World Cup only three months away, Adidas and Nike  are squaring up for a marketing battle to match the fierce on-field rivalry of nations like Brazil and Argentina.The sportswear giants dominate a soccer kit industry worth more than $5 billion annually. They vie for the title of market leader in the supply of hi-tech boots and jerseys to fans inspired by Argentine Lionel Messi, who wears Adidas, or new Brazilian idol Neymar, who is in the Nike camp.A bootmaker since the 1950s and a World Cup sponsor, Germany's Adidas regards soccer as its territory and wants to avoid being overtaken by younger but larger American rival Nike, as has happened in other sports.""Forget all you may have heard or written about a weak Adidas performance in football in 2013. We are leading this category that is so close to the Adidas DNA,"" Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said last week.""2014 is a football year and it will be an Adidas football year,"" he added, targeting record annual soccer-related sales of 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion).However, Hainer conceded that competition is fierce, with the top two brands sharing upwards of 80 percent of the market for many soccer products.Nike has built its business swiftly, having got heavily involved in soccer only 20 years ago when the World Cup was played in the United States. It generates revenues of $2 billion from the sport and calls itself the leading soccer brand.It will provide kit for hosts Brazil and a total of 10 of the 32 finalists this year - outscoring Adidas and Puma  in that regard. Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said sales should get an extra boost from the fact the World Cup is in Brazil, the spiritual home of stylish soccer.""We couldn't be more excited about the World Cup being in Brazil. It will resonate around the world,"" he told Reuters.KNITTED BOOTS, BAREFOOT FEEL Held every four years, the World Cup is a showcase for innovation in design of boots which the manufacturers claims will give players the edge in the big matches and hopefully go on to be big sellers throughout the rest of the year.""With replica kits, you will suddenly see an uptick in terms of sales during a tournament but with boots it's more continual,"" said Nike's Edwards.Nike last week launched its new Magista boot, based on the company's Flyknit technology in which the upper is made from knitted synthetic strands of material. The technology has been used for Nike's running and basketball shoes and the aim is to create a lightweight product which is also durable. Spanish international Andres Iniesta and German Mario Goetze were involved in developing the boot and Edwards said players wanted a ""barefoot with studs"" feel.Park players who want to emulate their World Cup heroes will have to dig deep into their wallets as the boot will cost $275.There are only so many ways a soccer boot can be remade and new products from Adidas and Puma draw on technologies and ideas that don't appear to differ radically from what Nike is doing.Adidas has already launched colourful ""Samba"" versions of its four main boots and will present its first ""knitted"" boot in mid-March. Hainer said the technology had the potential to revolutionise how and where Adidas produces shoes.Puma, based in the same small southern German town as Adidas, wants the World Cup to underline a shift back to performance sports and away from fashion.To that end, it has already launched a snug-fitting bright orange ""evoPOWER"" boot with yellow laces offset to one side. ""It inspired by barefoot beach soccer in Brazil,"" Torsten Hochstetter, Puma global creative director, told Reuters.THE BALL THAT TWEETS Technology is also being used in shirt design.Adidas says its World Cup shirts are 50 percent lighter than previous ones. Eight teams will wear Adidas at the tournament in June, including world champions Spain, Germany and Argentina.Puma launched shirts last week for the eight sides it is outfitting at the World Cup, including Italy, Switzerland and four teams from Africa. The tight-fitting jerseys feature built-in tapes designed to stimulate players' muscles.""This is based on taping used by physios to provide compression and stimulation,"" Hochstetter said.Just like team coaches, the big brands are deploying a variety of tactics to try to gain an advantage.Nike used a Brazil friendly match against South Africa last week to model two kits, playing in the traditional yellow in the first half before switching to a new blue outfit for the second half.Adidas has stressed the importance of social media to its marketing campaigns.In a sign of the times, its Brazuca official World Cup match ball has its own Twitter account offering its thoughts in English and Portuguese. Unlikely as it sounds, the ball already has over 100,000 followers.",2014-03-10,NKE,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 9:46am EDT",Adidas and Nike battle for soccer supremacy in World Cup year,http://www.reuters.com//article/soccer-world-cup-kit-idUSL6N0M41JN20140310?type=companyNews
11,"  * ANTA records third straight quarter of order growth* Xtep, Peak Sport see improved order figures* Nike distributor Belle books rising growth in same-store sales* 361 Degrees, Li Ning to announce earnings this weekHONG KONG, March 17 China's sportswear makers appear to be emerging from years of overzealous expansion fuelled by Beijing Olympic Games fever, after the country's biggest player demonstrated sustained recovery with its third straight quarter of order growth.ANTA Sports Products Ltd and smaller rivals such as Xtep International Holdings Ltd and Peak Sport Products Co Ltd were caught out after the 2008 games when demand fell far short of expectations. Massive inventories and the cost of maintaining a sprawling outlet network outlet soon ate into margins.Foreign competitors including Nike Inc and adidas AG  also took a knock from an ensuing war of price discounts, in a market widely regarded as a growth engine while demand is sluggish in Europe and the United States. Sportswear makers have since been clearing stocks and closing stores. ANTA - the biggest by market value at $4 billion - finally offered a sign of industry recovery last month by booking a high single-digit percentage growth in orders for third-quarter delivery.""The sportswear sector is back on a growth track and ANTA is the leader of the trend. Positive order growth for ANTA will likely be sustained in the next few years,"" said Hong Kong-based UBS analyst Spencer Leung.At Xtep, third-quarter orders fell on year by a low single-digit percent, but the rate of decline has narrowed over the past year.

13,"  * ANTA records third straight quarter of order growth* Xtep, Peak, 361 Degrees see improved order figures* Nike distributor Belle books rising growth in same-store sales* Li Ning to announce earnings this week   (Adds share movement)By Donny KwokHONG KONG, March 17 China's sportswear makers appear to be emerging from years of overzealous expansion fuelled by Beijing Olympic Games fever, after the country's biggest player demonstrated sustained recovery with its third straight quarter of order growth.ANTA Sports Products Ltd and smaller rivals such as Xtep International Holdings Ltd and Peak Sport Products Co Ltd were caught out after the 2008 games when demand fell far short of expectations. Massive inventories and the cost of maintaining a sprawling outlet network outlet soon ate into margins.Foreign competitors including Nike Inc and adidas AG  also took a knock from an ensuing war of price discounts, in a market widely regarded as a growth engine while demand is sluggish in Europe and the United States.Sportswear makers have since been clearing stocks and closing stores. ANTA - the biggest by market value at $4 billion - finally offered a sign of industry recovery last month by booking a high single-digit percentage growth in orders for third-quarter delivery. ""The sportswear sector is back on a growth track and ANTA is the leader of the trend. Positive order growth for ANTA will likely be sustained in the next few years,"" said Hong Kong-based UBS analyst Spencer Leung.At both Xtep and 361 Degrees International Ltd, third-quarter orders fell on year by a single-digit percent, but the rate of decline has narrowed over the past year.Peak even booked percentage growth in the mid-teens, saying orders for delivery in the first to third quarters pointed to overall recovery.""With substantial clearance of inventory, leaner sales networks, stricter cost control measures and a prudent approach in placing and accepting orders, the stronger sportswear manufacturers are now in better shape,"" 361 Degrees Chairman Ding Huihuang said in an earnings statement on Monday.The chairmen of both Xtep and Peak expressed similar turnaround sentiment, though both saw net profit fall 20 percent last year as a result of operational reorganisation. At 361 Degrees, the profit decline was 70 percent ""Even though we see the inventory issue has been taken care of, the industry is still not yet in a stage that we see solid organic growth. It may take a while,"" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at Hong Kong-based First Shanghai Securities.Shares of 361 Degrees closed down 1 percent on Monday after the company announced earnings which missed analyst estimates. Xtep and Peak ended higher last Wednesday after reporting figures in line with forecasts.GRADUAL SALES GROWTH  China's biggest distributor Belle International Holdings , which sells sportswear from Nike, adidas and Puma SE , offered further indication of the industry gradually getting back on its feet.Last week, Belle said same-store sportswear sales grew 7.0 percent for the three months to February compared with the same period a year earlier.

Nike has been spending heavily on marketing ahead of the World Cup, which Brazil will host this summer.Total revenue rose 12.7 percent to $6.97 billion for the quarter ended Feb. 28, above the $6.69 billion analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.In China, where Nike has grappled with the lingering effects of excess inventory and intense competition from rivals cutting prices in recent years, sales rose 7 percent.""They continue to produce items that resonate with shoppers globally,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. ""They're gaining share in each of their markets."" Still, the poor forecasts for China were worrisome, Yarbrough said.Nike earned $685 million, or 76 cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28, compared to $866 million, or 73 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, Nike had a profit of 76 cents per share for the quarter, four cents better than Wall Street had expected.

26,"  * Targets 9 percent more stores in 2014* Growing retail business helps keep margins above Nike* Young shoppers look for social, digital experience* Sports-inspired fashion is increasingly competitiveBy Emma ThomassonBERLIN, March 27 Adidas has launched a new store blueprint for its Originals fashion brand with a Wi-Fi equipped lounge and mobile charging points, aiming to persuade younger shoppers to linger longer and spend more in its high-margin, own-run outlets.The world's No.2 sportswear maker behind Nike wants to lift sales from its own shops, which accounted for 24 percent of its 2013 revenue of 14.5 billion euros ($20 billion), because they are more profitable than those made through third parties.The revamped Originals store in the heart of Berlin is part of a drive to encourage 16-24 year-olds to browse longer. ""Shopping for this generation is very social. They need to have a place to hang out. The longer the consumer stays in the store, the more likely they are to buy,"" Ted Mager, Adidas global head of retail environments, told Reuters.The shift from wholesale to retail helped boost the German firm's gross margin by 1.5 percentage points to 49.3 percent in 2013 compared with 43.6 percent for Nike, which makes less than a fifth of sales from its own stores and online.Adidas plans to open a net 250 stores in 2014, primarily in eastern Europe, even though its already high exposure to Russia - where it operates over 1,000 stores - has hurt its share price in recent weeks due to the Ukraine crisis.It added a net 294 stores in 2013 to bring the total to 2,740, including about 250 stores under the Originals brand, but not counting some 7,500 Adidas franchises operated in China. DESIGNER HIGH-HEEL SNEAKERS In addition to a Wi-Fi lounge near the fitting rooms and a ""digital bar"" for charging devices, the revamped store seeks to reflect the Berlin urban vibe by stripping back decor to raw concrete and brick and exposing lighting, while underwear is displayed in an eye-catching vending machine.The new Berlin format gives more prominence to footwear, including high-heel sneakers designed by Moschino creative director Jeremy Scott and multicolour variants of the recently-relaunched classic white-and-green ""Stan Smith"" tennis shoes. Previously a male-oriented brand, the store seeks to more clearly showcase women's wear as well as collaborations with partners such as fashion chain Top Shop and colourful Brazilian brand The Farm, timed for the soccer World Cup starting in June.Adidas plans to roll out the concept to Originals stores in over 30 cities, with London and Shanghai next for the makeover. It also has big ambitions for its new teen fashion brand NEO, which is being extended to Poland and the Czech Republic.However, sports-inspired fashion is becoming increasingly competitive with big players such as Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz , Japan's Uniqlo and Gap all offering more sportswear in recent years.And Adidas, which has been losing market share in Europe to Nike, must make sure the push into fashion does not distract from a core focus on sports performance, a mistake that cost German rival Puma dear.To that end, it is also revamping its flagship sportswear stores, seeking to create a stadium-like experience and, like the new Originals store, putting a focus on footwear and creating a multi-media experience for shoppers.""Footwear is treated as the centre of the brand and the heart of the experience,"" Mager said.

27,"  (Repeats to additional subsribers, no changes to text)By Keith WeirLONDON, April 1 Sportwear company Nike came under fire on Tuesday after England World Cup shirts went on sale for a price of up to 90 pounds ($150) ahead of this year's tournament in Brazil.The U.S. company said the top price was for a limited edition shirt which was an exact copy in terms of material, fit and finish of what the England players will wear. A more basic replica shirt costs 60 pounds.British newspapers branded the shirts a ""rip-off"" but Nike's German rivals Adidas and Puma are charging similar prices for the shirts of major countries they are supplying at the World Cup.Fans in London said they would be reluctant to pay so much for an England shirt.""An ideal price would be 30 to 40 pounds, which is acceptable,"" said Greg Brown, 35. ""I tend to buy football shirts at the end of the season at half price to save money.""The England shirt is usually a big seller with fans who take pride in wearing the national team jersey during major tournaments and the pricing added to broader concerns that supporters are being exploited for their loyalty. ""The anger generated by the 90 pound price tag for an adult England shirt is symptomatic of a wider issue of the games traditional fan base being edged out by the growing costs of being a supporter,"" said opposition Labour party sports spokesman Clive Efford.The Football Association said the Nike deal helped to fund the game in England at all levels.""The FA is a not-for-profit organisation that puts 100 million pounds back into the game every year.

32,"  HONG KONG, April 8 Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd, which makes shoes for global brands including Nike Inc and adidas AG, said on Tuesday it is in talks to resolve a dispute over employee terms and benefits at a factory in southern China.The demonstration, which began on Saturday, is the latest to highlight a growing trend of industrial activism in China amid a worsening shortage of workers that has shifted the balance of power in labour relations.About 600 workers took to the street in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub of Dongguan due to a ""misunderstanding"" over social security benefits and different terms for local and migrant workers, a spokesman for Yue Yuen, the world's largest maker of athletic shoes, told Reuters.""The misunderstanding has to be clarified by the government, in particular any difference between local and migrant workers when they claim their benefits,"" the spokesman said.Yue Yuen, which employs about 60,000 workers in the district, was in talks with local government officials and labour union representatives and hoped to resolve the issue by April 14, the spokesman said. Adidas said in a statement it was closely monitoring the situation and confirmed its supplier was in talks with local authorities to address workers' concerns.Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, a strike at a factory of International Business Machines Corp in the southern boom town of Shenzhen illustrated how significant changes in China's labour market are emboldening workers to take matters into their own hands, raising risks for multinationals, labour experts say.In November, hundreds of employees stopped work at a Nokia Oyj factory in Dongguan, complaining of changes following Nokia's sale of its mobile phone business to Microsoft Corp. Yuen Yuen, which listed in Hong Kong in 1992 and has a market value of $5.4 billion, said its business in Dongguan was operating as normal.Shares of the company closed down 0.4 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday, lagging a 1 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index.Yue Yuen, which also makes shoes for brands Reebok, ASICS, New Balance, Puma, Converse, Salomon and Timberland, has factories in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the United States, Mexico and elsewhere in Asia.

33,"   By Iain Rogers | MADRID, April 8  MADRID, April 8 Atletico Madrid's emergence as a third force in Spain and contenders among Europe's elite rests on wobbly economic foundations and the edifice could come crashing down if they cannot sustain their remarkable run.The club's success is in large measure down to inspirational coach Diego Simeone, who since taking charge in late 2011 has moulded an unspectacular squad into a unit capable of challenging the continent's richest clubs, including La Liga rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona.Real and Barca again topped Deloitte's latest Football Money League of the world's wealthiest club's by income, with revenue in excess of 500 million euros ($687 million), while Atletico squeaked into the top 20 with earnings of 120 million.Despite the huge gulf in resources, they are a point clear of Barca at the top of Spain's domestic league and three ahead of Real with six games left and are closing in on a first La Liga title since 1996 with a team featuring Simeone in midfield.At the same time, they have enjoyed another lucrative run in Europe and play their Champions League quarter-final, second leg at home to Barca on Wednesday with the pair locked at 1-1 after last week's first leg in the Catalan capital.Step back from the euphoria for a moment, however, and a glance at Atletico's accounts makes for grim reading.Figures for 2011-12 collated by Jose Maria Gay, a professor at the University of Barcelona and an expert on soccer finances, show the club are saddled with debts of more than 500 million euros and the cost of paying their players and staff alone is more than 90 percent of annual earnings.They had managed to stay afloat due to their unexpected winnings on the pitch and by convincing the government to let them fall behind in the payment of more than 100 million euros in taxes, according to Jaume Llopis, a professor at the IESE business school in Barcelona and soccer finance expert.The sale of top players like Fernando Torres, David De Gea and Sergio Aguero to the Premier League, a partnership with the Azerbaijan tourist board, reported to be worth 12 million euros over 18 months, and a deal with sporting goods maker Nike have also helped keep the wolves from the door, Llopis said. ""Atletico Madrid's financial situation is dramatic,"" he told Reuters.""But this year because of the team's excellent results their economic problems are not talked about.""Only with their continued presence in the Champions League, locking in the sponsorship deal with Azerbaijan, attracting more sponsors and selling their best players can they improve their finances, although it will be very tough.""Either they stay in the Champions League and win the odd title which keeps the sponsors happy or they won't be able to straighten out their precarious economic situation."" BRIGHT SPOT Angel Barajas, a professor of finance and accounting at the University of Vigo who specialises in sports economics, believes Atletico do not have the resources to challenge in more than one competition over the longer term.However, by selling their best players from time to time and buying decent replacements, as well as bringing through talent from the club's academy, they could remain a strong contender in the second rank behind the richest teams, he added.""Atletico's situation is problematic because of the level of debt but if they manage to keep wages under control and sell players to raise cash, while keeping their sporting model intact, they could stay at a good level,"" Barajas told Reuters. ""What is not viable in the long term is trying to stay in the fight for La Liga and European silverware in competition with clubs who have more than twice their earnings.""One exceptional season is possible but competing at the highest level in various competitions needs not only a good team but an extraordinary squad. And that costs a great deal.""Placido Rodriguez, a professor of economics at Oviedo University and a former chairman of Sporting Gijon, noted several examples of Spanish clubs with relatively limited resources that have challenged at the highest level before fading away again.These included Valencia, Villarreal, Deportivo La Coruna and Sevilla, who all had successful runs in Europe and either won or came close to winning La Liga in the past 15 years but like Atletico, have had to sell their top performers.One potential bright spot for Atletico, which would boost revenue and help secure their future, was the planned move from their crumbling Calderon stadium to a new 70,000-capacity arena at La Peineta, Rodriguez said.There are also plans for a vast new training complex which would include offices, a 15,000-seater stadium for the second and third teams and facilities and shops for fans.""If these two projects come off and they don't make any crazy financial decisions in the meantime, for example when results aren't going their way, Atletico's economic situation will be much improved,"" Rodriguez told Reuters.Atletico have already qualified for next season's Champions League and their run in the latest edition of the competition should see them climb the rankings in Deloitte's next Money League, the accounting firm said.($1 = 0.7277 euros)   (Editing by John O'Brien)",2014-04-08,NKE,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 5:15am EDT",Soccer-Atletico success built on shaky economic foundations,http://www.reuters.com//article/soccer-spain-atletico-finances-idUSL6N0MZ4S420140408?type=companyNews

The factory employs some 60,000 workers. Yue Yuen said it had decided to adjust social insurance and housing subsidies that will take effect from May 1. The workers at the factory have demanded improved social insurance payments, a pay rise and more equitable contracts. Yue Yuen Chairman Lu Chin Chu added that the company will continue to review its employee benefits policy. It gave no further details. The number of strikes in China so far this year is up by close to a third - the biggest surge in protests since the global financial crisis, according to one labour group - as businesses cut costs and foreign companies restructure or close operations in response to slowing growth in the world's second-biggest economy.

""China is and will continue to be a strategic sourcing country for us."" Yue Yuen's executive director, George Liu, declined to comment on Adidas' decision or on whether other clients were making similar moves. The plant has around 40,000 employees and also supplies rival leisurewear brands such as Nike Inc. Yue Yuen said it made around 300 million pairs of shoes last year.""We will not make any comments in regards to our customers,"" Liu said in an email sent to Reuters on Thursday.A Nike spokesman said the company has followed the events at the factory ""closely"" but has not shifted any production, and that Nike ""has the flexibility to manage volatility."" STORE PROTEST  About 20 protesters from labour rights groups in Hong Kong protested at Adidas' local office on Thursday morning, demanding the company work with Yue Yuen to compensate employees and help release those who have been detained. The protesters also went to nearby Adidas, Nike and other stores of brands supplied by Yue Yuen to voice their demands and hand in an open letter.Earlier this week, a prominent Chinese labour activist went missing after trying to help Yue Yuen workers organize their case. His wife suspects he was detained by state security agents.China's declining labour force has given workers greater confidence to demand their rights. The country's working age population shrank by almost 6 million in the past two years to 920 million, National Bureau of Statistics data shows.Dozens of workers protested against Wal-Mart Stores Inc  in Hunan province after the U.S. retailer said last month it was closing a store there - a small, but important case highlighting the growing activism among Chinese workers.

42,"  PARIS, May 5 European stocks were set to inch higher on Monday in thin volumes as UK markets were closed for a holiday, with gains set to be capped following soft Chinese manufacturing data.     At 0613 GMT, futures for Euro STOXX 50, for Germany's DAX  and for France's CAC were flat to up 0.2 percent.     The final reading of China's HSBC/Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for April came in at 48.1, lower than a preliminary reading of 48.3 but up slightly from an eight-month low of 48.0 in March. Output and new orders contracted in April, and new export orders slipped back into contraction after a recovery the previous month, the survey found.      Tensions in Ukraine were also at the forefront of investors' minds, after pro-Russian militants stormed a Ukrainian police station in Odessa on Sunday and freed nearly 70 fellow activists.      Portuguese equities will be in the spotlight after the country's government said on Sunday it would exit the three-year 78-billion-euro bailout this month without a precautionary credit line, as it returns to growth after years of painful austerity and unpopular reforms.     The cabinet decision was announced by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho in a televised address to the nation and means the country will no longer have to answer to foreign creditors after the bailout ends on May 17.      ""With a 15 billion euro ($20.80 billion) cash buffer and funding until 2015, there are few immediately obvious risks in the light of current periphery sentiment,"" RBS analysts wrote in a note.

43,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN German sportswear company Adidas reported disappointing first-quarter results on Tuesday due to a big drop in sales at its TaylorMade golf business, but said a stronger second quarter was signaling a return to growth.The world's second-biggest sportswear firm, which has been losing ground in its home territory of western Europe to U.S. giant Nike, said operating profit fell almost a third to 303 million euros ($420 million), missing average analyst forecasts for 318 million.It said 80 million euros of the decline was due to a poor quarter at TaylorMade due to a change in shipping cycles and a declining U.S. golfing market, and 50 million from negative currency movements - particularly the recent drop in the Russian rouble.But Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said those factors masked strong performances in emerging markets and the company's own retail network, which saw currency-neutral sales jump 22 percent, and confirmed the group's guidance for a ""high single-digit"" increase in currency-neutral sales in 2014.""While we still have to be wary of currencies and their effects on our financials, the first quarter will be the low point of our performance. I expect a strong second quarter to point the way forward,"" he told a media conference call.That may not be enough to mollify investors who have called for revolt at Thursday's annual general meeting over Hainer's failure to stop the advance of Nike, which extended its lead to take 15 percent of the global sportswear market in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to Euromonitor.In addition to taking on Adidas on its home turf, Nike has challenged the German firm's dominance in the soccer market, reporting a better than expected profit for the quarter ended February 28, helped by a large jump in revenue in western Europe. Ingo Speich, a fund manager with Union Investment which has a 0.89 percent stake in Adidas and is its tenth biggest investor, said he could not understand why the board decided in March to extended the contract of Hainer - in the job since 2001 - until 2017.Adidas shares, which are already down 17 percent this year on concerns about its exposure to emerging market currencies and the Russian market, were up 0.1 percent at 6:36 am (1036 GMT), compared to a flat German blue-chip index.MORE TIME? Hainer said he was surprised by Speich's comments as Adidas had performed well in 2013, but said he would speak to him at Thursday's shareholders meeting and try to regain his support. Stefan-Guenter Bauknecht, fund manager at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, Adidas' sixth-biggest shareholder with a 1.45 percent stake, said he was prepared to give Hainer more time.""The low point might have been reached. It is positive that the annual targets were not scrapped today, despite the weak quarterly results,"" he said.Hainer said football sales rose 27 percent in the first quarter ahead of the World Cup in Brazil starting next month, adding that sales of national shirts and the official match ball had been much higher than in the same period four years ago.Confidence for future growth was reflected in an 18 percent increase in inventories on a currency-neutral basis. However, Hainer said he was not happy with the group's performance in North America, where currency-neutral sales fell 20 percent in the first quarter. But he expects to reverse the negative trend and grow the business for the full year.More than half of the sales decline in North America was due to TaylorMade after a change in the business model to ship more products in the last quarter of the year rather than the first three months to give them more time to sell. That was compounded by a very cold start to 2014 on the U.S. East Coast.Hainer said Adidas was holding onto its position as the market leader even though the number of rounds of golf played in the United States - the world's biggest golfing market - fell 5 percent in the first quarter.California-based TaylorMade, a brand Adidas bought in 1997 to help it compete with Nike, is the biggest maker of golf bags, clubs, clothing and shoes in the world, with sales of 1.3 billion in 2013 or almost 9 percent of the group total.Meanwhile, Adidas is considering offers for its Rockport shoe brand, which saw sales rise 6 percent to 289 million euros in 2013 although they dipped in the first quarter.Adidas was constantly being asked whether Rockport, which it acquired when it bought Reebok in 2006, was for sale, Hainer said, adding it had engaged investment bank Guggenheim Partners to help it analyse the market.

Herbert Hainer, who has been Adidas CEO since 2001 and recently had his contract extended until 2017, admitted the company had made ""a few executional mistakes"" but said a revamped executive team had the talent to revive performance.""A high-quality management team knows how to tackle challenges. And believe me, we have all the insight, character and determination to do exactly this,"" Hainer told the company's annual general meeting in the Bavarian town of Fuerth.""We will achieve most, if not all, of our 'Route 2015' operational targets. However, it might take a little longer than we originally anticipated,"" the 59-year-old added.Adidas, which reported weak first-quarter results on Tuesday, had already warned in March that weakening emerging market currencies, notably the Russian rouble, would hurt 2014 results and pose a risk to its 2015 targets. MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE MEASURED LIKE ATHLETES Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which has a 0.89 percent stake in Adidas and is its tenth-biggest investor, called on shareholders to refuse to grant the customary endorsement of management's actions.""Even on the German football field, Nike is increasingly sidelining Adidas,"" Speich told the AGM. ""Athletes are measured by whether they achieve their goals - that should also apply to managers in the sporting goods industry."" Speich said Adidas shares had underperformed Nike by about 16 percent in the last 12 months, which Hainer countered by showing a chart which showed Adidas rising more over five years.""We're going to work on regaining your confidence,"" he said, inviting Speich to speak to him in person about his concerns.Despite Speich's comments, a majority of shareholders voted to endorse the executive and supervisory boards.Nike extended its lead to take 15 percent of the global sportswear market in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to data from Euromonitor, a market research firm.Hainer, who joined Adidas in 1987 as a sales director, is the longest-serving boss among German blue-chip companies and in March also took over as chairman of soccer club Bayern Munich after Uli Hoeness was convicted for tax evasion.He said he would be defining a new long-term strategy for the period up to 2020 in coming months and pursing the generation change he has already started among management.At the AGM, he presented Roland Auschel and Eric Liedtke, the recently appointed heads of global sales and global brands,  and also noted that Mark King will take over as new head of the struggling North America business in June.

46,"  (Adds quotes, share price)HONG KONG May 14 Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd, maker of footwear for companies such as Nike Inc  and Adidas, suspended production in Vietnam on Wednesday amid anti-China protests over a disputed area in the South China Sea.Thousands of Vietnamese set fire to factories and stormed industrial zones in the south of the country, with Taiwanese companies bearing the brunt of the damage, to protest against Chinese oil drilling in a part of the sea claimed by Hanoi.Yue Yuen, a $4.7 billion company controlled by Taiwan-listed Pou Chen Corp, told Reuters it was unclear if production would resume on Thursday. It added there had been no damage to factory facilities and its workers were safe. ""With respect to Vietnam, we have told workers to take a day off today and the operations are closed today for the entire country,"" said Jerry Shum, head of investor relations at Yue Yuen in Hong Kong. He added that the disruption on Wednesday would not have any significant impact on the business.Vietnam accounts for about a third of Yue Yuen's global production capacity, which amounted to 313 million pairs of shoes last year. Shares of Yue Yuen slid nearly 5 percent in Hong Kong trade to their lowest since November last year, lagging a 1 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index. Pou Chen's stock was up 0.8 percent in Taiwan.The suspension is the latest blow to Yue Yuen after thousands of workers went on strike last month at a complex in China to demand better social benefits. They returned to work at the end of April after the company agreed to meet some of their core demands.

48,"   By Nguyen Phuong Linh and Michael Gold | HANOI/TAIPEI  HANOI/TAIPEI May 16 Dexter Hsu spent Tuesday night barricaded inside his workers' dormitory in Vietnam's Binh Duong province. Tables were stacked up against the doors, but he and his dorm-mates were terrified by the shouts and sounds of nearby rioting.Earlier that day, the Taiwanese product developer at a footwear company saw a mob of some 4,000 angry protesters riding scooters into the industrial park where he worked, smashing windows and breaking equipment.Now, he's in hiding in a Ho Chi Minh City hotel, waiting for the order to resume work, although he said he was wondering whether in the long term he should just return home. ""I'm totally helpless to control this situation and I feel like my life could come under threat,"" he said in a telephone interview.Tales like Hsu's risk undermining foreign investment in Vietnam, the lynchpin of its economy.Industrial parks have been a major driver of the country's economic growth, accounting for more than 30 percent of Vietnam's exports and attracting around $110 billion in foreign direct investment.Setting up shop in one of the 200-odd parks across the country saves foreign companies the bureaucratic headache of obtaining land on their own, as well as giving them easy access to electricity, water supplies and worker accommodation. That's helped Vietnam and its army of low-wage workers carve out a niche in the global supply chain for textiles and electronics.Samsung Electronics has just opened the world's largest smartphone factory in northern Vietnam, Intel Corp  has one of its biggest chip plants there, while Nike Inc and Adidas both buy footwear from Vietnamese factories.South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore in particular have been some of the biggest investors in the parks. That could now change.""UNDERLYING TENSIONS"" Riots in Vietnam this week, sparked by protests over China's move to station an oil rig in waters claimed by both countries, have centred on the industrial parks, where thousands of Chinese employees live and work. Taiwanese or companies owned by Taiwanese in Vietnam are often mistakenly seen as mainland Chinese.Hundreds of companies have been forced to halt production as factories were looted, torched or damaged in the riots. In the long run, the concern for Vietnam would be that they move away altogether.""Investors cannot just pay attention to costs or quality of labour, they should also assess the likelihood of nationalist sentiments whipped up suddenly that could disrupt production,"" said Leong Wai Ho, an economist for Barclays in Singapore.""The protests might be one off, but the underlying tensions and sentiments will not go away, and will probably worsen over time,"" he added.Vietnam's industrial parks employ about 2.1 million people and manufactured products worth $38 billion in exports last year. They have helped provide a bright spot in the $170 billion economy, where growth potential has been hampered by debt-ridden state-owned enterprises and corruption. A glut of bad debt caused by over-indulgent bank lending and a glacial pace of reform in the state-owned corporate sector mean Vietnam has gone from being one of Asia's rising stars to one of the region's biggest underperformers.NOT FIRST SIGN This week was not the first sign of unrest at the parks; in recent years workers have been increasingly dissatisfied over labour conditions, although the authorities have until now kept any protests contained.""Local riots in response to harsh employment conditions have been quickly put down by the government,"" said Suiwah Leung, associate professor of economics at Australian National University, and an expert on Vietnam.Now, the risk is that anti-foreigner antagonism mixed with unhappy workers will be harder to control and will worry foreign companies, even if they have no connection to China and events in the South China Sea. ""The situation that some workers are taking advantage of their right to demonstrate by destroying factories is definitely not good for Vietnam's investment environment,"" said Nguyen Mai, chairman of the Vietnam Association of Foreign Invested Enterprises.A major downturn in foreign investment would be a big economic blow.Samsung spent $3.2 billion on its smartphone factory in the northern Thai Nguyen province.The five Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks, two of which were hit by this week's riots in Binh Duong, say they host around 500 companies and have created more than 140,000 local jobs. Their tenants come from 23 different countries.The Ha Tinh industrial park in central Vietnam, where a huge steel complex being built by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group was set on fire, is estimated to cost more than $20 billion by the time it is completed in 2020.For now, signs are that most foreign investors are willing to ride out the unrest.""This is a very isolated incident,"" said Jason Yeo, president of the Singapore Business Association Vietnam, who has been in the country for 17 years. ""The Vietnamese government (officials) are very concerned on this issue and will do their best to protect foreign investors in their country.""A spokeswoman for Singapore's Ascendas Pte Ltd, which runs a large industrial park with Vietnam's Protrade in Binh Duong, said that while it has bolstered security and is monitoring events, it still believes in ""Vietnam's long-term growth"".Hsu, however, is unlikely to easily put behind him the memories of Tuesday's riots.""This is a terrifying situation, it's the first time I've genuinely thought about leaving Vietnam,"" he said.

As a World Cup sponsor, Adidas provides the official match ball and is kitting out nine teams of the 32 finalists, including former world champions Spain, Germany and Argentina.""This year we will add 1-1.2 billion euros ($1.4-1.6 billion) to operational revenue, with the World Cup playing an important role,"" Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told journalists at a briefing in Munich in remarks released for publication on Thursday.That increase represents a rise of 7-8 percent from the 14.492 billion euros of sales Adidas recorded in 2013.    Previously, Adidas had guided for a ""high single-digit"" increase in currency-neutral sales in 2014. The world's second-biggest sportswear firm has been losing market share in western Europe, its home territory, to Nike , which is also challenging the German company's dominance in the soccer market.Nike is supplying teams from 10 countries, including the Brazilian hosts, at the World Cup.Hainer confirmed that Adidas expected to make a record 2 billion euros of sales in football this year, exceeding Nike's estimated $2 billion of soccer turnover. ""Football is the DNA of our company. We want to clearly show that we are number one in football,"" Hainer said, adding Adidas expected to sell significantly more balls than at the last World Cup in South Africa four years ago and about as many shirts.Hainer acknowledged, however, that Adidas faced a ""head-to-head"" race with Nike in the business for football boots, including in Germany, predicting Adidas would sell 2 million pairs of special boots designed for the World Cup.Argentina's Lionel Messi and Germany's Mezul Ozil are among the stars wearing Adidas boots, while Brazilian idol Neymar and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo will be sporting Nike shoes.Adidas is investing a ""double-digit million sum"" in advertising associated with the World Cup with a particular focus on social media, he said, with plans for a media room in Brazil to deliver and filter content from its sponsored teams and players.($1 = 0.7318 Euros)   (Reporting by Joern Poltz; Writing by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Kirsti Knolle and Jane Baird)",2014-05-22,NKE,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 7:19am EDT",UPDATE 1-Adidas sees boost to sales from World Cup,http://www.reuters.com//article/adidas-soccer-idUSL6N0O82QM20140522?type=companyNews

Ronaldo probably helps sell shirts even when he isn't wearing one - he poses nude on the cover of the latest Spanish Vogue with his model girlfriend Irina Shayk - though the branding benefits are shared as Adidas sponsors Real Madrid. ""While it is primarily about performance on the pitch, a player's appeal is about a whole range of variables.

53,"  * Fierce competition in store and online weighs on retailers* Robust sportswear sales to outpace footwear division* Net profit rose just 1 percent in fiscal year ended Feb   (Adds comment from CEO, earnings outlook details)By Donny KwokHONG KONG, May 27 China's biggest shoe retailer Belle International Holdings Ltd said it expects sluggish growth in the world's second-largest economy to weigh on its earnings for the next two years after profit edged up just 1 percent in its latest fiscal year.As fierce competition in stores and online makes life tougher for China retailers, Belle is counting on robust sales of popular global sportswear brands like Nike and Adidas  to cushion a more subdued performance by the shoes it makes itself that still generate most of its profit.Chief Executive Sheng Baijiao said Belle expects strong brand recognition to help lift same-store sportswear sales by a high-single digit percentage this fiscal year, compared with 6 percent last year. Sales at its footwear division, including affordable in-house brands like Staccato and Tata targeted at younger Chinese women, should rise by a low single-digit percentage, compared with 0.6 percent last year. ""We see some improvement in our same-store sales in March-May quarter as compared to the previous quarter, but (footwear business) in not out of the woods yet,"" said Sheng, in charge of the largest footwear retailer in China by market value.Speaking to reporters in Hong Kong, Sheng said the company may slow down its store opening pace in the current fiscal year in wake of the weak sentiment.Retailers like conglomerate China Resources Enterprise  have reported the softer economy is already taking its toll. Some are locked in price wars that are slicing into profit margins, while a rapid expansion of department store space and a surge in online retail have diluted foot traffic in Chinese stores.With a network of nearly 20,000 stores strung across China, Belle reported net profit rose 1 percent to 5.16 billion yuan ($827 million) for the 14 months ended February, compared with 5.11 billion yuan in a comparable 14-month period ended February 2013. Belle, worth $9 billion by market value, changed its financial year-end date to the end of February from December earlier this year. For the 14 months revenue at Belle rose 10 percent to 43.06 billion yuan, up from 39.13 billion yuan in the 14 months ended February 2013.""The macroeconomic outlook for the next two years is not optimistic,"" Sheng Baijiao said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Monday. ""The consumer retail market is expected to be under continued pressure due to weak consumer sentiment.""Licensed sportswear sales accounted for about 39 percent of Belle's total revenue. Belle has said that Nike and Adidas - which together make up 90 percent of the division's sales - have much better brand recognition in China, as well as a more extensive product offering, than second-tier clients such as French retail group Kering SA's Puma sports brand and Nike's Converse sneakers. In the footwear division, Sheng said he expects operating profit margins to remain stable at about 22 to 24 percent.The business is more profitable than the higher-priced licensed sportswear sales because Belle can book all revenue and profit from sales of most of the brands in the footwear unit itself. The division does include some licensed international footwear brands, like Hush Puppies and Clarks.Shares of Belle were down 1.9 percent in Hong Kong, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index was off 0.04 percent. The stock, which fell nearly 50 percent last year, has dropped about 9 percent so far this year.For full statement click: link.reuters.com/wyb69v($1 = 6.2392 Chinese Yuan)   (Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-05-27,NKE,"Tue May 27, 2014 | 3:17am EDT","UPDATE 1-Nike, Adidas China distributor Belle warns economy's sag means 2 lean years",http://www.reuters.com//article/belle-intl-results-idUSL3N0OD0IC20140527?type=companyNews

But so, as online commentators were quick to point out, did the brand logo.""Do you think Adidas are regretting this World Cup promotional ad... or reveling in it?"" wrote Twitter user @aspiringnomads.After FIFA suspended Suarez on Thursday, Adidas said it would not use him in any further World Cup marketing - but stopped short of ending its sponsorship deal with him. The German company is aiming for soccer sales of $2.7 billion this year, and needs a World Cup boost because its revenue so far has been dented by volatile currencies in emerging markets and by tensions in Russia. By comparison Nike, which only got going in the sport in the 1994, reported soccer revenue of $2.3 billion for the year to end May on Thursday, helping its shares jump 3.2 percent.  Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker told analysts that day: ""The combination of the world’s best players and teams, our most innovative performance products and new levels of consumer engagement through social media is truly extraordinary.""There is hope for Adidas though.

65,"   By Keith Weir | LONDON, July 7  LONDON, July 7 U.S. sportswear company Nike  will not renew a long-running kit supply deal with English soccer club Manchester United because of the cost of a new contract, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said.Nike has been supplying United's famous red shirts since 2002 but the current agreement expires next year. Its withdrawal is expected to clear the way for the club to sign a lucrative new deal with German sportswear company Adidas.""Clearly Nike's football business is booming and they could easily afford to do this (deal). They had the right to match any other offer but looking at the deal on the table, they will walk away as it doesn't make commercial sense,"" the source said. United got around 38 million pounds ($64.7 million) from the Nike deal in 2012-13, including its share of profit from the sale of merchandise around the world.Media reports had suggested the club was looking for a new deal worth around 60 million pounds per season. Nike and Adidas are battling for supremacy in the soccer kit industry, with the American company having made big inroads into a sport that its German rival long dominated. United, owned by the American Glazer family, are looking to rebuild after a disappointing season in which the 20-times English champions finished only seventh in the Premier League.The club has installed Dutchman Louis van Gaal as their new manager and he will take charge after the World Cup where he has steered the Netherlands to the semi-finals.Adidas and Man Utd both declined to comment.

72,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN With Adidas sponsoring both teams in Sunday's World Cup final, the German sportswear brand has declared victory over U.S. rival Nike in the latest round of its battle to remain the biggest global soccer brand.The two companies dominate a soccer kit industry worth more than $5 billion a year, sharing more than 80 percent of the market for many products, but Nike has been threatening Adidas' leadership, including in its home territory of western Europe.While Adidas has supplied the match ball for the World Cup since 1970, Nike kitted out more teams at the competition in Brazil for the first time, 10 out of the 32 teams including the hosts, compared with nine for Adidas.However, the three stripes of Adidas will dominate the pitch  on Sunday, on both teams' jerseys for the first time since 1990 and on many of their star players' boots as well as the match officials' clothing and the ball.""Adidas will be the most visible brand by far in the World Cup final,"" said Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, who had predicted a Germany-Argentina final well before the two teams beat Nike-backed Brazil and the Netherlands in the semis.""We are once again underlining our position as the world's leading football brand. Adidas is the clear number one in football globally,"" Hainer added in a statement.It is not clear how long that will last.Adidas expects record soccer sales of $2.7 billion in 2014, topping the $2.3 billion Nike reported for its financial year to end May. While the periods are not directly comparable, Nike has suggested the U.S. firm could exceed the Adidas figure for 2014 in its fiscal 2014/15. NIKE PUSH  Despite the fact Nike teams did not make the final, the Portland-based firm which has only been a serious player in soccer since the World Cup was held in the United States in 1994, sees no sign of growth in soccer slowing down. Chief Executive Mark Parker says Nike has already overtaken Adidas in boot sales in most countries and predicts a repeat in the current fiscal year of the 21 percent rise in soccer sales the company saw in 2013/14.""The United States offers huge potential in particular, enthusiasm for football is there in any case. And in China there are tremendous growth opportunities,"" Parker told Germany's Handelsblatt daily in an interview published on Wednesday.The determination of Adidas to stay ahead in the sport is set to be underlined by a pricey long-term kit supply deal it is expected to seal with English soccer club Manchester United, replacing Nike. Adidas shares, hit in recent months by exposure to Russia and other volatile emerging markets, fell to a 16-month low on Wednesday on concerns around the price of the Manchester United deal. The stock was down 0.8 percent by 1106 GMT. ""The possible deal with Manchester United would lead to rising marketing costs and the profit dynamism of Adidas is also weak,"" said Warburg Research analyst Joerg Frey.Adidas, whose sponsorship of each World Cup is estimated to cost about $100 million, predicted a ""modest increase"" in sales and marketing costs in 2014 due to the competition, without giving figures. Nike said total marketing expenses rose 36 percent to $876 million in the quarter to end May, mainly due to expenditure related to the World Cup, with an executive predicting a rise of 30 percent in the current quarter too.BOOT BATTLEGROUND The German company, which was founded by shoe maker Adi Dassler in 1949, admits it faces a ""head-to-head"" race with Nike in the boot business, but has predicted it would sell 2 million pairs of the special shoes it designed for the World Cup with striking black and white patterns. Nike has not given a forecast for World Cup boot or shirt sales.

Nike players scored 73 and other brands 15.Adidas players dominate the list of top World Cup scorers, including Colombia's James Rodriguez, Argentina's Lionel Messi and Thomas Mueller and Andre Schuerrle of Germany.Brazil's Neymar, who Nike provided with golden boots from the second round, was also a big scorer but missed the semi-final due to a serious back injury. Other top Nike players like Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Rooney of England had disappointing tournaments.While most national team jerseys are sold ahead of the World Cup or in the early stages, Euromonitor's Kondej said Brazil's failure to reach the final could dampen Nike sales of Brazil shirts both in the host nation and abroad in coming months.Adidas said it expected to sell more than 8 million World Cup shirts, including more than 2 million of the Germany jersey, with more than half a million of those sold outside Europe.Adidas and Nike have also fought a fierce battle off the pitch to grab attention on social media, with Adidas setting up a ""newsroom"" in Rio to generate real-time content after Nike dominated unofficial marketing at the 2010 competition. While Nike started the competition with more hits for its videos and posts, Adidas has pulled ahead in the last two weeks, with Adidas scoring nine million views for its clips on YouTube to three million for Nike, according to marketing intelligence firm Origami Logic, which advises big brands on social media.

74,"  * Adidas has offered upwards of 60 mln pounds a season -source* Adidas's 10-year deal will replace Nike from 2015* Man Utd's commercial appeal has survived a poor season* Its sponsorship deals are priced about twice rivals'By Keith WeirLONDON, July 11 A wretched season and exile from European soccer's top club competition have done nothing to dim Manchester United's commercial appeal, with the team set to sign a sportswear deal with Adidas worth twice what rivals have been earning.That partnership and a shirt sponsorship with car brand Chevrolet, which also set a new benchmark for the sport, will help to underwrite the rebuilding of the team under new manager Louis van Gaal.Negotiations for a new kit supply deal were a test of United's marketing muscle after a season in which the team won nothing and finished too low in the Premier League even to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League.The normally bullish Nike pulled out of contract renewal talks, saying that the price had gone too high and signalling an end to a partnership dating back to 2002.A source with knowledge of the negotiations said rival Adidas had offered upwards of 60 million pounds ($102 million) a season for a 10-year deal that will see it replace Nike from 2015.The current Nike deal was worth 38 million pounds to United in 2012-13, including a share of the earnings from the sale of shirts and other merchandise to fans around the world. United, majority owned by the American Glazer family and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, are determined to ensure that last season was a one-off failure and have replaced manager David Moyes after a short and unhappy tenure.""Brands are about the history and the promise that will continue into the future,"" said Peter Walshe, a global account director with marketing company Millward Brown.""There is a lot of excitement about the future after the disastrous handover to Moyes,"" he added. ""It shows the United brand is bigger than one decision or individual.""GLOBAL FAN BASE English champions a record 20 times, United have built up a huge global following over the decades thanks to players like George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Just before their stock market flotation in 2012, United produced a survey showing they had 659 million global followers - not far short of one in 10 of the population.That appeal helped persuade General Motors to put its Chevrolet brand on the team's red shirts in a deal worth $559 million that will run until 2021. As with the sportswear sponsorship, that was double the going rate for most major European teams.""The key thing here is the increasing power that the brand has internationally,"" said Andy Sutherden, global head of sports marketing and sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies.""The pool of fans from all over the world is the asset that they sell,"" he added.Indeed, the focus for General Motors will be the Asian markets where United is popular, as the car maker is pulling the Chevrolet brand out of European markets. United this week launched their new red shirts bearing the Chevrolet logo, a kit that will be the last one featuring the Nike swoosh and will be worn through the 2014-15 season.For Adidas, the United deal fits with a strategy of defending market leadership in soccer against the advances made by larger American rival Nike, which has been involved in the sport for only two decades.""If you can keep out a key rival that is worth a lot more to you rather than just the positive value of having that brand,"" said Millward Brown's Walshe.United fans on social media reacted positively to the prospect of Adidas returning as kit supplier, reviving a partnership from the 1980s.Nike had the right to match the bid from its rival, but walked away, saying it did not offer good value for shareholders.More than 2 million United shirts are sold every year, which will help Adidas to recoup its investment, provided the team can return to the top of the European game.That is where Dutchman Van Gaal comes in, fresh from taking a workmanlike Netherlands team to the World Cup semi-final this week.Just as importantly, he appears to have some of the aura of  former manager Alex Ferguson, who retired last year after winning 13 Premier League titles in two decades.""What van Gaal has done with the Netherlands whets the appetite of fans and sponsors alike,"" said Sutherden.""He has done enough with Holland to show he is a manager who will create a positive and immediate impact.""

75,"  (Corrects paragraph one of March 17 story to reflect Ma's apartment had more than one room)* Share of China online retail fell for first time in 2013* IPO in U.S. could exceed Facebook's $16 bln in value* Tencent, JD.com tie-up sharpens e-commerce challenge* Niche players, retail brands also step up competitionBy Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, March 17 Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in an apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.""In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,"" said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. PEELING AWAY Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian.Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.""We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,"" said Wang.Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.""As a mature Internet brand we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,"" Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. ""We go and sell our products where the consumers are."" RIVALS RISING Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious.JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in ""the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market"", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.""I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,"" said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. ""It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more."" Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.MA VS MA Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a ""killer weapon"" for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country's mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.""The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,"" said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.""Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,"" said Zhang.($1=6.14 Yuan)   (Reporting by Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Additional reporting by Jane Lee in JINAN, Paul Carsten in HONG KONG and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-07-14,NKE,"Mon Jul 14, 2014 | 12:59am EDT","CORRECTED-RPT-As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips",http://www.reuters.com//article/china-ecommerce-graphicspixtvrepeatcorre-idUSL3N0ME17U20140714?type=companyNews

78,"  BERLIN Aug 7 Adidas, the world's second-biggest sportswear firm, will increase its spending on marketing by 1 percent of sales as it seeks to halt the advance of market leader Nike following a profit warning last week.The German group said it planned to increase its target range for marketing spending to 13-14 percent of sales from a previous 12-13 percent. Adidas spent about 12.4 percent of its 14.5 billion euros of revenue on sales and marketing in 2013. Adidas last week cut its sales and net income targets for 2014 and scrapped its goals for 2015, blaming the move on poor performance at its golf business and volatile emerging market currencies, particularly the Russian rouble. Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said Adidas now planned to add only 80 more stores in Russia this year, down from a previously-planned 150, with a similar figure for 2015. That move, as well as a more promotional environment in Russia, would cut around 50 million euros from operating profit in the second half, while a planned restructuring at the golf unit would mean a hit of 50-60 million euros.

79,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN Sportswear firm Adidas (ADSGn.DE) probably thought it had hit the marketing jackpot when Adidas-sponsored Germany beat Adidas-sponsored Argentina to win the Adidas-sponsored World Cup.    But arch rival Nike (NKE.N) may have stolen much of its soccer branding thunder with quirky videos, innovative boots and amusing Tweets, not to mention the odd sponsorship coup of its own such as signing up hosts Brazil.    Adidas said it had secured “victory on and off the pitch” at the soccer tournament, providing the highest-scoring boots and generating 22 percent more discussion on social media than Nike.But more than half the players displayed Nike's brightly-colored shoes and it was one of Nike's new lightweight ""Flyknit"" boots worn by Germany's Mario Goetze that volleyed in the winning goal.     Nike has been eating into its German rival's market share and some branding experts and investors don't believe throwing more cash into marketing will necessarily fix the problem.    Instead, Adidas needs to spot and set more trends and create a buzz among fashion and sports-mad youngsters.    ""At the moment, Nike is cool, very cool. If you ask a 20-year-old, they are not going to pick Adidas right now,"" said Tammy Smulders, head of marketing consultancy SCB Partners.    ""It is not as easy as just writing a check. They need to be doing more of the viral, underground activities which brings out the cool factor of the brand.""MARKETING SPEND    After recently issuing its third profit warning in a year, Adidas said on Thursday it would boost spending on marketing to about 13 percent of sales in 2014 and to between 13 and 14 percent of sales in 2015.     The company also said it would give marketing experts more responsibility and bring them closer to sales and product development staff.    Adidas spent 12.4 percent of its 2013 revenue of 14.5 billion euros ($19.4 billion) on sales and marketing, up from 12.1 percent in 2012 and already well above Nike, which spent 10.8 percent of sales of $27.8 billion in the year to May 31.    Adidas chief Herbert Hainer admitted the company, known for its three stripes logo, was being taken on even on its home turf. But he said second-quarter results – including double-digit growth in Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy and a 41 percent jump in soccer sales – showed Adidas was fighting back.    While Nike can focus on its ""swoosh"" logo and the ""Just do it"" slogan it has used since 1988, Adidas has to spread its ad budget across a range of brands such as Reebok, TaylorMade golf and Rockport shoes, as well as its Originals and NEO sports-inspired fashion labels.    ""They are fighting fires everywhere. Pouring money into marketing might put out some fires, but they will continue to burn elsewhere,"" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which has a 1.2 percent stake in Adidas and has repeatedly criticized management in recent months.    YOUNG CONSUMERS  While Nike has encroached on Adidas's home territory, the German firm has failed to make serious inroads in North America. The U.S. firm extended its lead to take a 15 percent global market share in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to Euromonitor.    Nike has focused on exploiting social media to target young consumers, while Adidas has relied more on official partnerships with the likes of the FIFA World Cup and the National Basketball Association (NBA).    Nike's animated film ""The Last Game"", featuring soccer stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar on a quest to save football from the hands of a villainous mastermind, has become one of Facebook's most shared posts ever.    ""Nike is the cheeky challenger doing guerrilla ambush marketing, whereas Adidas follows the more orthodox line,"" said Andrew Walsh at sports marketing research group Repucom.    The value of the Nike brand rose 13 percent in 2013 to $17 billion, making it the world's 24th most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand, more than double the value of Adidas on $7.5 billion.    Even though Adidas was thought to have forked out about $100 million to FIFA to sponsor the World Cup, two Nike World Cup ads are among the top 10 most shared ad videos so far this year, according to marketing technology company Unruly. No Adidas videos feature in that ranking, though it says its videos published during the tournament made it the most-viewed sports brand on YouTube.    ""Quite a lot of people thought Nike was the official sponsor. They manage to get the benefits without as large an upfront investment,"" said Leah Donlan, marketing lecturer at Manchester Business School.     TOP CLUBS Adidas has started to replicate Nike's tactics, setting up a “news room” in Rio during the World Cup to generate a stream of social media chatter on its sponsored teams and players. Investment in social media will be a big part of its increased marketing spending and it plans to open similar news rooms in key cities around the world to continue its engagement with fans.But Nike is also investing, launching an interactive Football app. It is kitting out more of Europe's top clubs, such as Barcelona and Paris St Germain, for the 2014/15 season, even though Adidas is ousting Nike at Manchester United (MANU.N) and Italian champions Juventus from next year. Adidas CEO Hainer said the record $1.3 billion shirt deal struck with Manchester United last month - almost three times per year what Nike has been paying the former English champions - and the signing of four of the top six National Basketball Association (NBA) draft players - showed he meant business.“We have three out of the four biggest symbols in the football club world with Real (Madrid), Bayern (Munich) and ManU. This gives us huge reach,” he said, predicting the ManU deal will generate sales of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion). But not everybody is convinced.    ""The ManU deal is too expensive. It might bring management top-line growth and exposure in emerging markets, but means that the expected margin improvement will be delayed,"" said Stefan-Guenter Bauknecht, fund manager at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, which holds a 1.4 percent stake in Adidas.    ""The strategy has changed from profitable growth towards building up the top line and the brand image against Nike.""    Adidas acknowledges it has cut its 2014 target for its operating margin - operating income as a proportion of sales - to between 6.5 and 7.0 percent for 2014, from 8.5 to 9.0 percent, partly due to higher marketing spend. Nike recorded an operating margin of 13 percent in the fiscal year to May 31.""We know driving higher levels of profitability is absolutely critical to our long-term success, and we will get there. But we will not get there if we are not constantly winning in the marketplace,” Hainer said.     TREND SETTING       Adidas shares, down 39 percent this year after tumbling since last week's profit warning, trade at 16.9 times forward earnings to 22 times for Nike and almost 62 times for fast-growing U.S. upstart Under Armour Inc (UA.N).The success of Nike's ""Flyknit"" shoes worn by Goetze - made out of machine-knitted fiber rather than stitched-together pieces - is just the latest example of the U.S. firm's ability to innovate and set trends after its popular wearable ""FuelBand"" fitness device and ""Free"" barefoot-feel running shoes.    The Portland, Oregon-based firm has also arguably been quicker than Adidas to respond to booming demand for sportswear from women that has helped drive the rise of yoga specialist Lululemon (LULU.O). Adidas says it has run campaigns targeted at women in the United States and China in the last year.The biggest recent innovation hit Adidas can boast of - which it will now be marketing even harder - is the ""Boost"" cushioning technology initially developed for running shoes that it is now rolling out to other sports. It expects to sell 8 million pairs of the shoes this year and 15 million in 2015.    A Cowen survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers published last month showed 43 percent named Nike as their first choice of athletic apparel, compared with just 13 percent for Adidas, 6 percent for its Reebok brand, and 14 percent for Under Armour. More than three-quarters of respondents saw Nike as a cool brand.    Adidas is also struggling to dent Nike's dominance at home despite acquiring golf market leader TaylorMade in 1997 and Reebok in 2006. Euromonitor data showed its U.S. market share falling to 5.4 percent in 2013, while Nike grew to 20.2 percent.    DOMINANT POSITION  Adidas has not been helped by repeated injuries to basketball star Derrick Rose, whom it signed in 2012 in a 13-year $185 million deal, the biggest ever. In addition to its latest NBA signings, it plans to spend more on marketing ""Boost"" in a new basketball range this fall.    But Berenberg analyst John Guy said Adidas - under new Americas president Mark King - would be better off investing in its Originals, Boost and Reebok brands, given Nike's dominance in basketball where it has about a 90 percent market share.    ""We continue to question the logic of sizeable investments in basketball, where key-man risk is high and endorsement contracts are expensive,"" said Guy, who rates Adidas a ""sell"".    CEO Hainer said Adidas will launch its most ambitious brand campaign to date in 2015 after its current ""All in or Nothing"" slogan, used since the 2012 Olympics in London.    It will also be pushing new collaborations for its Originals label with celebrities Kanye West and Pharrell Williams and is optimistic for new products like relaunches of classic sneaker brand ZX Flux.    Marketing specialist Donlan says investing in building a brand is a long-term project that could take three to five years. But some investors are becoming impatient.    ""Management must be shown a yellow card,"" said Bauknecht at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management. ""There is not much more room for disappointment.""     (1 US dollar = 0.7486 euro) (Additional reporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by David Holmes and David Clarke)",2014-08-08,NKE,"Fri Aug 8, 2014 | 11:05am EDT",Adidas marketing push an uphill battle against 'cool' Nike,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-adidas-nike-rivalry-analysis-idUSKBN0G81MP20140808?type=companyNews

83,"   By Eric Kelsey | Sept 17  Sept 17 The Minnesota Vikings ""made a mistake"" in not initially suspending star player Adrian Peterson until his child-abuse case is resolved, the team's owners said on Wednesday, as sporting goods maker Nike halted its contract with the All-Pro running back.The Vikings' apology is the latest mea culpa to come from the NFL as the powerful sports league grapples with a spate of domestic violence cases that have raised questions about the league's integrity and leadership of commissioner Roger Goodell.The team, which on Monday reactivated Peterson for this Sunday's NFL game following his indictment last week in Texas in a case involving his 4-year-old son, reversed course by placing Peterson on a special exempt list that suspends him from all team activities.""We made a mistake, and we needed to get this right,"" Vikings co-owner Zygi Wilf said at a news conference.""It is important to always listen to our fans, the community and our sponsors,"" Wilf added. ""Our goal is to always make the decision we feel is right for the Minnesota Vikings."" Peterson, 29, stands accused of reckless or negligent injury to a child, stemming from a whipping incident that allegedly left bruises and wounds on his son.""This is a good decision that will allow Adrian Peterson to resolve his personal situation and the Vikings to return the focus to the football field,"" the NFL said of the decision to place Peterson on paid leave. The Vikings will continue to pay Peterson his full $11.75 million salary for this season.Nike Inc, one of Peterson's sponsors and which has a reputation for steadfastly sticking by its top athletes, said it had suspended its contract with the running back.""Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and we have shared our concerns with the NFL,"" the Oregon-based sporting goods company said in a statement. ""We have suspended our contract with Adrian Peterson."" The league has been publicly chastised by one of its top sponsors, beer brewer Anheuser-Busch. Several other sponsors, such as McDonald's Corp, Visa Inc and Campbell Soup Co, said they have communicated their  concerns to the NFL about its handling of domestic violence cases.Goodell and the league are already struggling to make amends for his initial lenient punishment of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who punched his then-fiancee, now his wife, in February, striking her unconscious.Goodell has since apologized for the handling of the Rice case and suspended Rice indefinitely. The Pro Bowl running back appealed his suspension on Tuesday.Two other players involved in domestic violence cases are Carolina Panthers' Greg Hardy and San Francisco 49ers' Ray McDonald.

86,"  * Shares up 4 pct* Long-serving CEO under pressure* Adidas in ""open, constructive"" dialogue with investors* Adidas loses ground to Nike in western Europe   (Adds investor, analyst comment, background)By Jörn PoltzMUNICH, Sept 17 Shares in sportswear maker Adidas jumped on Wednesday on a report that a group of hedge funds is seeking to buy a stake to pressure management to make sweeping changes, although one of the funds dismissed this.Germany's manager magazin said hedge funds including Knight Vinke, Third Point and TCI were considering buying stake in the world's second-largest sportswear company, driving a 4 percent jump in its shares.But Eric Knight, founder of activist fund Knight Vinke, poured cold water on the report: ""We don't have a shareholding and it's not something we're following,"" Knight told Reuters. Citing unnamed financial sources, the magazine said the funds would seek radical changes at Adidas, including the removal of Chief Executive Herbert Hainer and the possible spin off of fitness brand Reebok and golf label TaylorMade.An Adidas spokeswoman declined to comment on the magazine report. But she also said: ""We constantly conduct an open and constructive dialogue with investors.""TCI and Third Point declined to comment. Adidas has been losing market share in its home territory of western Europe to larger U.S. rival Nike and has failed to make serious inroads in North America despite buying golf market leader TaylorMade in 1997 and Reebok in 2006.The company issued its third profit warning in a year in July, blaming a plunge in sales at its golf business and its exposure to a weak Russian market.Adidas shares, which have fallen by more than a third this year, were up 4.1 percent by 1334 GMT, leading a 0.5 percent rise in the German DAX index.They had already risen earlier this week on a Wall Street Journal report that unnamed investors had met with the company to demand management changes, including the possible early replacement of Hainer, CEO since 2001. ""The stock is trading with a management discount,"" Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which is the ninth-biggest investor in Adidas with a 1.2 percent stake, told Reuters.Speich, who called unsuccessfully on shareholders in May to refuse to grant the customary endorsement of management's actions, said that Adidas' diminished market capitalisation of 12 billion euros ($15.6 billion) could make it easy for hedge funds to build up an influential stake.But Equinet analyst Ingbert Faust, rejected the possibility that Hainer would be easily unseated.""Of course some investors are unhappy for good reason,"" he said. ""I don't expect the dismissal of the executive board ... Such reports are really worthless. The fact that they move the share price shows that the stock is undervalued.""Hainer had his contract extended until 2017 earlier this year to allow the company to work on a succession plan. He has recently overhauled top management, appointing Roland Auschel and Eric Liedtke as new heads of global sales and global brands.(1 US dollar = 0.7715 euro)   (Additional reporting by Simon Jessop in London and Thomas Atkins in Frankfurt; writing by Emma Thomasson; Editing by David Clarke and Jane Merriman)",2014-09-17,NKE,"Wed Sep 17, 2014 | 11:31am EDT",UPDATE 2-Adidas shares jump on report of hedge fund activism,http://www.reuters.com//article/adidas-hedgefunds-idUSL6N0RI1ET20140917?type=companyNews
87,"   By Prak Chan Thul | PHNOM PENH  PHNOM PENH Cambodia deployed armed troops in its capital on Wednesday as garment workers held rallies to revive a campaign for higher wages that had helped to stoke a year-long political crisis.About 500 textile workers rallied in an industrial suburb of Phnom Penh, demanding a sharp hike in the monthly minimum wage to $177 from $100, as dozens of soldiers armed with assault rifles watched. Witnesses said army helicopters flew over the factories earlier.About 100 police were also deployed at economic zones in Svay Rieng province, bordering Vietnam, where garment workers also gathered, Pav Sina, president of the Collective Union Movement of Workers, told Reuters.    ""Why is our government so afraid of its own people, especially people who are only protesting to earn a basic salary?"" said Naly Pilorge, director of rights group Licadho.Licardo said two union leaders were arrested by police.But no incidents of violence were reported.The growth of the garment sector has become a vital but troublesome issue for the government of long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen. It has been a boon for the fledgling economy, providing as many as half a million jobs and generating $5 billion annually, but frequent protests by increasingly assertive unions have tested the government's patience.At stake if the campaign leads to prolonged strikes is the possibility of reduced orders from firms that outsource to Cambodian factories, such as Gap, Nike, H & M Hennes & Mauritz and Zara, owned by Inditex. ""We want to send a message to all buyers that they must provide a basic wage,"" Ath Thon, president of the biggest independent union, the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers Democratic Union, told reporters at the rally. VIOLENT CRACKDOWN Cambodia's garment sector is dwarfed by those in China and Vietnam, but lower wages have lured brands to the country. However, complaints about ""sweat shop"" working conditions and a crackdown by security forces in January, which killed at least five people, could damage the reputations of the brands.Instability in Cambodia comes as Myanmar offers generous tax breaks to manufacturers and Vietnam, which exported $18 billion worth of textiles last year, negotiates a raft of global trade deals to slash tariffs.Ath Thon said an alliance of union activists was also lending support for Wednesday's campaign in numerous capital cities by delivering petitions to Cambodian embassies and high street stores selling garments made in Cambodia. IndustriALL, which represents 50 million workers in 140 countries, said campaign activities had taken place in Australia, Belgium and Switzerland.""They understand that Cambodia's garment sector has victimized many workers and when they couldn't receive the basic wage, they protested and got killed,"" Ath Thon said, adding that 400,000 Cambodian textile workers participated in the campaign.The long-running dispute over pay looked to have been settled prior to last year's election, when the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia agreed to gradually raise the minimum wage to $160 by 2018.But things changed when the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) made an election campaign pledge to raise the figure further. CNRP won support from textile unions during its months of street protests to demand a re-run of a July 2013 poll it said was rigged by the ruling party. CNRP struck a deal with the Cambodian People's Party two months ago to end its year-long parliamentary boycott and a fragile truce remains, although it is unclear whether CNRP is backing the latest wage campaign.

96,"   By Emma Thomasson | HERZOGENAURACH Germany  HERZOGENAURACH Germany Adidas (ADSGn.DE) needs world-class designers, brand experts and technical whizzkids to improve its image against U.S. rival Nike (NKE.N), but persuading them to move to its headquarters in rural Germany is difficult.Adidas has been losing market share to the world's biggest sportswear brand Nike, which is seen as far cooler in consumer surveys and is based near the hip U.S. city of Portland, Oregon. Adidas acknowledges it is hard to recruit at its headquarters near the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach, particularly for design, marketing and digital roles, and admits it missed trends in the U.S. market, where Under Armour (UA.N) has just overtaken it as No. 2 behind Nike. Nike's better than expected earnings on Sept. 25 underscored its ascendancy.Adidas is responding by locating some key design roles in the United States at the same time as investing heavily in new facilities at its home base near the historic Bavarian town where Adidas was founded by shoe maker Adi Dassler in 1949.""We need a lot of that top talent that is cutting edge. Ideally, they are working in the tech industry, in marketing organizations or are coming from top competitors. We need an environment that appeals to them,"" said Steve Fogarty, who is responsible for employer branding and digital recruiting""Designers tend to gravitate to very large, international cities like Berlin, Amsterdam, London and it is a bit harder to convince them to move to the center of Germany.""Eric Liedtke, the American who took over as Adidas head of global brands in March, has promoted Paul Gaudio to the role of global creative director and moved him from Herzo to the firm's U.S. base in Portland in a bid to turn around its fortunes in the world's biggest market for sporting goods. Close to 1,000 Adidas staff are based in Portland, compared with Nike's 8,500-strong workforce in the area.Gaudio announced on Wednesday that Adidas will open a small creative studio in New York's Brooklyn district in 2015 to be led by three young footwear designers he has poached from Nike with a mission to explore design direction for the brand.That will complement existing creative centers in Shanghai, Tokyo and Rio, but the vast majority of the company's hundreds of designers for football, outdoor, Originals fashion, training and running products remain based in Herzo.Adidas shares are down more than a third this year, most recently suffering from a third profit warning in a year in July that the firm blamed in part on a disappointing performance in North America, particularly from its golf business.Adidas trades at 17 times expected earnings, at a discount to Nike's 22.5 times and fast-growing Under Armour's 58 times.Despite the new designers in the United States, long-serving Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, himself a native of Bavaria, remains committed to the company's base in a region proud of its strong economy and companies including BMW, Siemens, Audi, Munich Re and Allianz. About 3,900 of the total Adidas staff of 52,500 work in and around Herzo, about a third of them from outside Germany, and Hainer said last month the company planned to add 100-150 new staff at its headquarters every year.GLOBAL FOOTWEAR HUB  While Bavaria has a reputation for beer festivals, lederhosen and conservative politics, Nike's home town of Portland is a city of 600,000 that prides itself on its liberal values and environmental awareness, as well as a proliferation of trendy eateries and microbreweries.Based on a campus in Beaverton, seven miles (11 km) outside Portland, Nike's location in the American northwest also raised questions in its early days in the 1960s, with founder and Oregon native Phil Knight saying everybody originally thought it should be located in New England or the South.But Portland has since become a magnet for the global footwear industry, helped by the relatively short hop to Asian production hubs and a youthful talent pool, prompting Adidas to move its North America headquarters there from New Jersey in 1993, and drawing U.S. brands like Columbia Sportwear and Keen.Herzo, by contrast, is a town of just 24,000 people set in rolling fields, though many Adidas staff commute from the nearby university town of Erlangen or the city of Nuremberg, known for its walled old town, gingerbread and sausages but not for the most vibrant nightlife or fashion scene.Nuremberg has an airport with direct flights to many cities in Europe but not further afield and there is no train link to Herzo from Nuremberg or Erlangen, meaning most staff have to commute by car.Herzo's biggest employer is family-owned Schaeffler, which has 9,000 staff in the town, mostly in technical roles producing precision products for the auto and aerospace industry. It is also home to rival sportswear firm Puma (PUMG.DE).Conscious that it was not the best location for a big global consumer brand, Adidas considered leaving Herzo in the 1990s when the company was trying to rebuild its fortunes after flirting with bankruptcy following the death of founder Dassler in 1978 and then his son Horst in 1987. But when the departure of U.S. troops from Germany at the end of the Cold War freed up the military base outside Herzo, local authorities persuaded Adidas to stay. It moved its headquarters to the base in 1998 from an overcrowded office in downtown Herzo and has been expanding the campus ever since.SAFE BUT DULL Herzogenaurach mayor German Hacker said surveys showed that foreign inhabitants particularly value the high quality of life and security that the town offers.""Herzogenaurach is a sheltered and manageable town. That is its charm, but you can get to big towns in 10-15 minutes if you want,"" he said.

Nike's better than expected earnings on Sept. 25 underscored its ascendancy.Adidas is responding by locating some key design roles in the United States at the same time as investing heavily in new facilities at its home base near the historic Bavarian town where Adidas was founded by shoe maker Adi Dassler in 1949.""We need a lot of that top talent that is cutting edge.

Close to 1,000 Adidas staff are based in Portland, compared with Nike's 8,500-strong workforce in the area.Gaudio announced on Wednesday that Adidas will open a small creative studio in New York's Brooklyn district in 2015 to be led by three young footwear designers he has poached from Nike with a mission to explore design direction for the brand.That will complement existing creative centres in Shanghai, Tokyo and Rio, but the vast majority of the company's hundreds of designers for football, outdoor, Originals fashion, training and running products remain based in Herzo.Adidas shares are down more than a third this year, most recently suffering from a third profit warning in a year in July that the firm blamed in part on a disappointing performance in North America, particularly from its golf business.Adidas trades at 17 times expected earnings, at a discount to Nike's 22.5 times and fast-growing Under Armour's 58 times.Despite the new designers in the United States, long-serving Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, himself a native of Bavaria, remains committed to the company's base in a region proud of its strong economy and companies including BMW, Siemens, Audi, Munich Re and Allianz.About 3,900 of the total Adidas staff of 52,500 work in and around Herzo, about a third of them from outside Germany, and Hainer said last month the company planned to add 100-150 new staff at its headquarters every year.

It is also home to rival sportswear firm Puma. Conscious that it was not the best location for a big global consumer brand, Adidas considered leaving Herzo in the 1990s when the company was trying to rebuild its fortunes after flirting with bankruptcy following the death of founder Dassler in 1978 and then his son Horst in 1987.But when the departure of U.S. troops from Germany at the end of the Cold War freed up the military base outside Herzo, local authorities persuaded Adidas to stay.

99,"  * Share buy back to start in Q4, run to end 2017* Adidas says won't cut investment* Shares down a third this year as Nike gains ground   (Adds spokesman, shareholder comment, background)By Emma ThomassonPARIS, Oct 1 German sportswear maker Adidas , facing investor discontent after a series of profit warnings, plans to return  as much as 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to shareholders over the next three years.The shareholder return programme would be financed mainly from the group's free cash flow, with buybacks to start in the current quarter and be completed by the end of 2017, Adidas said in a statement on Wednesday.The buybacks would not come at the expense of a planned hike in investment in marketing, an Adidas spokesman added.The company, struggling to keep pace with larger U.S. rival Nike in the sportswear market, issued its third profit warning in a year in July, blaming a plunge in sales at its golf business and exposure to a weak Russian market. ""This is just a sop for beleaguered shareholders, but does not solve the operational problems at Adidas. Top management seems to be under enormous pressure,"" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which is the ninth-biggest investor in Adidas with a 1.2 percent stake.Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said in August that Adidas had no plans for a share buyback.Adidas shares, which are down more than a third this year, traded 1.9 percent higher by 0918 GMT, outperforming Germany's blue-chip index, which was 0.2 percent higher.""Given our group's strong projected cash flow generation and healthy balance sheet, we have the necessary funding for both reinvestments for growth as well as cash returns to shareholders,"" a company spokesman said in an emailed comment. Adidas has said it would increase spending on marketing and invest more in its own stores, although it is scaling back expansion plans in Russia due to higher risks to consumer sentiment and spending over the Ukraine crisis. LOSING MARKET SHARE While Nike has encroached on Adidas's home territory in western Europe, the German firm has failed to make serious inroads in North America. Its U.S. rival extended its lead to take a 15 percent global market share in 2013 compared with 10.8 percent for Adidas, according to Euromonitor.Last month, Germany's manager magazin said hedge funds including Knight Vinke, Third Point and TCI were considering buying stakes in Adidas to pressure management to make sweeping changes, although one of the funds dismissed this.The magazine said the funds would seek radical changes at Adidas, including the removal of CEO Hainer and the possible spin off of fitness brand Reebok and golf label TaylorMade.Hainer had his contract extended until 2017 earlier this year to allow the company to work on a succession plan. He has recently overhauled top management, appointing Roland Auschel and Eric Liedtke as new heads of global sales and global brands.Adidas said the buybacks were in addition to the company's policy of paying out 20-40 percent of its net income as a dividend to shareholders .Adidas also said it would issue two Eurobonds with a total volume of up to 1 billion euros - with a seven and 12 year term - saying it would use the proceeds to pay down debt and to prefund future debt maturities, pension payments and returns to shareholders.

100,"  BERLIN German sportswear firm Adidas (ADSGn.DE) has appointed two new senior managers as part of an ongoing overhaul of its top leadership aimed at making the firm quicker to respond to consumer trends to keep up with bigger rival Nike (NKE.N).Adidas said Karen Parkin, a 49-year-old British national, would take over as chief human resources officer from Nov. 1, reporting directly to Chief Executive Herbert Hainer.Parkin joined Adidas in 1997 and has been in charge of the company's global supply chain since 2013 after nine years working in North America. She replaces Matthias Malessa, who left the company at the end of July.Adidas said Jan Brecht, a 42-year-old who joined Adidas from German carmaker Daimler in 2009, would add Parkin's supply chain function to his current role as chief information officer, and report in future to Glenn Bennett, the executive board member responsible for global operations. Adidas, accused of being too slow to react to fast-changing fashion and sport trends, said it hoped that bringing together the supply chain and information technology functions will help simplify and accelerate processes. ""The sporting goods and lifestyle market is in permanent flux. Speed will be a significant advantage which ensures that the group's products reach consumers faster,"" Adidas said in a statement. Hainer, facing investor discontent after a series of profit warnings, has overhauled top management in the last year, appointing Eric Liedtke as global head of brands, Roland Auschel as head of global sales and Mark King as new head of the struggling North America business.Those three leaders have been working with Hainer on a new strategic plan expected early next year and restructuring their own teams, naming 11 new direct reports in recent months. Hainer, who has been CEO since 2001, had his contract extended until 2017 earlier this year to allow the company to work on a succession plan, but some investors believe a change at the top should come sooner than that.

101,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN German sportswear firm Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE), struggling to keep pace with larger U.S. rival Nike (NKE.N), reported progress on Thursday at clearing a backlog of stock as sales recovered in key markets, helping its shares rise strongly.Adidas, whose long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer is under pressure after a series of profit warnings, confirmed its sales and profit forecasts for 2014 after reporting third-quarter results at the upper end of analyst expectations.Hainer said he had been aggressively addressing the group's key challenges -- restructuring its golf business, scaling back expansion in Russia and seeking to revive momentum in the U.S. market, adding he will present a new strategic plan in March.Third-quarter sales growth in western Europe accelerated to 10 percent from a currency-neutral 6 percent in the first half. The group slowed its decline in North America as growth of the core Adidas brand helped compensate for slumping golf sales.Adidas is the kit supplier to Germany's world champion soccer team but has been losing market share to Nike which has been better a creating a buzz with its brand among fashion and sports-mad youngsters. Equinet analyst Ingbert Faust said the improvement in Europe was encouraging given that Nike had reported strong growth in the region, raising fears of major pressure on Adidas in its home region.""Around 12 percent growth in sales of brand Adidas is not too much short of the around 15 percent growth at Nike in the last quarter,"" said Faust, who rates Adidas as ""buy"". Adidas cut inventory growth to 7 percent at the end of September on a currency-neutral basis from 16 percent at the end of June, as it cleared stock, particularly in Russia, where flagging consumer confidence has forced it to mark down goods.Adidas shares, down around 39 percent this year, were up 3.3 percent at 1145 GMT (6.45 a.m. EST), compared with a 0.2 percent rise for the  German blue-chip index .GDAXI. Adidas shares trade at 16.5 times forward earnings, a discount to 24.4 times for Nike.Hainer told a conference call for journalists that Adidas wanted to trim inventories by a rate of more than 10 percent in 2014 and to continue reducing absolute levels next year. GROSS MARGIN TARGET CUT Markdowns to clear stock in Russia and the golf unit weighed on the gross margin in the quarter, which fell to 47.4 percent, prompting Adidas to trim its gross margin target for the full year to 48-48.5 percent from 48.5-49 percent. By contrast, Nike's gross margin grew to 46.6 percent in the quarter to Aug. 31 from 44.9 percent the previous three months as the company focused on higher-margin products like Flyknit soccer boots even as it spent heavily on World Cup marketing. To reduce its exposure to the weak rouble, Adidas, which runs more than 1,100 stores in Russia, will cut the number of net new stores it plans there to around 30 per year in 2014 and 2015, from an already reduced target of 80 per year. Hainer said Adidas was making progress in turning around its struggling golf business, cutting 15 percent of staff. He said sales and margins at the unit should stabilize and grow in 2015.Adidas said it expects sales to rise at a mid single-digit rate in 2015, while net income should grow at a higher rate than group sales. Adidas sales are traditionally slower in years with no major sporting events like the World Cup or Olympics.Adidas reported a 13 percent fall in third quarter operating profit to 405 million euros ($507 million) on sales up 6 percent to 4.118 billion, slightly ahead of average analyst forecasts for 399 million and 4 billion, respectively. Adidas also gave more details of a 1.5 billion euro share buyback plan it announced last month, seen as an attempt to placate investors and fend off moves by activist funds. It will launch a first tranche on Friday of up to 300 million euros.But Hainer declined to comment on reports that an investor group that includes Jynwel Capital and funds affiliated with the Abu Dhabi government plan a $2.2 billion bid to buy Reebok, the fitness brand Adidas acquired in 2006.

Adidas sales are traditionally slower in years with no major sporting events like the World Cup or Olympics.Adidas reported a 13 percent fall in third quarter operating profit to 405 million euros ($507 million) on sales up 6 percent to 4.118 billion, slightly ahead of average analyst forecasts for 399 million and 4 billion, respectively.Adidas also gave more details of a 1.5 billion euro share buyback plan it announced last month, seen as an attempt to placate investors and fend off moves by activist funds. It will launch a first tranche on Friday of up to 300 million euros.But Hainer declined to comment on reports that an investor group that includes Jynwel Capital and funds affiliated with the Abu Dhabi government plan a $2.2 billion bid to buy Reebok, the fitness brand Adidas acquired in 2006.

110,"  * ""Millennial"" generation keen on self-expression* Mars, Coca-Cola, Nike, Adidas offer personalised products* Co-creation trend spreads as technology advances* Personalisation helps retailers draw shoppers to storesBy Emma ThomassonBERLIN, Dec 11 Looking for a unique Christmas gift to wow friends or family? Try some specially tailored perfume, chocolates stamped with a personal message or sneakers embossed with a selfie.Products with that individual twist are not really new. It has long been possible to get a basic T-shirt, baseball cap or umbrella printed with a name or photo.But big consumer brands, including major names like Coca-Cola, and Nike have latched on to personalised products because they seem to have a particular appeal to consumers known as ""Millennials"" in marketing speak.Used to posting selfie mobile phone shots on social media, this generation, who came of age from around 2000, wants something more than just the latest hot brand name.Millennials still like brands but expect them to listen and react to their ideas and criticism in real time and allow them a role in shaping future products. They have become a big focus of marketing experts as their spending power grows.""They're drawn to brands who are rethinking the way things are done. They want to be heard,"" Maryleigh Bliss, trends editor at youth marketing firm Ypulse, told the World Retail Congress earlier this year.Early to respond was Mars Inc, which prints tiny personal messages and photos on M&Ms chocolates, and Coca-Cola which scored a hit by putting people's names on its bottles, selling more than 150 million.""It was a crazy idea but ... it really connected because it has all the characteristics that appeal to Millennials,"" Coca-Cola chief marketing officer Joe Tripodi said.""It was customisable, it was social."" Coca-Cola has gone a step further to produce its first fully user-generated commercial, including shaky videos showing its fans enjoying a Coke. It has also come up with the Freestyle machine which allows people to mix their own soft drink.The ""co-creation"" fad is spreading to more complex products and processes as technology brings down costs.U.S. sportswear firm Nike allows people to customise colours of shoes and accessories. German rival Adidas has tapped into the selfie obsession by offering shoppers the option to put personal images on the uppers of ZX Flux sneakers. THE FUTURE OF RETAIL? While Adidas customers currently have to wait three to four weeks for the delivery of ""selfie shoes,"" the proliferation of technology like 3-D printing means it might not be long before personalised products can be made on the spot in a store.Ben Perkins, a consumer expert at consultants Deloitte, said brands and retailers have to act fast to keep up with rising expectations for more personalisation.""As speeds improve, this kind of real-time product design, development and manufacture is going to be increasingly scaled,"" he said. ""Don't look at your customer base today but look at them tomorrow and think about how you need to embed these approaches and technologies ... in your organisation now.""Retailers trying to cope with the growth of online shopping are also looking at co-creation as a way to attract consumers back into their stores.British department store Selfridges and Swiss fragrance maker Givaudan created a ""lab"" installation where shoppers can develop a perfume, bottle shape and label tailored to their personality.Australian online start-up Shoes of Prey allows customers to choose from 170 different fabrics to design their own shoes. It launched studios in six branches of upscale U.S. department store chain Nordstrom last month.Shoes of Prey delivers within four weeks but is working towards a two-week turnaround. Chief Executive Michael Fox said that the business model was more profitable and involved less waste as there was no need to discount excess stock.""Customers are looking to participate in the design process to get exactly what they want. Together we see customisation and manufacturing on demand as the future of retail,"" Fox said.       (Reporting by Emma Thomasson.

Puma has been spending heavily on marketing - including a kit deal with English soccer team Arsenal and a big advertising drive - as it seeks to make up ground lost in recent years to market leader Nike and German rival Adidas.Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said finding a top name for women's training was important to complement the brand's strength in football, running and motorsport.""Rihanna was a natural choice for us,"" Gulden said. ""Her global profile, her charisma and individuality, her ambition, all these things make her a perfect ambassador for our brand."" Puma said Rihanna would directly influence product collections from next year, and would be involved in consumer and retail events as well as social media content.The company, which did not give any financial details for the deal, is seeking to tap into fast-growing sales of sports-inspired fashion for women, which has helped drive the rise of the likes of Canadian yogawear chain Lululemon Athletica Inc. Nike invited 27 of the world's top female athletes to a glitzy event in New York in October to present its new collections for women, while Under Armour signed a deal in September with supermodel Gisele Buendchen.Nike expects its women's business to grow faster than its other divisions and to account for 19 percent of targeted group sales of $36 billion by 2017, from under 18 percent now.""(Running) tights are the new denim,"" wrote Nomura analysts as they reiterated a ""buy"" rating on the Nike stock following the women's event. ""We remain excited about the growth drivers behind this business's potential.""Adidas, which has a more fashion-inspired offering than Nike due to its Originals and NEO streetwear brands, already makes an estimated 30 percent of its sales from women's products, helped by collaborations with celebrities such as Rita Ora, Stella McCartney and Selena Gomez.It has launched marketing campaigns targeted at women in key markets like the United States and China in the last 18 months.

115,"  * Brent holds above $60 a barrel* Indexes: Dow down 0.1 pct, S&P up 0.1 pct, Nasdaq up 0.2 pct   (Updates to early afternoon)By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK, Dec 19 U.S. stocks were little changed on Friday after the market's best two-day run in more than three years, with shares of Nike weighing on the Dow while energy shares led a modest advance on the benchmark S&P 500.The S&P 500 index had climbed 4.5 percent over the previous two sessions, spurred by the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to take a ""patient"" approach toward raising interest rates, while signaling it was on track to boost rates in 2015. That provided clarity and relief to investors over the policy outlook, analysts said. Brent crude oil advanced above $60 a barrel on Friday, recovering from near a 5-1/2-year low, while WTI crude  climbed 3.3 percent to $55.90.The benchmark stock index has risen more than 3 percent this week, putting the S&P on track for its best weekly performance in two months. It has erased nearly all the losses from the prior week, which were spurred by a sharp drop in oil prices. Shares of Nike shed 2.8 percent, a day after the company flagged slowing growth in western Europe.At 1:16 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average  fell 12.64 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,765.51, the S&P 500  gained 2.58 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,063.81 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.18 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,755.57. Quadruple witching - the expiration of stock options, index options, index futures and single-stock futures - may add to the day's volatility, along with the rebalancing of the S&P 500, which is scheduled to take effect after the close.Shares of Red Hat surged 10.9 percent after it raised its profit forecast for the full year and reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat expectations.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,780 to 1,258, for a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,389 issues rose and 1,265 fell for a 1.10-to-1 ratio.The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 102 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 94 new highs and 35 new lows.

He is due to launch a new long-term strategic plan on March 26 together with his two most likely successors, global brand chief Eric Liedtke and sales boss Roland Auschel.Hainer said he wants to get the plan off to a ""great start"", without saying if he will see out his existing contract.Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment which has a 0.9 percent stake in Adidas, said the CEO should go as quickly as possible.""A new strategy will only be credible with a new leadership,"" Speich, who has been Hainer's most outspoken critic, told journalists in an email. ""The sooner Mr Hainer hands the baton on to a successor, the better.""HAINER ROSE THROUGH RANKS Manager Magazin said Hainer would target 20 billion euros  ($22.7 billion) of annual sales and an operating margin of at least 10 percent by 2020, up from 14.8 billion and 8.3 percent last year respectively. Nike is targeting revenue of $36 billion by fiscal 2017. Hainer said the plan would show the ambition of Adidas to be the best sports company in the world, but declined to give further details.He said Adidas had made a ""fantastic start"" to 2015 after he restructured the struggling golf business, sold the non-core Rockport brand and launched a big marketing drive, including campaigns with singers Pharrell Williams and Kanye West.Hainer started out as a sales manager for consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble, joining Adidas in 1987 and rising rapidly through the ranks to take over as CEO in 2001.Sales have more than doubled during his 14-year tenure, but those of Nike and other rivals have grown even faster as Adidas failed to crack the U.S. market despite buying the Reebok brand in 2006. It recently slipped into third place in the United States behind Nike and relative newcomer Under Armour.Hainer's woes were compounded last year by a sudden slowdown in the golf market and the firm's deep exposure to Russia, where the tumbling rouble has scaled back new store openings.A series of profit warnings prompted rumblings from shareholders, with hedge funds reported to be considering buying stakes in Adidas to force Hainer out.The company's shares were up 3.4 percent by 1410 GMT on Thursday, making them the biggest gainer on the German blue-chip index DAX.

S&P 500 earnings projections for the quarter and for 2015 have fallen sharply since Jan. 1.Among early reporters, Nike jumped 4.8 percent to $103.02 as the biggest boost to the Dow after it posted a quarterly profit that beat market estimates. The world's largest sportswear maker sold more higher margin shoes and apparel, but warned that the stronger dollar would take a toll on its current quarter. Biotechs were on track for their eighth straight advance, powered by a 7.1 percent climb in Biogen Idec to $464.26.The company said its experimental drug became the first Alzheimer's treatment to significantly slow cognitive decline and reduce brain plaque in patients with early and mild forms of the disease, according to a small study. The Nasdaq biotech  index has gained 7.3 percent since March 10.The Nasdaq was well above the 5,000 level and about 11 points from its record closing high. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, was down 9 percent, and remains below the 13 level. That suggests ""the smart money is not really concerned about a downturn right now,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.At 1:38 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 229.38 points, or 1.28 percent, to 18,188.41, the S&P 500  gained 23.89 points, or 1.14 percent, to 2,113.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.73 points, or 0.96 percent, to 5,040.11.The S&P 500 is up 2.8 percent for the week and is on track for its first weekly gain in four.

130,"  * Euro set for best week in over two years* Wall St stocks rally; S&P set for weekly gain* Oil sharply higher despite oversupply concerns* European stocks helped after Athens' assurances   (Updates to afternoon trading, recasts lead and adds Nike results)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, March 20 The U.S. dollar fell sharply on Friday and was on track for its biggest weekly decline against the euro in more than three years, helping to drive a rally in Wall Street stocks and crude oil.Riskier assets like equities were in general on track for a strong week, largely driven by the Federal Reserve's policy statement on Wednesday, which struck a more dovish tone than investors had expected. The Fed appeared to argue against an interest rate hike in June.The dollar index is up more than 20 percent since mid-2014. The dollar's strength for some time buoyed U.S. stocks because it served as evidence of a growing economy, but lately there have been concerns of the impact on profits of U.S. multinational companies. U.S. crude futures were on track for their first weekly advance of the past five, while the S&P 500 was set to snap a three-week losing streak. The euro was on pace for its biggest weekly jump against the dollar in more than three years, while the U.S. dollar index was set for its biggest weekly drop since 2011.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 1.7 percent, its biggest one-day decline since October 2011. The euro rose 1.87 percent to $1.0859 on Friday, while the yen rose 0.54 percent against the dollar.""This is just some counter-trend correction in the dollar and is transitory,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist, at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. European equities closed higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  posted its highest close since mid-2007, finishing up 0.8 percent at 1,610.93. Greek equities rose 2.9 percent after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras assured European Union creditors his coalition would soon present economic reforms to unlock cash to stave off bankruptcy. In addition, the longer-term weakness of the euro was seen as boosting the region's economy and corporate earnings.MSCI's all-country world index of equity performance in 46 countries rose 1.54 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 226.52 points, or 1.26 percent, to 18,185.55, the S&P 500 gained 24.13 points, or 1.15 percent, to 2,113.4, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 47.84 points, or 0.96 percent, to 5,040.22.Share of Nike Inc, a Dow component, jumped 5 percent, to $103.40, a day after the company reported strong quarterly results, though it warned about the impact of the dollar on the current quarter. ""The reaction to Nike has been positive and the stock is up nicely. It has been a strong name, but currency is going to have an impact,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.The biotech index rose 0.5, powered by a 9.4 percent gain in Biogen Idec after the company announced promising results of an early-stage study of its drug to treat Alzheimer's.The market may see heightened volatility heading into Friday's close as a result of quadruple witching: the expiration of stock options, index options, index futures and single-stock futures.The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 12/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 1.9303 percent.Brent crude rose 1 percent to $54.99 per barrel while U.S. crude futures for April delivery jumped 5 percent to $46.17. While concerns remain about oversupply, oil was boosted by the dollar's decline.Both gold and silver rose for a third straight session, also helped by the dollar's weakness.  Gold rose 1.2 percent while silver jumped 4.7 percent. Copper  rose 3.2 percent.

But JD.com still trails far behind Alibaba in Chinese e-commerce. Alibaba's high profile since its record-breaking $25 billion U.S. listing in September is a huge lure for brands looking to enter or raise their presence in China, which some analysts estimate as the world's biggest online shopping market.""Imported goods have always been huge sellers on JD.com, and this massively expands the range of products available to Chinese consumers,"" said Leo Li, who oversees JD Worldwide, in an e-mail to Reuters.

Alibaba's stock price, on the other hand, has fallen 18 percent in the same period.Analysts have expressed concern over counterfeits on the world's largest e-commerce firm's platforms, as well as lacklustre earnings and investor excitement wearing off after the initial public offering.

139,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN German sportswear company Adidas (ADSGn.DE) turned around its sales in North America in the first quarter, helped by a marketing campaign designed to win business from dominant rival Nike(NKE.N).Adidas said group sales rose 17 percent to 4.08 billion euros ($4.54 billion), or 9 percent excluding the impact of currencies, beating an average analyst forecast for 3.91 billion and lifting its shares more than 1 percent.Despite the hike in marketing spending, Adidas increased its operating margin by 10 basis points to 8.9 percent, still well behind the 13 percent achieved by Nike last year.Long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, who faced calls to quit last year as Adidas lost more ground to Nike, said the sales improvement was broad-based, with particularly strong growth in the running and fashion businesses.While western Europe and China grew fast, Hainer also highlighted a 7 percent currency-neutral rise in North American sales in the first three months of the year, which he said showed the initial success of splashy brand campaigns.""It is just the beginning. America is not a sprint for us, it is more a marathon... We still have a lot of work ahead of us,"" Hainer told a conference call for journalists.The figures should help reassure investors ahead of the Adidas annual general meeting on Thursday, when Hainer is likely to face calls for clarity on his leadership after the board launched a formal search for a successor.Hainer, who has been CEO since 2001, said on Tuesday that turning the business around was more important than whether he stays on until the end of his contract in 2017.Hainer launched a new five-year strategy last month to lift sales by almost half to above 22 billion euros, focusing on speeding up the supply chain and achieving success in the United States and the world's largest cities.

141,"   By Roberta Rampton and Krista Hughes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 6 President Barack Obama will make a high-profile pitch for a Pacific trade deal he promises will protect workers on Friday at Nike Inc, a company once reviled for using Asian sweatshops to make its famous sneakers.In choosing the company's Oregon headquarters as the backdrop for his message, Obama risks reminding people of global trade's downside just when he needs to convince nervous Democrats to back the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a key plank of the administration's strategic pivot to Asia.But appearing at Nike also allows Obama to talk about how things have changed from previous trade deals, and to associate his TPP with a company that says it has learned from the past mistakes of globalization.Obama calls the TPP ""the most progressive trade agreement in our history,"" but officials declined to say why he chose Nike to showcase a deal economists say will add $77.5 billion to U.S. annual economic output.Stories exposing low wages and abuse at Indonesian shoe factories supplying Nike surfaced in the early 1990s, eventually sparking consumer boycotts.In 1998, then-chief executive Phil Knight acknowledged that his product ""has become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse"" and pledged to raise standards.Nike required contractors to sign a code of conduct and hired auditors to monitor changes.Although the approach had little impact initially, conditions improved significantly after Nike began training and working more closely with suppliers, said Richard Locke of Brown University, who began studying the company in 2002. ""They're still being paid less than they would be paid here, because wage rates are lower in these countries,"" said Locke, who has pored over Nike's internal audit data.""But the actual working conditions - pace, cleanliness, healthiness - it's like a modern factory anywhere.""NIKE AS TRADE SYMBOL  Skeptics point to Nike's past as vindication for their message about the TPP's dangers.""They are the symbol of what everyone is afraid the future under TPP will be, which is a United States brand name, a handful of well-paid, high-income professional jobs ... and then production offshore to the lowest possible wage venues,"" said Lori Wallach of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.Nike employs about 26,000 Americans, 8,000 in Oregon, where its shoes are designed. But they are produced by more than 1 million workers in nearly 700 contract factories, a third in TPP partner Vietnam, where unions say the minimum wage is $100-$140 a month. The pact would make importing those shoes cheaper.Obama making the case that the TPP paves the way to more sustainable U.S. jobs could give political cover to Democrats  braving union opposition to support legislation to speed deals like the TPP through Congress. Four of Oregon's six Democratic members of Congress have signaled support for the bill, which is expected to be voted on by end-June. Nike said it is proud of its record in Oregon, where one in five jobs depend on trade and where it contributes $2.5 billion a year to the state economy, according to Hilary Krane, the company's general counsel and chief administrative officer.""Our whole Oregon operation from the start has been built on international trade,"" she said.Nike spokesman Greg Rossiter said the company had ""fundamentally changed the way we do business"" and improved conditions for workers in contract factories, although more work is still needed.For Nike, Obama's visit allows it to align itself as part of the ""solution"" to the ills of globalization, said Peter LaMotte, senior vice president at crisis communications firm Levick.""While there will always be those who remember Nike for the child labor issues, the vast majority of the American public will associate them more with Air Jordans,"" LaMotte said.(Reporting by Krista Hughes and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh, David Chance and Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-06,NKE,"Wed May 6, 2015 | 11:59am EDT",Obama puts Nike in trade spotlight despite sweatshop stigma of past,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-trade-obama-idUSL1N0XW27020150506?type=companyNews

147,"   By Jeff Mason | BEAVERTON, Oregon  BEAVERTON, Oregon President Barack Obama, co-opting Nike Inc's famous slogan, told Democrats on Friday to ""just do it"" and support a trade deal with Asian countries that the shoe company said would help it create up to 10,000 U.S. jobs over 10 years.The setting - Nike's headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon - was an unusual one for a presidential trade pitch. Nike has long faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its pricey footwear. But the company has worked to improve conditions overseas and said on Friday it would also boost investment in U.S. manufacturing if the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact is approved.Obama used that promise of new jobs to try to convince skeptical lawmakers from his own party to support TPP and join Republicans in granting him ""fast-track"" authority to finalize the deal. Many Democrats are concerned the proposed pact would help companies move operations to cheaper offshore facilities. ""On trade, I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong. They're just wrong,"" Obama said at Nike headquarters. ""If we don't write the rules for trade around the world, guess what: China will.""He added, ""Just do it, everybody.""SHOES FROM VIETNAM Before the trip, White House aides had been coy about why Obama chose such a controversial backdrop for his speech. An administration official said Nike had approached the White House about the trade deal and that led to Obama's appearance there.Labor and environmental groups protested Obama's appearance at Nike and said the company's job-creating claims were vague.  ""We have heard similar promises from companies before, and very few have panned out,"" said Eric Hauser, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor coalition.Nike has 26,000 U.S. employees, but it counts on more than 1 million workers in contract factories worldwide to make its shoes, some of which sell for hundreds of dollars. A third of those factories are in Vietnam, a TPP participant.Almost all footwear sold in the United States is made overseas and is subject to import tariffs that average 25 percent to 35 percent, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a shoe dealer's group.For shoes imported from TPP countries, notably Vietnam, U.S. firms paid $400 million in tariffs in 2014, the group said.Nike said relief from ""antiquated"" footwear tariffs in the TPP deal would allow it to invest more money at home. In addition to 10,000 U.S. manufacturing and engineering jobs, it promised as many as 40,000 additional jobs would pop up in its domestic supply chain if an agreement were reached.""Free trade opens doors. It removes barriers. It creates jobs,"" Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker told the crowd ahead of Obama's speech in Beaverton, seven miles from Portland.When asked, Nike offered few details on, for instance, whether it would build new plants, how soon new jobs could come on line, how much money workers might be paid, or what kind of shoes could be produced in the United States. A Nike spokesman said in an email that it was ""too early for us to say specifically where we will invest, but it will be a significant investment over the next decade.""The White House declined to provide additional details, referring questions to Nike.MORE LOBBYING EXPENSE In the past two years, Nike has ramped up its lobbying efforts as debate over the trade treaty has intensified.The company nearly tripled its lobbying spending to more than $1.1 million in 2014 from $400,000 in 2012, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington campaign finance and lobbying research group. Nike multibillionaire co-founder Philip Knight is Oregon’s richest person and leans Republican, though he has donated money over the years to both parties, including more than $85,000 to Republican congressional committees in 2013 and 2014, according to federal records analyzed by the center.Knight has also given money to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, a key supporter along with Republicans of giving Obama ""fast-track"" authority to negotiate the TPP deal.Under the deal's terms, Obama said Vietnam is one country that would be forced to improve its labor standards, set a minimum wage, and protect workers' rights to unionize.""It would be good for the workers in Vietnam even as it helps make sure that they're not undercutting competition here in the United States,"" he said.The TPP would also help more companies move advanced manufacturing to the United States, Obama added.But despite anecdotal evidence that some companies are shifting production back to the U.S., economic data suggest America's production lines rely more than ever on suppliers from low-wage countries.""The data clearly show no sign of reshoring,"" said University of Munich economist Dalia Marin, in a detailed analysis published in November.Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, a government watchdog group, said labor standards in the TPP were too weak, pointing to a U.S. Government Accountability Office study that found similar standards in trade deals with Peru, Colombia, Panama and Korea had failed to improve labor conditions in those countries.

148,"   By Joseph White, Howard Schneider and Nick Carey | DETROIT  DETROIT Nike Inc's (NKE.N) announcement that it could create up to 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States will spark further debate on whether the country is starting to see an industrial renaissance after many years of job losses.Evidence from government and private data suggests it is too early for U.S. workers, or politicians, to celebrate. Any boost in U.S. manufacturing appears so far to be, at best, modest and fragile.The athletic shoemaker Nike on Friday joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), General Electric Co (GE.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) among U.S. businesses promising to invest in manufacturing jobs in the United States.There were 12.3 million U.S. manufacturing jobs in April, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier but well below 1990, when there were almost 18 million jobs, the government reported Friday.How best to expand manufacturing employment will be a prominent question in the 2016 election cycle, especially in Midwestern states such as Ohio and Michigan. But economists and analysts say that excitement over ""reshoring,"" or shifting jobs back to the United States from overseas, is overdone.""Instead of hundreds of jobs at a time, manufacturers are hiring five or 10 people at a time,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. Other measures of manufacturing activity suggest that U.S. companies are relying on more imported parts for goods they produce. The share of U.S. intermediate goods imported from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe grew from about 2 percent in the late 1990s to almost 5 percent in 2011, only dipping briefly during the recession, according to an analysis published in November by University of Munich economist Dalia Marin.  MEXICO GAINS There are cases that counter the trends seen in the broader measures of job creation. Tailor Made Products Inc, which makes kitchen utensils, shifted production of spatulas, slotted spoons and other utensils to China about a decade ago. It was “highly likely” the company would have gone out of business otherwise, said chief financial officer Mike Retzer. But the company had problems with its Chinese suppliers, from delays at the U.S. West Coast ports to contaminants in the plastics used to make them. In April, as part of Wal-Mart's reshoring effort, Tailor Made opened a new production line in its home town of Elroy, Wisconsin. The company has invested $600,000 in the new line, adding up to 10 jobs to its work force of 65 to start with. More new jobs are expected if production expands. Many of the company’s other kitchen products are still made in China. ""We would love to move all of our production back here if we could."" Retzer said. ""But we work in an ultra-competitive environment where a penny or two on a product can make all the difference.""Michelle Gloeckler, executive vice president for U.S. manufacturing at Wal-Mart, said the retailer is on track with its plan to buy an estimated $250 billion in U.S. made goods from 2013 to 2023.  In the auto industry, which accounts for about 750,000 U.S. factory jobs, vehicle makers and their parts suppliers are shifting some production out of Asia, in part to reduce the risks posed by delays at U.S. ports or natural disasters such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan. But Mexico is landing many of those jobs, says Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. U.S. auto industry manufacturing employment will grow to about 760,000 workers and then stay at that plateau until the next cyclical downturn, he said.Average pay for U.S. auto workers has stagnated or fallen in recent years, McAlinden said. However, U.S. workers get paid far more than their Mexican counterparts. ""Mexican workers are cheaper than Chinese,"" he said. ""So why not go near-shore rather than far-shore?""In Nike’s case, the company linked its promise to create U.S. jobs to relief from tariffs on imported shoes. Those levies average around 25 percent to 35 percent, depending on the materials used and the type of shoe, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.U.S. firms paid about $400 million in tariffs in 2014 for shoes imported from countries that would be included in a Trans-Pacific trade pact, notably Vietnam, according to the trade group. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership would reduce tariffs. Nike manufactured 43 percent of its Nike brand shoes in Vietnam in the 2014 fiscal year, according to its disclosures.

152,"   By Jeff Mason | PORTLAND, Oregon  PORTLAND, Oregon May 8 Sports shoe maker Nike Inc put its weight behind President Barack Obama's push for a trade deal with Asian countries on Friday with a promise to create up to 10,000 U.S.-based manufacturing jobs if the pact is approved.In an announcement that coincided with a visit by Obama to Nike's Oregon headquarters, the company said footwear tariff relief within the proposed 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement would allow it to speed up investment in ""advanced footwear manufacturing"" in the United States.Obama is pressing the U.S. Congress to pass Trade Promotion Authority, which would enable him to negotiate international trade deals without the threat of changes by lawmakers. If TPA is passed and the TPP deal is sealed, Nike said, it would accelerate its U.S. investments and spur as many as 10,000 domestic manufacturing and engineering jobs, thousands of construction jobs, and up to 40,000 jobs elsewhere in its supply chain over 10 years.Nike has 26,000 employees in the United States and more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide that manufacture its shoes. Its top-end soccer and baseball shoes retail for more than $300. ""We believe agreements that encourage free and fair trade allow Nike to do what we do best: innovate, expand our businesses and drive economic growth,"" said Nike Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker in a media release distributed by the White House.The company did not say in the media release what it would pay those workers or where the U.S. jobs would be located. Obama is scheduled to visit Nike's headquarters later on Friday. The trip was designed to help sell the free-trade agreement to skeptical Democrats, who say it will put more American workers out of jobs and cut their wages while enriching companies.An administration official said Nike approached the White House about the issue, which led to the trip. White House aides have been coy all week about why they chose Nike, which suffered for years from a tarnished image for using Asian sweatshops to make its products.Imports accounted for as much as 98 percent of the U.S. market for apparel, although that number has fallen slightly,  according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association.

156,"  (Adds ex-FIFA vice president Warner court appearance, statements by FIFA sponsors, Nike and Coca-Cola)* Nine FIFA officials, five corporate executives indicted* Seven top soccer figures arrested in Switzerland* Authorities seek arrests of others - U.S. prosecutors* High-ranking officials in Switzerland for FIFA Congress* Swiss criminal probe related to Russia, Qatar World CupsBy Mike Collett, Brian Homewood and Nate RaymondZURICH/NEW YORK, May 27 The world's most popular sport was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday as seven senior soccer officials were arrested on U.S. corruption charges and faced extradition from Switzerland, whose authorities also announced a criminal investigation into the awarding of the next two World Cups.The arrests in a dawn raid at a five-star Zurich hotel mark an unprecedented blow against soccer's governing body FIFA, which for years has been dogged by allegations of corruption but always escaped major criminal cases.U.S. prosecutors said they aimed to make more arrests but would not be drawn on whether FIFA President Sepp Blatter, for long the most powerful man in the sport, was a target of the probe. Blatter, 79, is standing for re-election to a fifth term at the FIFA Congress in Zurich on Friday, and FIFA said the vote would go ahead as planned.The European soccer body UEFA called for the election to be postponed, saying ""the European associations will have to consider carefully if they should even attend this Congress.""In a scathing indictment of corruption in soccer, U.S. authorities said nine officials and five sports media and promotions executives were charged in cases involving more than $150 million in bribes over a period of 24 years. They said their investigation exposed complex money laundering schemes, millions of dollars in untaxed incomes and tens of millions in offshore accounts held by FIFA officials.Swiss police arrested the seven, all from the Latin American and Caribbean region, and detained them pending extradition proceedings to the United States, which could take years if they contest the process. The Federal Office of Justice in Switzerland said that six would contest extradition, but that one person agreed to be extradited.""As charged in the indictment, the defendants fostered a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for the biggest sport in the world,"" said Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. ""Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA.""Blatter, who has denied and survived allegations of his involvement in corruption, said in a statement: ""Let me be clear: such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game.""The statement also said that FIFA welcomed the actions and the investigations ""and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football.""Separate from the U.S. investigation, Swiss prosecutors said they had opened their own criminal proceedings against unidentified people on suspicion of mismanagement and money laundering related to the awarding of rights to host the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 event in Qatar. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters at a news conference in New York her office did not want to impede the 2018 and 2022 World Cups but looked forward to working with Swiss authorities investigating the award of the tournaments.""FIFA has a lot of soul searching to do,"" she said.The indictment accused the officials of using a variety of schemes to take kickbacks and bribes from sports marketing firms connected to major tournaments, and also alleged corruption in the selection of the 2010 World Cup host and the 2011 FIFA presidential election.One of those indicted, former FIFA Vice President Jack Warner of Trinidad, solicited $10 million in bribes from the South African government to host the 2010 World Cup, the Justice Department said.Warner directed a number of co-conspirators to arrange the payment, which was eventually sent from a FIFA account in Switzerland to a Bank of America account in New York that Warner controlled, the indictment said. The South African Football Association called the bribe allegations ""baseless and untested.""""THE BEGINNING...NOT THE END"" Warner, former FIFA vice president and executive committee member of CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America, Caribbean Association Football), said in a statement that he was innocent of any charges. Warner surrendered to the police mid-afternoon in Port of Spain, made an initial court appearance on 12 charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering and was granted TT$2.5 million ($400,000) bail.The United States took jurisdiction of the case in part because the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI secured the cooperation of U.S. citizen Chuck Blazer, a former top FIFA official, who U.S. officials said had not paid taxes for years. Blazer's lawyer, Eric Corngold, declined to comment.Kelly Currie, the acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said Wednesday's charges brought in the New York City borough represent ""the beginning of our effort, not the end.""Early Wednesday, FBI agents carrying bags and boxes to execute a search warrant went into the group's office in Miami Beach. Agents also used a search warrant at the offices of Traffic Sports in Miami.CONCACAF said in a statement it was ""deeply concerned by today's developments"" and that ""the Confederation will continue to cooperate with the authorities to its fullest capacity.""In addition to Blazer, 70, others who pleaded guilty were José Hawilla, 71, owner of the Traffic Group, a sports marketing firm founded in Brazil, and two of his companies; Daryan Warner, 46, and Daryll Warner, 40, sons of Jack Warner.Their lawyers declined comment or were not available to comment.""It is clear that the case is based in large part on some cooperating insiders who have already plead guilty,"" said Miami lawyer David Weinstein, former prosecutor.The FIFA officials appeared to have walked into a trap set by U.S. and Swiss authorities. The arrests were made at dawn at a plush Zurich hotel, the Baur au Lac, where officials are staying before the vote. Suites at the hotel cost up to $4,000 a night. SPONSORSHIP CONSEQUENCES The arrests could have implications for sponsorship.The indictment said that in 1996, an unidentified global sports company agreed to pay $160 million over 10 years to become Brazil's exclusive footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment supplier. That was an apparent reference to Nike Inc , which sponsored the Brazil national team.Nike said that it was cooperating with authorities. ""Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport...,"" a company statement said.The indictment said that the company agreed to additional financial terms not in the initial contract. This included paying an additional $40 million to ""a Traffic affiliate with a Swiss bank account"" and referred to as ""marketing fees.""German sportswear company Adidas, long associated with FIFA, said the soccer body should do more to establish transparent compliance standards. Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose Budweiser brand is a sponsor of the 2018 World Cup, said it was closely monitoring developments at FIFA.Coca-Cola Co, another FIFA sponsor, said the charges had ""tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations.""Officials said that following the arrests, accounts at several banks in Switzerland had been blocked.The officials arrested in Zurich are: Jeffrey Webb, vice-president of world body FIFA, president of North and Central American body CONCACAF and head of soccer in the Cayman Islands; Eduardo Li, who runs Costa Rica's soccer federation; Julio Rocha, who headed Nicaragua's federation; Eugenio Figueredo, another FIFA vice-president who used to run Uruguayan soccer; Rafael Esquivel who is the sport's boss in Venezuela; Jose Maria Marin, who used to be the head of Brazil's federation; and Costas Takkas, another CONCACAF official.Those detained or their representatives were not available to comment.Lynch said in a statement that the charges span ""at least two generations of soccer officials who, as alleged, have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.""The international governing body of football collects billions of dollars in revenue, mostly from sponsorship and television rights for World Cups. It has been dogged by reports of corruption which it says it investigates itself.""The chickens are finally coming home to roost and this sounds like a hugely significant development for FIFA,"" said Damian Collins, a British member of parliament who founded the reform group New FIFA Now.FIFA's decision to award the World Cup to Qatar, a tiny desert country with no domestic tradition of soccer, was heavily criticised by soccer officials in Western countries. FIFA was forced to acknowledge that it is too hot to play soccer there in the summer when the tournament is traditionally held, forcing schedules around the globe to be rewritten to move the event.Qatar's stock market fell sharply as news of the Swiss investigation emerged.

160,"  * Visa says disappointment with FIFA is ""profound""* Consumers attack brands on Twitter* Nike says cooperating with authorities* Adidas, Coca-Cola Hyundai, McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch concerned* World Cup seen as too lucrative to ditch   (Adds comment, background)By Anjali Athavaley and Emma ThomassonNEW YORK/BERLIN, May 28 Visa Inc has told FIFA it could end its sponsorship if soccer's governing body does not act fast to restore the reputation of the game after senior officials were arrested on  corruption charges.The statement from Visa was the strongest so far as sponsors lined up to express concern about the scandal engulfing the world's most popular sport and their customers took to social media to threaten a boycott of brands associated with FIFA.Sponsors are trying to balance the growing sensitivity of consumers to corruption, human rights abuses and environmental issues against their relationship with the organisation that holds the keys to a billion soccer fans worldwide.""Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today's developments is profound. As a sponsor, we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization,"" Visa said.""This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices,"" it said. ""Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.""U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer's world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years.Airline Emirates and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA, although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung  are reportedly in talks to replace them.Emirates and Sony were among FIFA's six main partners who together paid a total of $177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark.A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony's withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal.Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehaviour of top players on and off the pitch. Sponsors including Nike Inc dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping, but Germany's Adidas decided last year to stick with Uruguay's Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender.""Brands have to take a longer-term view. Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field,"" said Paul Smith, founder of sports marketing research group Repucom.""What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game... Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game, not of the organisation.""CLOSE TIES FIFA's longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co .Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022.That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022. ""This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,"" Coca Cola said.Adidas, which is the world's biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA ""to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards"". Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday.Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas' dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world's top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team.U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said ""the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.""She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike.Nike later said in a statement it was ""concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: ""Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery."" OTHER SPONSORS BRISTLE FIFA's main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations.Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites.That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones.The pressure only mounted after Wednesday's news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA.""Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,"" wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter.The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors.""They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company's cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,"" said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald's Corp said they were in contact with FIFA.Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first ""official"" FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA.""The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren't exposed in the same way as the sponsors,"" said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller.But brand experts were sceptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors.""Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,"" said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton.Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency agreed:""These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,"" he said.

A number of non-banks have also been targeted by regulators or the Justice Department over anti-money laundering failures.The indictment also alleged that a New Jersey-based ""Sports Marketing Company A"" paid bribes to the head of South American soccer association CONMEBOL in exchange for gaining exclusive marketing rights to the Copa Libertadores tournament.Asked Wednesday if companies that had won soccer marketing rights faced criminal liability or were being investigated, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she could not comment on specific investigation targets.

165,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Brad Haynes and Anthony BoadleSAO PAULO/BRASILIA, June 5 Nike Inc and some other big international companies face a grilling over their powerful role in Brazilian soccer as a former star player turned senator vows to expose what he describes as suspect marketing contracts and their links to corrupt payments.Romario, a revered striker who led Brazil to victory at the 1994 World Cup wearing the U.S. sportswear giant's boots, is leading a new congressional probe into sponsorship deals in the wake of U.S. graft charges that have shaken the soccer world.Three Brazilians were among those named and charged in the U.S. indictment, including a former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF).Neither Romario nor Brazilian prosecutors have alleged that Nike did anything illegal, despite the company's $160 million deal in 1996 to sponsor Brazil's team being linked to kickback payments in the U.S. indictment released last week.Nike was not named in the indictment but there was only one company that fit the prosecutors' description. In a statement last week, Nike noted that the charges did not allege it engaged in criminal conduct or that its employees were involved in or aware of bribery.Romario, Brazil's leading voice for soccer reform whose playing fame boosts his influence, says he wants to investigate such sponsorship deals to see if they were used to funnel money to officials and exert undue influence on the sport.The commission, which will start next week, will have the power to subpoena witnesses, bank records and private contracts, but cannot issue search or arrest warrants.Among companies whose sponsorship deals with the Brazil team have come under scrutiny in recent years are airline TAM, the Brazilian arm of regional giant Latam Airlines Group, and Ambev SA, now a subsidiary of Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch InBev.""These brands are going to be front and center in the investigation ... They won't be able to remain silent,"" said  Fernando Ferreira, head of sports marketing firm Pluri, citing the heavy focus on sponsors in a similar probe 15 years ago.""People are fed up and they want to know what sponsors are doing with the power of their checkbooks to demand changes in the sport.""Sponsors in Brazil have been hesitant to publicly address corruption concerns, emphasizing their support for the national team rather than the CBF. The use of intermediaries is common in contracts in Brazil and sponsors may not have any direct knowledge of wrongdoing.Previous investigations have revealed deals for broadcast and marketing rights that involve intermediary firms funneling sponsorship money to close associates of CBF officials, opening the door to kickbacks and bribery. Romario met with Brazil's top federal prosecutor on Monday and said they were cooperating on the investigation. Federal police have investigated former CBF officials for money laundering and tax evasion, but federal prosecutors have not confirmed any formal charges.One lawyer with expertise on corruption cases and corporate compliance said that the CBF's status as a private entity meant that a company could not be charged with giving it bribes.""At worst, the problem will be damage to its (the company's) image,"" said the lawyer, who asked not to be identified.Prosecutors would have to go after intermediaries on other charges, like money laundering and tax fraud, he said.""A VERY DIFFERENT MOMENT"" The U.S. indictment said that in the 1996 deal ""Sportswear Company A"" - apparently Nike - agreed to pay $40 million in ""marketing fees"" that were not in its initial contract with the CBF to the Swiss bank account of an affiliate of Brazilian sports marketing firm Traffic. Jose Hawilla, the founder of Traffic who was named by the indictment as convicted on graft charges, agreed to pay half of everything he made from the deal to an unidentified senior member of the CBF, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. That amounted to ""millions of dollars, as a bribe and kickback,"" the indictment said.The new Brazilian Senate inquiry reprises a congressional probe 15 years ago.

166,"   By Brad Haynes and Anthony Boadle | SAO PAULO/BRASILIA  SAO PAULO/BRASILIA Nike Inc and some other big international companies face a grilling over their powerful role in Brazilian soccer as a former star player turned senator vows to expose what he describes as suspect marketing contracts and their links to corrupt payments.Romario, a revered striker who led Brazil to victory at the 1994 World Cup wearing the U.S. sportswear giant's boots, is leading a new congressional probe into sponsorship deals in the wake of U.S. graft charges that have shaken the soccer world. Three Brazilians were among those named and charged in the U.S. indictment, including a former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF).Neither Romario nor Brazilian prosecutors have alleged that Nike did anything illegal, despite the company's $160 million deal in 1996 to sponsor Brazil's team being linked to kickback payments in the U.S. indictment released last week.Nike was not named in the indictment but there was only one company that fit the prosecutors' description. In a statement last week, Nike noted that the charges did not allege it engaged in criminal conduct or that its employees were involved in or aware of bribery.Romario, Brazil's leading voice for soccer reform whose playing fame boosts his influence, says he wants to investigate such sponsorship deals to see if they were used to funnel money to officials and exert undue influence on the sport.The commission, which will start next week, will have the power to subpoena witnesses, bank records and private contracts, but cannot issue search or arrest warrants. Among companies whose sponsorship deals with the Brazil team have come under scrutiny in recent years are airline TAM, the Brazilian arm of regional giant Latam Airlines Group, and Ambev SA, now a subsidiary of Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch InBev.""These brands are going to be front and center in the investigation ... They won't be able to remain silent,"" said  Fernando Ferreira, head of sports marketing firm Pluri, citing the heavy focus on sponsors in a similar probe 15 years ago. ""People are fed up and they want to know what sponsors are doing with the power of their checkbooks to demand changes in the sport.""    Sponsors in Brazil have been hesitant to publicly address corruption concerns, emphasizing their support for the national team rather than the CBF. The use of intermediaries is common in contracts in Brazil and sponsors may not have any direct knowledge of wrongdoing.Previous investigations have revealed deals for broadcast and marketing rights that involve intermediary firms funneling sponsorship money to close associates of CBF officials, opening the door to kickbacks and bribery.Romario met with Brazil's top federal prosecutor on Monday and said they were cooperating on the investigation. Federal police have investigated former CBF officials for money laundering and tax evasion, but federal prosecutors have not confirmed any formal charges. One lawyer with expertise on corruption cases and corporate compliance said that the CBF's status as a private entity meant that a company could not be charged with giving it bribes.""At worst, the problem will be damage to its (the company's) image,"" said the lawyer, who asked not to be identified.Prosecutors would have to go after intermediaries on other charges, like money laundering and tax fraud, he said.""A VERY DIFFERENT MOMENT"" The U.S. indictment said that in the 1996 deal ""Sportswear Company A"" - apparently Nike - agreed to pay $40 million in ""marketing fees"" that were not in its initial contract with the CBF to the Swiss bank account of an affiliate of Brazilian sports marketing firm Traffic.Jose Hawilla, the founder of Traffic who was named by the indictment as convicted on graft charges, agreed to pay half of everything he made from the deal to an unidentified senior member of the CBF, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. That amounted to ""millions of dollars, as a bribe and kickback,"" the indictment said.     The new Brazilian Senate inquiry reprises a congressional probe 15 years ago.

169,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nike Inc has settled a lawsuit against three former shoe designers it had accused of stealing its commercial secrets and taking them to German rival Adidas AG  with plans to open a footwear design studio in Brooklyn.The designers' attorney, Matt Levin, said in a statement Tuesday that the case had been resolved through a confidential settlement. Both Nike and Adidas declined to comment, but a clerk with the state court in Oregon, where the lawsuit was filed, said both sides agreed to dismiss the matter on June 4.Nike, the world's largest sportswear maker, sued Denis Dekovic, Marc Dolce and Mark Miner last December for at least $10 million in damages, alleging that the trio started consulting for Adidas while still working at Nike, violating their non-compete agreements. Before leaving Nike, the complaint alleged, the designers copied sensitive documents, including drawings for an unreleased shoe made for one of Nike's sponsored athletes, and tried to cover their tracks by erasing emails and text messages from their work-issued cellphones and laptops.Nike's complaint said the trio brought Adidas information about Nike's plans for its running, sportswear and soccer lines and pitched Adidas on a design studio that was a knockoff of its own design lab. Last September, Adidas announced it would open an urban footwear design studio in Brooklyn, to be staffed by Dekovic, Dolce and Miner. Nike also claimed that Adidas knew of the non-compete agreements and promised to pay for any legal fallout.In a countersuit filed in May, the designers had claimed that Nike invaded their privacy and broke federal law in accessing their personal electronic communications.

175,"  * Robots to cut labour costs by 18 pct by 2025 - BCG* Adidas targets prototype in-store production by 2016* Nike promises to create 10,000 jobs for US production* ""Knitted"" shoes need half the labour, 80 pct fewer parts* Footwear industry employs millions in China, Vietnam, BrazilBy Emma ThomassonHERZOGENAURACH, Germany, June 10 German cobbler Adi Dassler revolutionised running when he started hammering spikes into track shoes almost a century ago. Today most of the 258 million pairs of shoes produced each year by his firm Adidas  are made in low-cost Asia.That could soon change as cheaper, faster and more flexible robots mean manufacturing - including producing fiddly footwear - could be brought closer to consumers in high-wage countries like Germany, speeding up delivery and slashing freight costs in what some call a fourth industrial revolution.Adidas is working with the German government, academics and robotics firms on new technologies it hopes will trigger a significant a shift in the footwear industry as the move led by its arch rival Nike to produce in Asia decades ago.The project is part of a broader drive by Adidas to catch up with Nike, which has extended its lead as the world's biggest sportswear firm in recent years with innovative products such as its ""Flyknit"" shoes made out of machine-knitted fibre.""We will bring production back to where the main markets are,"" Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said in March. ""We will be the leader and the first mover there.""Adidas hopes to be able to produce a custom-made running shoe from scratch in a store in Berlin by next year, using a stitching machine and a foamer to make the sole.Nike, which has long faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its pricey footwear, is also investing heavily in new manufacturing methods. But it has not yet put a date on when it expects that to result in more U.S.-based production. JOBS AT RISK Key to moving footwear manufacturing closer to Western markets are technologies which cut the need for workers to  piece together shoes. A machine can now ""knit"" an upper like a sock, robots can already complete more of the final assembly of the shoe, while 3-D printing could soon allow the production of a customised sole.That could threaten millions of jobs in the footwear industry in countries like China, Brazil and Vietnam, but potentially create new positions elsewhere, albeit for more highly skilled labourers working alongside robots.Robots, now used mainly in auto production, could soon cut labour costs by 18 percent or more by 2025 in other sectors, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) predicts.The new technology is being closely guarded: photographers were not invited to an investor presentation at the Adidas innovation centre, where it demonstrated a robot that could stick its trademark three stripes to a running shoe. Nike, for its part, tried to stop Adidas producing a knitted shoe that it said violated patents for the ""Flyknit"" technology it launched in 2012. However, a German court ultimately allowed Adidas to resume production of its ""Primeknit"" shoes.Nike says it can make ""Flyknit"" shoes with half the labour input of a typical ""cut-and-sew"" shoe as it has 80 percent fewer components, also resulting in 70 percent less waste as it no longer needs to cut pieces from a pattern and discard the rest.Nike co-founder Philip Knight shook up the sporting goods industry that Adidas has dominated until the 1970s after putting into practice his thesis paper arguing that sneakers from lower-cost Japan could compete with pricier German-made versions.Today, Asia produces 87 percent of all footwear, with China by far the biggest manufacturer, followed by India, Brazil and Vietnam, according to APICCAPS, the association of Portuguese footwear manufacturers that compiles global industry figures.INCREASING SPEED TO BOOST MARGINS  Nike and Adidas each rely on more than 1 million workers in contract factories worldwide to make their shoes.While the need for speed is one motivating factor, rising wage costs, particularly in China, are also driving the shift.""That element is going up dramatically,"" said Glenn Bennett, head of global operations for Adidas who leads the project aimed at getting products to shoppers faster than the six weeks needed for shipments to arrive from Asia.Adidas is working with companies like automotive supplier Johnson Controls, robotics experts Manz and knitting machine maker Stoll on new processes as it targets prototype in-store manufacturing by next year.Adidas says more local manufacturing should leave it with less surplus stock it has to discount, helping to lift its operating margin above 10 percent from 6.6 percent in 2014, still behind the 13 percent Nike recorded last year.Nike, which saw sales in North America dampened earlier this year by delays to deliveries from Asia due to labour disruption at ports on the U.S. West Coast, is unlikely to allow its German rival to get much of a headstart on localised production.During a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama to Nike headquarters last month, the firm promised to create 10,000 jobs in the United States in the next decade by producing more in its home market if a trade deal with Asian countries is approved.""We are putting a lot of money and a lot of resources against how our supply chain evolves to increase speed and make sure we deliver to consumers as quickly and innovatively as we can,"" Trevor Edwards, Nike brand president, said in March.Beyond knitting and 3-D printing, other innovations helping to speed up production include bonding and gluing technologies to fuse together fabrics as well as waterless dyeing which allows pigments to penetrate textiles more quickly.Yves-Simon Gloy, an expert from the Institute for Textile Technology at Aachen University who is collaborating with Adidas and sees the dawning of a fourth industrial revolution due to the emergence of ""cyber physical systems"", machines equipped with sensors, cameras and motors that can be adjusted using the Internet in real time.But Bennett and Gloy do not expect these smart machines to completely usurp human workers.""The breakthrough will probably happen in finishing the product close to the consumer,"" said Bennett. ""Not moving the whole of the operation"".

179,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN German sportswear firm Adidas presented plans on Wednesday to defend its position as the world's top soccer brand against fierce competition from Nike by launching a new range of footwear and setting up more grassroots programs.Adidas said it aims to increase sales from soccer gear at a mid-single-digit rate annually on average from 2015 to 2020 on a currency-neutral basis. That is lower than the ""high-single-digit"" growth rate it set for group sales in March and reflects the challenges it faces from U.S. rival Nike.The two companies dominate a soccer kit industry worth more than $5 billion a year, sharing more than 80 percent of the market for many products. But Nike has been threatening Adidas' leadership, including in its home territory of western Europe.Adidas, which saw the 2014 World Cup help boost its soccer sales by more than 20 percent to 2.1 billion euros ($2.35 billion), said it would do more to connect with a broader range of players with permanent or temporary grassroots programs.""Soccer still starts on the street.

Adidas last year struck a record shirt deal with former British champions Manchester United, ousting Nike. It will also replace Nike at Italian champions Juventus this summer and has extended an outfitting deal with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.

But Baumann said the company has no intention of changing its contracts with FIFA and Europe's soccer authority UEFA in the next couple of years, noting that both are long-term contracts. However, Baumann said that when contracts come up for renegotiation, Adidas would consider how influential this kind of partnership is to its target consumer.It is focusing on boosting sales of footwear rather than apparel, and this month scrapped its four established soccer shoe brands and launched two new ones, the ""X"" and ""ACE"".Baumann said marketing of the new shoes, which respond to a new footballing philosophy which divides players into those specializing in control and those who bring unpredictability and speed to the game, had already reached 40 million consumers.

The German group said on Wednesday it had completed the acquisition from majority owner Axel Springer SE, along with the company's founders and an ""angel"" investor, in a deal valuing the Austrian company at 220 million euros ($239 million).Rival Nike Inc was a pioneer in fitness tracking, teaming up with Apple Inc on the Nike+ running programmes for the iPod and iPhone and launching the FuelBand in 2012. Adidas has been losing market share in sporting goods to its bigger U.S. rival and launched its own miCoach fitness device only last year. Fast-growing Under Armour Inc, which last year overtook Adidas as the second-biggest sportswear maker in the United States, earlier this year bought diet and exercise app MyFitnessPal for $475 million and social fitness network Endomondo for $85 million.Under Armour said those deals had given it a total of 120 million registered users on its Connected Fitness platform, which it said made it the largest digital health and fitness community in the world.Adidas said Runtastic offers over 20 apps covering a variety of endurance, health and fitness activities in 18 languages.

191,"  * Q2 sales ahead of consensus forecast* Golf sales slump 26 pct, worsen from Q1* Adidas launches new round of restructuring for golf* Robust momentum in other units seen for H2* Shares up 0.9 pct   (Adds background)By Emma Thomasson and Jörn PoltzLONDON/MUNICH, Aug 6 German sportswear company Adidas has appointed investment bank Guggenheim Partners to help with the possible sale of its golf brands, which are struggling as the sport loses popularity, particularly in the United States.Adidas made the announcement on Thursday as deteriorating golf sales overshadowed otherwise strong second-quarter results, boosted by double-digit sales growth in both western Europe and China, which it expects to continue for the rest of the year.After peaking around 2000 when Tiger Woods was in his prime, the number of U.S. golfers has been steadily falling as fewer young people take up the sport and as busy professionals switch to cycling rather than spending the best part of a day playing 18 holes. Adidas bought the TaylorMade brand in 1997 along with Salomon, developing it into the world's biggest golf supplier. It acquired the Ashworth brand in 2008 for $72.8 million and the Adams brand for $70 million four years later.Investors have criticised Adidas for responding too slowly to the declining popularity of the sport, flooding the market with new products that it then had to discount heavily.Golf sales fell to about 6 percent of sales in 2014, forcing the group to warn on profits several times, while Adidas is not a major player in the booming business for high-end bicyles.Chief Executive Herbert Hainer admitted that two new golf clubs - the R15 and the AeroBurner drivers - had not sold well and competitors had been raising their game, but said he had high hopes for another new club which it will be launching soon.He told reporters on a conference call that Adidas was initially looking into the possible sale of its smaller golf brands Adams and Ashworth, which have suffered most in the downturn, although it was considering all options for the main TaylorMade label for which it also announced a turnaround plan. The number of people playing golf in the United States, which accounts for about half the global golf market, has fallen to an estimated 23 million from nearly 30 million in 2000, with the number of courses declining for the past eight years.The Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) is trying to market the sport to youngsters and make the game more family-friendly and Hainer said the number of golf rounds played had reversed their downwards trend recently.But that has yet to be reflected in sales of Adidas golf equipment. In the second quarter the firm's golf sales fell by a currency-adjusted 26 percent, accelerating a 9 percent decline in the previous three months.Other companies in the golf market include Nike, Kering's Puma  and Callaway Golf. The company formerly known as Fortune Brands sold its golf business in 2011 for $1.2 billion to a group led by Fila Korea and Korean private equity fund Mirae Asset Private Equity. ROBUST MOMENTUM Despite the slump in golf Adidas group sales rose in the last quarter by 15 percent to 3.91 billion euros ($4.27 billion) or 5 percent excluding the impact of currencies, beating an average of analysts' forecasts of 3.8 billion euros.Adidas shares, which are up 31 percent this year helped by a stock buyback and improving sales, were up 0.8 percent at 1217 GMT, outperforming a flat German blue-chip index.Hainer said he expected robust momentum to continue in the second half, citing a strong order book and ""unprecedented"" demand for Manchester United kit launched on Saturday after it displaced Nike as new suppliers to the English side.He said the weak performance of the golf business would not put the group's 2015 targets at risk.Adidas has already overhauled top management at the golf business and launched a restructuring programme last year, but Hainer said a more radical overhaul of the business was needed, including a review of marketing and production and more cost cutting.

""We are winning big time. Both Adidas and Reebok are enjoying great momentum across the globe,"" Hainer said, referring to the company's other main brand.However, higher marketing spending and currency effects look set to keep a lid on the operating margin, which Adidas said should stay flat in 2016 after a forecast 6.5-7 percent in 2015, far from the 13.6 percent Nike recorded for the year to end-May.Hainer said a strategic review of the company's TaylorMade golf business should be completed in the first quarter of 2016, adding that it has already attracted potential bidders.In the meantime, Adidas will keep working to restructure the unit, suffering from sport's declining popularity, and would cut its global staff by 14 percent by the end of the year, which would incur a small hit to group profits in the fourth quarter.

BRIGHTER OUTLOOK Adidas said currency-neutral sales in North America rose 6 percent, after a flat first half, driven by double-digit sales growth for the core Adidas brand, the fastest pace since 2011.Adidas raised its full-year outlook for sales and profits and said it should be able to repeat the performance next year, forecasting that currency-neutral sales and operating profit should both rise at a high-single-digit rate.""We are winning big time. Both Adidas and Reebok are enjoying great momentum across the globe,"" Hainer said, referring to the company's other main brand.However, higher marketing spending and currency effects look set to keep a lid on the operating margin, which Adidas said should stay flat in 2016 after a forecast 6.5-7 percent in 2015, far from the 13.6 percent Nike recorded for the year to end-May.Hainer said a strategic review of the company's TaylorMade golf business should be completed in the first quarter of 2016, adding that it has already attracted potential bidders.In the meantime, Adidas will keep working to restructure the unit, suffering from sport's declining popularity, and would cut its global staff by 14 percent by the end of the year, which would incur a small hit to group profits in the fourth quarter.

217,"   By Mitch Phillips | MONACO  MONACO Sebastian Coe is stepping down from his ambassadorial role with Nike, the IAAF president said on Thursday. Coe, who leads the ruling body of world athletics, has worked as a paid ambassador for the sportswear firm but faced repeated questions about a potential conflict of interest.An internal Nike email leaked this week appeared to show him supporting the bid of Eugene, the U.S. city with close links to the company, to host the 2021 world athletics championships. Coe also announced that CSM, the sports marketing firm he heads, will not tender for any contracts that might lead to allegations of a conflict of interest.  The Briton also said he was stepping down as chair of the British Olympic Association (BOA) after next year's Rio Games. ""I have sought advice from the IAAF's Ethics Committee to review my interests and was told I could retain my positions in Nike and CSM as long as I do not seek to influence any decisions that could influence them,"" Coe said at a news conference following an IAAF Council meeting. ""I'm grateful for that advice but it is clear that perception and reality have become horribly mangled. ""I've made the following decisions: I've stepped down from my ambassadorial role with Nike which lasted 38 years. The current noise level around it is not good for Nike or the IAAF and is a distraction."" Coe's relationship with Nike was thrust deeper under the spotlight this week when he faced fresh allegations about his involvement in the controversial award of the 2021 world championships to Eugene.  In April this year the hosting rights were surprisingly awarded without a bidding process, much to the surprise of the Swedish city of Gothenburg that was in the process of preparing to present its own case.The then-president of the IAAF (the International Association of Athletics Federations), Lamine Diack, supported the idea to give Eugene hosting rights.  But in the light of the 82-year-old being investigated by French authorities over a doping corruption scandal, many observers questioned the validity and transparency of the decision.On Tuesday the BBC published internal emails it said it obtained from Nike that suggested Coe gave support to the U.S. city's bid.The emails raised questions about whether there was a conflict of interests in Coe, who succeeded Diack as IAAF chief in August, supporting Eugene's bid given his links to Nike.

The current noise level around it is not good for Nike or the IAAF and is a distraction,"" Coe told a news conference following an IAAF Council meeting.

""I don't believe it was a conflict of interest,"" he said. ""I always declared it, and a range of others, but I just felt I needed to focus unflinchingly on the challenges ahead with my colleagues.""Coe also said he had made the decision before the release of the Nike email this week but wanted to wait to meet his Council colleagues face-to-face before announcing the decision.He is reported to earn around 100,000 pounds annually from Nike, and has been a hugely successful businessman since retiring from the track but his IAAF presidency is an upaid role -- something that might be changed in the future.""Considering what Seb has given up the athletes want someone at the top to be paid to deliver professional services for the sport,"" said former Namibian sprinter Frankie Fredericks, a Council member and head of the IAAF Athletes' Commission.The issue dominated Thursday's news conference, with little time allocated to Russia's suspension over a doping scandal and  its chances of cleaning up its act in time to compete in next year's Olympics.Earlier on Thursday Russian athletics officials said they would not be appealing against the suspension and would work with the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency on a ""pathway to re-admittance"".(Editing by Toby Davis)",2015-11-26,NKE,"Thu Nov 26, 2015 | 2:40pm EST",UPDATE 3-Athletics-Coe quits ambassadorial role with Nike,http://www.reuters.com//article/athletics-iaaf-coe-idUSL3N13L4CJ20151126?type=companyNews

221,"  * Board launched search for new CEO in February* Investors satisfied, particularly like Adidas core brand-CEO* Hainer says order books not been so full for 15 years* CEO expects double-digit 2016 Adidas sales in N.AmericaBy Emma ThomassonHERZOGENAURACH, Germany, Dec 9 Adidas  Chief Executive Herbert Hainer plans to stay until the end of his contract in March 2017 even though the board is looking for a successor, saying he expects bumper sales in his last full year in office.Hainer has been in his job since 2001 as the longest-serving boss of a German blue-chip and early last year the Adidas board extended his contract to 2017.But he has come under fire after the sportswear group lost market share to Nike and suffered from falling golf sales and its exposure to Russia. In February, the board said it had launched a search for a successor. Since then the pressure on Hainer has abated as Adidas's sales have rebounded in the important U.S. market.At a news briefing, Hainer said much had changed and he was upbeat for 2016, noting that the share price had risen 60 percent in the last year, to make it one of the strongest performers in the German DAX index.""I have never seen the order books as full in my 15 years here,"" Hainer said. ""I am extremely optimistic as I know what we've sold for the first six months (of 2016).""Hainer said he did not feel under pressure from high-profile new investors the world's second biggest sportswear brand has attracted in the last year, saying he met with them regularly. ""Investors are all satisfied,"" he said. ""What all really like is the Adidas brand. It is such a strong brand and it has such a sheen. That is what really interests them.""Reuters reported last week that Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris has formed a partnership with U.S. investor Mason Hawkins and his colleagues at Southeastern Asset Management to drive change at companies including Adidas.The new entity plans to build stakes in up to 10 European companies it deems to be underperforming to spur boardroom revamps and influence strategy, one source said.Although Adidas shares are up strongly this year, they still trade at a discount to Nike. But Hainer is not in any hurry to step down, saying the board is taking its time to consider external candidates as well as internal ones.""Of course I will stay until the end of my contract,"" he said, adding he had doubled sales and profit at Adidas in the last decade. ""At some point an announcement will come and then we will see how quickly the person can come.""Hainer repeated his rejection of calls from some investors for Adidas to sell the long-struggling Reebok fitness brand he bought in 2006, saying the business was now growing at double-digit rates everywhere except in North America.He also denied a media report that Adidas was preparing to sell its ice hockey equipment business, saying there was no current sales process although there were always people interested in the business.After slipping last year into third place in the U.S. market behind Nike and fast-growing Under Armour, Adidas has hiked marketing spending in North America by 50 percent in the first nine months of the year, Hainer said.Hainer said he expected the core Adidas brand to grow by 10 percent or more in North America in 2016, up from 8 percent in the first nine months of 2015, while sales of football kit should also rise at a double digit rate.North America is Adidas's second biggest market in terms of sales after Western Europe, based on third quarter sales.

These types of consumer companies with strong brands tend to withstand volatile markets, Lynch said. At the same time, he trimmed positions in top holdings Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc that rallied this year.Other active fund managers that are looking for big names with lots of downside protection in 2015 include Daniel Davidowitz, co-portfolio manager of the $804 million Polen Growth fund - the year's top performer in the large cap category - and Douglas Rao, portfolio manager of the $2.4 billion Janus Forty fund. ""There's a lot of noise and volatility in the market right now, and we're in the position of trying to find companies that are less sensitive to the macro environment,"" said Rao. Rao's fund gained 10.7 percent for the year through Monday, a performance that was the 10th best among large-cap funds tracked by Lipper during a time when only 24 percent of large-cap funds have been able to outperform the 0.1 percent gain in the index this year, according to Lipper data.Much of Rao's performance came from his top holding, Google parent Alphabet Inc, which has gained 44 percent for the year to date, and Amazon, which more than doubled this year and accounts for his 8th-largest position.Yet Rao is not searching for the next stock to hit out the lights in 2016. Instead, he expects GE to once again outperform in the coming year as it sheds its GE Capital assets faster than analysts expect and turns more of its focus to segments such as expanding its line of industrial software.

'WHEN THE SEAS GET ROUGH' The Polen fund is aiming straight at all-weather stocks: All  20 companies in its portfolio generate high levels of cash flow, return 20 percent or more on capital and show increasing profit margins and organic revenue growth.

The group appears to want to gain exposure to the U.S. market, having previously been focused on acquisitions in Europe, where it runs 257 stores across the continent plus 455 in Britain.""The main rationale for these stakes is to allow Sports Direct to hopefully build a relationship and develop commercial partnerships with the relevant parties,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Dick's operates 645 stores across the U.S., selling brands such as Nike Inc and Under Armour, while Iconix owns a portfolio of brands including ""Mudd"", ""Joe Boxer"" and ""Rocawear"".For years, Sports Direct's cheap prices fuelled rapid growth but investor confidence in the group, founded and majority owned by Mike Ashley, has been shaken over the last two months by allegations over the treatment of staff in Britain and a profit warning.Shares in Sports Direct, whose founder Ashley also owns Newcastle United soccer club, traded up 3 percent to 424 pence at 0845 GMT following news of the investments. The stock had lost 44 percent of its value since the beginning of December.

230,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN Adidas (ADSGn.DE) has named Henkel's (HNKG_p.DE) Kasper Rorsted as its new chief executive, boosting its shares as investors expressed hopes that the Dane has the credentials to boost profits at the German sportswear firm.Rorsted, 53, will leave Henkel in April after eight years at the consumer goods firm and take charge of Adidas on Oct. 1, succeeding Herbert Hainer, 61, who has headed the firm for 15 years as the longest-serving boss of a leading German company.Hainer had come under fire as Adidas has lost market share to Nike (NKE.N), particularly in the key U.S. market, and suffered from falling golf sales and its exposure to Russia, prompting the board to launch a search for a successor.Adidas shares were up 5.8 percent by 1400 GMT, while Henkel was down 4.5 percent.""The share price reaction speaks for itself,"" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, which owns a 0.7 percent stake in Adidas.""We welcome the appointment of Mr Rorsted to replace Mr Hainer and hope it means an end to the long dry spell in the profitability of Adidas,"" added Speich, who has long been critical of the Adidas CEO.Adidas sales have more than doubled under Hainer but they have failed to match Nike, which forecasts revenue will rise another 63 percent to $50 billion by 2020, compared to the Adidas target of 22 billion euros ($24 billion).Hainer has also struggled to improve profitability, with the Adidas operating margin of 6.6 percent in 2014 still half that of Nike. In contrast, Henkel's adjusted operating margin rose to almost 16 percent in 2014 from 10 percent in 2008.  SUMMER HANDOVER Hainer had cultivated potential internal successors,   including brand chief Eric Liedtke, but several investors wanted an outsider who might be more likely to take tough decisions and potentially sell more non-core businesses.Hainer has said he is considering selling the struggling Taylor Made golf business, but has repeatedly rejected calls from some investors to sell the Reebok fitness brand he bought in 2006, saying the business was now growing fast. Reuters reported last year that Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris has formed a partnership with U.S. investor Mason Hawkins and his Southeastern Asset Management to drive boardroom change at companies including Adidas. Southeastern declined to comment on Rorsted's appointment. Adidas said Rorsted would join the executive board on Aug. 1 and have a two-month transition period with Hainer during a busy period for the sporting goods industry, just after the European soccer championships and just before the Olympics in Rio.Since Rorsted took over at Henkel in 2008, shares in the maker of Schwarzkopf hair care products and Loctite glue have more than tripled, while its annual sales have grown by more than a third to around 18 billion euros estimated for 2015.Rorsted has a reputation as a dynamic manager with a relentless focus on improving profitability, but, like Hainer at Adidas, faced challenges in the United States, the company's biggest market, where competition from the likes of Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L) is fierce. In response, Rorsted, who says he spends 200 days of the year traveling, has overhauled management in the U.S. market, where Henkel has also launched products popular in Europe - Persil laundry detergent and Schwarzkopf shampoo.Rorsted was widely seen as seeking a new challenge after Henkel last year lost out to to Coty Inc (COTY.N) in a bid to buy hair care firm Wella from Procter & Gamble.Rorsted, who is known as a keen skier and fan of soccer club Bayern Munich, is married with four children and his family already live in Munich, meaning he will have less far to commute to his new job in the northern Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach.He serves on the boards of German media company Bertelsmann, Denmark's Danfoss and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR)and, before Henkel, he worked for Hewlett Packard, Compaq and Oracle, living in Germany since 1991.Hans Van Bylen, a Belgian who has worked at Henkel since 1984 and who has headed the beauty care business since 2005, will take over as Henkel CEO on May 1, the company said, adding it would name a successor for Van Bylen in due course.($1 = 0.9179 euros) (Additional reporting by Matthias Inverardi in Duesseldorf and Joern Poeltz in Munich; Editing by Keith Weir)",2016-01-18,NKE,"Mon Jan 18, 2016 | 9:56am EST",UPDATE 3-Adidas names Henkel's Rorsted to replace Hainer as CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/adidas-moves-ceo-idUSL8N1521WZ?type=companyNews

235,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova said on Monday she had failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she was taking for health issues, leading longtime sponsor Nike to announce it was suspending ties during the investigation.The 28-year-old Sharapova, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said. She is the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as of January 1.""I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down,"" said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. ""I take full responsibility for it.""""I know that with this I face consequences and I don't want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,"" former world number one Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel.Nike, the world's largest sportswear maker, said it was ""saddened and surprised"" by the news and released a statement saying it was putting ties on hold with the player. ""We have decided to suspend our relationship with Maria while the investigation continues,"" it said. The ITF's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test, but that ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as for first-time offences or if the player shows no significant fault or negligence. If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.    TAKEN MELDONIUM FOR 10 YEARS According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements. Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.""It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance.""WADA declined to comment until ITF issues a final decision.Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks among other conditions, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is listed by WADA among its prohibited metabolic modulators, along with insulin, and some researchers say it can also help recovery.It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. Over the past month, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, Russian figure skater Ekaterina Bobrova, Ethiopia-born athletes Endeshaw Negesse and Abeba Aregawi, and Ukraine biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko have all tested positive for meldonium. Sharapova is the most prominent tennis player to test positive for a banned substance in recent years.Croatia's Marin Cilic was banned for nine months in 2013 after testing positive for a prohibited stimulant, though the suspension was cut to four months on appeal.Former world number one Martina Hingis retired after receiving a two-year suspension for a positive cocaine test in 2007, though the Swiss denied taking the drug.WTA SADDENED BY NEWS Last year, the sport banned U.S. player Wayne Odesnik for 15 years after his second doping violation, testing positive for steroids and other banned substances. Sharapova is the biggest name in sport to test positive since New York Yankees baseball slugger Alex Rodriguez was banned for a year in 2013 after using performance-enhancing drugs and American cyclist Lance Armstrong was banned for life from racing in 2012 after a U.S. Anti-Doping investigation.Sharapova, one of the most popular figures in global sports, has long been a favorite with her sponsors. Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc declined to comment on its endorsements.     Steve Simon, CEO of the Women's Tennis Association, said in a statement he was saddened to hear the news.""Maria (Sharapova) is a leader and I have always known her to be a woman of great integrity,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, as Maria acknowledged, it is every player's responsibility to know what they put in their body and to know if it is permissible. The WTA will support the decisions reached through this process.""

236,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova said on Monday she had failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she was taking for health issues, leading longtime sponsor Nike to announce it was suspending ties during the investigation.The 28-year-old Sharapova, a five-time grand slam champion and the highest paid woman in sports, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said. She is the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as of January 1.""I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down,"" said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. ""I take full responsibility for it.""""I know that with this I face consequences and I don't want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,"" former world number one Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel.Nike, the world's largest sportswear maker, said it was ""saddened and surprised"" by the news and released a statement saying it was putting ties on hold with the player. ""We have decided to suspend our relationship with Maria while the investigation continues,"" it said. The ITF's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test, but that ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as for first-time offences or if the player shows no significant fault or negligence. If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.    TAKEN MELDONIUM FOR 10 YEARS According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements. Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.""It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance.""WADA declined to comment until ITF issues a final decision.Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks among other conditions, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is listed by WADA among its prohibited metabolic modulators, along with insulin, and some researchers say it can also help recovery.It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. Over the past month, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, Russian figure skater Ekaterina Bobrova, Ethiopia-born athletes Endeshaw Negesse and Abeba Aregawi, and Ukraine biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko have all tested positive for meldonium. Sharapova is the most prominent tennis player to test positive for a banned substance in recent years.Croatia's Marin Cilic was banned for nine months in 2013 after testing positive for a prohibited stimulant, though the suspension was cut to four months on appeal.Former world number one Martina Hingis retired after receiving a two-year suspension for a positive cocaine test in 2007, though the Swiss denied taking the drug.WTA SADDENED BY NEWS Last year, the sport banned U.S. player Wayne Odesnik for 15 years after his second doping violation, testing positive for steroids and other banned substances. Sharapova is the biggest name in sport to test positive since New York Yankees baseball slugger Alex Rodriguez was banned for a year in 2013 after using performance-enhancing drugs and American cyclist Lance Armstrong was banned for life from racing in 2012 after a U.S. Anti-Doping investigation.Sharapova, one of the most popular figures in global sports, has long been a favorite with her sponsors. Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc declined to comment on its endorsements.     Steve Simon, CEO of the Women's Tennis Association, said in a statement he was saddened to hear the news.""Maria (Sharapova) is a leader and I have always known her to be a woman of great integrity,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, as Maria acknowledged, it is every player's responsibility to know what they put in their body and to know if it is permissible. The WTA will support the decisions reached through this process.""

251,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN A battle between Adidas and Nike for dominance of the global soccer gear market is driving a steep rise in sponsorship payments to elite clubs - and cutting into the two manufacturers' profits.Shirt deal inflation is reinforcing the advantage of about a dozen clubs with a global fan base - among them Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two Manchester clubs and Paris Saint Germain. These same clubs benefit from bigger revenues from broadcast rights, helping them pay for the best players.The clubs' gain comes at Adidas and Nike's expense.Nike stock dropped this week after Morgan Stanley downgraded it to ""equal weight"", primarily on concerns the firm is losing U.S. market share to Adidas and Under Armour, but also citing a profit squeeze from the rising cost of sponsorships.""At the top, it is a pure power struggle between Nike and Adidas,"" said Peter Rohlmann, a marketing consultant who advises clubs and federations on such deals. ""The costs don't play a role. They want to keep their competitor out.""    Under the terms of sponsorship deals, the brand pays the clubs for the license to sell replica jerseys and other merchandise. The clubs usually receive a fixed fee, kit for the team, plus royalties of some 10-15 percent of the merchandise sold and performance bonuses if the team wins major trophies.Only the highest-profile clubs, and a few national sides like Brazil and Germany, can shift the millions of shirts that justify deals now worth as much as 100 million euros ($111.58 million) a year.Spanish champions Barcelona are market leaders, selling 3.6 million shirts last season, according to Euromericas agency, followed by Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Manchester United.This top four has negotiated new kit deals with Nike or Adidas in the last two years worth double or triple what they were previously receiving. Champions League winners Real Madrid are demanding a big hike from Adidas.POWER STRUGGLE ESCALATES  Competition has intensified since Nike took the lead in the market for soccer shoes in 2014, prompting Adidas - long the world's top soccer brand - to shift strategy to focus its spending on fewer top teams and players.Its biggest win was to oust Nike at Manchester United in a deal worth 75 million pounds ($110 million) a year over a decade.Nike, slipping in the U.S. market after it lost singer Kanye West to Adidas and basketball star Steph Curry to Under Armour, is now retaliating. Its new deal with Barcelona last month hit a new record of up to 155 million euros ($173.66 million).Nike declined to comment for this article. Brand president Trevor Edwards has justified the Barcelona deal by saying the club has millions of fans worldwide, adding that the relationship ""extends Nike's leadership position in soccer"".     Nike has also trumped Adidas at Chelsea, more than doubling the value of the contract.""We think Nike ... is willing to sacrifice margin to keep its stars and sign new ones,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, noting that deals for Nike and Under Armour are up about 70 percent since 2013. HALF A BILLION ON FIVE DEALS?    Adidas could be forced to stump up almost half a billion euros a year for its top five soccer deals - almost a quarter of its marketing budget - if it yields to demands from Germany and Real Madrid for more. ""Clubs are becoming increasingly sophisticated,"" said Glenn Lovett, head of global strategy at sports data firm Repucom.     ""Soccer is the most global sport and this is where you need to be if you want to be a global brand.""Adidas says the high media profile of top teams and players shifts merchandise - particularly in Asia - and also indirectly helps sales of training and running gear. ""The top clubs will get more expensive while those that are not so good will have problems,"" Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said. He sees a limit of not much above 100 million euros a year for the most expensive contracts.The next tier of clubs are having to make do with much less, opening up opportunities for firms like Puma, Under Armour and New Balance.Fans at Bayer Leverkusen complained after the Bundesliga's third ranked club only managed to secure around 2 million euros a year with local brand Jako after being dropped by Adidas.Under Armour, which sponsored its first English side in Tottenham Hotspur in 2011, recently took over from Adidas at Southampton for 8 million pounds a year.Puma faces demands for a hike from Leicester City after a fifteen-fold jump in demand for its shirts due to its surprise victory in the Premier League, although the contract - worth just 1 million pounds a year - runs until 2018.With the European championships and Copa America about to start, Nike and Adidas are also competing for national sides.World Cup winners Germany are pushing Adidas to leapfrog Nike's record contract with Euro 2016 hosts France worth 43 million euros a year.     The brands are also bidding to sign top footballers, with Adidas poaching France and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba from Nike in March for at least 4 million euros per season.Such deals allow the brands to reinforce club contracts, or undermine those of their rivals: Barcelona's Lionel Messi wears Adidas shoes with his Nike shirt, while Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo does the reverse.

252,"   By Martyn Herman | LONDON  LONDON The career of Russian former world number one Maria Sharapova was in tatters on Wednesday after she was given a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) following her positive test for the banned drug meldonium.In a statement the ITF said the five-times grand slam champion's ban would be backdated to Jan. 26 this year, meaning her results and prize money from the Australian Open, where she reached the quarter-finals, would be canceled out.Sharapova, 29, said she would appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), describing the punishment as ""unfairly harsh"".She said an independent tribunal in London on May 18-19 had found that she had not intentionally violated anti-doping rules.A 33-page report of the tribunal's findings said: ""The ITF accepts that the player did not engage in conduct that she knew constituted an antidoping rule violation,"" but it rejected her assertion that there was no ""significant"" fault on her part.""She was the sole author of her own misfortune,"" it said.On its website, the ITF said the ban, which could have been as long as four years, had been backdated due to Sharapova's ""prompt admission"" of taking the substance, and would end on midnight of Jan. 25, 2018.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) later issued a short statement saying it would review the decision before deciding whether to use its independent right of appeal to CAS.Sharapova has regularly battled back from serious injuries during her glittering career but the two-year ban means she will not be eligible to play until after the 2018 Australian Open when she will be 30, and raises the question of whether she will ever play again.""If it stands, then I think it will be difficult for her to come back at the same level,"" the president of the Russian Tennis Federation, Shamil Tarpishchev, told TASS news agency, calling for the penalty to be reduced.     TIME AND RESOURCES  Meldonium was added to WADA's list of banned substances at the start of the year after mounting evidence that it boosted blood flow and enhanced athletic performance.Around 180 athletes have tested positive for the drug, manufactured in Latvia and common throughout eastern Europe, since January.Sharapova, the world's highest-paid female athlete, stunned the sporting world in March when she announced that she had tested positive for meldonium, a component of a product named Mildronate which she has taken since 2006 for health issues.At the time Sharapova, the highest-profile tennis player to fail an anti-doping test, said she had made ""a huge mistake"" in failing to realize that continuing to take Mildronate would be a violation of the anti-doping code.""The ITF spent tremendous amounts of time and resources trying to prove I intentionally violated the anti-doping rules and the tribunal concluded I did not,"" she said on Facebook. The ITF had sought a four-year suspension but the tribunal rejected that, she said.""While the tribunal concluded correctly that I did not intentionally violate the anti-doping rules, I cannot accept an unfairly harsh two-year suspension.""The tribunal found that Sharapova had taken Mildronate before each of her five matches at this year's Australian Open where she lost to Serena Williams.It rejected Sharapova's argument that the ITF should have informed her that she and a number of other tennis players had tested positive for meldonium in 2015 before it was added to the banned list.""CONCEALED""  The report also said that Sharapova had not made her use of Mildronate known to most of her team, including her coach, her trainer, her physiotherapist and her nutritionist, nor any of the doctors made available to players by the WTA.Questioning why she continued taking Mildronate before matches, the report said: ""In the tribunal's view the answer is clear. Whatever the position may have been in 2006, there was in 2016 no diagnosis and no therapeutic advice supporting the continuing use of Mildronate.""If she had not concealed her use of Mildronate from the anti-doping authorities, members of her own support team and the doctors whom she consulted, but had sought advice, then the contravention would have been avoided,"" it said.The ban will have an enormous impact on Sharapova's earning potential.Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut its ties with Sharapova after the news of her doping violation while other sponsors such as Porsche distanced themselves from her.Nike however, said on Wednesday they would continue to work with Sharapova.“The ITF Tribunal has found that Maria did not intentionally break its rules,"" the sports apparel giant said in a statement. ""Maria has always made her position clear, has apologized for her mistake and is now appealing the length of the ban.""  Sharapova has 35 WTA singles titles and has won all four of the sport's grand slam titles.Her career earnings amount to $36 million while her off-court earnings, according to Forbes, are around $200 million.

Hainer said Adidas's sponsorship strategy was based on quantity, rather than quality.Adidas is currently under pressure to pay more to renew its sponsorship deal with Germany.  Hainer said the two sides are in constructive talks and said he was still hopeful for a deal before he steps down as chief executive in October after 15 years as chief executive.Hainer said he believes his successor, former Henkel (HNKG_p.DE) chief Kasper Rorsted, will not ditch a five-year strategy Adidas launched last year, saying the strong sales the company has posted of late showed it was working well.However, Hainer said he hoped Rorsted, who made major strides in improving profitability at German consumer goods firm Henkel, would do the same for Adidas.""If we can keep the growth and he can help profitability, it would be a sensible mix,"" he said.

259,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Nike Inc's (NKE.N) quarterly revenue growth and its forecast for future orders missed analysts' estimates, underscoring the sportswear maker's struggle to fend off competition from Adidas and others, especially in its home turf of North America.Nike's shares, already the third worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a 15 percent drop this year through Tuesday, fell another 4.2 percent to $50.85 in extended trading.While Nike still dominates in North America, its biggest market, analysts have said it is losing ground to Germany's Adidas (ADSGn.DE), and smaller domestic rivals such as Under Armour Inc (UA.N) are also making inroads.""You are seeing more people moving towards Adidas,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. He said Adidas was ""making a comeback"" and some U.S. retailers were giving more shelf space to Nike's competition.Nike's revenue in the fourth quarter ended May 31 was hurt by a strong dollar that ate into overseas sales. Clearing excess inventory in North America also hurt sales and margins, and is expected to dent the current quarter as well, Nike said.While Nike noted the volatility in the currency markets after Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union, it maintained its full-year sales growth forecast.Nike expects revenue to grow in the high single digits for the year ending May 2017. Adidas, by contrast, expects its full-year currency-adjusted sales to grow 10-12 percent, thanks in part to a busy sporting calendar that includes the Rio Olympics and the European soccer championship. FUTURES ORDERS Nike's orders for delivery from June through November in North America, a demand gauge it calls ""futures orders"", missed expectations, signaling slowing growth. Its futures orders in the region were up 6 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, while analysts were expecting growth of 9 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.Slipping demand for its basketball shoes hurt Nike's ""futures orders"", Yarbrough said. The success of Under Armour's basketball shoes endorsed by NBA star Stephen Curry have eaten into demand for Nike's, endorsed by Michael Jordan and LeBron James among others. Celebrity and team-endorsed products are big sales drivers for sportswear companies. Adidas has hiked marketing spending, particularly in North America, while Under Armour has benefited from deals with Steph Curry and golfer Jordan Spieth.Nike could benefit from higher demand for basketball shoes after LeBron James powered the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first NBA championship earlier this month. Nike's fourth-quarter revenue rose nearly 6 percent to $8.24 billion, while analysts on average had expected revenue of $8.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales in North America were flat, weighed down by a fall in apparel and equipment sales. Footwear sales inched up 2 percent.Net income fell 2.2 percent to $846 million. On a per share basis, profit was flat at 49 cents and a penny higher than analysts' estimates.Nike's gross margins dropped 30 basis points to 45.9 percent as higher average selling prices were more than offset by higher product costs, the inventory clearance and currency rates.

262,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN Adidas (ADSGn.DE) has agreed to expand its partnership with Kanye West, including opening new stores, hoping to build on its higher profile in the U.S. market since it poached the singer-turned-designer from Nike (NKE.N) in 2013.The deal was described by the German sportswear firm on Wednesday as the most significant partnership between a non-athlete and a sports brand and said it will develop beyond its current lifestyle focus to introduce sports performance designs.Adidas will create a new brand with West for footwear, clothing and accessories, and also plans new stores selling West's Yeezy branded products along with Adidas products.West has said that he moved from Nike to Adidas because the German company gave him more creative freedom and royalties, which he said the U.S. firm told him it reserved for professional athletes such as basketball star Michael Jordan. An Adidas spokeswoman declined to give financial details or specify the length of the deal. Media reports put the value of the previous deal at $10 million. Adidas has regained some ground in the U.S. market in recent months since falling into third place behind Nike and Under Armour (UA.N).Adidas has increased its spending on marketing and lifted its profile thanks to collaborations with celebrities such as West and singer Pharrell Williams. It has also poached the NFL's Aaron Rodgers and basketball player James Harden from Nike.Although Nike and its Jordan brand still dominate the U.S. footwear market, Adidas sales rose almost two-thirds in May to take a 6 percent share, according to data from market research firm NPD. Nike's overall share of the U.S. sportswear market rose to 21.1 percent in 2015 from 20.1 percent in 2014, while Under Armour was up at 3.9 percent from 3.5 percent and Adidas rose to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, according to Euromonitor data.On Tuesday Nike gave a lower than expected forecast for future orders, highlighting its struggle to fend off competition from Adidas and others, especially on its home turf.Adidas said a dedicated team based in the firm's U.S. headquarters in Portland, Oregon would work with West on the development of all Yeezy products.  West's designs so far for Adidas have concentrated on limited edition footwear, with fans camping outside stores to wait for the release of the latest Yeezy Boost shoes.""This partnership illustrates that anyone with a dream can dream without limitations,"" West said on Wednesday.Adidas has announced two other major partnerships in recent weeks -- one with the Wanda business empire to sponsor endurance events and promote other sports in China, and the other an extension of its shirt deal with the German soccer team.

263,"  (Repeats to widen distribution)By Liana B. BakerJune 29 Against a backdrop of the iconic five rings, legendary swimmer Michael Phelps sat on a United States Olympic Committee stage at a March media event in Los Angeles, telling reporters why he had arrived fashionably late.He had been rushed by private jet from Baltimore, courtesy of his sponsor Under Armour, which had held its own media event the same day (a coincidence, the company said). Phelps called Under Armour-backed athletes a ""family"" and its chief executive Kevin Plank a visionary with ""mind-blowing ideas.""The scene previewed the kind of marketing to expect during this summer's games, with companies operating under newly liberalized sponsorship rules - enacted after years of lobbying by athletes and their agents.Under Armour won't pay the USOC or the International Olympic Committee for such mind-blowing branding opportunities. The company is not an official sponsor of the games. That privilege costs brands such as Nike Inc, Visa Inc and McDonald's Corp tens of millions of dollars for explicit rights to use the rings, the word ""Olympics"" and other intellectual property.Sports agents and marketing executives told Reuters that Under Armour's campaign will be the best case study for the changes to so-called rule 40, which ends a marketing blackout during the games for companies who sponsor athletes rather than the event itself.Phelps, one of Under Armour's biggest bets, competes this week in the U.S. swimming trials, where he aims to secure a spot in his fifth Olympics. He hopes to add to his total of 18 gold medals and 22 medals total, which already makes him the most decorated Olympian of all time. On Tuesday, Phelps posted the top time in the 200 meter butterfly heats, advancing to the semi-finals.Beyond Phelps, Under Armour has backed a fleet of about 250 athletes - from the famous to the obscure - and plans a wide range of creative tactics to connect its brand to the Olympics.The apparel company will, for instance, rent a series of outdoor gyms on a 50-mile stretch of beach in Rio to set up marketing outposts and host daily workouts for fans during the games. It will entertain VIP guests in a penthouse where they can mingle with its stable of athletes.Official sponsors - worried the rule change could undermine their massive investments - will keep a keen eye out for potential infractions by other companies. John Lewicki, who oversees global Olympic sponsorship deals for McDonald's Corp , said his company will use these games to evaluate whether to continue future Olympic deals.""I wouldn't necessarily say we're all happy about it,"" Lewicki said. ""If we find rule 40 impacts the value of our sponsorship, we could always go back and renegotiate for the future.""McDonald's current deal, at a cost it declined to disclose, runs until after the 2020 summer games in Tokyo.Lisa Baird, USOC's chief marketing officer said in a statement that ""the USOC relies on partner support and works very hard to protect their Olympic rights, but while doing so we also look to expand opportunities for Team USA athletes.""The IOC said in a statement that it takes ambush marketing seriously and will protect its sponsors' exclusive rights. ""If there is a concerted effort to create an unauthorised commercial association with the Olympic Games or the Olympic properties, then we will take swift action,"" the statement said.LONG LOBBYING CAMPAIGN Before the rule change, approved last summer at the IOC session in Malaysia, athletes had long argued they were deprived of commercial attention and income during their most marketable moments.Peter Carlisle, who represents Phelps as an agent at Octagon, a unit of Interpublic Group, said the rule changes help famous athletes like his client. But more changes are needed from the IOC, he said, to help the masses of athletes.Official sponsorship proceeds, in fact, are vital to less famous participants, whom the Olympic committees support with the money. The USOC's annual budget was $247 million in 2012, the last summer Olympics year, and the cost of sending an individual athlete to the Games averages $40,000, the USOC said.Companies sponsoring individual athletes or teams had to submit their plans months in advance to the USOC or other national committees to ensure the campaigns do not infringe on Olympics copyrights. Sports agents estimate that hundreds of brands applied for U.S. waivers. The USOC declined to release the numbers of waivers requested or granted. To feasibly take advantage of rule 40, athletes would have had to find sponsors at least six months before the games to meet the deadlines for brands to submit waiver requests. Many Olympians are only finding out in the next few weeks whether they qualify for the games in trials happening all over the world.""This is a change for the better, but it's nowhere near where we need to get,"" Carlisle said.BRANDING FREE-FOR-ALL Under Armour - along with dozens of other companies, including camera maker GoPro and beverage brands Red Bull and Gatorade, a unit of PepsiCo Inc - have already started flashy campaigns featuring Olympians. Each has sought approval to continue them during the games.In March, Under Armour released a commercial showing Phelps swimming to a song called ""The Last Goodbye,"" and then facing a flash of cameras.""As long as you don't use Olympic intellectual property, like the rings or the word Olympic, you can make something that looks very beautiful,"" said Lowell Taub, head of sports endorsements at CAA Sports, an agency that works with Olympians such as gymnast Gabby Douglas. Under Armour's ""family"" includes other big name athletes who are expected to compete in Rio: Jordan Spieth in golf, Andy Murray in tennis and Kelley O'Hara in soccer. It suffered a blow, however, when Steph Curry - one of its highest profile athletes and a star point guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association - opted out of playing for the U.S. basketball team in Rio so he could rest his injured knee.The USOC said it plans to police any marketing activity that could hurt their official sponsors' investments, including on social media, but it declined to detail its enforcement plans. Nike, Under Armour's biggest competition in Rio, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The flood of new marketing during a three-week Olympics period is likely to pose steep enforcement challenges. Phelps' agent, Carlisle, predicted there would be so many violations of rule 40 this summer - especially on social media - that ""it'll make your head spin.""Brands are taking their own measures to protect their sponsorship rights. McDonald's said it plans to work with media monitoring agencies, and its own internal marketing teams will watch social media closely to evaluate the impact of the changes.HIGH STAKES A source who has negotiated previous IOC sponsorship deals said that top global sponsors spend about $25 million per year for the rights, or about $100 million for four-year period that includes a summer and winter games.The IOC hopes to double fees to $200 million per four year period starting in 2021, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. That could mean tough negotiations for the IOC with current sponsors.Under Armour will likely spend considerably less. It has chosen instead to cut much less expensive deals to outfit the athletes in several national governing bodies, which are groups that oversee specific sports in various countries such as USA Gymnastics, USA Boxing, Rugby Canada and beach volleyball in Switzerland and the Netherlands.The company does not disclose how much it invests in Olympics marketing, but it reported in a filing that its marketing costs rose by 14 percent - to $122.5 million from $107.6 million - during the first quarter ended March 31, compared to a year ago. The company attributed the increase to ""key marketing campaigns and investments in sponsorships"" in the filing, which covered the period when it unveiled Olympic-themed commercials.Under Armour plenty of reasons to keep pushing hard at the Olympics, said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. Unlike Nike, only a small percentage its sales come from international markets, and it needs to catch up to rivals in India and China, he said.Peter Murray, vice president of sports marketing for Under Armour, didn't rule out becoming an official sponsor at some point.""As we look to grow the brand and the business around the world outside the US, Olympics will continue to play a role in that,"" Murray said. ""We are really just getting started.""   (Reporting by Liana B.

But more changes are needed from the IOC, he said, to help the masses of athletes.Official sponsorship proceeds, in fact, are vital to less famous participants, whom the Olympic committees support with the money. The USOC's annual budget was $247 million in 2012, the last summer Olympics year, and the cost of sending an individual athlete to the Games averages $40,000, the USOC said.Companies sponsoring individual athletes or teams had to submit their plans months in advance to the USOC or other national committees to ensure the campaigns do not infringe on Olympics copyrights. Sports agents estimate that hundreds of brands applied for U.S. waivers. The USOC declined to release the numbers of waivers requested or granted.To feasibly take advantage of rule 40, athletes would have had to find sponsors at least six months before the games to meet the deadlines for brands to submit waiver requests.

274,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN German sportswear firm Puma (PUMG.DE) wants to forge even closer ties with Usain Bolt, the highest profile athlete it sponsors, if the Jamaican sprinter retires after the Rio Olympics, predicting he could be just as valuable off the track.""Usain is part of the Puma family,"" Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told reporters on Wednesday.""If he decides not to run, we will probably work even closer with him,"" he said, adding Bolt would have more time for product development and could even take on a commercial role at Puma.Bigger rival Nike (NKE.N) has built a brand with annual sales of $2.8 billion with retired basketballer Michael Jordan, while Adidas (ADSGn.DE) still uses former England soccer star David Beckham to promote its products.Gulden made the comments after Puma reported a stronger-than-expected rise in second quarter sales, helped by the European soccer championships as well as products designed by singer Rihanna, appointed women's creative director in 2014.Bolt has been at the center of a push by Gulden to put more emphasis on sport performance gear rather than fashion, also bolstered by its sponsorship of English soccer side Arsenal. Bolt has promoted Puma's ""Ignite"" running shoes, but Bankhaus Lampe analyst Peter Steiner said track and field was a relatively small category so his eventual retirement was unlikely to be a big hit.Puma reported a quarterly net profit of 1.6 million euros  ($1.8 million), compared with a loss of 3.3 million a year ago. Sales rose 7 percent to 827 million euros.Puma shares pared earlier gains to trade up 0.2 percent by 1051 GMT, while owner Kering (PRTP.PA) rose 2.3 percent. Adidas, which has been hitting a series of record highs in anticipation of bumper results on Aug. 4, was up 1.1 percent. Gulden said it was not clear whether the six-time Olympic sprint champion, who has been sponsored by Puma since he was 15 years old, would keep running after the Rio Olympics, saying Bolt might need time off to think about it.Gulden said the Jamaican was already helping Puma hunt for a successor, adding the company has a strong scouting operating in the Caribbean: ""We have to admit there won't be a second Usain but there will be something else,"" he said.While the Olympics is a major platform for the brand, Gulden said it was hard to measure a direct impact on sales as fans do not buy replica team shirts in the same way they do for soccer. Puma's quarterly sales jumped a currency-adjusted 23.5 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, helped by its sponsorship of five national soccer teams at Euro 2016.Gulden said Puma's partnerships with Rihanna and celebrity Kylie Jenner were helping it win more space at key retailers, which are all putting more focus on the women's business because it is growing faster than the men's.

280,"  LONDON Adidas will open a new factory near Atlanta in 2017  largely operated by robots, part of a drive to shift production closer to customers and counter rising wages in Asia and lengthy shipping times.The sportswear company has already started work at a similar factory in the southern German town of Ansbach. The two factories are each expected to produce half a million shoes for running and other categories in the medium term.Founded by German cobbler Adi Dassler in 1949, Adidas had closed all but one of its 10 shoe factories in Germany by 1993 as it shifted most production from Europe to lower-cost Asia, particularly China and Vietnam.But advances in robotics and automation means that Adidas can now bring production back closer to customers to meet demands for faster delivery of new styles. ""This allows us to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives, in real time,"" brand director Eric Liedtke said, adding the factory would allow Adidas to customize more products for individuals.Rival Nike, which has faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its footwear, promised last year to create 10,000 jobs in the United States in the next decade by producing more in its home market. Nike has also worked to improve conditions overseas. Adidas has said the new plants would supplement rather than replace production in Asia, noting that Adidas currently makes about 300 million pairs of shoes a year and already needs to add two factories a year to keep up with current rates of growth. The new U.S. factory will create around 160 jobs and is being operated by Oechsler Motion GmbH. Adidas is also working with German engineering group Manz to develop new automated production technology.

288,"   By John Tilak and Jessica DiNapoli | TORONTO/NEW YORK  TORONTO/NEW YORK The former chairman of Performance Sports Group Ltd, Graeme Roustan, told Reuters he has hired investment banks Jefferies Group LLC and Canaccord Genuity to explore a possible bid for the troubled maker of hockey gear.He disclosed his plans on Wednesday, a day after Reuters reported that the sporting equipment maker has hired investment bank Centerview Partners Holdings LLC to help it negotiate with lenders to avoid defaulting on its loans.     Roustan said he believes he can turn around the money-losing company, which is under investigation by securities regulators in the United States and Canada. The company is conducting an internal investigation into its accounting practices, which has delayed the release of its annual report.“Should there be an opportunity that becomes available through any kind of process, I’ll be the first in line to make an offer,"" Roustan said in an interview. ""I believe that my ownership involvement is not behind me.""Shares in the company fell as much as 5.6 percent in early morning trade. Performance Sports, Jefferies and Canaccord Genuity did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Founded in Kitchener, Ontario, Performance Sports developed the first skate with a blade attached to the boot, an innovation credited with changing the game of hockey. It also makes Easton baseball bats and was previously called Bauer, the brand of its popular hockey gear. Its shares lost half their market value after warning last week it might default on its loans due to the delay in filing its annual report.It slashed its full-year earnings forecast in June, citing a downturn in baseball and softball markets. Roustan told Reuters in January he was looking to wage a proxy battle or take the company private at a premium to its stock price, then at C$12.36, if the company did not abandon plans to open its own stores. He said the move would pit the company against its own customers. Roustan sued accounting firm Grant Thornton earlier this year for breach of contract and defamation in connection with a survey of the company's strategy, according to a claim filed in a Canadian court. The lawsuit is ongoing.The company, which was founded in the 1920s, was owned for about a decade by sporting goods giant Nike Inc before being sold to Roustan and private equity firm Kohlberg & Co in 2008. It went public in 2011.

290,"   By Abhijith Ganapavaram  Nike Inc's (NKE.N) future orders missed analysts' estimates for the third time in a row, as the world's largest footwear maker struggles with increasing competition from Under Armour Inc (UA.N) and a resurgent Adidas (ADSGn.DE) in North America.Shares of the company, which reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, fell 4.4 percent to $52.90 in after-market trading on Tuesday. The stock is the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, down about 11 percent to Tuesday's close.Nike and its Jordan brand still command the lion's share of the U.S. footwear market, but rivals Adidas and Under Armour are chipping away at the company's decades-long dominant position.The company has lost basketball sales to Under Armour since the latter poached Golden State Warriors player Stephen Curry in 2013. It is also suffering from a revival at Adidas, which has scored mostly with fashion shoes promoted by celebrities such as Kanye West, who moved from Nike to Adidas the same year.""Adidas is red-hot right now and retailers can't get enough of it,"" Edward Jones Analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters adding that some U.S. retailers were giving more shelf space to Nike's competition.     Sales of Adidas' classic shoes nearly quadrupled in August, compared with a 33 percent rise in Nike's similar line, according to market research firm NPD. Under Armour has also been pushing deeper into department stores. The second-biggest U.S. sportswear maker said it would sell its products at U.S. department store operator Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) from 2017.FUTURE ORDERS  Nike said on a conference call that it would now issue a forecast for its future orders, a key indicator of demand, during the earnings call, moving away from a years-long tradition of announcing it in the earnings release. The move to stop issuing future orders seems ""very suspect"" at a time when North America and other markets have slowed down, Yarbrough said. The company said global orders from September 2016 through January 2017 were up 7 percent on a constant-currency basis, missing the 8 percent increase analysts' had expected.  The forecast - keenly watched by investors - was the lowest in five quarters. Net income rose 5.9 percent to $1.25 billion, or 73 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Aug. 31.Revenue rose 7.7 percent to $9.06 billion, while inventories jumped 11 percent to $4.9 billion.

296,"  LONDON Chelsea announced on Thursday a long-term partnership with Nike from next year in a deal that media reports suggested could be worth 60 million pounds ($74.61 million) a season.Without giving financial details, Chelsea said it represented the largest commercial deal in the Premier League club's history.""Nike will produce strips for the first team, academy and ladies teams, as well as a full range of clothing for Chelsea’s millions of supporters around the world,"" the club said in a statement.Chelsea's current kit is produced by Adidas, which said in May it had reached a mutual agreement to end its deal on June 30, 2017, instead of in 2023 as originally agreed, allowing the club to enter a new agreement with another competitor.Media reports have indicated Adidas were paying Chelsea an estimated 30 million pounds ($43.38 million) a year, with the Nike deal likely to be double that figure. Adidas agreed in 2014 to pay 750 million pounds ($1.1 billion) to replace Nike as sponsor of Manchester United for a decade.""This is an incredibly exciting and important deal for the club,"" Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia told the club website (www.chelseafc.com). ""We believe Nike will be able to support our growth into new markets as well as helping us maintain our place among the world’s elite soccer clubs.""  Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, won the Premier League title in 2014-15 but a poor run of form last season meant they failed to qualify for European football.

301,"   By Matt Scuffham  Performance Sports Group Ltd PSG.TO PSG.N, the maker of Bauer ice hockey gear, said on Monday it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Canada to facilitate a restructuring and sale of almost all of its assets.The company, which also makes baseball bats and other sports equipment, said it would put its assets up for auction but already had a deal to sell nearly all of them for $575 million to an investor group led by Sagard Capital, its biggest shareholder, and Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO). Reuters reported on Friday that Performance would file for bankruptcy with a buyer in hand and would seek out higher bids.Former Performance Chairman Graeme Roustan told Reuters in August that he was working with investment banks to explore a bid for the company. Performance's troubles highlight the challenges North American manufacturers face in the highly competitive sporting goods market. The company listed assets of $500 million to $1 billion and liabilities of $500 million to $1 billion in its voluntary petition filed in Delaware under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  The company said it had begun proceedings under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada's Ontario Superior Court of Justice.Performance said it expected operations to continue uninterrupted during the bankruptcy process, through a $386 million debtor-in-possession financing provided by existing lenders and the investor group. The company also announced management changes. President Amir Rosenthal and Executive Vice President Todd Harman left on Friday. Dan Sills was named executive vice president, hockey, and Mike Thorne was appointed executive vice president, baseball/softball.Jennifer Hughey was named senior vice president, supply chain.

302,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN German sportswear firm Puma (PUMG.DE) reported strong third-quarter profits on Thursday, due to tight cost controls, improved sourcing and higher prices, and said its full-year operating profit should come in at the top end of its expectations.Installed by majority owner Kering (PRTP.PA) in 2013, Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden has led a gradual turnaround of a brand that had fallen out of favor, pushing it further behind market leaders Nike (NKE.N) and Adidas (ADSGn.DE).Gulden has managed to revive sales growth, but improving profitability has been made more difficult by the strong U.S. dollar, the currency in which the sportswear industry sources most products in Asia.In response, Gulden has sought to impose a strict control on costs, while increasing some prices and shifting more production to markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.Those efforts bore some fruit in the third quarter, with net profit almost doubling to 39.5 million euros, beating average analyst forecasts for 33 million euros.It now expects its full-year earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) to be in upper half of the range of 115 million to 125 million euros, reiterating a forecast for a high single-digit rise in currency-adjusted sales. Puma's shares were up 1.4 percent by 0429 ET, bringing their gains this year to almost 11 percent, outperforming a 1 percent rise for the German small-cap index .SDAXI.Gulden said new products like Ignite Dual running shoes promoted by Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt and the Fenty fashion line designed by singer Rihanna were proving popular.""More consumers are buying our products at full price and retailers are therefore more satisfied with us,"" he said, adding that products for women were selling particularly well. Puma appointed Rihanna as women's creative director in 2014 as it seeks to tap into the ""athleisure"" trend of sports clothing being worn as a fashion statement, also partnering with top models like Cara Delevingne and Kylie Jenner.Gulden shrugged off suggestions that slowing sales for both Nike and Under Armour Inc (UA.N) in North America might be a signal that ""athleisure"" might have peaked.""We are coming from a low base. We are very, very happy with the development in the U.S. in the last eight to 10 weeks because our products are selling through. Our sales are not slowing down, more the opposite,"" he told reporters. Rival Adidas last week gave a cautious outlook for 2017 after it reported its quarterly net profit rose 15 percent on sales up 14 percent and reiterated a forecast for 2016 currency-adjusted sales to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens.($1 = 0.9143 euros) (Editing by Victoria Bryan, Greg Mahlich)",2016-11-10,NKE,"Thu Nov 10, 2016 | 5:25am EST",UPDATE 2-Puma sees year profits hitting top end of targeted range,http://www.reuters.com//article/puma-de-results-idUSL8N1DB2AH?type=companyNews
