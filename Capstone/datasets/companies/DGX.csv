4,"   By Ransdell Pierson  The chief executive of Quest Diagnostics Inc (DGX.N) said his company will stick to its core business of diagnostic testing and is not interested in acquiring a contract research organization (CRO), despite such a planned move by rival diagnostics firm LabCorp (LH.N).LabCorp, or Laboratory Corp of America Holdings, said on Monday it would pay $6.1 billion for Covance Inc CVD.N, a leading CRO that conducts trials for drugmakers, as its own diagnostic services business faces pressure from reimbursement cuts. Covance's drug development outsourcing services lessen the need for drugmakers to maintain their own in-house laboratories. By buying Covance, LabCorp would enter the CRO business, while holding on to its existing central labs diagnostics business.Quest, through its own laboratories, offers a wide array of services that range from simple cholesterol tests to genetic tests for risk of breast cancer. Steve Rusckowski, Quest's chief executive, said in an interview on Wednesday that his company is not interested in straying very far from its focus on diagnostic information services.""What we don't have, and we believe is not in the scope of diagnostic information services, is a clinical research organization,"" Rusckowski said. ""We believe the scope we have in diagnostic information services is broad enough and good enough for us to support our growth goals.""Earlier on Wednesday, at an investor day in New York, Quest said it expects average annual sales to grow by 2 percent to 5 percent over the next three years, with acquisitions accounting for one to two percentage points of that growth. It also forecast combined cost savings of $600 million over the same period, thanks largely to standardization of processes, information technology and equipment. For the three-year period, it also predicted growth in earnings per share, excluding special items, of 8 percent to 10 percent on average. Rusckowski said the company, like its rivals, has been hurt in recent years by pricing pressures, including a large reduction in reimbursement by the U.S. Medicare insurance program for pathology tests.But he said pricing pressures appear to be moderating and that increasing numbers of diagnostic tests ordered by doctors could offer ""upside"" for the company in coming years.

5,"  Laboratory testing company Quest Diagnostics Inc said on Tuesday it had signed a $520,000 agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify trends in screening, diagnosis and treatment of four strains of viral hepatitis.Quest will provide the U.S. public health agency with analytics and access to Quest's national database of clinical testing hepatitis data, which includes information from more than 20 billion test results.The agreement expands on Quest's previous efforts with the CDC on hepatitis C testing data for Baby Boomers, or individuals born between 1945 and 1965, one of the groups most exposed to the virus. The government in 2012 recommended that Baby Boomers be screened for hepatitis C, which can cause death. The expanded agreement aims to identify trends in screening for hepatitis A, B, C and E and will focus on data for hepatitis B and C in pregnant women to find possible gaps that the CDC could use to target screening and treatment.The data have been modified to protect the identity of the patients. ""If you can get people diagnosed, then the next obvious stage is to get them into care,"" said Rick Pesano, medical director for infectious diseases at Quest.Treatment for hepatitis C has changed dramatically since Gilead Sciences Inc introduced its Sovaldi drug in December of 2013 with few side effects. It has since introduced a second combination drug Harvoni and AbbVie Inc has launched a competitor that offers similar cure rates above 90 percent.

7,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to the $1.2  billion bond offering by Quest Diagnostics Inc. (Quest; NYSE: DGX). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Fitch expects the bond proceeds, as well as internal liquidity sources, to be  used to repay up to $1,275 million of outstanding debt and associated fees  during 2015, including: --$500 million of 5.45% senior notes due November 2015; --$375 million of 6.4% senior notes due July 2017; --$150 million (50%) of the 3.2% senior notes due April 2016;  --Up to $250 million of a combination of its 6.95% senior notes due 2037 and  5.75% senior notes due 2040. The refinancing will cause reported debt leverage to be temporarily elevated  during 2015. But Fitch expects the aforementioned debt to be repaid and total  debt balances to be reduced to approximately $3.8 billion, with gross  debt/EBITDA between 2.5x and 2.7x, by year-end. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Quest is the largest provider of clinical diagnostic and lab services in the  U.S. Its scale, scope, and customer diversity contributes to relatively stable  operations and margins, albeit facing ongoing pricing and competitive pressures. --Gross debt/EBITDA of 2.7x at Dec. 31, 2014 is expected to remain toward the  upper end of the current 'BBB' ratings and outside Quest's stated long-term  target of 2.25x at least through 2015. --Discretionary cash flows, including FCF of $412 million in 2014, are weaker  than historical measures but still adequate. Recently elevated capital spending  is a more favorable strain on FCF than the heavy shareholder returns of 2013 and  should drive stronger operations going forward.  --The aforementioned refinancing extends most of Quest's near-term debt  maturities and, thereby, reduces refinancing risk. But opportunities for debt  repayment over the next four years will now be limited to temporary A/R facility  borrowings and the $150 million of remaining 3.2% notes due 2016. --The firm's restructuring programs are helping to offset margin pressures from  weak healthcare utilization trends and tightened reimbursement. But EBITDA  margins still showed some compression in 2014, the fifth straight year of  decline. RATING SENSITIVITIES Quest will have limited flexibility at the current 'BBB' ratings for much of  2015. De-leveraging is likely to occur primarily from growing EBITDA, as the  firm has limited opportunities for debt repayment following the contemplated  refinancing. Organic growth will be difficult given industry headwinds, making  EBITDA growth dependent on cost savings and/or M&A funded out of discretionary  cash flows. Negative rating action could stem from sustained weak operating performance,  characterized by minimal volume growth due to continued negative healthcare  utilization trends and tightened government and commercial reimbursement.  Continued EBITDA margin compression and/or incremental debt from leveraging  transactions that results in gross debt leverage maintained above 2.7x would be  more consistent with a 'BBB-' rating. Positive rating action is not likely over the ratings horizon. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Relatively flat organic revenues, some benefit from acquisitions annualizing  in Q1; --Relatively flat margins from continuing pricing and competitive pressures,  offset by further Invigorate cost savings and improving margins in acquired  businesses; --Operating cash flow in 2015 similar to 2014 measures, with modest increases in  capex and dividend payouts.

10,"  NEW YORK Quest Diagnostics Inc, the world's largest provider of diagnostic testing services, is working with France's national health agency to build an expanded database for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations to better determine patient hereditary risks of breast and ovarian cancer.Other medical testing companies and public laboratories can participate in the project, called BRCA Share, for which Quest will charge an annual fee in return for access to the curated database, Madison, New Jersey-based Quest said on Tuesday.Laboratory Corporation of America, Quest's biggest U.S. competitor in medical diagnostics testing, has also agreed to participate.Genetic information gathered from DNA testing is not always shared by diagnostics laboratories, which can make it difficult for those with smaller databases to analyze gene mutations. This can result in uncertainty for patients about their cancer risk and appropriate preventative care.The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research collects all BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing information in France through 16 labs that are part of the Unicancer Genetic Group and maintains a database that is the foundation of the project.While other databases exist to share genetic information, differences in terminology and format as well as duplications can make them difficult to use, said Charles Strom, Quest's vice president for genetics and genomics. With the broader pool, Quest will also be able to conduct research studies, he said.Fees for access to the database will run from the tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for private laboratories. The number of tests for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has jumped since Angelina Jolie revealed 18 months ago that she had the mutation associated with breast and ovarian cancer.There are some mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that are well recognized as raising the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but there are thousands of other possible mutations in the genes whose significance remains unknown.In the United States, Myriad Genetics Inc has the longest history of BRCA testing as well as the highest volume of tests. It holds over 90 percent of the market for hereditary cancer testing and has cited its database as a competitive advantage. Myriad had held a patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing, but after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it invalid, other laboratories entered the market in 2013.In addition to Quest and LabCorp, Invitae Corp, privately held Ambry Genetics and the University of Washington in Seattle offer BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing.

14,"  (Adds Quest declined to comment, updates prices)NEW YORK May 22 Quest Diagnostics Inc  shares jumped to a record high on heavy volume on Friday following chatter on Twitter and elsewhere that the lab testing company may be trying to sell itself.The stock rose as much as 20.5 percent and was briefly halted on the New York Stock Exchange. It was last up 10 percent at $81.29, which would be its biggest one-day percentage move since 2011.A Quest spokeswoman declined to discuss the stock price move, saying the company does not comment on rumors or speculation.Volume was also the highest since 2011. It began to rise sharply around 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) and was last at more than 11.2 million shares, more than nine times the 10-day moving average. ""It's rumors of them selling themselves but they're being really quiet,"" said JMP Securities analyst J.T. Haresco. ""No one (at the company) is answering any calls, so it's all speculation.""Quest, the largest U.S. laboratory diagnostics company, conducts medical tests such as blood analysis. ""There's always going to be a group of investors who want the company sold,"" Haresco said, ""but when you think of what Quest is as an entity, there aren't too many places it could fit.""The speculation also spurred a surge in activity in Quest options, whose overall volume jumped to 15,000 contracts, or about 28 times normal, according to analytics firm Trade Alert. The bulk of the activity was in calls, which are usually used for placing bullish bets on a stock. About 12,000 calls traded, with nine of the 10 most active set to expire in mid-June.Calls on the shares rising above $75 and $80 by June 19 were the most active.One lot of about 700 calls at the $75 strike was snapped up for $1.00 to $1.05 at 10:10 ET (1410 GMT), minutes before the shares started spiking. These calls were last trading at $7.21, according to Thomson Reuters data.Shares of rival Laboratory Corp of America were up 1.3 percent at $121.83.

23,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Quest  Diagnostics Inc. (Quest; NYSE: DGX) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Quest is the largest independent player in the relatively fragmented and  highly competitive U.S. clinical laboratory market. Such scale affords the  opportunity for comparatively efficient operations and supplies sourcing and the  ability to drive associated margin improvement following M&A. --Quest's focus on operational improvement has helped to drive margin  improvement that has been accompanied by positive organic growth in each fiscal  quarter since fourth-quarter 2014. Fitch expects low single digit organic growth  and further margin expansion in 2016, benefitting from moderating pricing  pressure, cost efficiencies, and favorable business mix driven by strong growth  in Quest's gene-based and esoteric testing business. --Gross debt/EBITDA was 2.7x at March 31, 2016, which remains moderately  elevated relative to Quest's 'BBB' ratings and what Fitch believes to be  management's long-term target of around 2.5x. Fitch expects this metric to  approximate 2.5x by year-end 2016, largely due to earnings growth . Fitch does  not expect the company to prioritize debt repayment in the current low interest  rate environment. --Management has demonstrated its commitment to using discretionary cash to fund  M&A and shareholder-friendly payments over the past few years. The firm has  committed to delivering a majority of its operating cash flows, less capex, to  shareholders going forward and plans to conduct M&A so as to add 1%-2% of sales  per year. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Quest include: --Top-line growth of between 3%-4% in 2017-2019. Organic top-line growth is  expected to approximate 1.5-2% with the remainder anticipated to come from 1%-2%  of annual growth through M&A.  --Incremental margin expansion is forecast throughout the projection period.  Organic positive top-line growth allows for the leverage of fixed costs, and  additional cost savings from the company's 'Invigorate' restructuring program  are expected to benefit 2016-2019 results.  --Operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF) are expected to total  roughly $1 billion and $400 million, respectively, in 2016, and then grow  roughly in line with EBITDA over the forecast period. --Moderate EBITDA growth on a slightly increasing debt balance (reflecting  expectation that Quest will manage towards a 2.5x gross leverage target) is  expected to result in gross leverage of around 2.5x throughout the forecast  period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Quest's 'BBB' ratings consider gross debt/EBITDA in the range of 2.2x-2.7x, with  evidence of growth and margin stabilization over the forecast period. Fitch  estimates that OCF of $500 million to $600 million will be necessary to fund the  firm's M&A targets (1%-2% of growth) and commitment to return a majority of FCF  to shareholders. Positive rating actions are not likely in the near term, as Fitch expects Quest  to maintain gross leverage at or near 2.5x for the foreseeable future. Over the  longer term, an upgrade to 'BBB+' could be considered if the company committed  to maintaining gross debt/EBITDA at 2.2x or below, accompanied by an outlook for  positive organic growth and margin expansion. Organic growth will be challenged  in the near term by a persistently constrained reimbursement environment, making  meaningful EBITDA growth dependent on cost savings and/or M&A funded with  discretionary cash flows. Negative rating action could stem from a reversion to negative growth and margin  trends coupled with an inability to drive cost savings under the firm's expanded  Invigorate program. Ongoing EBITDA declines and/or debt-funded transactions  contributing to gross debt/EBITDA sustained around 2.7x or above could drive a  downgrade to 'BBB-'. Operating cash flow trending below $500 million without an  adjustment to the firm's dividend or capital spending could also pressure the  ratings. BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS YIELDING BENEFITS Quest ended a five-year streak of organic top-line declines and margin  deterioration in 2015 thanks to a renewed focus on the company's diagnostic  information services business and a commitment to improving operational  efficiencies. Adjusting for exited business, Quest has now reported six  consecutive quarters of organic growth. Fitch forecasts organic sales growth in  2016 to approximate 1.5%. Company organic growth could rejoin overall market  growth of 2%-3% in 2017. Organic top-line growth, coupled with an additional $600 million of cost savings  targeted in 2015-2017, is expected to promote margin expansion over the forecast  period. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to be modestly up in 2016 and 2017, with  greater improvement possible in 2018 and 2019. EBITDA margins are expected to  surpass 20% over the forecast period compared to 19.5% and 18.7% in 2015 and  2014, respectively. Greater improvement is possible but will be challenged by a  constrained reimbursement environment and growth in Quest's professional labs  services (PLS) business, which is lower margin than the company's diagnostic  services business, but is significantly less capital intensive. DEBT REDUCTION IS UNLIKELY Fitch projects that Quest's gross debt leverage will generally approximate 2.5x  over the forecast period and does not expect the company to prioritize debt  repayment in the current low interest rate environment.  Management has demonstrated its commitment to using discretionary cash to fund  M&A and shareholder-friendly payments over the past few years. The firm has  committed to delivering a majority of its operating cash flows, less capex, to  shareholders going forward and plans to conduct M&A so as to add 1%-2% of sales  per year. On May 18, 2016, Quest announced that it would use the cash proceeds  from the sale of its Focus products business to repurchase shares. Fitch expects  near-term acquisition activity to be targeted in nature and financed with cash  on hand and/or temporary draws on the company's A/R facility. Without material opportunities for debt repayment over the next four years,  deleveraging will be highly dependent on EBITDA growth.  PAMA PRESENTS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES  Under the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), it is  expected that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will revise  reimbursement schedules for clinical laboratory testing services provided under  Medicare. Among other provisions, PAMA allows CMS to create a market-based  payment system to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule as early as 2017,  although delays in the rule making progress appear likely to delay its  implementation. Under the law, 'applicable laboratories' are required to report to CMS the rates  they receive from private payors for each clinical diagnostic lab test. After  collecting this information, CMS will calculate a weighted median payment amount  for each test. An 'applicable laboratory' is defined as a lab that receives more than 50  percent of its Medicare revenues Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule  (MCLFS) and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). As drafted, PAMA  therefore would not require hospital labs to report fees. Because hospital labs  typically receive higher commercial rates than independent labs, their exclusion  from CMS' market rate calculation could result in revisions to the MCLFS and  MPFS that are lower than actual overall market rates. While lower Medicare reimbursement rates would pressure Quest and other  independent labs, Quest may be in a better position than many of its smaller  competitors to absorb its impact and could actually benefit from PAMA's  implementation. In 2015, only 12% of the company's consolidated net revenues  were reimbursed by Medicare under the CLFS while 2% were reimbursed by under the  MPFS. Fitch believes many smaller labs may have more concentrated exposure to  Medicare. AMPLE LIQUIDITY Quest had access to an undrawn $750 million revolver, $123 million available  under its $600 million A/R securitization facility, and had cash on hand of $128  million at March 31, 2016 (42% considered permanently reinvested outside the  U.S.). Quest amended and restated its $750 million revolver in April 2014, extending  its maturity to April 2019. In October 2015, the company amended and restated  the agreement for the secured receivables credit facility, increasing the  borrowing capacity under the facility to $600 million from $525 million and  extending the maturity by one year to October 2017. Quest's only remaining bond  maturity before 2020 is $300 million due April 2019. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Quest's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'.
