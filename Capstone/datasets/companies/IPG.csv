Wren said if the companies were unable to obtain the tax residency approvals, ""it could affect the likelihood of satisfaction of the conditions to closing of our deal.""Any major tax implication for investors could be a potential deal breaker as both companies are trying to make the merger tax-free for their shareholders, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich told Reuters.""I think there's definitely some additional doubt cast on the deal getting done,"" she added.The tax residency will have to be approved by the revenue and customs authority in the United Kingdom and the finance ministry of the Netherlands, where the new company will be headquartered.Tax approval from France is also pending, the company said.""With respect to a number of items (for receiving tax approvals)... there is no Plan B. Those things are requirements to get to a closing,"" Wren said.

10,"   By Liana B. Baker and Jennifer Saba  Activist hedge fund Elliott Management has taken a 6.7 percent stake, worth about $570 million, in advertising firm Interpublic Group of Cos Inc (IPG.N), setting up a showdown that could result in a sale. The $24 billion hedge fund run by Paul Singer disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday that IPG's shares ""are undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity."" Elliott said it wants to ""engage in a constructive dialogue"" with the company's board of directors to maximize shareholder value.A source familiar with Elliott's position in the U.S.-based advertising firm, that includes the agencies McCann Erickson and FCB, said it is gearing up to push the company on the auction block, hoping to attract IPG's larger competitors as buyers.IPG shares were up 1.5 percent at $20.15 in morning trading. A spokesman did not respond to a request to comment. IPG is the No.4 ad firm in the world, with a market value of $8.4 billion. WPP (WPP.L) is the largest agency, followed by Omnicom and Publicis. ""It seems reasonable to conclude there is interest in creating a process to sell IPG,"" said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. ""One of the big challenges in trying to do this with a big agency holding company is that it can be very disruptive to existing business.""Wieser thinks that Japan's Dentsu Aegis (4324.T) is the most likely bidder for IPG. IPG has long been rumored as a takeover candidate and the speculation has only increased as the advertising sector consolidates. France's Publicis (PUBP.PA) and U.S.-based Omnicom (OMC.N) planned to merge in a $35 billion deal that would have resulted in the world’s largest advertising agency, billing it as a better way to compete in the digital arena.That potential marriage collapsed as the two companies clashed on culture and couldn’t agree on leadership or structure.The consolidation points to the enormous pressures that traditional ad firms are facing from digital platforms like Facebook (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), tech giants like Oracle (ORCL.N) and Adobe (ADBE.O), as well as a host of VC-funded start-ups focused on turning the process of buying and selling ads into one that resembles electronic stock exchanges. IPG's clients include General Motors (GM.N), Unilever (ULVR.L) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).This is the second bet this week by Elliott Management, which invested more than $1 billion in data storage products maker EMC EMC.N with an aim to push it to spin off its VMware unit.

11,"  Sept 11 A Dentsu Aegis executive said on Thursday that the advertising company was not interested in acquiring rival Interpublic Group of Cos, putting merger speculation to rest for the moment.U.S.-based IPG, long considered a takeover candidate, has been under increased pressure since activist hedge fund Elliott Management took a 6.7 percent stake in the company, a move that could eventually result in a sale.Dentsu is considered one of the potential suitors.

15,"  * Publicis aims to boost growth after failed Omnicom merger* CEO Maurice Levy bets on digital ads and marketing* Sapient options unusually active before announcement* Deal financed with existing cash and debt* Publicis shares fall as much as 5 pct   (Adds information about options moves before deal, additional quotes from Levy)By Leila AbboudPARIS, Nov 3 Publicis, the world's third-largest advertising agency, is to buy U.S.-based digital ad specialist Sapient for $3.7 billion in cash as it seeks to accelerate growth after a botched merger earlier this year.The French group is hoping rapid growth in both North American and Internet advertising, which are far outpacing European and traditional ad formats, will help it catch up with sales gains at rivals such as WPP and Interpublic .Chief Executive Maurice Levy has blamed Publicis' recent poor performance on a failed merger with world No.2 ad agency Omnicom, announced in August 2013 and abandoned in May over control and cultural clashes.But some analysts said Publicis' offer of $25 per share, a 44 percent premium to Sapient's closing price on Friday, was a hefty price for a company whose growth may have peaked.The transaction, which followed an unusual rally in Sapient shares and options last week, could also dash hopes among the French company's shareholders that cash might be distributed to them, analysts said.Publicis shares fell 2.3 percent, while Sapient was up 42 percent at $24.59 in early afternoon trading.""A good asset at a steep price,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Charles Bedouelle of the deal, adding it would ""likely push back (Publicis') cash return story by two years.""UBS analyst Tamsin Garrity said Publicis had been under pressure from investors to return cash, and was expected to announced share buybacks at a strategy day on Friday. ""The acquisition of Sapient makes such returns unlikely,"" she added. Garrity has a neutral rating on Publicis shares.Levy defended the decision, saying the company would generate more value in the long term by buying Sapient rather than buying back its own shares. He pledged to update investors on his approach to dividends and buybacks sometime in November.""This operation is extremely important for securing the future of Publicis,"" Levy said. ""It is far better to invest and deliver a higher growth and higher profits ... which will lead to a re-rating, rather than simply buy back our own shares.""""The deal will create a foundation for accelerated growth"" by giving Publicis access to new markets and revenues, he added.Publicis said the deal would be financed through existing cash and new debt, and would not affect Publicis' credit rating. It did not say when it would add to group profits but forecast 50 million euros ($63 million) in annual cost savings.""A JILTED LOVER""?  Sapient's sales grew 14.1 percent to 1.1 billion euros last year, far outstripping Publicis' sales growth of 1.2 percent, though the French company had a higher operating profit margin. The U.S-based group earned 63 percent of its 2013 sales in North America and has 13,000 employees, 8,500 of which are in India.""The risk that growth slows at Sapient is one of the transaction's more important considerations,"" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.He noted the deal gave Sapient an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of around 12 times its forecast earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for 2015, far above Publicis' current multiple of about 8 times.Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of Publicis' rival WPP, was even harsher, telling financial blog Business Insider that Publicis had rushed into the Sapient deal to compensate for its botched marriage with Omnicom.""It looks like the behaviour of a jilted lover,"" said Sorrell, who often trades barbs with his cross-channel rival.Levy responded on a later conference call that he did not think Sorrell ""knew anything about love."" ""When it comes to love he should give that to the French,"" he said.Buying Sapient will speed Publicis' roughly seven year-old effort to earn more revenue from digital advertising, which includes everything from online marketing to brand building on social networks and automatic ad buying for major customers.Last year, 38.4 percent of Publicis' sales came from digital, and it had been aiming to reach 50 percent by 2018, something that the Sapient deal will make happen immediately.According to Zenith Optimedia, the digital ad market is expected to grow 17.1 percent this year, driving total ad market growth of 5.3 percent.Sapient's main SapientNitro unit is a digital agency on a par with Publicis' Razorfish and WPP's AKQA with customers including carmaker Fiat, retailer Marks & Spencer and consumer goods group Unilever.'SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY'? Sapient shares rose 20 percent last week ahead of the deal announcement, compared to a 3.3 percent rise in the Nasdaq, prompting some market observers to question whether information had leaked.  Trading in options in Sapient was also especially heavy.""It looks like that there was some suspicious activity in Sapient,"" said optionMonster.com lead analyst David Russell. ""Someone is definitely making a lot of money on this and they were buying the calls right before the merger was announced.""Sapient boss Alan Herrick will continue to run the company and join Publicis' management team, while Jerry Greenberg, the co-chairman of Sapient's board, will join Publicis' board.The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Citigroup has committed to financing the bid.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Rothschild advised Publicis, while Goldman Sachs and Blackstone advised Sapient.(1 US dollar = 0.8000 euro)   (Additional reporting by Saqib Ahmed and Jennifer Saba; Editing by David Clarke, Mark Potter and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-11-03,IPG,"Mon Nov 3, 2014 | 12:54pm EST",UPDATE 4-Publicis to buy U.S. digital ad firm Sapient for $3.7 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/sapient-ma-publicis-groupe-idUSL6N0ST0EV20141103?type=companyNews

24,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider advertising agency Campbell-Ewald Co's attempt to fend off a class action lawsuit over claims the company violated a federal consumer law by sending unsolicited text messages on behalf of the U.S. Navy.Campbell-Ewald, a subsidiary of the Interpublic Group of Companies Inc(IPG.N), says the court has no grounds to hear the case brought by plaintiff Jose Gomez on behalf of himself and others who received the messages because the advertising firm offered to pay him the maximum amount available under the law to settle the claims. The U.S. Navy messages were part of a recruitment drive. The brief text message, sent to around 100,000 people, included the phrase: “Destined for something big? Do it in the Navy.” The company is seeking to reverse a September 2014 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the case could move forward despite the offer. Gomez turned down the $1,500 offer for each violation, which Campbell-Ewald said would fully resolve his case. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, it is illegal to make a call or send a message using an automated system without consent. There is a $500 penalty for each violation, which can be trebled if it is a knowing and willful violation.The Navy was not sued and is not involved in the case.In court papers, Campbell-Ewald said that although the dollar amounts are small for each complaint, the consumer law has become “an extortionist weapon in the hands of class action lawyers seeking to extract lucrative attorneys’ fees for class-wide settlements.” Defendants like Campbell-Ewald have sought to offer plaintiffs full damages before the class action lawsuit can go forward in order to avoid the lengthy litigation, the lawyers said.Gomez’s lawyers say an offer to the lead plaintiff in a case should not prevent him from representing the class. Oral arguments and a decision are due in the court’s next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2016.The case is Campbell-Ewald v. Gomez, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-857.

34,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of The  Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG) including its Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. A  full list of rating actions follows at the end of the release. The positive outlook reflects Fitch's belief that IPG's credit protection  metrics and credit profile are strong for the 'BBB' rating. IPG's operating  profile has shown marked improvement since FY 2012 (EBITDA margins have improved  more than 200 bps), and the company continues to make progress to close the gap  relative to its peer group. Fitch believes this improvement will continue as the  business grows and IPG further scales its cost structure while maintaining its  conservative financial posture.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --IPG's ratings reflect its position in the industry as one of the largest  global advertising and marketing services holding companies, its diverse client  base, and its ample liquidity. --The ratings incorporate the cyclicality of the advertising industry and  potential top-line volatility due to client wins or losses in any given year.  IPG has reduced its exposure to U.S. advertising cycles by diversifying into  international markets and marketing services businesses. For FY 2015,  approximately 41% of IPG's revenues were generated outside the U.S. IPG  delivered organic revenue growth of 6.1% and 6.7% in 2015 and first quarter  2016, respectively. The company expects organic growth in the range of 3% to 4%  in 2016. Fitch believes this is achievable given its current forecast for U.S.  GDP growth and Worldwide GDP growth of 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively, for 2016. --Digital ad spend continues to capture more of the total advertising market.  IPG remains platform agnostic and the company remains focused on growing and  strengthening its digital capabilities across their agency portfolio in line  with market trends.  --The risk of revenue cyclicality is balanced somewhat by the flexible cost  structures of IPG and the other global advertising holding companies. IPG has  made significant progress in improving margins from 10.7% in FY 2009 to 14.4% in  FY 2015. Fitch expects the EBITDA margin to continue improving reaching 14.7% by  year-end 2016 and expects IPG to achieve peer level margins within the next two  to three years, assuming low- to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth over  this timeframe. --The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that IPG will manage unadjusted gross  leverage to a level below 2.0x. Fitch expects capital deployment to go toward  acquisitions, share buy backs and dividend growth. However, Fitch expects any  such deployment to remain in the context of current ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for IPG include: --Margins expected to improve from cost controls and operating leverage; --Model assumes constant dividend growth; --Model assumes share buyback near prior ranges as well as ongoing acquisitions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch would consider an upgrade if the Company continues to demonstrate  improvement in its operating profile, specifically EBITDA margin of  approximately 15%, to bring them more in line with industry peers while  maintaining leverage below 2.0x. Fitch is comfortable with management's willingness and ability to maintain its  'BBB' rating. However, a change in the company's posture regarding adequate  bondholder protection over the near and long term could negatively affect the  rating. This may include an unadjusted gross leverage greater than 2.75x,  significant margin erosion, or sustaining free cash flow (FCF) margin below 3%. LIQUIDITY IPG's total debt outstanding as March 31, 2016 was $1.8 billion (including  capital leases). Fitch calculates unadjusted gross leverage at 1.6x. Fitch views IPG's liquidity as solid. IPG's liquidity position is supported by a  cash balance of $673 million and marketable securities of $7 million as of March  31, 2016, in addition to $996 million of availability under its $1 billion  revolving credit facility due Oct. 2020. The company's next two maturities are  $300 million due in 2017 and $250 million in 2022.  Fitch-calculated FCF increased to $429 million in the latest 12 months (LTM)  period ended March 31, 2016, from $267 in 2013. Fitch expects 2016 FCF in the  range of $350 to $450 million. Fitch expects IPG to maintain sufficient  liquidity to handle seasonal working capital swings. Fitch's FCF expectation  also incorporates capital expenditures of $150 to $170 million. In addition,  Fitch's FCF expectations incorporate IPG's increased quarterly common dividend  to $0.15/share, for total annual cash dividend payments of approximately $240  million. IPG's U.S. pension plan was $25.8 million underfunded as of the end of 2015. IPG  should have no issues meeting any required U.S. pension plan funding.  In February 2016, IPG announced an additional $300 million share repurchase  authorization, increasing total remaining authorization to $404.9 million as of  March 31, 2016. The rating incorporates Fitch's belief that the company will  deploy liquidity, including FCF, toward share repurchases and acquisitions in a  disciplined manner. Fitch expects IPG to continue to target small bolt-on  acquisitions and the current ratings do not contemplate or expect a materially  large acquisition. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: IPG --LT IDR at 'BBB'; --Bank credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'; The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.

40,"   By Tim Baysinger and Aishwarya Venugopal | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Interpublic Group of Cos, one of the world's biggest advertising companies, said on Wednesday that the U.S. Justice Department had asked one of its standalone domestic agencies for documents regarding video production practices. It disclosed the request a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department's Antitrust Division was examining whether advertising agencies rigged bids to favor in-house production units, citing people familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/2h1OMbV). That story did not identify which advertising firms were being scrutinized in the investigation, which it said has been under way for the past few months.""We can confirm that one of our standalone domestic agencies has been contacted by the Department of Justice Antitrust Division for documents regarding video production practices and is cooperating with the government,"" Interpublic said in a statement. Justice Department officials could not immediately be reached for comment.A spokesman for WPP Plc, the world's biggest advertising firm, declined to say if the firm had been contacted by the Justice Department. Representatives with Omnicom Group Inc, and Publicis Group SA could not immediately be reached.The Wall Street Journal report said the government is investigating whether agencies compelled independent production companies to inflate their prices to make it easier for their own in-house units to be awarded those contracts. They are trying to determine whether the company violated federal antitrust laws that prohibit bid rigging and price fixing, the newspaper reported.Interpublic's statement said its code of conduct requires it act in the best interests of clients. ""In the case of production, that means requiring triple bids on all projects above a minimal dollar threshold,” it said. Interpublic’s shares were up 0.6 percent at $23.40 in midday trade.Large advertising companies have ramped up their own production efforts in recent years as a way to grow new revenue streams and keep up with advertisers’ increasing demand for video content.
