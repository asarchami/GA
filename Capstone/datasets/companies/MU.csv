16,"   By Reiji  Murai  and Edmund Klamann | TOKYO, March 18  TOKYO, March 18 When Japan Display Inc  lists on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Wednesday, it will bring vindication - and $1.6 billion in cash - for a government-backed restructuring effort after other high-stakes attempts to help chipmakers flopped.Cobbled together from loss-making units at Sony Corp , Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd, Japan Display has emerged as the world's biggest producer of screens for smartphones and tablets, marking a rare success for Japan's industrial policy.But the deal never would have happened if it were not for a group of working-level engineers who came up with the idea, leaving top executives on the sidelines - and at times in the dark - as their plans took shape, people involved in the process said.""When the company was launched, we were told it was a miracle,"" said Koichiro Taniyama, an executive managing director at the government-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), which invested 200 billion yen ($1.97 billion) for a 70 percent stake when Japan Display was founded two years ago.""And once the company was launched, we were told, can it really make it to a listing. But here, we've made it.""Japan Display is listing after selling more than $3 billion of shares in Japan's biggest offering in nine months, raising funds to invest in new facilities. The INCJ will reduce its stake to 34.5 percent from 86.7 percent.Industry and government officials have voiced hope the Japan Display model can be followed to revive other areas of the dormant electronics sector, which is feeling the heat from more nimble rivals such as those in South Korea and Taiwan.Doubts about Japan Display's prospects initially ran deep after failures at chipmakers Elpida Memory and Renesas Electronics Corp, which were also carved out of Japan's electronics conglomerates over the past decade and a half.Elpida was bought from bankruptcy protection last year by Micron Technology Inc, while Renesas was taken over by the INCJ in a rescue and restructuring after racking up nearly 650 billion yen in net losses during eight years in the red.Elpida and Renesas were hamstrung in part by infighting as executives from the conglomerates formed rival factions and fought for advantage, industry officials say. SECRETS But the engineers and managers at the display units of Sony, Toshiba and Hitachi, who joined forces with Taniyama and a handful of consultants to push their idea to form Japan Display, managed to avoid such pitfalls.They ""were more devoted to the survival of the display business than they were to remaining a part of those companies,"" said Keita Nishiyama, head of the economics and industrial policy bureau at the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry.The INCJ, which not only provided funds to Japan Display but was the main intermediary among the three conglomerates, is also widely credited with the success.""Without the Innovation Network Corp, Japan Display would not have happened,"" said METI's Nishiyama, who oversaw the creation of the government-backed fund to bolster innovative enterprises in Japan.Shortly after the fund's founding in mid-2009, Taniyama, a former banker and director at private equity firm Carlyle Group LP's Japan operation, was approached by Fumiaki Sato, a veteran industry analyst, who has long advocated electronics sector consolidation, and an engineer from one of the display units. Apple Inc's iPhone had been launched the year before, and they feared Japan might be overtaken in the coming smartphone revolution by aggressive, well-funded Taiwanese and Korean rivals.South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had already out manoeuvred Japan in businesses from TVs to memory chips.Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony were struggling in the wake of the Lehman crisis and were loath to invest in new factories to boost their businesses.But managers and engineers at the display units were convinced Japan could capitalise on its distinct technological edge in the specialised market for small screens, where fast-evolving gadgets were demanding ever-higher resolutions. RISKY ENTERPRISE At the beginning of 2010, Taniyama, Sato, the display executives and several consultants met secretly at the INCJ's Tokyo office to work on their plan, people in attendance said.They produced a 30-page proposal, which Taniyama took to the head offices of each of the three conglomerates and won their agreement to study the idea further.Sony later balked, however, unhappy with the valuations offered for its display unit and preoccupied with its own acquisition of Seiko Epson Corp's screen operations. It hoped to keep its display unit in-house.No sooner had Sony finally relented to the idea of merging the display businesses than Hitachi stopped attending meetings, lured by a more generous offer from Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co for its display unit.Hitachi's top management also eventually yielded, persuaded by the firm's display unit managers and engineers that a three-way tie-up offered the best long-term prospects for their technology to succeed, people directly involved in the process said.Aside from Japan Display and Renesas, the INCJ has invested primarily in small ventures and projects.Established to work to a 15-year time limit and with a 2 trillion yen funding limit, mainly government guarantees for lending rather than direct loans, it is able to fill funding gaps left by private-sector investment funds.""It's clear that the private-sector financial system is not working,"" said METI's Nishiyama. ""It will take some time to fix the overall system, so we started with trying this out in just a few cases.""The problem is that many Japanese firms are wary of private equity, especially foreign private equity. In addition, many private equity firms are not willing to work on the same sort of time horizon as the INCJ, said Tsutomu Noda, managing director and co-Japan representative at AlixPartners Asia LLC, a corporate turnaround consultancy.""Private equity firms typically want to realise the gain within three to five years, while INCJ has a much longer investment period,"" he said. ""Japanese companies prefer a longer-term view.""",2014-03-17,MU,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 5:02pm EDT",Engineers' coup pays off with Japan Display listing,http://www.reuters.com//article/japan-display-ipo-coup-idUSL3N0MB39720140317?type=companyNews
17,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Greenlight Capital Inc, the hedge fund overseen by David Einhorn, said on Monday it has unmasked the identity of an anonymous blogger who disclosed Greenlight's stake in a semiconductor company, and dropped a lawsuit to force website Seeking Alpha to reveal the blogger's name.Greenlight did not publicly disclose the name of the blogger, who under the pseudonym ""Valuable Insights"" revealed on November 14 that Greenlight had been buying shares of Micron Technology Inc.The New York-based firm eventually disclosed at the November 21 Robin Hood investment conference that it had been buying Micron shares. But it said the leak caused Micron's share price to rise, forcing the firm to pay higher prices and hurting its investors.Einhorn's firm had begun civil litigation last month in a New York state court to identify the Seeking Alpha contributor.""Greenlight has identified the anonymous blogger and has resolved the matter privately to our satisfaction,"" a Greenlight spokesman said.Seeking Alpha's website has identified Valuable Insights as a fund manager with nearly 20 years of investment experience. A spokesman for Seeking Alpha said on Monday the website did not reveal the blogger's identity, and that Greenlight ""dropped the suit of its own accord.""We continue to support third-party posters and their decision as to whether to publish under real or assumed names,"" the spokesman said. ""We believe in the value that pseudonymity builds for the community.""It is common for news to be leaked in the financial media, which often enjoy broad free speech protection, but rare for investors to litigate over leaks that cost them money, which Greenlight called ""misappropriation of trade secrets."" Investors like Einhorn and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc often try to keep their buying quiet, including by obtaining confidential treatment from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to keep other investors form mimicking their activity.Greenlight said it had requested confidential treatment from the SEC for its Micron purchases on November 14, the same day as the blog posting.In that posting, Valuable Insights wrote that a ""mega hedge fund rock star"" other than Daniel Ackman, Carl Icahn and Daniel Loeb would be investing in Micron. After another writer guessed that ""Einhorn"" was the buyer, Valuable Insights wrote, ""You heard it here first.""Micron's shares closed at $18.92 on November 13. They closed at $19.19 on November 14, and rose as high as $19.88 before Einhorn formally revealed he had taken a stake.Greenlight said it owned 47.7 million Micron shares as of December 31.

20,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and said the outlook for the memory industry is favorable as it switches production lines to make NAND chips used in smartphones and tablets from making DRAM chips for personal computers.Prices for DRAM chips made by Micron, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have bounced back from a deep memory chip price slump in 2012 that led some chipmakers to throttle back production.""They're executing pretty well in an improved memory market,"" said Pacific Crest analyst Monika Garg. ""DRAM was much better than expectations. On the NAND side they're facing a slightly higher average selling price decline but I think that's expected.""The Boise, Idaho company said that in the current quarter, average selling prices for its DRAM and NAND chips would likely decline by a low single-digit percentage.Micron's stock has surged over 160 percent in the past 12 months, helped by the recovery in memory chip prices as well as news in November that David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital had invested in the company. Micron's quarterly results include bankrupt Japanese DRAM maker Elpida Memory, which the U.S. chipmaker acquired in July 2013 in a bid to improve economies of scale.Micron believes that reducing the number of players competing in the memory chip industry will put an end to extreme price volatility that in difficult years has left the company reporting losses and driven smaller competitors out of business.""The industry is mature enough that people don't want to lose money anymore. There's just not any irrational money coming in to add supply and bring the whole industry down,"" Micron President Mark Adams told Reuters. ""The parties who may be interested have been burnt pretty badly."" Declining sales of personal computers have hurt demand for DRAM chips. In response, Micron has been focusing more on specialized DRAM for smartphones and tablets, as well as converting DRAM production lines to make NAND chips used to store data like music and photos on mobile devices.NAND chips have also been making inroads into data centers and high-end laptops, where they can replace traditional hard disk drives and enable ""instant on"" performance similar to tablets.In the short term, Micron is more optimistic about for DRAM chips than NAND chips due to imbalances between supply and demand, Adams said. But in the long-term, NAND chips have more growth potential, he said. Micron on Thursday reported a net profit of $731 million, or 61 cents per share, in the quarter ended February 27, compared with a loss of $286 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier.Excluding items, Micron earned 85 cents per share, better than the 76 cents expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 98 percent to $4.11 billion.

But the shares could still rise another 50 percent and yet trade at price-earnings discount to the broad semiconductor group, Barron's said in its issue dated Oct. 6.DRAM demand has increased because of new orders by businesses to replace workplace computers following Microsoft's end of support for its Windows XP operating system. There's new need now for computer power to drive so-called ""big data"" applications designed to quickly glean selling opportunities from information. The number of key DRAM makers has decreased to three from than 20 in the 1990s with an industry shakeout. That means there's more supply discipline among manufacturers, Barron's said. It helps, too, that smaller and smaller small chips are harder to make.""None of this will bring an end to memory cyclicality, but it should provide steadier cash flows, leading to less fearful stock valuations,"" the article said. Micron stock closed on Friday at $33.94. It could rise to over $50 next year and still trade at 12 times estimated earnings, Barron's said.

Analysts on average expected 92 cents per share.Shares of Micron were down 2.5 percent in extended trade after closing down 2.68 percent at $32.87 on Nasdaq.

43,"  (Adds comment from White House advisor in paragraphs 10-11)By Joseph MennSAN FRANCISCO Feb 16 The U.S. National Security Agency has figured out how to hide spying software deep within hard drives made by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba and other top manufacturers, giving the agency the means to eavesdrop on the majority of the world's computers, according to cyber researchers and former operatives.That long-sought and closely guarded ability was part of a cluster of spying programs discovered by Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based security software maker that has exposed a series of Western cyberespionage operations.Kaspersky said it found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs, with the most infections seen in Iran, followed by Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Mali, Syria, Yemen and Algeria. The targets  included government and military institutions, telecommunication companies, banks, energy companies, nuclear researchers, media, and Islamic activists, Kaspersky said. (reut.rs/1L5knm0)The firm declined to publicly name the country behind the spying campaign, but said it was closely linked to Stuxnet, the NSA-led cyberweapon that was used to attack Iran's uranium enrichment facility. The NSA is the agency responsible for gathering electronic intelligence on behalf of the United States.A former NSA employee told Reuters that Kaspersky's analysis was correct, and that people still in the intelligence agency valued these spying programs as highly as Stuxnet. Another former intelligence operative confirmed that the NSA had developed the prized technique of concealing spyware in hard drives, but said he did not know which spy efforts relied on it.NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines declined to comment.Kaspersky published the technical details of its research on Monday, which should help infected institutions detect the spying programs, some of which trace back as far as 2001. (bit.ly/17bPUUe)The disclosure could further hurt the NSA's surveillance abilities, already damaged by massive leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden's revelations have hurt the United States' relations with some allies and slowed the sales of U.S. technology products abroad.The exposure of these new spying tools could lead to greater backlash against Western technology, particularly in countries such as China, which is already drafting regulations that would require most bank technology suppliers to proffer copies of their software code for inspection.Peter Swire, one of five members of U.S. President Barack Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, said the Kaspersky report showed that it is essential for the country to consider the possible impact on trade and diplomatic relations before deciding to use its knowledge of software flaws for intelligence gathering. ""There can be serious negative effects on other U.S. interests,"" Swire said.TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH According to Kaspersky, the spies made a technological breakthrough by figuring out how to lodge malicious software in the obscure code called firmware that launches every time a computer is turned on.Disk drive firmware is viewed by spies and cybersecurity experts as the second-most valuable real estate on a PC for a hacker, second only to the BIOS code invoked automatically as a computer boots up.""The hardware will be able to infect the computer over and over,"" lead Kaspersky researcher Costin Raiu said in an interview. Though the leaders of the still-active espionage campaign could have taken control of thousands of PCs, giving them the ability to steal files or eavesdrop on anything they wanted, the spies were selective and only established full remote control over machines belonging to the most desirable foreign targets, according to Raiu. He said Kaspersky found only a few especially high-value computers with the hard-drive infections.Kaspersky's reconstructions of the spying programs show that they could work in disk drives sold by more than a dozen companies, comprising essentially the entire market. They include Western Digital Corp, Seagate Technology Plc , Toshiba Corp, IBM, Micron Technology Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.Western Digital, Seagate and Micron said they had no knowledge of these spying programs. Toshiba and Samsung declined to comment. IBM did not respond to requests for comment.GETTING THE SOURCE CODE  Raiu said the authors of the spying programs must have had access to the proprietary source code that directs the actions of the hard drives. That code can serve as a roadmap to vulnerabilities, allowing those who study it to launch attacks much more easily.""There is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [hard drive] operating system using public information,"" Raiu said.Concerns about access to source code flared after a series of high-profile cyberattacks on Google Inc and other U.S. companies in 2009 that were blamed on China. Investigators have said they found evidence that the hackers gained access to source code from several big U.S. tech and defense companies.It is not clear how the NSA may have obtained the hard drives' source code. Western Digital spokesman Steve Shattuck said the company ""has not provided its source code to government agencies."" The other hard drive makers would not say if they had shared their source code with the NSA.Seagate spokesman Clive Over said it has ""secure measures to prevent tampering or reverse engineering of its firmware and other technologies.""

Greece needs fresh funds to avoid defaulting on a $1.8 billion debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30. If it defaults, it may have to leave the euro or the European Union, potentially shaking the region's economic foundations. ""If this issue gets resolved, then we're set up for a fairly decent market, but it could be that everything falls apart on the 30th,"" said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisers in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. ""Market valuation is high in an absolute sense.""Nike rose 4.3 percent to $109.71 and was the biggest boost to the Dow after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted as it sold more high-margin shoes and apparel at higher prices.Micron Technology sank 18 percent to $19.66 a day after forecasting a further decline in prices of chips used in personal computers.

""Our long-term outlook is that sometime in the next few years, MU ... will be worth more than NFLX,"" Einhorn said. Micron's market capitalization is less than half that of Netflix, at about $19.1 billion, compared with Netflix's $42.9 billion after the close of trading on Monday.Einhorn expressed surprise that Netflix shares had rallied in the second quarter after the company's first-quarter earnings miss. The company's stock soared 58 percent during the quarter.He said that Micron's shares, which fell about 31 percent in the second quarter, ""have fallen too far.""  Micron's shares closed up 0.23 percent on Monday at $17.61, while Netflix was up nearly 4 percent to end at $707.61.""In today's market, the best-performing stocks are companies where accountability is in the distant future,"" Einhorn said, adding that ""apparently Red Ink is the New Black."" He also said that Greenlight had initiated ""small"" bullish positions in Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) over the quarter.

62,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar  China's Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd would need to pay as much as $38 billion to buy Micron Technology Inc (MU.O), analysts said - assuming that the U.S. government approved the purchase of last U.S. maker of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips.State-backed Tsinghua Unigroup is considering making a bid of $21 per share for Micron, valuing the Idaho-based company at $23 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Micron's shares rose as much as 12 percent to $19.79 in morning trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.China has been expressing strong interest in building up its domestic chip industry, and buying Micron would be a major coup.An acquisition of Micron would give China access to both DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are used in personal computers and to store music, pictures and other data on smartphones and mobile devices.The country consumes $10-$11 billion of DRAM chips annually, according to JP Morgan analysts. Any deal, though, would need a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which would examine the national security implications.""DRAM and 3D NAND manufacturing technologies are strategic for China but difficult to access,"" Jefferies analysts said in a client note.""Leading-edge high volume memory design and manufacturing (intellectual property) is closely held by a handful of companies, none of which we think would want a new entrant from China to affect supply/demand fundamentals unfavorably."" Tsinghua Unigroup has been at the forefront of China's efforts to expand its chip industry.The company bought Chinese mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum and RDA Electronics in the last two years. Last year, Intel Corp (INTC.O) bought into Tsinghua with a $1.5 billion investment.""With estimated 21 percent market share in DRAM, 16 percent market share in NAND, and solid technology in both markets, Micron would give Tsinghua a solid presence in both areas of memory,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report.

63,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar | July 14  July 14 China's Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd would need to pay as much as $38 billion to buy Micron Technology Inc , analysts said - assuming that the U.S. government approved the purchase of last U.S. maker of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips.State-backed Tsinghua Unigroup is considering making a bid of $21 per share for Micron, valuing the Idaho-based company at $23 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Micron's shares rose as much as 12 percent to $19.79 in morning trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.China has been expressing strong interest in building up its domestic chip industry, and buying Micron would be a major coup.An acquisition of Micron would give China access to both DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are used in personal computers and to store music, pictures and other data on smartphones and mobile devices. The country consumes $10-$11 billion of DRAM chips annually, according to JP Morgan analysts.Any deal, though, would need a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which would examine the national security implications.""DRAM and 3D NAND manufacturing technologies are strategic for China but difficult to access,"" Jefferies analysts said in a client note. ""Leading-edge high volume memory design and manufacturing (intellectual property) is closely held by a handful of companies, none of which we think would want a new entrant from China to affect supply/demand fundamentals unfavorably.""Tsinghua Unigroup has been at the forefront of China's efforts to expand its chip industry. The company bought Chinese mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum and RDA Electronics in the last two years. Last year, Intel Corp  bought into Tsinghua with a $1.5 billion investment.""With estimated 21 percent market share in DRAM, 16 percent market share in NAND, and solid technology in both markets, Micron would give Tsinghua a solid presence in both areas of memory,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report.However, several analysts said an offer of $21 per share would severely undervalue Micron, and there could be counterbids from companies such as SanDisk Corp and South Korea's SK Hynix Inc.J.P.

Lutts said investors were ignoring external worries like China's economic slowdown for the time being and focusing on earnings.""Earnings expectations are pretty modest right now. If the stock market is going to get any help from earnings, we need to see better growth.""The quarterly earnings kicked off in earnest with JPMorgan  and Wells Fargo reporting results.

That glut has since eased, and supply grew just 19 percent in 2013, according to Macquarie.China has been a key destination for big spending by chipmakers, with production increasing in a market that uses around a fifth of the world's memory chips.Samsung last year began full-scale production at a new $7 billion chip factory in Xi'an, and SK Hynix will next year likely take its cumulative investment in its China plant, which produces about half its total DRAM output, to above $10 billion.

70,"  (Adds Pentagon response)By Diane Bartz, Noel Randewich and Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO July 14 A Chinese state-backed company's plan to buy U.S. chip maker Micron Technology faces no shortage of obstacles - questions about the price, worries on Capitol Hill, an aggressive regulator - and any one of them could torpedo the deal.Analysts argued Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd's proposed price, $23 billion, was far too low. But China's critics on Capitol Hill worried about the impact on the Defense Department. And any deal would likely face a close look by the agency charged with vetting transactions that have potential national security concerns.""If people decide that if what Micron makes isn't important any more (it will be approved),"" said Jim Lewis of the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But I think that Tsinghua will have to get over a whole lot of hurdles and it won't be easy.""Tsinghua, which sources said was preparing a bid for Micron but had not officially submitted it, has been at the forefront of China's efforts to expand its chip industry.The company bought Chinese mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum and RDA Electronics in the last two years. Last year, Intel Corp  bought into Tsinghua with a $1.5 billion investment.Buying Micron would give China access to both DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are used in personal computers and to store music, pictures and other data on smartphones and mobile devices.But analysts said the $23 billion planned offer price far undervalues the plants, employees and intellectual property of Micron, whose stock has recently taken a hit due to slow demand for personal computers. ""We think the price was only floated through the media because they were too embarrassed to bring it to Micron's board,"" said Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy.J.P. Morgan analysts said a $27 to $29 per share offer would be more realistic, while Needham analysts said the company was unlikely to sell itself for less than $35 per share, implying a deal value of about $38 billion.SENSITIVE SECTOR, TECH Micron's potential sale to Tsinghua triggered concerns among U.S. lawmakers given modern weapons' enormous dependence on computer chips. The possible deal also comes amid concerns over U.S. cyber attacks tied to Chinese hackers. ""This is a sensitive sector and a sensitive technology, and there will be a lot of congressional interest in conducting oversight,"" said one Senate aide, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Analysts were split on whether the deal could be approved.""This seems highly unlikely, just given the technology that's involved. This is a massive deal, really important technology and quite frankly, it's the Chinese,"" said Reed Smith partner Leigh Hansson, who leads the firm's International Trade & National Security practice.Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright declined comment on the expected bid or how prevalent the company's chips were in U.S. weapons systems. Micron Technology did not respond to questions about use of its chips in defense systems. A central national security concern is that a Chinese version of a Micron chip could have a ""back door,"" which allows it to be more easily compromised.""If you have access to these chips, what mischief could you do?"" asked Paul Marquardt of Cleary Gottlieb, who is an expert on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.CFIUS, an inter-agency which reviews mergers to ensure they do not compromise national security, required Chinese networking company Huawei Technologies Co to divest 3Leaf Systems in 2011 and blocked its purchase of 3Com Corp stock in 2008 because of concerns about links between Huawei's founder and China's military.But CFIUS does approve some tech deals. In 2014, China's Lenovo Group won CFIUS approval to buy IBM's  low-end server business.Two other experts with CFIUS experience said they would not write off the deal as dead. CFIUS, they said, would assess Tsinghua's ties to the government and Micron's role in national security to decide if the task force, which is led by the Treasury Department, would allow it to go forward.The company's apparent close ties to the government could be a negative. It behaves as a private equity fund but is controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing, which counts President Xi Jinping among its alumni, and is backed by China's central government.The Pentagon may opt to order its supplier to refrain from using Micron chips, said Marquardt.Micron competes intensely with Samsung, SK Hynix, and Toshiba selling memory chips, and there is very little that it sells that its competitors do not.

72,"   By Michael Gold | TAIPEI  TAIPEI China's Tsinghua Holdings is still discussing a potential deal to buy U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) and hopes it could eventually go through, the state-backed investment company's chairman told Reuters on Thursday.Sources told Reuters earlier this week that Micron has dismissed an informal $23 billion offer from Tsinghua Unigroup, a private equity subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings, on the presumption that a deal would be blocked by U.S. regulators.The mooted takeover of the last remaining U.S. dynamic memory chipmaker would be the largest foreign deal by a Chinese company.

For $3.8 billion, a unit of state-owned Tsinghua Holdings Co will get a 15 percent stake in Western Digital. What Tsinghua, run by a university committee, hopes to get is the latest in a string of domestic and foreign footholds in data storage and the chip market, an area deemed of strategic importance by Beijing.Wednesday's Western Digital deal follows Tsinghua's $23 billion move to buy U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc  as China ramps up efforts to develop chips expertise. But the Micron plan has been clouded by U.S. security concerns - and some say the Western Digital may follow suit.""Its (Tsinghua's) Chinese government affiliation is making its overseas acquisition more difficult,"" said Fubon Securities analyst Carlos Peng. Western Digital hopes selling the minority stake to Tsinghua's Unisplendour Corp will help it avoid rigorous regulatory scrutiny. If the deal goes through, the California-based firm will have a new investor with a wide range of China tech units, from IT services provider Unisplendour to biotechnology firm Chengzhi Shareholding Co.The Tsinghua network also stretches to other U.S. firms. In May, Unisplendour announced to buy 51 percent of Hewlett-Packard's H3C Technologies for $2.3 billion, creating a Chinese tech hub that houses H3C's networking operation alongside its China-based server, data-storage and technology-services businesses.Meanwhile in 2014 Intel Corp bought a $1.5 billion, 20 percent stake in two mobile chipmakers under Tsinghua's umbrella. That provided the Chinese firm with support from a U.S. semiconductor giant on chip design and development within China itself - a landmark deal for Beijing.""It (China) is producing its own products rather than just contract making, it's because there's demand from local consumption,"" said Gartner analyst Tracy Tsai.""Tsinghua, with its state-backed role, plays a key part under this background. It needs to introduce partners through mergers and acquisitions and help China boost its technology knowhow.""

87,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Natalie Grover  Oct 14 Toshiba, SanDisk's partner in making memory chips, is more likely to sign off on a potential takeover of SanDisk by hard drive maker Western Digital than by rival memory chip maker Micron, analysts said.Micron Technology Inc and Western Digital Corp  are in talks with SanDisk Corp about a possible acquisition, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.The report came after months of intense speculation about imminent consolidation in the memory chip industry as a supply glut and cheaper products from China continue to drive down prices.SanDisk will require Toshiba's approval to consummate a deal with either party. SanDisk uses Toshiba's foundries to make its chips and the two companies have an important intellectual property-sharing joint venture.If Micron, which has its own foundries, buys SanDisk, Toshiba is likely to lose a lot of business. Moreover, Micron has a growing presence in the NAND-flash memory chips market and a tie up with SanDisk will immensely increase competition for the Japanese tech leader. NAND-flash memory chips power solid-state drives, which are faster and more reliable than traditional hard drives, Western Digital' mainstay. SSDs are used in cloud computing, data centers, smartphones and laptops.""From Micron's perspective ... you could take out two competitors at once,"" Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri said. ""If you can extricate SanDisk from the Toshiba JV, then you've taken Toshiba out of the NAND business and you've taken out SanDisk as well ... this would really catapult you to number 2. status behind Samsung.""Micron and Western Digital declined to comment. Toshiba and SanDisk did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.SanDisk, which had a market capitalization of about $12.6 billion as of the stock's close on Tuesday, has lost 37 percent of its value this year. The company's stock rose as much as 14 percent on Wednesday. Micron's rose 6 percent, while Western Digital's rose 2.4 percent.SanDisk itself would be more amenable to a bid from Western Digital, which has strong free cash flow thanks to its cash cow hard-drive business, analysts said.Western Digital is also expected to receive a $4 billion cash infusion from China's state-backed Tsinghua Holdings Co Ltd , if the deal passes regulatory scrutiny in the United States.The investment could give Western Digital the firepower to speed up SanDisk's transition from a legacy hard drive maker to a company that makes efficient chips that run data centers.

95,"   By J.R. Wu | TAIPEI  TAIPEI China's Tsinghua Unigroup's $2.6 billion offer for stakes in three Taiwanese chip firms will undergo unprecedented scrutiny by a new government less friendly toward its giant neighbor, complicating the chance of success.The Chinese state-backed conglomerate aims to buy into the island's technology sector as a step toward building China's own semiconductor industry. But the timing of its offers, during a Taiwan election in which deepening cross-straits economic ties was a hot topic, left the firm a target of political attack.    Following civil war in China, Nationalist forces fled in 1949 to Taiwan which has been self-ruled ever since. But China regards it as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary, fuelling fears among Taiwanese of Chinese influence in the island's foremost industries.Such fears prompted the government to subject Tsinghua's offers to review by the newly elected parliament, national security advisors and financial regulators, and to request its management team make its case personally to a government panel, Taiwanese regulators and executives at the targeted firms said.""We said from the start that it will not entirely be approved,"" said Emile Chang, executive secretary of Taiwan's Investment Commission, the agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs in charge of reviewing inbound and outbound investment.""Whether one or two of the cases can pass, we need to see the review process,"" Chang told Reuters at a recent briefing.Tsinghua is aware it may not receive approval for all three deals due to the change in government, but overseas acquisitions will continue to focus on Taiwan and the United States, a person familiar with Tsinghua's thinking told Reuters, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.Tsinghua, which is yet to submit investment plans to Taiwan regulators, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. NATIONAL SECURITY Tsinghua made offers in quick succession late last year for a quarter each of chip testing and packaging companies Powertech Technology Inc, ChipMOS Technologies Inc and Siliconware Precision Industries Co Ltd (SPIL).The company plans to inject a total of $2.6 billion into the three in exchange for stakes plus one board seat at each with no management control. The offers came after Micron Technology Inc rejected Tsinghua's informal $23 billion takeover bid on the presumption of U.S. national security concerns. ""Security and business concerns over relying on Chinese suppliers include intellectual property and trade secrets protection, competitiveness, and innovation,"" said Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, in a commentary labeling Tsinghua's moves ""hostile"".Taiwan's new government will therefore need policies that keep businesses free of Chinese control to ensure Taiwan remains a major player in the global technology supply chain, he said.CEDING CONTROL President-elect Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) - which was elected by a landslide - said when campaigning the offers were problematic and could lead to Taiwan ceding control of its tech industry. ""From the country's point of view, this is not just a business deal,"" said Wu Tsong-tseng, a DPP adviser on technology issues during the election.Shareholders of Powertech and ChipMOS approved the plans in January as they seek capital to expand and survive in a global chip sector experiencing record merger and acquisition activity.SPIL scheduled a shareholder vote for Jan. 28 but postponed due to the political timing, spokesman Byron Chiang said.Powertech Chairman D.K. Tsai said the other deals, announced six weeks after its own, were unexpected. He said he was committed to seeing through Powertech's application and that he would ""respect any (government) decision.""""I am regretful that this matter became emotional for society and a political factor,"" Powertech's Tsai told reporters after shareholders accepted the offer.
