0,"  * 2013 crude shipments up 51 pct despite 8 pct decline in Q4* Pipeline startups replaced Bakken shipments, growth expected in Canadian crudeBy Kristen HaysHOUSTON, Jan 24 Kansas City Southern is ""working on several new opportunities"" to move Canadian heavy crude oil via rail to the U.S. Gulf Coast region, a top executive told analysts on Friday.The regional railroad operator's shipped crude volumes rose 51 percent in 2013 compared with the prior year, despite a pullback in shipments of North Dakota Bakken crude to the Gulf region, Patrick Ottensmeyer, executive vice president of sales and marketing, said on a quarterly earnings call.The company expects shipments of Canadian heavy crude to increase in 2014 and beyond, he said, as specialized offloading equipment is installed at various destination points, such as Port Arthur, Texas, New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.""We are working on several new opportunities throughout the Gulf region,"" he said. On Thursday, safety officials in Canada and the United States urged regulators to take steps aimed at preventing fiery crashes of trains carrying crude oil, after a string of recent accidents.Kansas City Southern's results missed quarterly profit estimates on weakness in its energy business, primarily a drop in utility coal shipments.While the company's 2013 crude shipments jumped overall, they declined by 8 percent in the fourth quarter as refiner demand for North Dakota Bakken crude waned in the Gulf region. Pipeline startups brought more light-sweet Texas and Oklahoma crudes to the market at a lower cost, siphoning demand to move it via rail from West Texas and North Dakota.However, Kansas City Southern expects Canadian heavy crude shipments to the region to grow, executives said.""Our longer-term opportunity is going to be driven more by the heavy crude coming from Canada, which did increase significantly during the quarter, but not enough to offset the decline in Bakken and West Texas"" crude shipments, Ottensmeyer said. The railroad remains committed to a crude terminal operation in Port Arthur that will handle a 120-car train per day of Canadian heavy crude, he said.Port Arthur is home to three major refineries, including Motiva Enterprises' 600,000 barrels-per-day plant - the largest in the United States - and Valero Energy Corp's 290,000 bpd refinery.Kansas City Southern has not disclosed its partner in the Port Arthur offloading project, but Valero has said publicly that the company wants to increase Canadian crude supplies at its refinery there.Ottensmeyer said on Friday that once heating equipment needed to offload undiluted bitumen is permitted and built in Port Arthur and the other sites, more opportunities to move Canadian crude to the region will open up.""We still expect to deliver crude oil to Port Arthur this year,"" he added.",2014-01-24,KSU,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 3:10pm EST",UPDATE 1-Kansas City Southern says crude-by-rail volumes soared in 2013,http://www.reuters.com//article/kansascitysouthern-crude-rail-idUSL2N0KY13S20140124?type=companyNews

5,"  NEW YORK, July 8 Railroad owner Kansas City Southern has teamed up with oil product distributor Global Partners LP to build a major oil train terminal in Port Arthur, Texas that will import crude from Western Canada, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.The terminal, which will initially be able to accept up to two trainloads of oil each day, would be one of the largest of its kind in the United States and could nearly double the amount of viscous Canadian crude sent to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining.The project will be built on a 200-acre (80-hectare) plot leased by Global from Kansas City Southern, construction permits pending. The companies did not give a timeline for start-up. It represents an opportunity ""to capitalize on strong demand for the movement of Western Canadian crude initially to one of the world's premier refining centers in the U.S. Gulf Coast,"" said KCS President and Chief Executive David Starling. The terminal is part of a wider move by North American energy producers and railroads to ship oil by train as pipelines lag growing output in remote regions. From nearly none in 2008, there are now about 90 oil-by-rail projects in various stages of development in the United States alone. Trains carry about 1 million barrels of U.S. oil daily. A typical train exclusively carrying crude can hold around 70,000 barrels, making this terminal's potential around 140,000 barrels per day (bpd), one of the biggest in the United States. Running at capacity, it could nearly double the average 150,000 bpd of Canadian crude that already heads to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

13,"  (Adds details of results, stock price, background)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, April 21 Regional U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern on Tuesday reported a drop in revenue as its coal and energy-related freight volumes took a hit and the strong U.S. dollar hurt its Mexico-based business, but net profit rose.As natural gas prices have fallen, utilities have shifted away from coal, resulting in a 26 percent drop in first-quarter coal revenue. Fracking sand revenues were off 12 percent as oil producers in the Bakken oil formation in North Dakota scaled back production amid low oil prices. Overall freight volumes were up 1 percent in the quarter.Last week major railroads CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp reported that results were hurt by lower freight volumes and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on some commodity imports. Kansas City Southern reported first-quarter net income of $101.2 million, or 91 cents per share, up nearly 8 percent from $94 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier.Adjusted for one-time expenses, the company reported earning per share of $1.03, down from $1.05 in the first quarter of 2014. On that basis, the results came in just below analysts' expectations of earnings per share of $1.07. The railroad's higher profit came despite a slight drop in revenue to $603.1 million from $607.4 million. The company said if it had not been for currency fluctuations, revenue would have risen 4 percent in the first quarter.The company said the weaker Mexican peso and lower fuel surcharges hurt results, but it benefited from a lower fuel bill. The railroad spent $81 million on fuel in the first quarter, down more than 22 percent from $103.9 million a year earlier.Kansas City Southern also benefited from a slightly lower tax rate in the quarter.

15,"  (Adds Kansas City Southern share buyback, changes headline)By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK May 14 U.S. corporate spending on capital projects could fall this year to the lowest level since 2011, with steep reductions by the energy industry and companies in other sectors cutting spending amid broad concerns about global growth.Among the S&P sectors, only the materials and financials sectors expect to spend more in 2015 than they did last year, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis of spending outlooks from the 255 S&P 500 companies that have offered guidance on their capex for the year.Analyst projections for all S&P 500 companies point in the same direction: a grim year for capital expenditures.The numbers suggest that corporate bosses across many sectors are less confident in the economy than they had been in recent years.""They're not spending at a pace that would suggest a global recovery,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.That could translate to lower job growth and weakness in the technology and industrial companies that typically benefit from capital spending.""The new worry cropping up in the first-quarter earnings season is the concern of a more pervasive slowdown across industrial markets,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a recent note. Analyst estimates show total S&P 500 capex spending could dip 11 percent to $641.6 billion in 2015 from actual 2014 spending of $718.1 billion, marking the lowest level since 2011's $591.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.That would break the recent trend of increasing S&P 500 capital spending every year since at least 2009, the data shows.Companies themselves are projecting a similar decline from 2014 levels, with total spending from 255 S&P 500 companies projected at $410.2 billion this year, down from actual spending by those same firms of $459.2 billion last year.As expected, S&P 500 energy companies account for the biggest fall in projected spending levels. As a group, their capex plans are down by $21.4 billion, or 14.1 percent from a year ago, according to the Thomson Reuters analysis. U.S. oil prices are down more than 43 percent from mid-June of last year. There are a few bright spots, including International Paper , which expects to spend $1.5 billion on capex this year compared with $1.4 billion in 2014.S&P 500 technology, industrial and consumer discretionaries also are showing sizeable declines in spending plans. Chip maker Intel, which expects to spend $8.7 billion in 2015, down from $10.2 billion in 2014, said last month the dip reflected greater efficiency in manufacturing, more re-use of its existing production machinery and lower demand for PC chips.""I'd characterize this as being an unusually low level of capex, relative to the size of the business, because we are driving efficiency at a faster rate, and we are getting more re-use than we expected,"" Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told analysts on a conference call.Even with projected cuts, energy companies still account for roughly 32 percent of total capex plans, down from roughly 33 percent of last year's spending levels. ConocoPhillips, for example, expects $11.5 billion in capex this year, down from $17.1 billion last year.""This could go on into 2016, barring a meaningful recovery in the oil price. I think the trend continues for lower capital spending,"" said Fadel Gheit, managing director and senior analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.RECORD CASH NOT TRANSLATING TO CAPEX S&P 500 companies still have record levels of cash on their balance sheets, and spending on buybacks and dividend payments has come at the expense of capex for many companies.""Companies have been more interested in share buybacks than capex,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey.Railroad Kansas City Southern, which has forecast reduced capex this year and said in April it was delaying some capacity expansion projects related to energy, on Thursday announced a share buyback program of up to $500 million.

16,"  (Adds details, background)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, July 17 Regional U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern on Friday reported a lower quarterly net profit, hurt by falling coal shipments in particular as shipments declined almost across the board.All the major U.S. railroads have seen their coal business hurt this year as power plants have shifted to burning cheaper natural gas. Coal exports have been hurt by the strong U.S. dollar.Kansas City Southern reported a 64 percent decline in coal revenue during the second quarter. The Kansas City-based railroad said grain freight revenue fell 11 percent during the quarter. Fracking sand revenue was down 50 percent, but crude oil revenue rose 42 percent.Overall, the company saw a 6 percent drop in train carloads during the quarter. ""There are still uncertainties in many of the primary markets served by rail,"" chief executive David Starling said in a statement. ""However, Kansas City Southern's average daily volumes increased each month throughout the second quarter and the initial results from the first few weeks of July suggest the positive trend may be continuing.""The company said it has worked to scale its operations to adjust for falling freight demand and said its operating performance would continue to improve throughout the year. Kansas City Southern reported second-quarter net income of $111.8 million or $1.01 a share, down nearly 14 percent from $129.8 million or $1.18 per share a year earlier.Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $1.02.Revenue in the second quarter fell nearly 10 percent to $585.8 million from $649.7 million in the same quarter last year.

30,"   By Luciana Lopez | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The head of U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern said on Thursday the company could transfer money from Mexico to the United States if President-elect Donald Trump lowers taxes for those transactions, even as the company works to convince Trump not to clamp down on trade with Mexico.“We could invest in other growth opportunities, we could repurchase shares,” said Patrick Ottensmeyer, the president and chief executive officer of Kansas City Southern (KSU.N), speaking on the sidelines of the RailTrends 2016 conference here.Ottensmeyer declined to say how much money the company could bring back to the United States. He said the tax hit under current U.S. law had so far prevented repatriation. “It would certainly be a benefit for us to have the flexibility to move money around as we see fit,” Ottensmeyer said. Simultaneously, the company will press Trump to avoid ripping up the North American Free Trade Agreement, a promise that resonated with the working-class voters in industrial states who helped propel the New York Republican's victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Cutting back on trade with Mexico could concern railroad companies that move goods around the continent. Canada is also a party to NAFTA.KCS’s multipronged approach underscores the uncertainty before Trump takes office on Jan. 20, as the businessman has never held public office before and, during the election, often made outsized statements on everything from trade to race relations. The railroad’s stock sank about 11 percent in the two days after the election, but has risen nearly 6 percent since then.  Ottensmeyer said the company will reach out to a Trump administration directly, through trade groups and even through officials of other governments. “We will use contacts that we have directly, we’ll go through the AAR (Association of American Railroads),” he said, citing also the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber helps sponsor the U.S.-Mexico Leadership Initiative CEO Dialogue, and both private and public sector participants there could be helpful, he said.“We have very strong relationships with a lot of those people, so hopefully the balance will shift a little bit and they will also be engaged in the debate,” he said. “Mexican business leaders, Mexican cabinet members engaged with their counterparts in the new administration, so maybe … we use our connections with those people to engage in a discussion.”   (Reporting By Joe White; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2016-11-17,KSU,"Thu Nov 17, 2016 | 4:20pm EST",KC Southern railroad could transfer funds to U.S. from Mexico,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-trump-kc-sthrn-rail-idUSKBN13C2P1?type=companyNews
