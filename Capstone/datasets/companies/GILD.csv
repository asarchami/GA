6,"  Gilead Sciences plans to license its breakthrough hepatitis C drug Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, allowing for lower-priced sales of the medication in that developing nation, according to the company.Although prices for the drug have not been set, company spokesman Nick Francis said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that Gilead aims to establish ""tiered pricing.""For example, the price discussed for 24 weeks of Sovaldi therapy would run about $2,500 for certain patients at public hospitals, community clinics and non-governmental agencies in India, the Hindu Business Line reported earlier this week.""Providing treatment in resource-limited settings presents complex challenges, and we will work with partners in multiple sectors around the world to ensure our access program reaches as many patients as possible,"" Francis said.Gilead said final details of the program in India will be announced in coming months. The company has a similar program in place for lower-cost versions of its HIV/AIDS drugs.In the United States, where Sovaldi was approved by regulators in December, the drug costs $84,000 for 12 weeks of therapy or $1,000 for a daily pill. The Foster City, California-based company has said the price is fair because the treatment offers a potential cure for the liver-destroying virus without injections of interferon, which can cause severe side effects that compromise patient outcomes.Prices in Europe are also lower than in the United States. The cost for treatment in the United Kingdom is about $57,000 while the price in Germany is around $66,000, the company has said.Analysts have estimated that the drug will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales. Sanford Bernstein has forecast sales this year alone of $6.7 billion. But some have questioned whether that is achievable. Many patients including those in the United States, where more than half of hepatitis C patients are estimated to rely on public funding, could have difficulty securing reimbursement for such a high-priced drug.Other companies including Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Merck & Co are also working to develop new hepatitis C treatments with some in advanced stages of clinical studies. Gilead, which reported 2013 earnings on Tuesday, declined to include an estimate for hepatitis C sales in its 2014 sales forecast, saying only that Sovaldi sales so far have been strong and broadly based.Sales of Sovaldi in the last three weeks of 2013 totaled more than $139 million.The World Health Organization estimates that about three percent of the world's population has been infected with the hepatitis C virus and that more than 170 million chronic carriers are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis, liver cancer or both.Shares of Gilead fell $3.87, or nearly five percent, to close at $78.15 in Nasdaq trading on Wednesday.

""It will be a buying opportunity when investors feel comfortable this rout we're in is over,"" he said.""I don't think they want to step in front of it just yet until they have a feeling of where the bottom is going to be. We're not there yet.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.44 points or 0.29 percent, to 15,400.8, the S&P 500 lost 11.02 points or 0.63 percent, to 1,744.18 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 46.696 points or 1.16 percent, to 3,984.824.Investors are not ready to call the bottom and are paying more for protection against further slides. The CBOE Volatility Index rose 5.5 percent to trade above 20 for a third-straight session. The vast U.S. services sector rebounded in January after two months of slower growth and firms added workers at the fastest clip in more than three years, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Separate data showed the U.S. private sector created 175,000 jobs in January, slightly below estimates, while the December reading was revised lower.The limp data earlier in the week added to concerns about growth in China and the outlook for some emerging market economies. A recent rout in emerging currencies spurred some central banks to act, pressuring bond and stock holdings and luring investors into assets perceived as relatively safe, like the yen and U.S. and German government debt.""There's fear as we move into Friday's (jobs) report that we're going to see a weather impact that is going to distort the number and make if difficult to know if it is covering up something more substantial,"" said Mendelsohn.

But he also did not dismiss analysts' record-shattering forecasts that the treatment could rake in $5 billion to $6 billion in its first year on the market.""It would be unprecedented for a drug to launch at that level, but because of the duration of therapy being short, because of the number of patients who are out there who have the disease, it's not unreasonable math to come to that conclusion,"" Milligan told Reuters on the sidelines at the Bio CEO & Investor conference in New York.""We're in early launch phase, just two months in, so it's dangerous to extrapolate from two months. I can see the number that's out there. I don't know if it's too high or too low based on the dynamics,"" Milligan said. Along with its fourth-quarter results released last week, Gilead reported $139.4 million in Sovaldi sales after less than one month on the market. The drug promises to increase cure rates with a much shorter duration of treatment and far fewer side effects than previous standard regimens.""We've seen great enthusiasm from the doctors, and the question is how long will they continue to bring those patients in, what experience will they have as we get through this year?"" Milligan said.He noted that a rival hepatitis C regimen from AbbVie Inc with an equally impressive cure rate could hit the market this year and affect sales. But AbbVie's treatment involves more drugs and many more pills a day, likely giving Gilead a competitive edge. Gilead this week applied for approval of a combination of Sovaldi and an experimental antiviral drug, ledipasvir, that would be taken as one pill once a day, which could also impact future sales.In late stage clinical trials, the combination provided cure rates well in excess of 90 percent, in some cases with as little as eight weeks of treatment. It would allow patients to avoid use of older hepatitis drugs that can cause troublesome side effects. Current standard treatment regimens take 24 to 48 weeks and include injected interferon that causes miserable flu-like symptoms, leading many patients to discontinue or delay treatment, and ribavirin, which can cause anemia and other unpleasant side effects.It is widely believed that thousands of patients have put off treating the virus in order to wait for new drugs such as Gilead's. By being the first of the expected new wave of oral hepatitis C treatments to market, many analysts believe that Gilead will grab the lion's share of those ""warehoused"" patients.""Remember, patients who started in December haven't gotten through their 12 weeks of therapy yet, so (doctors) haven't seen that full experience of seeing patients cured and they really won't understand that until we get into the mid part of this year,"" Milligan said.""So I encourage people not to get too far ahead of themselves in thinking about that,"" he said of the multibillion-dollar first-year Wall Street sales forecasts.

17,"   By Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley  U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs.The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.Some health insurers, including the government's Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead's new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world's highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country's per capita gross national income. Sovaldi's U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company's pricing methodology and its impact on public health.Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market. ""What is really scaring folks is the volume,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a ""reasonable"" level.""Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,"" the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.COMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000. ""The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,"" the letter said. It added, ""The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.""Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a ""breakthrough therapy.""Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi's price and the public health impact of insurers' and public health programs' decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitisC.  Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.""We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,"" he said. ""In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.""These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.""Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to 'guarantee a cure' to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,"" Meacham said in a research note.Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day.

Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi's price and the public health impact of insurers' and public health programs' decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.""We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,"" he said. ""In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.""These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.""Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to 'guarantee a cure' to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,"" Meacham said in a research note.Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations.El-Adawi said Gilead's offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt.Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely.

The recently approved medicine, seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease, costs about $84,000 per patient.  Gilead shares were down 4 percent in morning trading on Nasdaq.

24,"   By Deena Beasley  Gilead Sciences Inc, under fire for pricing a new hepatitis C drug at $1,000 a pill, has discount agreements with a number of health insurers, a company executive said in an interview.The medication, Sovaldi, has a list price of $84,000 for a 12-week course of therapy and is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease.It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment time with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions of Americans.On March 20, Democratic lawmakers led by California Representative Henry Waxman asked Gilead to explain the price tag, and a meeting with the company is scheduled for next week.Health insurers and state Medicaid programs for the poor are pushing for further discounts, fearing a multibillion-dollar pricetag from treating most hepatitis C sufferers with Sovaldi and similar new medicines likely to be approved in coming years.Gilead shares have dropped 9 percent in the last week on concerns over the pushback on drug pricing. The news has also weighed on other biotechnology companies that are banking on their ability to command high prices for new treatments.""It's the volume (of patients) payers are looking at here. It's not the price,"" said Gregg Alton, Gilead's executive vice president, corporate and medical affairs. ""A lot of them are looking for a discount, but I think the real issue here is how many patients they now have in their plans that need hepatitis C treatment."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, a liver-destroying virus transmitted through blood.If each were treated with full-priced Sovaldi, the cost would be $269 billion. Gilead already provides a mandated discount off its list price to U.S. government health plans and insurers at about 23 percent.Alton said the company has deals for ""supplemental discounts"" for government-funded agencies such the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, on top of the 23 percent. He would not provide details.He said the VA, which accounts for about 10 to 15 percent of the hepatitis C population in the United States, has been ""proactive"" in recognizing the need to treat the disease, which can lead to liver failure and necessitate liver transplants. He estimated that patients eligible for Medicaid, the government-funded health plan for the poor, account for another 10 to 15 percent of Americans with hepatitis C.Alton singled out health maintenance organization Kaiser Permanente for taking action to secure Sovaldi, also at a discount, for its patients.""We have an arrangement with Kaiser that works very well for both of us,"" the Gilead executive said. ""They recognize that if they make the investment today, they get all the benefit."" He said that is because many Kaiser patients stay for many years with the organization known for quality, integrated care, even into retirement when they qualify for a managed Medicare plan. So Kaiser's upfront investment treating hepatitis C will pay off years later by averting future costs of liver disease. Kaiser officials were not immediately available for comment.But many traditional insurers can't rely on the same kind of stability among their policyholders, who tend to switch health plans more frequently, meaning they cannot be sure of the same savings over time.""One of the challenges we have with some insurers is that the benefits may not come to them,"" the Gilead executive said. ""No matter how we price this product, the benefits and the savings are going to come later.""Alton also sees the concerns over a deluge of patients demanding immediate treatment as unlikely to materialize.""Most of the patients are not diagnosed, and many aren't seeking care currently,"" he said. ""This is going to take some time.""ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted on Friday data showing that new prescriptions of Sovaldi had dropped 5 percent in the past week. He estimated that Gilead's 2014 U.S. sales of Sovaldi, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, will total as much as $9 billion even if it sees no new prescription growth.(Reporting By Deena Beasley; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Tom Brown and David Gregorio)",2014-03-29,GILD,"Sat Mar 29, 2014 | 12:13pm EDT",Gilead says has discounted hepatitis C drug for some health plans,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-gilead-hepatitis-idUSBREA2S0EZ20140329?type=companyNews

Gilead said the study met its goal, showing that 98 percent of previously-untreated patients achieved undetectable levels of the virus three months after completing 12 weeks of treatment with a combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin. For previously-treated patients, the response rate was 95 percent. Side effects seen in the trial included anemia and headache.

26,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Gilead Sciences aims to license its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi to three or four Indian generic manufacturers to allow sales of the medicine at lower prices in some 60 developing nations.Clifford Samuel, head of access operations and emerging markets at the U.S. drugmaker, told Reuters he expected to have deals in place shortly with the Indian firms, which would be able to produce the drug in high volumes and at low margins.Gilead is under pressure to address the high cost of its breakthrough pill, which is the first of a new wave of drugs that have been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration without the side effects of current injections.""We're in the midst of discussions right now. We're nailing down the geographical scope, and we should have these licenses in place and ready to go in short order,"" Samuel said on a visit to London for an international liver conference.He said Gilead was looking to strike deals with firms that had proven experience in producing generic versions of its HIV/AIDS drugs, such as the Indian division of Mylan. The Foster City, California-based company has been operating a similar voluntary licensing programme for many years for low-cost HIV drugs, which covers 112 countries.Under the hepatitis C plan, Indian-made generics would be available in most of sub-Saharan Africa, selected Asian countries including India, Pakistan and Myanmar, and some smaller developing nations.Gilead is also working to establish ""tiered pricing"" for Sovaldi in other low- and middle-income countries, Samuel said. The company struck the first such tiered pricing deal last month in Egypt, where it has agreed to supply the government at just over 1 percent of the U.S. price, or $300 for a 28-day bottle against $28,000.For India, the company is currently discussing a price of $2,000 based on 24 weeks of treatment, although no final deal has been reached, Samuel added. Egypt has the world's highest prevalence of the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus, which is spread through blood, making it an obvious first market for more affordable, tiered pricing.""We're targeting key, high-prevalence countries like India, Pakistan and Egypt. We are sitting down with them and looking at differential pricing,"" Samuel said.Gilead's tiered pricing will not apply, however, to some large middle-income countries with significant hepatitis C populations such as Ukraine and China, which are viewed as commercial market opportunities.In the United States, Sovaldi's price tag of $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment has been described by one health provider as ""outrageous"", while U.S. lawmakers have written to the firm demanding an explanation of the price.(Editing by Jane Baird)",2014-04-08,GILD,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 11:42am EDT",Gilead aims to license hepatitis C drug to 3-4 Indian firms,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hepatitis-gilead-idUSBREA371DI20140408?type=companyNews
27,"  * London congress showcases dramatic treatment advances* WHO guidelines back Gilead, J&J pills but flag up cost* UN agency wants ""concerted effort"" to reduce prices* Hepatitis C pricing a hot issue for biotech investorsBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, April 9 The World Health Organisation wants a ""concerted effort"" to drive down the cost of new hepatitis C drugs that offer a cure for the liver-destroying virus but are unaffordable for most infected people worldwide.The forthright comments from the UN agency on Wednesday   add to pressure on drugmakers such as Gilead Sciences - which is already facing protests in the United States over its $1,000-a-day pill - to do more to improve access.In its first-ever treatment guidelines for the disease, issued at a meeting of international liver experts in London, the WHO strongly recommended new drugs from Gilead and Johnson & Johnson - with a big caveat on their cost.Treating the approximately 150 million people in the world living with chronic hepatitis C infection is the new front-line in the battle over access to medicines.As with AIDS 15 years ago, modern drugs are transforming the ability to fight hepatitis C because pills such as Gilead's Sovaldi are far more effective and better-tolerated than older injection regimens, with cure rates well above 90 percent in many cases.""These drugs are fantastic - they are a real breakthrough,"" Markus Peck-Radosavljevic, a professor of medicine in Vienna and secretary-general of the European Association for the Study of the Liver, told Reuters. ""But the prices are too high."" Pharmaceutical companies say they need to charge high prices on new successful drugs to cover the huge cost of development, including of those that fail to make it to the market.A record number of promising results from late-stage clinical trials on a range of new oral medicines will be showcased at the International Liver Congress this week.Hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is spread through blood, often via contaminated needles. It causes cirrhosis and liver cancer. The vast majority of cases are in poorer countries where the complexity, cost and side effects of current treatments have made treatment impractical.The arrival of simple pills, taken for as little as a couple of months, could revolutionise therapy, if the price is right.By giving governments a plan setting out how to test for, treat and prevent HCV, the WHO is laying foundations for tackling the disease, while spurring demand and sending a strong message on price. ""I hope these guidelines will help to promote a reduction in price and thereby an increase in access,"" said Stefan Wiktor, who leads the WHO hepatitis programme.COMPULSORY LICENCES? Drawing a clear parallel with the experience of HIV/AIDS, the WHO believes a ""multi-pronged"" approach is needed. This could include tiered price discounts by branded drugmakers, voluntary licensing and also compulsory licensing.Voluntary licensing involves a patent owner agreeing to license its drug to generic manufacturers, while a compulsory licence is issued by a government without any such agreement - something the pharmaceuticals industry is keen to avoid. After dragging their feet for years over access to AIDS drugs in Africa, pharmaceuticals makers are trying to take the initiative this time. Market leader Gilead recently agreed a 99 percent price discount for Egypt and plans to grant voluntary licences to several Indian generics firms.J&J has also promised to work on access and others entering the area - such as AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb  and Merck & Co - are expected to follow suit.But campaigners want more. The Medecins Sans Frontieres group believes a 12-week course of treatment and diagnosis should cost no more than $500. That compares with the $84,000 and $66,000 charged by Gilead and J&J respectively for their drugs in the United States.There is also a big concern about middle-income countries such as China, India and Russia, which are home to most cases of HCV worldwide but where drug companies are more reluctant to accept rock-bottom prices than in the poorest nations.Charles Gore, president of the patient-led World Hepatitis Alliance, welcomed the WHO guidelines but said international funding along the lines of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was now needed.When it comes to profits, drug companies are expecting to make most of their money in the United States, where medicines traditionally fetch a premium.But the scale of the expected demand for new hepatitis C drugs - which industry analysts believe will translate into annual sales of $9.1 billion for Sovaldi alone by 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data - means the industry is under fire.U.S. lawmakers asked Gilead last month to explain the $84,000 price tag on Sovaldi, hitting shares in the firm and raising fears across the biotech sector.""Until we develop a better model, we are still in the situation where investors in pharma want to recompensed on the winners for all the losers - and there have been a lot of losers in hepatitis C over the years,"" said Gore.(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by David Stamp)",2014-04-09,GILD,"Wed Apr 9, 2014 | 7:00am EDT",WHO joins clamour to make new hepatitis C pills affordable,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-hepatitis-idUSL6N0MZ47K20140409?type=companyNews

All three IPOs ended lower.""Momentum names have been driving this market higher.

Cerulean fell 2.1 percent to close at $6.85, while Adamas lost 12.4 percent to end at $14.01.Among Internet-related tech shares, which were among last year's biggest advancers, Facebook Inc (FB.O) fell 5.2 percent to end at $59.16, while Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) sank 5.2 percent to close at $334.73.""You've basically more than erased the bounce of the last two days, so I would imagine any bounce from these levels is probably going to be met with supply because the market is on very tenuous legs right now,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Among other big decliners, shares of Imperva Inc (IMPV.N) plunged 43.7 percent to $28 after the data center security company reported preliminary first-quarter results. Rival FireEye Inc (FEYE.O) lost 11.8 percent to $49.75.On the earnings front, Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) shares slumped 6.2 percent to $63.72 after the home-goods retailer reported fourth-quarter sales that fell from a year ago and gave a first-quarter outlook that was below expectations.The day's economic data was encouraging, however, with initial jobless claims dropping sharply last week to the lowest in almost seven years, suggesting job growth may be picking up after a harsh winter.After the bell, shares of Gap (GPS.N) dropped 2.4 percent to $38.33. The slide followed the clothing retailer's report on its March sales and reaffirmation of its 2014 outlook. In contrast, shares of H&R Block (HRB.N) rose 7.7 percent to $30.60 in extended-hours trading after the U.S. tax preparer said it would sell some assets and transfer certain liabilities to BofI Federal Bank.Volume was high, with 7.5 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.8 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Decliners outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 3.6 to 1.

The selling also hit the shares of three companies in their first day of public trading after their initial public offerings were priced on Wednesday night. All three IPOs ended lower.""This is a pretty dramatic selloff, but it's not entirely unexpected,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.""Momentum names have been driving this market higher. A lot of these names have been trading at stratospheric valuations, and on long-term outlooks, that may or may not materialize. The question is, 'At what point do they get too expensive?' Right now, I think they're looking a little expensive.""There's a good chance that the selling could spread to areas beyond the momentum names, Frederick said. Alexion Pharma was the S&P 500's biggest decliner, off 7.5 percent at $144.19, followed by Gilead Sciences, down 7.3 percent at $65.48, and TripAdvisor, down 7 percent at $81.90.The move was a sharp reversal from the previous day, when shares rallied after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting showed members were more keen to keep rates low than previously expected.The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 266.96 points or 1.62 percent, to end at 16,170.22. The S&P 500  lost 39.09 points or 2.09 percent, to close at 1,833.09. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 129.794 points or 3.1 percent, to 4,054.106. The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 10, wile the CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's measure of investor anxiety, spiked 14.98 percent to end at 15.89, still at historically low levels.The stock of bailed-out auto lender Ally Financial Inc  fell 4.1 percent to close at $23.98 in its market debut.Two biotech companies - Cerulean Pharma Inc and Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc - also slid in their trading debuts. Cerulean fell 2.1 percent to close at $6.85, while Adamas lost 12.4 percent to end at $14.01.Among Internet-related tech shares, which were among last year's biggest advancers, Facebook Inc fell 5.2 percent to end at $59.16, while Netflix Inc sank 5.2 percent to close at $334.73.""You've basically more than erased the bounce of the last two days, so I would imagine any bounce from these levels is probably going to be met with supply because the market is on very tenuous legs right now,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.Volume was high, with 7.5 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.8 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Decliners outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 3.6 to 1. On the Nasdaq, about 6.6 stocks fell for every one that rose.

35,"   By Caroline Humer  Texas is reconsidering whether to impose strict limits on Gilead Sciences' $84,000 hepatitis C treatment for patients on the state's Medicaid health plan for the poor, at the urging of outside advisers, a state official said on Friday.The Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees Medicaid, had proposed a policy to allow the drug, Sovaldi, to be used mainly for sicker patients such as those whose hepatitis C had developed into advanced liver disease, according to state documents reviewed by Reuters.As with most state Medicaid programs, an outside committee of pharmacists and doctors in Texas meets quarterly to review new drugs and recommend policies to the program's director. The agency had been planning to begin offering coverage in July if the committee recommended the policy at its Thursday meeting.""The board asked state staff to meet with stakeholders, including gastroenterologists, about the criteria, whether it was too strict, and the prior authorization process,"" Texas Health and Human Services Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said. In the interim, Medicaid patients in Texas will still not be prescribed the drug.""We're looking at our options and how that will affect our timeline to get the drug covered,"" Goodman said.A Gilead spokeswoman declined to comment.The deliberations in Texas, one of the most populous states and home to a relatively large number of hepatitis C patients, underline the difficulties of state health officials in deciding how to cover the Gilead treatment. It would have been the first major state to craft a policy. Discussions are continuing in California, Colorado and Virginia among others. The Texas move has also tabled a plan that the state had hoped could be in place by July in which it would make supplemental payments to insurers to help offset the high cost of the drug.Texas is among states including California and Florida asked by insurers who manage Medicaid plans to pay for the treatments directly, a move they said was needed because they would otherwise lose money on their contracts.Leerink managed care analyst Ana Gupta said that the Texas per-use payment could be a viable approach to compensating insurers in other states.""It covers the use of the drug while still potentially limiting the utilization only where medically necessary,"" Gupta said. She said the price tag to insurers may be $8 billion for eligible patients in Medicaid and similarly structured plans such as those sold on the Obamacare exchanges. Sovaldi has become the focal point for a global outcry over the price of novel medicines, attracting criticism from the World Health Organization, doctors' groups, state officials and insurance industries. Sovaldi is the first drug to provide a true cure for most patients who take it, but its cost could reach more than $200 billion if widely used in the United States, posing huge risks to state budgets and insurers' financial results.Gilead Sciences received U.S. regulatory approval for the treatment in December. Many patients are prescribed the drug in combination with another new drug, Johnson & Johnson's Olysio, pushing the treatment cost to around $150,000.Gilead shares, which have been hit by questions over Sovaldi's price in recent weeks, rose as much as 4 percent on Friday. The company reported new data on a combination therapy including Sovaldi.CARVING OUT THE DRUG  One of the country's largest insurers, WellPoint Inc, told investors last month that it was in talks with state Medicaid agencies about these high costs.""Our view is pretty simply it either needs to be covered in the rates and covered quickly or you have to take it out of managed care and put it into fee for service and pay for it that way,"" said Richard Zoretic, president of WellPoint's government business division.Some patient advocates prefer the second approach because it could encourage better access to the drug.""There is this basic bar in Medicaid where they do have to cover the drug. The question is who is going to get it and what will the rules around that be,"" said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at Project Inform based in San Francisco.For instance, Texas' policy on use of the drug this year appears to be stricter than the policy adopted in Oregon. Its pharmacy committee has recommended limiting the use of Sovaldi to patients who have moderate to severe fibrosis of the liver whereas Texas was targeting advanced liver disease.State Medicaid programs, funded by both state and federal government, set the policy for drug use in their fee-for-service programs. Coverage can differ because the vast majority of patients are in plans managed by private insurers that heed the state's recommendations but may also have their own practices.(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Grant McCool)",2014-04-11,GILD,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 2:49pm EDT",Texas Medicaid holds off on proposed limits for Gilead hepatitis drug,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-healthcare-hepatitisc-idUSBREA3A1BH20140411?type=companyNews

37,"   By Deena Beasley and Ben Hirschler | LOS ANGELES/LONDON  LOS ANGELES/LONDON Doctors at a key medical conference welcomed the prospect of more new drugs to treat the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus, while agreeing that Gilead Sciences Inc continues to lead the effort.Gilead, under fire from insurers and legislators for the $1,000-a-pill price of its Sovaldi drug, presented pivotal data on Friday at the European Association for the Study of the Liver conference in London, showing a cure rate of 94 percent after eight weeks of treatment with its experimental two-drug pill.Midstage trial results from Merck & Co Inc, also presented at the meeting, showed that 12 weeks of therapy with its two-drug combination cured 98 percent of previously-untreated patients.AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb are also developing new generation all-oral hepatitis C treatments that have demonstrated cure rates in excess of 90 percent.Citi Research sees Gilead as the clear market leader, but in the long term expects that Merck will be the second largest player, followed by AbbVie.""We assume Merck will use aggressive pricing to maximize market share,"" Citi analyst Yaron Werber said in a research note.Wall Street analysts, on average, forecast Sovaldi sales of $9.1 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma. Doctors at the London meeting said the value proposition of the new direct-acting antiviral drugs should stack up for governments and insurers, given the potential huge costs down the line from the disease, which can lead to liver cirrohosis and liver transplants.""Competition will drive the price down, but probably not far enough,"" said Markus Peck-Radosavljevic, professor of medicine in the Medical University of Vienna and secretary-general of EASL.The current U.S. price for a 12-week course of treatment with Sovaldi is $84,000, and Gilead has said the price in the United Kingdom is about $57,000. ""We spend at least this sort of money for cancer drugs, which only prolong patients' lives by a few weeks, and often with much worse side effects,"" said Dr Mark Thurz, professor of hepatology at Imperial College, London.AVOIDING STRONGER SIDE EFFECTS The World Health Organization estimates that 150 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C, which can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.Before Sovaldi's launch late last year, patients with hepatitis C had to be treated for at least six months with several drugs, including interferon, an injected medicine that can cause severe flu-like symptoms, and ribavirin, which can cause rash, anemia and other side effects. The combination of Gilead's Sovaldi and ledipasvir, an experimental drug from a class known as NS5A inhibitors, was shown to work better than the same regimen plus ribavirin.The trial, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved 647 previously untreated patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C - the hardest to treat, but the most common type in the United States - who had not developed liver cirrhosis.""The key points useful to clinicians here are the very high rates of sustained virologic response and very good safety profile,"" said Dr Kris Kowdley, director of the liver center at Seattle's Virginia Mason Medical Center and the study's lead author.More patients in the ribavirin group suffered side effects such as fatigue, headache and nausea.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted priority review to Gilead's application for the once-daily combination of Sovaldi, or sofosbuvir, and ledipasvir. The agency is slated to decide on the marketing application by October 10.(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Ken Wills)",2014-04-11,GILD,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 1:04am EDT","Doctors welcome hepatitis C drug rivals, Gilead still leads",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hepatitis-gilead-sciences-idUSBREA3A0CL20140411?type=companyNews
38,"   By Caroline Humer  UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, said it spent more than $100 million to cover a pricey new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences Inc in its first three months on the market, an amount that was ""multiple"" times what it had expected.UnitedHealth is the first insurer to quantify its costs to cover patients using Gilead's new Sovaldi treatment, whose $84,000 price tag has spurred a national outcry over the rising costs of specialty medicines.UnitedHealth shares fell nearly 4 percent on Thursday and shares of rivals WellPoint Inc and Aetna Inc fell 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, as investors weighed what their potential costs could be as well.The disclosure indicates that industry-wide, insurers spent $1 to $1.5 billion on treatments in the first quarter, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note.U.S. drug regulators approved Sovaldi in December, the first of a handful of ground-breaking hepatitis C treatments that are expected to be on the market in the next few years.Sovaldi has been shown to cure most patients of the liver-wasting virus with few side effects, but health officials, insurers and Medicaid directors are balking at the cost. The national cost of treating even two-thirds of the estimated 3.2 million people with the virus could reach $200 billion.This has focused scrutiny on U.S. drug prices, which outstrip the rest of the world. Biotechnology shares were already in the midst of a selloff when U.S. lawmakers asked on March 21 for Gilead Sciences to explain the price for the Sovaldi treatment.Since then, shares of Gilead have lost more than 7 percent as investors feared that regulators and insurers would pressure the company to restrain prices. It pulled other biotech stocks down in tandem and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has dropped nearly 14 percent since March 20. Some doctors and health officials say the drug's cost must be viewed in comparison to spending on treating liver disease or on liver transplants, which can be more expensive and may not prevent a relapse in hepatitis C.Daniel Schumacher, chief financial officer of the group's UnitedHealthcare division, said the spending on Sovaldi could begin to moderate after the first big wave of patients are treated with the drug.He did not disclose what it had anticipated spending on the hepatitis C drug but said the cost ""is a multiple of what we had expected.""Because Sovaldi is widely viewed as a breakthrough in treating the liver-wasting virus in typically as few as 12 weeks, many doctors had waited for the drug before prescribing treatment to patients. ""What we're seeing is ... higher pent-up demand as there were more patients that were warehoused leading up to the launch,"" Schumacher said.UnitedHealth saw increased spending levels due to Sovaldi in its Medicaid, Medicare and commercial businesses during the first quarter of 2014, he said. A Gilead spokeswoman declined to comment.Schumacher said the company is working with state Medicaid directors, whose agencies could bear much of the cost because they cover a disproportionate share of people with the virus, and expects to be reimbursed at some point.State Medicaid directors are pushing Gilead for discounts, but it so far has refused to give much ground. Medicaid receives at least a mandatory 23 percent discount from pharmaceutical makers, but states can negotiate for more cuts. Some insurers, such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, has said it will use anticipated products from AbbVie Inc and Merck & Co as price leverage with Gilead. ACA COSTS UnitedHealth said its quarterly profit was cut by 35 cents a share due to costs and taxes related to President Barack Obama's healthcare law, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act, and government cuts to private Medicare funding.The hepatitis C cost is one of several new pressures UnitedHealth said it has an eye on this year including commercial premium prices in several markets. In New York, which is also a large market for WellPoint, it said new competitors were underpricing at unsustainable levels.""This is really the first look of anyone operating under the full brunt of ACA-mandated cuts and sequestration and you have to revise your thinking a little bit,"" CRT Capital analyst Sheryl Skolnick said.UnitedHealth, a small player on the Obamacare exchanges created by that reform law in 2014, said that it had a ""bias"" towards expansion in 2015. Insurers must submit new plans and rates to the federal government by the end of June if they want to participate.The company's quarterly results slightly beat analyst expectations. UnitedHealth said net profit was $1.1 billion, or about $1.10 per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.16 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected first quarter profit of $1.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.UnitedHealth stuck by its previous forecast for 2014 earnings of $5.40 to $5.60 per share and said it sees revenue growth of about 5 percent to $128 billion to $129 billion.(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Chizu Nomiyiama and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-04-17,GILD,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 2:30pm EDT",UnitedHealth: New hepatitis C drug costs far more than forecast,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-unitedheal-grp-results-idUSBREA3G0KN20140417?type=companyNews

40,"  LONDON, April 17 Health authorities in England have approved an 18.7 million pound ($31 million) investment to provide Gilead Sciences' controversial new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi for seriously ill patients.Healthcare provider NHS England said the decision would benefit about 500 patients suffering from acute liver failure, many of whom are awaiting a liver transplant.The recommendation means that while Sovaldi has not yet been approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the country's cost-effectiveness watchdog, it will be funded for those patients at significant risk of dying. NICE is due to publish its guidance on whether Sovaldi is worth using widely on the state-run National Health Service later this year. Sovaldi is far more effective and better-tolerated than older treatments, but its high cost has provoked criticism from healthcare campaigners and insurers. The current U.S. price for a 12-week course of treatment with Sovaldi is $84,000, or $1,000 for each once-daily pill, but Gilead has said the price in Britain will be about $57,000.

Gilead continued to exclude sales of Sovaldi and other hepatitis C drugs from its forecast for 2014 product sales, which it still expects to total between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion.John Milligan, Gilead's chief operating officer, said during a conference call with analysts and investors that the drug has been ""priced appropriately based on its benefit.""Gilead is awaiting U.S. approval for a combination of Sovaldi and experimental drug ledipasvir that would allow more patients to be cured of the virus with a single-pill regimen.The company's pricing for that ""simpler"" regimen will take into account the additional benefit it provides, Milligan said. UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the largest U.S. health insurer, said last week that its first quarter costs to cover Sovaldi were much higher than expected, but it anticipated spending would moderate after the first big wave of patients are treated with the drug.Pharmacy plan manager Express Scripts (ESRX.O) suggested its clients should stop using Sovaldi once rival products are on the market. Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives, led by California's Henry Waxman, have asked Gilead to explain the pricing on Sovaldi.Before the new drug was available, patients infected with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus had to be treated for at least six months with several drugs, including interferon, an injected medicine that can cause severe flu-like symptoms, and ribavirin, which can casue rash, anemia and other side effects.Those regimens were shown in clinical trials to cure around 75 percent of patients, compared with Sovaldi's cure rate of more than 90 percent.Around 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

51,"  April 24 Aetna Inc. spent about $30 million during the first quarter on Sovaldi, the pricey new hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc., Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said on Thursday during a conference call with investors.Guertin said the costs were in line with the company's expectations. Most of it was in its commercial business and in Medicare Part D, the government program in which private insurers manage drug benefits.  Medicaid-related Sovaldi costs accounted for the smallest portion of that $30 million, he said, as some states continue to develop policies on the drug and because some states where it operates do not use private insurance to pay for any pharmaceutical benefits.

52,"  (Adds analyst comment, details, background, byline, updates share price)By Deena BeasleyMay 1 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday said a combination of its cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and an experimental compound was shown to improve lung function in a mid-stage trial, sending its shares up nearly 8 percent.The study found that treatment with Kalydeco and the experimental drug VX-661 for 28 days resulted in a 4.6 percentage point improvement in mean lung function for patients with two specific genetic mutations.VX-661 would be the second drug from Vertex that works by treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disease that impairs the lungs and digestive system.The disease is caused by defective or missing CF transmembrane conductane regulator (CFTR) proteins. Kalydeco is designed for patients with the most common CFTR mutation, while VX-661 aims to treat patients with a different mutation that affects protein function. The Phase 2 trial involved patients with both mutations who were already taking Kalydeco.""It is good data and some believe it does have an incremental positive read-through to the all-important Phase 3 data later this summer,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.That trial will answer the question of whether a combination of Vertex drugs is effective in patients with two copies of the gene mutation not currently addressed by Kalydeco - a market representing about half of the 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients in the United States. A positive result ""would be transformative to the cystic fibrosis community,"" Yee said.The most common side effects seen during the Phase 2 trial included cough, headache and upper respiratory tract infection. But ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum cautioned that Vertex has not disclosed results from the mid-stage trial for patients treated with a placebo.Vertex also announced that first quarter sales of Kalydeco totaled $100 million, which fell short of the average analyst estimate of $107 million, according to Wells Fargo Securities.Separately, The company reported an adjusted first quarter loss of $1.00 per share, also below the average analyst per-share loss estimate of 67 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Vertex said it would discontinue research into treatments for hepatitis C, a market now dominated by sales of Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi. Vertex late last year sold off its non-North America royalty rights to hepatitis C drug Incivek.Shares of Vertex, which closed at $68.95 in regular Nasdaq trading, were up $5.30 at $74.25 after hours.

55,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 15 Top hedge funds shed their stakes in high-profile Internet names such as Netflix Inc  and Groupon Inc in the first quarter, moving to peers viewed as more mature and less volatile.High-growth Internet software and biotech companies were the darlings of 2013, but their shares started to fall sharply in early March. Netflix, last year's biggest S&P 500 gainer and an important hedge fund holding, is down more than 24 percent from its closing high this year.Hedge funds invested in technology and healthcare fell 3.65 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline since October 2008 and extending March's 1.8 percent decline, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.Among prominent hedge fund managers, Carl Icahn cut his holding in Netflix by 15.8 percent in the first quarter, reducing it to about 2.2 million shares. Tiger Global Management sold its entire stake of 663,000 shares during the quarter. Netflix was up on the year for most of the first quarter, so the fund is likely to have sold at the right time.Tiger also dumped its stake of 11.46 million shares in Groupon. That position was worth $134.9 million at the end of 2013 and $89.9 million at the end of the quarter. The Internet software and services sector now accounts for about 10 percent of the top 100 long positions for equity/long short hedge funds, down from 20 percent to 25 percent in January, according to Credit Suisse data.Long/short hedge fund managers moved to short bets in Internet names amid a meltdown in the group, according to Credit Suisse. Long positions in the group now account for about 25 percent of the overall gross exposure to the group, which adds together both long and short positions. That's the lowest rate in at least three years. Some funds added to their ""momentum"" exposure, with Jana Partners increasing its stake in Groupon by almost 32 percent to 40.8 million shares.Other funds moved to technology names with less lofty valuations and that are viewed as more established. Third Point sold its stakes in both Yahoo Inc and biotech company Gilead Sciences Inc but increased its Google Inc  holdings by 31.3 percent.EBay Inc, which became a darling among top U.S. hedge funds in the fourth quarter just before billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn urged the company to spin off its PayPal business, continued to find fans in the first quarter.Omega more than tripled its stake in eBay, bringing it to 2.9 million shares, while Jana opened a stake of 3.9 million shares in the first quarter. Icahn, who backed down from his demands, disclosed a new stake in eBay, holding 27.8 million shares as of March 31.

The new drug has demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients in just 12 weeks or less with few side effects.Prior to the Sovaldi approval, hepatitis C treatments took 24 or 48 weeks, cured about 75 percent of patients and involved many more pills as well as injectable interferon that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that led many people to avoid or discontinue treatment.But concern that hundreds of thousands of patients will  seek treatment with the Gilead drug that costs roughly $1,000 per pill has provided a rallying point for insurers and others seeking to rein in the skyrocketing cost of new medicines in the United States, which has no price controls on drugs, unlike Europe and other countries. In its first full quarter on the market, Sovaldi had more than $2 billion in sales, shattering previous pharmaceutical records.Cara Miller, a spokeswoman for Gilead, defended the drug's pricing in an emailed statement: ""While Sovaldi greatly enhances the standard of care for hepatitis C, it was priced such that the total regimen cost is equal to that of prior standard of care regimens.    ""Sovaldi reduces total treatment costs for HCV – taking into account the cost of medications (including those for side effects or complications) and healthcare visits – and it represents a finite cure, an important point to consider when comparing the price of a pill or bottle to the lifetime costs of treating a chronic disease.""The campaign against Gilead may also be an effort to pressure other drugmakers, such as Merck & Co, AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, before they set prices for their hepatitis C drugs that are expected to gain regulatory approval in the next year or two.AHIP said promising new drugs are being priced in a way that threatens Americans' access to them.

Unfortunately, the drug's maker has priced it at an astronomical level that is not sustainable for consumers, innovation, or society,"" AHIP said on its Coverage blog.Sovaldi is the first in a new wave of all-oral treatments for the liver disease that has been a tremendous advance over prior treatments. The new drug has demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients in just 12 weeks or less with few side effects.Prior to the Sovaldi approval, hepatitis C treatments took 24 or 48 weeks, cured about 75 percent of patients and involved many more pills as well as injectable interferon that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that led many people to avoid or discontinue treatment. But concern that hundreds of thousands of patients will  seek treatment with the Gilead drug that costs roughly $1,000 per pill has provided a rallying point for insurers and others seeking to rein in the skyrocketing cost of new medicines in the United States, which has no price controls on drugs, unlike Europe and other countries.In its first full quarter on the market, Sovaldi had more than $2 billion in sales, shattering previous pharmaceutical records. Representatives from Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Drugmakers have argued that it costs billions of dollars to  develop new medicines and that high prices are necessary to sustain innovation. They also note that a treatment such as Sovaldi can save future healthcare costs by preventing liver failure, cancer or the need for a transplant. The campaign against Gilead may also be an effort to pressure other drugmakers, such as Merck & Co, AbbVie  and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, before they set prices for their hepatitis C drugs that are expected to gain regulatory approval in the next year or two.AHIP said promising new drugs are being priced in a way that threatens Americans' access to them. ""We need to find a solution that ensures important drugs like Sovaldi are priced at sustainable levels so that we can foster even more life-saving innovation.""John Castellani, chief executive of PhRMA, the leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, said the problem is an insurance system that pushes too much of the cost of treatment onto the patient with high co-pays and deductibles for drugs.""The insurance model makes medicine seem like the most expensive part of the healthcare system,"" Castellani said.

Waxman, a Democrat who helped build a government buying program for HIV drugs more than two decades ago, asks Gilead to justify prices that will fall to the taxpayers who support government insurance programs including Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Affairs Bureau and the federal and state prison systems.

66,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In the race to find a faster cure for hepatitis C, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said it will test its experimental antiviral drug combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's blockbuster drug Sovaldi, hoping to cut treatment time to four weeks.Bristol-Myers disclosed plans for the exploratory 30-patient trial testing its three-drug combination with Sovaldi in an interview with Reuters. Eric Hughes, the leader of Bristol's global hepatitis program, said the details were due to be posted on the clinicaltrials.gov website next week. Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag for a 12-week treatment has spurred outrage among insurers, state health officials and lawmakers who fear the cost of treating millions of Americans with the progressive liver disease will top $250 billion. Insurers are pushing Gilead's rivals to offer lower prices when their hepatitis C medicines reach the market. Using the drug for a shorter course of treatment could, in theory, lower the cost, even when combined with Bristol's therapies. Rivals Merck & Co and AbbVie are also racing to develop next-generation hepatitis C treatments that cure most people of the virus in a shorter time frame.But drug pricing experts expect Gilead and its rivals may still argue that the quicker cure represents a value to patients, buffering any steep price reductions.""The position and concept of pharma is not ingredient costs or duration of treatment cost. Pharma is looking at it as cost per cure,"" said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, which works with pharmaceutical companies and payers to help determine prices for medicines.The cost could come down, he said, ""but it's not going to be proportionate to the degree that the duration of treatment shortens."" The new generation of oral drugs being developed by several companies has raised hepatitis C cure rates to well above 90 percent from about 75 percent without the need for interferon or ribavirin, which caused miserable side effects that led many patients to delay or drop treatment. The drugs in clinical trials have already cut treatment time to 12 weeks from 24 to 48 weeks.  ""We got rid of the tolerability problem. We got rid of the efficacy problem. Now there is a tremendous drive to get down to shorter treatment durations,"" Bristol-Myers' Hughes said in a telephone interview.REVIVING A SOVALDI COMBO  Bristol's plan essentially revives an effort to test its drugs in combination with Sovaldi. It previously tested a single compound with Sovaldi, achieving cure rates close to 100 percent in 12 weeks. But Gilead scrapped further testing in 2012, as it  preferred to develop its own combination without a partner. Gilead's pill that combines Sovaldi with its ledipasvir is expected to gain U.S. approval this year for therapies of eight or 12 weeks, depending on the patient. The company is also testing the combination as a six-week treatment.The go-it-alone strategy has already paid off as Gilead was first to market with Sovaldi, breaking pharmaceutical industry sales records with $2.3 billion in sales within a few months. The new study, set to begin in late July, will test a trio of Bristol drugs with Sovaldi in previously untreated patients with the most common Genotype 1 form of the virus. It will involve two groups of 15 patients each - one getting four weeks of treatment and the other six. If Bristol can demonstrate cure rates in excess of 90 percent in four weeks, it plans to conduct larger trials with a more diverse patient population. ""We'll see what the data says,"" Hughes said. ""Taking this forward will be a very exciting thing.""       With Gilead not involved in the effort, Bristol will pay full price for Sovaldi to conduct the trial.Bristol would not discuss potential pricing of its regimen, since its drugs are not approved. But if treatment can be cut to four weeks from 12, the Sovaldi portion would be closer to $28,000. Other rivals are also advancing efforts to compete in what is expected to be a huge market.Merck this month agreed to pay $3.85 billion to acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc with the hope that combining the two companies' most promising drugs will produce cures in four to six weeks across the full spectrum of genotypes.U.S. and European health regulators in the last week said they would accelerate their reviews of AbbVie's four-drug regimen, meaning it could be vying for market share by early next year.

68,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Two members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, including Chairman Ron Wyden, on Friday asked Gilead Sciences Inc to defend the more than $80,000 cost of its breakthrough  treatment for hepatitis C, citing the expense to federal healthcare programs.“Given the impact Sovaldi’s cost will have on Medicare, Medicaid and other federal spending, we need a better understanding of how your company arrived at the price for this drug,” the lawmakers said in a release. ""It is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi.""Sovaldi's cost can soar to $168,000 in patients that need longer treatment periods, not including the costs of other drugs used with it, the senators said. Gilead acquired Sovaldi (sufosbuvir) in 2012 by paying more than $11 billion for Pharmasset Inc. The deal began to bear fruit after Sovaldi produced stellar results in late-stage clinical trials and was approved by U.S. regulators late last year.

69,"  (Adds background on Sovaldi, rival drugs)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 11 Two members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, including Chairman Ron Wyden, on Friday asked Gilead Sciences Inc to defend the more than $80,000 cost of its breakthrough  treatment for hepatitis C, citing the expense to federal healthcare programs.""Given the impact Sovaldi's cost will have on Medicare, Medicaid and other federal spending, we need a better understanding of how your company arrived at the price for this drug,"" the lawmakers said in a release. ""It is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi.""Sovaldi's cost can soar to $168,000 in patients that need longer treatment periods, not including the costs of other drugs used with it, the senators said. Gilead acquired Sovaldi (sufosbuvir) in 2012 by paying more than $11 billion for Pharmasset Inc.

82,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK With some of Wall Street's more volatile names set to report in the next couple of days, traders who bet on big swings in shares are hoping to see moves more like Facebook than Netflix.Netflix, along with Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) and several other stocks famous for their sharp gyrations, were unusually calm following their latest quarterly reports. However, Amazon.com and Facebook have had big days after their reports, heightening expectations for upcoming releases from Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O).For volatility investors, the direction of the move is not important, just the magnitude. Traders use an option strategy known as a straddle - buying a bullish call option and a bearish put option at the same strike price - in a bet that a stock will move by a certain amount. Even if a stock rises, the trader can lose money if it moves less than implied by the combined cost of the put and call options.On average, the realized stock change on earnings is about 1.5 percent lower than expected, according to derivatives strategists at Credit Suisse in New York.""Many of the companies that are typically volatile have had in-line numbers, which wouldn’t result in a materially volatile stocks afterwards,"" said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Florida.     Expedia and Tesla are both due to report results on Thursday. Over the past eight quarters, both have averaged a move of about 15 percent following results, according to Thomson Reuters data. Based on where they traded on Monday, investors expect a move of 9.4 percent for Expedia and 7.8 percent for Tesla.Investors trading options in 3D Systems Corp (DDD.N), scheduled to report on Wednesday, are looking for an 11 percent move in shares, compared with the eight-quarter median of 6 percent, according to Goldman Sachs. VOLATILITY SUCCESSES Recent days have seen more volatility among individual names. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Friday tumbled almost 10 percent following results, while both Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) soared to records.Amazon lost more than $34 on the day after reporting results. The options market had priced in a $22 move. Facebook shares rose as much as $5.45, beyond the $4.92 move estimated by the options market, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. Still, moves like these have been the exception this season, in an environment where the CBOE Volatility index .VIX is less than 13, well below its historical average of 20. Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) fell 5 percent in the week after its results, less than a third of its nearly 19 percent average move over the past eight quarters.""One might expect a little more volatility to the downside, which we haven’t seen,"" said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ""We could be in a calm before the storm, there’s a lot of complacency."" Google Inc (GOOGL.O) rose 2.5 percent in the week after its results, less than half the 5.5 percent average over the past eight quarters. F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O) rose 1.7 percent, below its 7.85 percent average. Gilead Sciences averaged a one-day move of 2.85 percent in the last six quarters; this time out, it gained just 1.1 percent.   Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rose 4.8 percent in the seven sessions following earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data, below the 6.4 percent average over the past eight quarters.""Last quarter the people who played an Apple straddle really got rewarded,"" said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. Apple gained 11.4 percent in the week after results.

89,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The next generation version of Gilead Sciences Inc's $84,000 hepatitis C drug, already under fire for its record-breaking costs, is going to be even more expensive.Gregg Alton, Gilead's executive vice president of corporate and medical affairs, declined to give an exact price for the new medicine, the first all-oral treatment for the virus which is expected to launch next month. The total cost of the current treatment is $95,000, which includes Sovaldi and two older medicines, ribavirin and interferon, according to Gilead. The price of the new drug would be based on that cost, Alton said in an interview. ""We are going to price this fixed-dose regimen based on those costs,"" Alton said. ""We do plan on launching a better product without having a significant premium.""Health insurers, U.S. state authorities and congressional lawmakers have pleaded with Gilead to offer a greater discount for Sovaldi as the cost of treating more than 3 million U.S. patients are expected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars. The drugmaker is expected to rake in nearly $12 billion in hepatitis C drug sales worldwide in 2014. Sovaldi sales have been unprecedented for any drug in its first year on the market. ""The blank check mindset we've seen from Gilead is a threat to our entire health care system, and we hope they will pursue more sustainable pricing in the future,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the insurance industry's largest lobbying group, America's Health Insurance Plans.Gilead expects savings for some patients in its pricing scheme. It said that nearly half of hepatitis C patients - previously untreated, healthier individuals - can be cured after eight weeks of using the new pill, compared with 12 weeks for the current Sovaldi regimen. That would effectively cut the treatment cost by one-third for such patients.  U.S. health regulators are due to decide by Oct. 10 whether to approve the new drug, a pill that combines Sovaldi with the experimental therapy ledipasvir and eliminates the need for other treatments. It has been shown to cure up to 99 percent of patients versus 90 percent for Sovaldi plus ribavirin and interferon, which also cause hard-to-tolerate side effects.LOWER AVERAGE COST? But the fact that a shorter treatment time for some will equate to a lower drug price may disappoint some investors. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum on Friday lowered his average price estimate per patient to $85,000 from $100,000 to account for it. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates that the new Gilead drug will be priced at $95,000 for 12 weeks, while Sanford Bernstein's Geoff Porges anticipated a list price of $100,000.Alton noted that the new drug will be priced below the current cost of Sovaldi plus Olysio, a daily protease inhibitor sold by Johnson & Johnson. Although it is not FDA-approved, some doctors have been prescribing Sovaldi in combination with Olysio, costing up to $150,000.But J. Mario Molina, chief executive officer at insurer Molina Healthcare Inc, says the drug should cost no more than $45,000 per patient, based on his estimate of how many patients it may save from severe liver disease.    ""Yes, it will save lives and prevent people from having a liver transplant, but not very many,"" Molina said. ""If I said, you give me $9 million and I will give you $4 million or $5 million back, would you do that? That's what Gilead is doing.""

103,"   By Natalie Huet | PARIS  PARIS France will tax drugmakers whose costly hepatitis C drugs threaten to throw off course its healthcare budget, the government has said, heaping pressure on pharmaceutical companies like Gilead Sciences to cut their prices.The Socialist government said it had designed a ""progressive contribution scheme"" ensuring all patients can access new and more effective treatments against the liver-destroying virus, while limiting the burden of these drugs on state finances.The government will selectively tax drugmakers when the total cost to the state from their hepatitis C drugs exceeds a certain amount each year, Health Minister Marisol Touraine said, as she unveiled the country's 2015 social security budget bill on Monday.If social security spending on hepatitis C drugs exceeds 450 million euros ($567 million) in 2014, the makers of those drugs will be taxed based on the revenue they had reaped in excess of that cap, the ministry said in a presentation. In 2015, the tax will apply beyond a 700 million euro cap, it added.Details of the new tax should be presented to lawmakers in October and a vote on the budget is due by the end of the year. Some 200,000 people in France are infected with hepatitis C and treatments for the virus could cost the state-run healthcare system as much as 1 billion euros this year, according to reports in newspapers Le Monde and Les Echos. The ministry declined to comment on any estimates.LOWER CURE RATES   With its move, France is raising pressure on U.S. biotechnology company Gilead, which obtained regulatory approval for its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi in Europe last January, but is still negotiating its official price in France with representatives of the economy and health ministries. A representative for Gilead in Europe could not immediately be reached for comment. Gilead has argued that Sovaldi's price is comparable to older medicines that require longer treatment duration with much lower cure rates and nasty side effects.Sovaldi cures well in excess of 90 percent of patients in as little as eight weeks of treatment. But its price has fueled sharp criticism from governments and private insurers alike. Sovaldi currently costs around 56,000 euros ($70,000) in France and $84,000 in the United States for 12 weeks of treatment. The U.S. price works out to as much as $1,000 per pill.Sovaldi is on track to be one of the world's biggest-selling drugs, set to rake in close to $12 billion in revenue in 2014 - its first full year on the market - according to forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.

112,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Now that new medicines promise to cure millions of hepatitis C patients in coming years, drugmakers including Gilead Sciences Inc are turning their attention to other liver diseases, with a potential market that could rival the success of statins, which generated more than $30 billion a year in sales at their peak.Several companies are working on treatments for hepatitis B, which can be controlled but not yet cured, and for fatty liver conditions caused by rising obesity, which without treatment could affect half of all Americans by 2030, according to the American Liver Foundation (ALF). Some of the drugs will address advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are the scarring that virtually all liver diseases cause without effective treatments. Each of these drugs, once approved, could reach annual sales of as much as $10 billion, industry analysts said.    Most of the treatments are now in early Phase I or Phase II clinical trials, with more informative interim data on several expected over the course of the next year.Gilead, which was first to market with its hepatitis C cure Sovaldi late last year and has been racking up about $3 billion in sales each quarter, is a solid bet to be among the leaders in the next wave of liver therapies, experts said.""The Gilead program is encouraging,"" said Dr. Naga Chalasani, director of gastroenterology and hepatology at Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis, who is participating in clinical trials of promising drugs from Gilead and others.Drugmakers are working to address the fatty liver disease known as NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Without treatment, NASH can progress to liver-destroying cirrhosis and potentially cancer.ALF estimates that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including NASH, affects up to 30 percent of people in the United States. It can be caused by bad diets and alcohol abuse, and has also been tied to diabetes.""We have no treatment for that condition other than tell a patient they need to lose weight,"" said Dr. Mauricio Lisker-Melman, director of the hepatology program at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis.     Intercept Pharmaceuticals has attracted the most attention. Just released final data from a mid-stage clinical trial showed its obeticholic acid halted NASH progression and improved liver scarring in primarily moderately ill patients. ""For now, no one else has demonstrated an antifibrotic effect in this population, and I believe we are ahead of the pack in that sense,"" said Intercept Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski.Intercept plans to begin a Phase III trial with at least 1,000 more seriously ill patients next year. Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, who has worked with virtually all the companies in the field, said most were first testing drugs in patients whose liver damage is not advanced.""Gilead has sort of leapfrogged that,"" Friedman said, tackling more serious damage, as its simtuzumab targets fibrotic scarring directly, rather than inflammation or other drivers of disease. Reversing cirrhosis and improving liver function is ""the highest bar I can think of in this business, and it would be spectacular,"" he said.    Gilead faces competition from several smaller companies with promising drugs in development, including Intercept, France's Genfit, Israel's Galmed, Galectin Therapeutics, Conatus Pharmaceuticals and Raptor Pharmaceuticals, specialists said.    Gilead's antibody simtuzumab blocks an enzyme called LOXL2 that is directly involved in laying down bands of collagen that form the scar tissue behind cirrhosis. The collagen bands, which result from a wide variety of assaults on the liver, including alcohol and drug abuse, cross link haphazardly to destroy the liver's architecture and function.Gilead expects to have a strong indication of whether its drug is working when one-year data from a two-year Phase II study becomes available next year.""We have a very active research program,"" said Mani Subramanian, head of liver disease clinical research at Gilead. ""We're targeting everything: metabolic issues, inflammation and fibrosis directly."" He acknowledged challenges faced by drugmakers trying to address more advanced liver disease: ""It's been a graveyard for drugs that try to reverse fibrosis,"" Subramanian said.     NOT FOR FAINT OF HEART     Chalasani at Indiana University Hospital estimated there may be 20 different drugs being tried by various drug companies that seem to be good targets.But betting on them is not for the faint of heart. Intercept's shares shot from about $72 to over $400 in a matter of days in January after it was announced the trial of its drug would meet the intended goal. On the flip side, Galectin lost nearly two thirds of its value in July, when its NASH drug using a different approach had a setback in a Phase I trial.    Conatus is first testing its drug, emricasan, in patients facing acute liver failure, which has a 50 percent mortality rate in 28 days. Chief Executive Steven Mento said the goal was to ""rescue these patients and prevent catastrophic organ failure."" The company plans to work its way back, testing on less severely ill patients. The drug targets inflammation and excessive cell death seen as drivers of the disease.    Dr. David Bernstein, chief of hepatology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the Conatus drug exciting and the initial trial a sensible approach.     ""There's limited downside because there's nothing else that can be done anyway,"" said Bernstein, who expects to be involved in future emricasan trials. ""If you can reverse cirrhosis, you really will change the impact of liver disease worldwide.""Drugs that succeed in reversing cirrhosis ""can be as big a class as the class of statins,"" said Conatus's Mento, referring to cholesterol drugs, such as Pfizer's Lipitor, which alone at its peak had annual sales of about $13 billion.    Raptor, by contrast, is developing a drug for NASH in children, a growing problem that has left liver specialists fearing an obese generation that could require liver transplants in the prime of life.    Raptor is testing a drug already approved for use in children for an extremely rare kidney disease. ""In terms of safety, it's well established,"" said Raptor President and CEO designate Julie Anne Smith. It is now engaged in a year-long mid-stage trial of 169 children whose NASH was confirmed by liver biopsy with data expected in the first half of next year.    Companies are waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to outline what it will take to approve a NASH drug. ""The FDA is struggling with what constitutes a meaningful improvement with a patient,"" Gilead's Subramanian said.Goals such as reducing fat buildup or modestly improving fibrosis would likely be simpler and quicker to achieve, for example, than avoiding need for liver transplants.     The FDA is working ""to identify clinically meaningful endpoints for NASH and related liver diseases to help guide drug development,"" it said in a statement.The uncertainty from the FDA also creates risks for investors and has led some analysts to focus on other liver therapies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee favors companies taking on hepatitis B, such as Arrowhead Research Corp, Canada's Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Isis Pharmaceuticals in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. And one private company not to be ignored, OnCore Biopharma, founded by former Pharmasset executives, including the inventor of Gilead's Sovaldi.     While finding a cure for hepatitis B will not be easy, trials would mirror those for hepatitis C, with a simple blood test yielding clear results in months rather than years.

120,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Bill BerkrotNEW YORK Nov 10 Now that new medicines promise to cure millions of hepatitis C patients in coming years, drugmakers including Gilead Sciences Inc are turning their attention to other liver diseases, with a potential market that could rival the success of statins, which generated more than $30 billion a year in sales at their peak.Several companies are working on treatments for hepatitis B, which can be controlled but not yet cured, and for fatty liver conditions caused by rising obesity, which without treatment could affect half of all Americans by 2030, according to the American Liver Foundation (ALF). Some of the drugs will address advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are the scarring that virtually all liver diseases cause without effective treatments. Each of these drugs, once approved, could reach annual sales of as much as $10 billion, industry analysts said.Most of the treatments are now in early Phase I or Phase II clinical trials, with more informative interim data on several expected over the course of the next year.Gilead, which was first to market with its hepatitis C cure Sovaldi late last year and has been racking up about $3 billion in sales each quarter, is a solid bet to be among the leaders in the next wave of liver therapies, experts said.""The Gilead program is encouraging,"" said Dr. Naga Chalasani, director of gastroenterology and hepatology at Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis, who is participating in clinical trials of promising drugs from Gilead and others.Drugmakers are working to address the fatty liver disease known as NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Without treatment, NASH can progress to liver-destroying cirrhosis and potentially cancer.ALF estimates that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including NASH, affects up to 30 percent of people in the United States. It can be caused by bad diets and alcohol abuse, and has also been tied to diabetes.""We have no treatment for that condition other than tell a patient they need to lose weight,"" said Dr. Mauricio Lisker-Melman, director of the hepatology program at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis.Intercept Pharmaceuticals has attracted the most attention. Just released final data from a mid-stage clinical trial showed its obeticholic acid halted NASH progression and improved liver scarring in primarily moderately ill patients. ""For now, no one else has demonstrated an antifibrotic effect in this population, and I believe we are ahead of the pack in that sense,"" said Intercept Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski. Intercept plans to begin a Phase III trial with at least 1,000 more seriously ill patients next year.Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, who has worked with virtually all the companies in the field, said most were first testing drugs in patients whose liver damage is not advanced.""Gilead has sort of leapfrogged that,"" Friedman said, tackling more serious damage, as its simtuzumab targets fibrotic scarring directly, rather than inflammation or other drivers of disease. Reversing cirrhosis and improving liver function is ""the highest bar I can think of in this business, and it would be spectacular,"" he said.Gilead faces competition from several smaller companies with promising drugs in development, including Intercept, France's Genfit, Israel's Galmed, Galectin Therapeutics, Conatus Pharmaceuticals and Raptor Pharmaceuticals, specialists said.Gilead's antibody simtuzumab blocks an enzyme called LOXL2 that is directly involved in laying down bands of collagen that form the scar tissue behind cirrhosis. The collagen bands, which result from a wide variety of assaults on the liver, including alcohol and drug abuse, cross link haphazardly to destroy the liver's architecture and function. Gilead expects to have a strong indication of whether its drug is working when one-year data from a two-year Phase II study becomes available next year.""We have a very active research program,"" said Mani Subramanian, head of liver disease clinical research at Gilead. ""We're targeting everything: metabolic issues, inflammation and fibrosis directly."" He acknowledged challenges faced by drugmakers trying to address more advanced liver disease: ""It's been a graveyard for drugs that try to reverse fibrosis,"" Subramanian said.NOT FOR FAINT OF HEART Chalasani at Indiana University Hospital estimated there may be 20 different drugs being tried by various drug companies that seem to be good targets.But betting on them is not for the faint of heart. Intercept's shares shot from about $72 to over $400 in a matter of days in January after it was announced the trial of its drug would meet the intended goal. On the flip side, Galectin lost nearly two thirds of its value in July, when its NASH drug using a different approach had a setback in a Phase I trial.Conatus is first testing its drug, emricasan, in patients facing acute liver failure, which has a 50 percent mortality rate in 28 days. Chief Executive Steven Mento said the goal was to ""rescue these patients and prevent catastrophic organ failure."" The company plans to work its way back, testing on less severely ill patients. The drug targets inflammation and excessive cell death seen as drivers of the disease. Dr. David Bernstein, chief of hepatology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the Conatus drug exciting and the initial trial a sensible approach.""There's limited downside because there's nothing else that can be done anyway,"" said Bernstein, who expects to be involved in future emricasan trials. ""If you can reverse cirrhosis, you really will change the impact of liver disease worldwide.""Drugs that succeed in reversing cirrhosis ""can be as big a class as the class of statins,"" said Conatus's Mento, referring to cholesterol drugs, such as Pfizer's Lipitor, which alone at its peak had annual sales of about $13 billion.Raptor, by contrast, is developing a drug for NASH in children, a growing problem that has left liver specialists fearing an obese generation that could require liver transplants in the prime of life.Raptor is testing a drug already approved for use in children for an extremely rare kidney disease. ""In terms of safety, it's well established,"" said Raptor President and CEO designate Julie Anne Smith. It is now engaged in a year-long mid-stage trial of 169 children whose NASH was confirmed by liver biopsy with data expected in the first half of next year.Companies are waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to outline what it will take to approve a NASH drug. ""The FDA is struggling with what constitutes a meaningful improvement with a patient,"" Gilead's Subramanian said.Goals such as reducing fat buildup or modestly improving fibrosis would likely be simpler and quicker to achieve, for example, than avoiding need for liver transplants.The FDA is working ""to identify clinically meaningful endpoints for NASH and related liver diseases to help guide drug development,"" it said in a statement.The uncertainty from the FDA also creates risks for investors and has led some analysts to focus on other liver therapies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee favors companies taking on hepatitis B, such as Arrowhead Research Corp , Canada's Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Isis Pharmaceuticals in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. And one private company not to be ignored, OnCore Biopharma, founded by former Pharmasset executives, including the inventor of Gilead's Sovaldi.While finding a cure for hepatitis B will not be easy, trials would mirror those for hepatitis C, with a simple blood test yielding clear results in months rather than years.

121,"   By Bill Berkrot  Nov 9 An attempt by Merck & Co to shorten hepatitis C treatment to just four weeks by adding Gilead Sciences Inc's huge selling Sovaldi to its own oral two-drug combination came nowhere near the desired efficacy due to a high rate of relapses, according to interim data from a midstage study.Several companies have been working to find ways to further reduce the number of weeks of treatment needed, while keeping cure rates above 90 percent.A just approved pill called Harvoni that combines Sovaldi  with another Gilead drug requires eight weeks of treatment for many patients, and longer for tougher to treat patients.In the ongoing Merck trial of previously untreated patients, only 38.7 percent had no detectable sign of the liver destroying virus after four weeks of treatment with Sovaldi and Merck's grazoprevir/elbasvir combination. Nineteen of the 31 patients in the four-week treatment arm relapsed prior to the planned end of the study, which is 12 weeks after completion of dosing. The preliminary data was set to be presented on Monday at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Boston.The best result so far in the multi-arm, three-drug study called C-Swift was observed with eight weeks of treatment of patients with cirrhosis in which 94.7 percent had no detectable virus. They will be deemed cured if the virus has not reappeared 12 weeks after stopping treatment. With a six-week regimen in non-cirrhotics, 86.7 percent of patients had no sign of virus up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, according to the interim results.""These findings will inform the design of larger studies aimed at understanding the potential of short-duration triple therapy across multiple patient types,"" Dr. Eric Lawitz, the study's lead investigator, said in a statement. The three drugs each work in a different way to help prevent the virus from replicating. But following failure of the 4-week experiment, Merck said it will turn its attention to studying a combination of three of its own drugs in development rather than involving the Gilead medicine in future studies.The hepatitis C field has been moving at a lightning pace. Only a handful of years ago, patients needed 48 weeks of treatment with drugs that had harsh side effects and only cured about 40 percent of patients.The new all-oral treatments eliminate the need for injectable interferon and its flu-like side effects, as well as another older drug called ribavirin that caused anemia and other problems, while dramatically increasing cure rates and reducing treatment duration.

The Gilead study involved 155 patients with cirrhosis and the most common genotype 1 form of the liver virus. They previously had failed to benefit from standard older treatments that included protease inhibitors as well as interferon and ribavirin, drugs that can cause harsh side effects and must be taken for almost a year.  All patients received Harvoni, a once-daily pill containing Gilead's Sovaldi and ledipasvir. The combination eliminates the need to take interferon and ribavirin with Sovaldi.In one group taking Harvoni alone for 24 weeks, the cure rate was 97 percent. It was 96 percent for patients who received Harvoni plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. Three far smaller Gilead studies evaluated Sovaldi, a so-called nucleotide, in combination with the company's experimental NS5A inhibitor GS-5816, with and without ribavirin for eight or 12 weeks.Of patients taking the combination for 12 weeks without ribavirin, sustained cures were seen in 100 percent of genotype 1 patients, with and without cirrhosis, and in 88 percent of those with the less common genotype 3 form of the virus, with cirrhosis.

124,"  PARIS Nov 20 France has negotiated a big discount for Gilead Sciences Inc's controversial new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, under a government deal that ensures it will be fully reimbursable by health-funding schemes.The Economic Committee for Health Products (CEPS) has fixed the price of a box of Sovaldi at 13,667 euros before tax, a reduction of 5,000 euros on the original price and ""the lowest price in Europe"", the Health Ministry said on Thursday.Twelve weeks of treatment will now cost 41,000 euros ($51,373) before tax, against 56,000 euros previously. In the United States, where Sovaldi's high price has sparked controversy and pushed up insurance companies' costs, a 12-week course costs $84,000, or $1,000 per pill.Some 200,000 people in France have hepatitis C and the total cost of treatment to the national health fund is 800 million euros a year. Sovaldi has racked up record sales despite a fierce debate over its price and concerns that high demand will place a huge burden on government-run health plans and private insurers. Last month, U.S. regulators approved the sale of a new hepatitis C pill from Gilead, called Harvoni, which will cost $94,500 for an improved 12-week course of treatment to rid patients of the liver-destroying viral infection.Harvoni has just won temporary approval for sale in France at 16,000 euros a box but negotiations are taking place with the French government aiming for a lower price.

125,"   By Caroline Humer  Global pharmaceutical spending will break the trillion dollar mark in 2014, driven by high prices in the United States for novel treatments such as Gilead Sciences Inc's  Sovaldi for hepatitis C and new cancer drugs, according to a study released on Thursday.Total spending on drugs will hit $1.06 trillion, an increase of 7 percent over 2013 levels, according to the report from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. The increase also reflected a slowdown in the introduction of cheaper generic versions of branded medicines.By 2018, IMS expects spending to rise to $1.3 trillion due to new breakthrough therapies.Hepatitis C drugs will add about $100 billion in total spending in the next few years, while cancer spending will rise to $100 billion and diabetes care will account for another $78 billion. Cancer drugs contributing to the high cost include Roche Holding AG's Perjeta and Kadcyla, Pharmacyclics Inc's Imbruvica and Amgen's Kyprolis. Drugmakers have come under pressure over high U.S. prices, particularly Sovaldi's list price of $1,000 per pill. State Medicaid offices and private insurers say the prices are too high to bear, while drugmakers defend them as reflecting the wider cost of developing medicines, many of which they say will never make a profit.U.S. spending accounts for about one-third of the total drug spend and is due to rise 11.7 percent in 2014 before the growth rate slows to an annual 5 percent increase after 2015.

127,"  (Adds details on drug, other Bristol-Myers, rival treatments)Nov 26 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Wednesday said U.S. regulators had declined to approve the use of its experimental treatment for hepatitis C, daclatasvir, in combination with other antiviral drugs.Bristol-Myers said it had initially sought permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market the drug, a so-called NS5A inhibitor, in combination with asunaprevir, one of the New York-based company's experimental medicines.But Bristol-Myers abandoned its U.S. marketing application for asunaprevir in October because of potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen. Bristol-Myers said the FDA has asked it for data involving use of daclatasvir with other drugs, and that the company is in discussions with the agency about the scope of the required information.Most notably, it is testing daclatasvir in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi, a blockbuster treatment that is used on its own or as a component of a combination treatment called Harvoni that was recently introduced by Gilead and is expected to quickly become the market leader. Bristol-Myers' combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir,  however, was approved in July for use in Japan, which it long considered a prime market for the treatment. One strain of the hepatitis C virus, Genotype 1b, is prevalent in Japan, where intolerance to interferon, an older medicine, is particularly high. In late-stage clinical trials, the combination treatment cured about 85 percent of patients with 24 weeks of therapy. The combinations being developed by rival drugmakers have demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with just 12 weeks of therapy, and they are pursuing even shorter treatment durations.Bristol-Myers, meanwhile, is studying a three-drug regimen that, based on earlier studies, is expected to cure more people in 12 weeks and would compete more favorably with rival treatments. The U.S. marketing application for the company's three-drug combination is expected to be filed next year.Shares of Bristol-Myers were little changed in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

130,"   By Brendan Pierson  Dec 10 Philadelphia's transportation authority has filed a class action lawsuit accusing Gilead Sciences Inc  of charging ""exorbitant"" prices for its blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi.The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in Philadelphia by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, seeks an unspecified amount of money damages.Sovaldi, a highly effective treatment for hepatitis C, costs $1,000 per pill in the United States, or $84,000 for a typical 12-week course. The drug sells for much less in some other countries. The lawsuit claims that Gilead's pricing is an abuse of its patent monopoly on the drug and violates federal antitrust laws.Gilead's ""limited rights as a patent holder do not translate into a license to price gouge consumers,"" the lawsuit said. The transportation authority, which said it has paid more than $2.4 million for Sovaldi for its employees, is seeking to represent a class of everyone in the United States who has paid for Sovaldi or has not been able to afford needed Sovaldi treatment. Sovaldi has brought in more than $8.5 billion for Gilead in the first three quarters of 2014, just under half the company's total sales.Gilead did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The case is Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v.

131,"  U.S. health regulators on Friday approved AbbVie's all-oral treatment for hepatitis C, providing the first competition for Gilead Sciences huge selling and expensive medicine for the liver-destroying virus.The AbbVie regimen consists of four different anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen, which will be sold under the brand name Viekira Pak, for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common  type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat.  Gilead's Sovaldi, which was approved a year ago, had been selling at the rate of about $3 billion per quarter due to huge pent up demand. Sovaldi is now combined with another Gilead drug and sold as Harvoni, which is taken as one pill once a day for  12 weeks at a cost of about $94,500. Some patients can take it for just eight weeks, which costs about $63,000. The AbbVie regimen has demonstrated similarly impressive efficacy to Gilead's, with cure rates above 90 percent, and minimal negative side effects.  But Gilead, which has come under intense pressure from U.S. health insurers, politicians and pharmacy benefit managers over the high cost of its treatment, is widely expected to dominate the market, given its convenience advantage of fewer pills and  drugs, unless AbbVie undercuts Harvoni on pricing.AbbVie did not immediately announce the price of its treatment. The AbbVie treatment is awaiting a European approval decision expected in the first quarter of 2015 after an advisory committee gave it a positive recommendation.Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and at least 130 million people worldwide, is a progressive viral disease that if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure, cancer or need for at transplant. The new all-oral treatment options eliminate the need for injectable interferon, for years a mainstay of heptatitis C therapy, but one that caused miserable side effects, such as flu-like symptoms.

135,"  (Adds price for 12-week treatment)By Caroline HumerDec 19 U.S. health regulators on Friday approved AbbVie's all-oral treatment for hepatitis C, and the company said the drug would cost $83,319 for a typical 12-week plan, a bit below its huge selling competitor Solvadi from Gilead Sciences.Gilead's Sovaldi treatment stole headlines last year with its $84,000 price tag and set off a national debate about whether drug prices have climbed too high.AbbVie's newly approved regimen is also less costly than  Gilead's newest one-pill regimen that combines Sovaldi with another drug and costs $94,500 for 12 weeks. With Gilead's newly improved Harvoni, some patients can take the treatment for just eight weeks, which sells for about $63,000.Some insurers and analysts had said that AbbVie might price its drug, which will be sold under the brand name Viekira Pak,  lower than Gilead because of pricing pressure.Gilead has come under intense pressure from U.S. health insurers, politicians and pharmacy benefit managers over the high cost of Sovaldi and more recently, Harvoni. It argues the price is justified because the treatment cures nearly all patients of the liver-destroying virus. An AbbVie spokeswoman said the company considered many factors in setting the price such as the cost effectiveness of the treatment and its value in offsetting other short and long term costs.The AbbVie regimen consists of four different anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat. It was not immediately clear how the AbbVie pricing would impact Harvoni sales, which is widely expected to dominate the market given its advantage of fewer pills.Gilead's Sovaldi, which was approved a year ago, had been selling at the rate of about $3 billion per quarter due to huge pent up demand.The AbbVie regimen has demonstrated similar efficacy to Gilead's, with cure rates of 95 to 100 percent, the company said, and minimal negative side effects.

136,"   By Caroline Humer  The largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager said on Monday it has lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount.Express Scripts' move reignited investor concerns that pharmaceutical companies will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.Gilead shares dropped 13 percent, or about $14.54, in Monday trading to $93.88, though it was still far above the $65 level reached in April, when insurers launched a major outcry over its multibillion-dollar hepatitis C business. Shares in major biotechnology companies such as Amgen, Biogen and Celgene fell more than 2 percent.Express Scripts opposed the $84,000 price tag of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi treatment since its approval a year ago. It said the $1,000-a-day pill, shown to cure hepatitis C in most patients, was unaffordable.Private insurers generally receive discounts of as much as 20 percent, but Gilead has resisted, bringing in $3 billion in quarterly revenue for Sovaldi this year. The company maintains that Sovaldi, and a next-generation version called Harvoni that was approved in October, will save the U.S. healthcare system the costs of caring for advanced liver disease in many patients.Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller said on Monday in an e-mailed statement that the company is continuing to negotiate with Express Scripts.AbbVie's Viekira Pak drug was approved on Friday by U.S. regulators and the company set a list price of $83,319. But it has agreed to a significantly lower price than Gilead for Express Scripts' National Preferred Formulary, a list of approved and covered drugs for 25 million Americans, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview.""This is unprecedented,"" Miller said, explaining that the pricing on specialty drugs of this type tend to be much closer even when a competitor enters the market. He did not provide a specific dollar figure, but said AbbVie had narrowed the price gap to resemble what Western European countries pay for  Sovaldi, which runs from $51,373 in France to $66,000 in Germany. WIDENING TREATMENT An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States have hepatitis C. Most insurance plans have paid for Gilead's drugs only for patients with advanced liver disease to limit their exposure to its cost. Express Scripts said the AbbVie agreement will allow it to extend treatment to all hepatitis C patients. Dr. Camilla Graham, co-director of the viral hepatitis center at Beth Israel Deaconess medical center in Boston, said she is hopeful other insurers will follow suit. ""My first thought when I saw this was 'Finally, we have a solution to this public health crisis,'"" Graham said. A significant portion of patients with hepatitis C receive medical care through government-paid programs, including Medicare for the elderly and disabled, Medicaid for the poor and the U.S. Department of Defense.State Medicaid agencies have also limited access to Gilead's Sovaldi, saying it is too expensive even after they receive a legally mandated 23 percent discount.Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said he is ""hopeful but cautious"" about the state agencies' ability to extract further rebates on top of the discount from Gilead and AbbVie.America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry's largest lobbying group, also hopes to see Gilead's prices drop now that there is competition in the market, said spokesman Brendan Buck.  EXCEPTIONS MADE FOR SOVALDI The AbbVie regimen consists of a cocktail of anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The regimen requires some patients also to take ribavirin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat.Express Scripts said starting Jan. 1, 2015, it would pay for the AbbVie drug only for patients who have genotype 1. Express Scripts will no longer cover Gilead's Harvoni, a one-pill treatment for patients with genotype 1 that costs $94,500 for a 12-week course. It will cover Sovaldi in cases where patients have other types of the disease. The AbbVie regimen is also not recommended for patients whose livers are not functioning and in people who have not benefited from using older treatments. An Express Scripts spokesman said the company will make exceptions for those patients to allow them to take Gilead's medications.Mario Molina, chief executive officer of Molina Healthcare Inc., a small Medicaid insurer in California that has criticized Gilead's high prices, said on Monday that he sees more competition on drug prices ahead.""I think that this is the beginning,"" Molina said, describing the move as ""a harbinger of things to come.""

U.S. stocks inched up, but some profit-taking after the S&P 500's best weekly performance in nearly two months capped gains. Anticipation of outright government bond buying from the European Central Bank and greater political stability in Greece boosted European bourses.

142,"   By Caroline Humer  (Story refiles to correct typographical error in first paragraph to Sovaldi instead of Solvadi)U.S. health regulators on Friday approved AbbVie's all-oral treatment for hepatitis C, and the company said the drug would cost $83,319 for a typical 12-week plan, a bit below its huge selling competitor Sovaldi from Gilead Sciences.Gilead's Sovaldi treatment stole headlines last year with its $84,000 price tag and set off a national debate about whether drug prices have climbed too high.AbbVie's newly approved regimen is also less costly than  Gilead's newest one-pill regimen that combines Sovaldi with another drug and costs $94,500 for 12 weeks.With Gilead's newly improved Harvoni, some patients can take the treatment for just eight weeks, which sells for about $63,000.  Some insurers and analysts had said that AbbVie might price its drug, which will be sold under the brand name Viekira Pak,  lower than Gilead because of pricing pressure.Gilead has come under intense pressure from U.S. health insurers, politicians and pharmacy benefit managers over the high cost of Sovaldi and more recently, Harvoni. It argues the price is justified because the treatment cures nearly all patients of the liver-destroying virus.An AbbVie spokeswoman said the company considered many factors in setting the price such as the cost effectiveness of the treatment and its value in offsetting other short and long term costs. The AbbVie regimen consists of four different anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat. It was not immediately clear how the AbbVie pricing would impact Harvoni sales, which is widely expected to dominate the market given its advantage of fewer pills. Gilead's Sovaldi, which was approved a year ago, had been selling at the rate of about $3 billion per quarter due to huge pent up demand. The AbbVie regimen has demonstrated similar efficacy to Gilead's, with cure rates of 95 to 100 percent, the company said, and minimal negative side effects. AbbVie said that 95 percent of patients will require a 12 week treatment. Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc, which helped develop the Abbvie drug, saw its shares rise 4.2 percent in after-hours trading while AbbVie's shares gained 1.1 percent.

145,"   By Natalie Grover  Data from Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc's hepatitis C drug trials showed the company could develop a shorter-duration treatment rivaling offerings from Gilead Sciences Inc and Abbvie Inc.The company said on Monday it would test a combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C drugs after they showed promise against the virus in separate studies.The biotechnology company's shares rose as much as 17 percent to $16.77, their highest in more than seven years.Data from the first study, testing a combination of Achillion's NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, and Gilead's blockbuster Sovaldi, showed signs that the virus disappeared within four weeks, following a six-week course of therapy.  Gilead's Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with the company's own NS5A inhibitor, achieves this response only after eight weeks of therapy.The main goal of Achillion's ongoing mid-stage study is to achieve a sustained virological response 12 weeks after therapy that would constitute a cure.The market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightening pace in recent years, with several companies working on producing newer drugs to treat the disease that affects about 150 million around the world. The U.S. health regulator on Friday approved Abbvie's hep C cocktail.  In a separate early-stage study, Achillion's nucleotide inhibitor, ACH-3422, also demonstrated potent antiviral activity.William Blair's Katherine Xu said the company's ACH-3422 was slower to exert its effects than Sovaldi, adding that its nucleotide inhibitor needs to be equally effective for Achillion to attract takeover interest. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C drugs independently, said it planned to start mid-stage studies to evaluate the combination next year.Wells Fargo's Brian Abrahams said an all-Achillion combination could still have an edge over competition as ACH-3102's high barrier to resistance will offset ACH-3422's slower effect.

147,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year.On Monday, Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's   rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. [ID: nL1N0U61N4]The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead, and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players, including Amgen Inc and Biogen Inc, will face steeper U.S. pricing pressure from insurers. Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products, such as Shire Plc, Novo Nordisk and Theravance Inc , may also be particularly vulnerable, analysts said. Neither Shire, Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment.Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won't cover for 2016, including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension and arthritis, said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller, in an interview earlier this month. In some cases, Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field, he said. The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U.S. market.Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014, with 44 medications, and increased that number to 66 for 2015.The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts' biggest ""formulary"" list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices, Miller said.Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs, and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than $1 billion in annual spending, Miller said.Employers ""are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk,"" Miller said. ""We are going to be opportunistic"" in looking for savings in the future.Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading to $92.90. Shares in Amgen, Biogen and Celgene CELG.O fell more than 2 percent. CVS HEALTH The second largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, CVS Health Corp, has said it will exclude 95 prescription products from its reimbursement list next year, up from 72 in 2014. It expects the practice will save its plan sponsors over $3.5 billion between 2012 and 2015.The drugs most under scrutiny include more expensive, ""me-too"" products, in categories where several drugmakers compete for similar patients. Both Novo Nordisk and Sanofi SA  are developing slightly longer-lasting insulins.Amgen, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson, respectively sell Enbrel, Humira and Remicade - all rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work in a similar way. Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Actavis want to switch patients to more expensive versions of their multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's drugs, respectively, before the arrival of cheap generic competitors.The effect is already being felt by such Big Pharma players as AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi. Both companies warned recently that the need to offer U.S. price discounts on some of their biggest brand-name medicines will hurt 2015 sales. Insurers are pushing back against prices in other categories, including blood thinners and even HIV drugs and multiple sclerosis treatments, where there are multiple options for doctors and patients, observers said.""The extent of this becoming a broader problem is tied to whether we get great new drugs for things like asthma, (high cholesterol), Alzheimer's and cancer,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. ""If there is a limited pool of money and a bunch of new drugs, the pressure on older drugs will increase.""DIMINISHING RETURNS In recent years, the introduction of far cheaper generic versions of medicines like Pfizer Inc's Lipitor to reduce cholesterol and Merck & Co's asthma drug Singulair helped insurers save on reimbursement costs. But that wave of patent expiries has slowed considerably.In the meantime, a new crop of novel, and in some cases, highly effective treatments for cancer and hepatitis C are costing them tens of billions of dollars more to reimburse. The influx of generics ""allowed the system to actually see drug price deflation,"" said Asher Anolic, manager of Fidelity's Select Pharmaceuticals Portfolio.

158,"  Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc closed down 6 percent on Tuesday, after a pharmacy benefit manager said it would cover both Gilead and rival AbbVie Inc's hepatitis C offering, renewing concerns of pricing pressure.Investors interpreted this as further discounting of hep C drugs, signaled by an increasing willingness by drugmakers to offer rebates, Sanford Bernstein's Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note.Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, dropped Gilead's hep C drugs in December in favor of AbbVie's newly approved alternative at a cheaper price.Meanwhile, CVS Health Corp, the second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, and health insurer Anthem Inc inked deals with Gilead to cover Harvoni.On Monday, St. Paul, Minnesota-based pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC, which serves over 25 million people, said it would cover both Gilead's Harvoni and AbbVie's Viekira Pak.  ""There has been a substantial reduction in the net price of both of these drugs just in the past few weeks, so sometimes it pays not to go first,"" said Peter Wickersham, Prime's senior vice president of Integrated Care and Specialty.While exact rebate rates will unlikely be disclosed we would hesitate to read too much into the claims from Prime, and we do not believe they alter expectations about hep C pricing, Porges said. ""It is possible that neither Gilead nor AbbVie felt the need to offer a deep rebate to Prime for exclusivity.""Prime is not known for exclusionary formularies in contrast with CVS and Express Scripts, and consequently, both drugmakers may have been less pressured with Prime than they were with CVS and Express Scripts, he said.

159,"   By Susan Kelly and Bill Berkrot  Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, on Tuesday said cost savings on expensive cancer treatments could be achieved if the company were involved earlier in the decision-making process. Express Scripts, which has become more aggressive in negotiating discounts on drugs for insurance plans and employers, in December stopped covering Gilead Sciences Inc's hepatitis C treatments after lining up a cheaper price for AbbVie's newly-approved alternative.Gilead's Sovaldi and follow-up combination pill Harvoni have been shown to cure hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients. But Express deemed the more than $90,000 price for 12 weeks of Harvoni treatment unaffordable. The move reignited investor concerns that drugmakers will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.For cancer patients, treatment decisions typically go through health insurance plans first, and medicines are not changed once people have begun their regimens, Express Scripts Chief Executive George Paz said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. He said PBMs should be included in the decision-making process at a much earlier stage.   ""The big opportunity out there is really in cancer,"" Paz said. ""If we can get out in front of that, that is a huge opportunity."" Paz said he is also focused on a new crop of cholesterol-lowering drugs expected to hit the market this year, and is talking to companies about market share, positioning and pricing. ""They are pretty astonishing, but they are also very expensive,"" Paz said of the drugs which target a protein known as PCSK9. Manufacturers include Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi. The key is to determine which are real breakthrough treatments and which are “me too” drugs, Paz said.Amgen said it was talking to payers about its evolocumab, and believes they can only exclude a drug from formularies if there is no clinical difference between rival medicines.""If not, payers will have to leave choices to physicians,"" said Tony Hooper, Amgen's head of commercial operations. Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Len Schleifer was asked if he was concerned about Paz's comments that PCSK9 drugs were in his sights.""It's not a worry. It's a reality that we will deal with,"" Schleifer said. ""I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace.""

Amgen said it was talking to payers about its evolocumab, and believes they can only exclude a drug from formularies if there is no clinical difference between rival medicines.""If not, payers will have to leave choices to physicians,"" said Tony Hooper, Amgen's head of commercial operations.Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Len Schleifer was asked if he was concerned about Paz's comments that PCSK9 drugs were in his sights.""It's not a worry. It's a reality that we will deal with,"" Schleifer said. ""I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace.""

161,"   By Sumeet Chatterjee | MUMBAI  MUMBAI India's patent office has rejected an application from U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc for its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, paving the way for local drugmakers to launch cheaper generic versions of the $1,000-a-pill medicine.The application had been opposed by Indian generic drugmaker Natco Pharma Ltd and New York-based Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK) on the grounds that the drug, chemically called sofosbuvir, is not inventive enough compared with a previous formulation, according to patent office order documents seen by Reuters on Wednesday.India's patent laws allow a third party to dispute the validity of a pending patent application.The patent office's order said Gilead's request for Sovaldi, which is normally given for either three or six months and costs $84,000 for a 12-week course in the United States, was rejected on the basis that ""minor changes in the molecule"" did not improve efficacy of the drug. The rejection will allow the Indian generic companies to make and sell versions of the drug in country where a majority of people live on less than $2 a day and health insurance is scarce.Gilead could not immediately be reached for comment. Natco Chief Executive Rajeev Nannapaneni was not available outside regular Indian business hours.Foreign drugmakers in India, a global hub for making generic drugs, have been frustrated by a series of decisions on patents and pricing, with the government looking to improve healthcare access. Market access and patent protection for U.S. drugs are expected to feature when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosts President Barack Obama later this month for India's annual Republic Day celebrations.The patent office's order comes amid a growing clamor by healthcare campaigners and doctors to ensure Sovaldi and other new hepatitis C pills are affordable in developing countries. In a bid to make Sovaldi available in 91 developing nations including in India, Gilead licensed the drug, hailed by doctors as a breakthrough in treating the liver-destroying disease, to seven India-based drugmakers in April last year.Campaigners, however, were critical of the licensing deals, saying they would not ensure access to several middle-income countries where health authorities would still struggle to provide treatment to patients.

163,"   By Caroline Humer  Kite Pharma Inc plans to open conversations with insurers this year to lay the groundwork for an experimental cancer treatment that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars if it works and is approved by regulators, top executives said this week.The possible treatment has yet to start a broad clinical trial, but the urgency comes as biotech and pharma companies consider how to navigate pushback by health insurers against Gilead Sciences Inc on the price of its hepatitis C treatment.""We learn from mistakes,"" Kite Chief Executive Officer Arie Belldegrun said in an interview at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference when asked how it would garner support for an immunotherapy cancer treatment that may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.Such treatments are in early development but are being closely watched as they could offer substantially higher cure rates than current cancer regimens. Insurer pushback on drug prices hit its stride in December when AbbVie Inc. introduced a competitor to Gilead and the nation's largest benefit manager Express Scripts dropped coverage of Gilead's drug on its largest pharmacy plan covering 25 million people. Gilead, which charges less for the treatment outside of the United States, has since been dropping its price, according to Wall Street analysts. When asked at the conference about analyst reports that it had cut its price by 30 percent, Gilead did not comment. Kite will soon begin a broad clinical trial on the immunotherapy cancer treatment in which cells are drawn from a person, sent to the lab to be treated, and then reintroduced into the individual's bloodstream. The trial is due to be completed by the second half of 2016.Kite Chief Financial Officer Cynthia Butitta said that its financial models set a base case price at $150,000 per treatment, but that the actual price will depend more on survival rates and the drug's efficacy. Analysts have estimated the costs at up to $300,000 per treatment. The company's new marketing head starts next month and will begin conversations with insurers about the trials and the treatment's possible benefits. ""We're starting that effort this year,"" Butitta said.Kite, which recently signed a collaboration deal with Amgen Inc is one of several companies developing this type of immunotherapy cancer treatment along with Novartis AG, BlueBird Bio Inc and Juno Therapeutics Inc.

164,"   By Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot  Aetna Inc, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said it negotiated a discount with Gilead Sciences Inc for its hepatitis C treatment and will offer it as the preferred choice to nearly 11 million commercial customers.Aetna, which posted an updated coverage policy on its website on Friday, said it believes the price it received for Gilead's Sovaldi, and a newer combination treatment called Harvoni, is ""competitive with other recently announced agreements for this class of therapy."" It would not detail the size of the discount. Gilead shares closed up 3.4 percent at $100.71 after the Aetna deal was announced. Aetna shares closed 2.3 percent higher at $92.56.    Aetna and other insurers have pushed back against the high price of new hepatitis C treatments and other drugs, questioning their affordability after Gilead's Sovaldi was priced at $84,000 per treatment when it became the first new all-oral treatment to reach the market in late 2013. U.S. health regulators late last month approved Viekira Pak from AbbVie Inc, the first competitor to Gilead's drugs. Within a few days, Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, dropped coverage of Gilead's treatments in most cases in favor of the AbbVie therapy, citing a substantial discount.  Both breakthrough treatments for the first time can cure the liver-wasting disease in more than 90 percent of patients without the miserable side effects of older medicines. More than 3 million people in the United States are estimated to have hepatitis C.Since Express Scripts' move, insurers have pressed both AbbVie and Gilead for discounts on their hepatitis C treatments to keep them on reimbursement lists. CVS Health, Anthem and Humana chose Gilead drugs as their preferred treatment, while pharmacy benefits company Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list.Wall Street analysts estimate the drugmakers have provided discounts of 30 percent or more.

174,"   By Caroline Humer  UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, on Wednesday backed Gilead Sciences Inc's Harvoni as the preferred hepatitis C treatment on its 2015 commercial drug coverage list, another victory for Gilead over competitor AbbVie Inc.Gilead and AbbVie have been battling for hepatitis C market share since the approval in December for an AbbVie drug that challenges Gilead's blockbusters. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been striking deals for preferred or exclusive status in exchange for discounts for 2015.UnitedHealth's drug coverage list, which is effective Feb. 1, applies to all of the company's commercial, fully insured customers who use its Optum RX pharmacy benefit manager and self-insured customers such as large employers who follow the drug list.The update to the formulary, available on the company's website, also applies to its Medicaid, Medicare and military contracts. ""We are constantly working to deliver value and manage costs for customers and consumers throughout our business,"" UnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason said in a statement. Gilead declined to comment. Gilead set off a firestorm last year when it launched a breakthrough treatment for hepatitis C called Sovaldi that carries an $84,000-per-treatment price tag.Insurers, including UnitedHealth, were taken by surprise by its cost and called it out as an unexpected hit to profits last year.  Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, pushed back against the price of Sovaldi and Gilead's follow-up drug Harvoni, which has a list price of $93,400. It backed AbbVie's Viekira Pak, saying it had gotten a significant discount.Analysts and investors say the treatments are being discounted by at least 30 percent. The companies have declined to comment.UnitedHealth is the last of the top three U.S. insurers to strike a deal with either Gilead or AbbVie.

175,"  (Adds background on other insurers)By Caroline HumerJan 28 UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, on Wednesday backed Gilead Sciences Inc's Harvoni as the preferred hepatitis C treatment on its 2015 commercial drug coverage list, another victory for Gilead over competitor AbbVie Inc.Gilead and AbbVie have been battling for hepatitis C market share since the approval in December for an AbbVie drug that challenges Gilead's blockbusters. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been striking deals for preferred or exclusive status in exchange for discounts for 2015.UnitedHealth's drug coverage list, which is effective Feb. 1, applies to all of the company's commercial, fully insured customers who use its Optum RX pharmacy benefit manager and self-insured customers such as large employers who follow the drug list.The update to the formulary, available on the company's website, also applies to its Medicaid, Medicare and military contracts. ""We are constantly working to deliver value and manage costs for customers and consumers throughout our business,"" UnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason said in a statement.Gilead declined to comment.Gilead set off a firestorm last year when it launched a breakthrough treatment for hepatitis C called Sovaldi that carries an $84,000-per-treatment price tag. Insurers, including UnitedHealth, were taken by surprise by its cost and called it out as an unexpected hit to profits last year.Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, pushed back against the price of Sovaldi and Gilead's follow-up drug Harvoni, which has a list price of $93,400. It backed AbbVie's Viekira Pak, saying it had gotten a significant discount. Analysts and investors say the treatments are being discounted by at least 30 percent. The companies have declined to comment.UnitedHealth is the last of the top three U.S. insurers to strike a deal with either Gilead or AbbVie. Reuters reported two weeks ago that Aetna Inc had backed Gilead, as have Anthem Inc and Humana Inc.

More than half of all U.S. managed care lives are now under contract, Gonzalez estimated. He said AbbVie was working on several contracts expected to be finalized within 30 days.""Up to this point we are pleased with our formulary position and we believe we have the potential to capture meaningful share of the U.S. HCV market,"" he added.Analysts have estimated that discounts offered for preferred drug status have exceeded 30 percent off list price.

Aetna said the increased outlook was also due to momentum in its business early in the year after a strong finish to 2014. It boosted its full-year operating earnings forecast to at least $7.00 per share, up from $6.90. Aetna also reported quarterly profit in line with estimates.The stock rose more than 1 percent.Aetna reported an improved medical benefit ratio of 83 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with 83.9 percent a year earlier. The ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums.The company said the costs of medical care have remained moderate and that it expects its medical benefit ratio to be between 82 percent and 83 percent. Its comments on spending were in line with larger competitors UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N). The company said the medical benefit ratio for commercial plans, its largest business, deteriorated to 82 percent from 81.7 percent, due to higher-than-expected medical costs in small businesses and expenses associated with the new hepatitis C treatments.Last year Aetna was among insurance companies and other payers who said that the $84,000 cost per treatment for Gilead's new hepatitis C drug, which hit the market late in 2013, was unaffordable. When AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) launched a competing drug at the end of 2014, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and others started negotiating for discounts from Gilead.

192,"   By Natalie Grover  Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc's experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment.Achillion's shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor's hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead's and AbbVie Inc's current therapies.The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally.The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or ""nuke"" and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead's case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options.Gilead's regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the ""nuke"", needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. AbbVie's three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks.Achillion's ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy. The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday's data shows Achillion's NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said.The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair's Katherine Xu said. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet.The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank's Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount.Harvoni's list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.

203,"  * Natco says deal covers 91 developing nations* Natco to pay Gilead royalties on sales of drugs   (Adds comments from Delhi Network of Positive People, BDR Pharma MD, stock price)MUMBAI, March 2 India's Natco Pharma Ltd  said on Monday it has agreed a deal with Gilead Sciences Inc to supply generic copies of the U.S. drugmaker's chronic hepatitis C medicines, including $1,000-a-pill drug Sovaldi, in 91 developing nations.Natco, a mid-sized player in India's crowded pharmaceutical industry, is the latest generic drugmaker to team up with Gilead on Sovaldi, having previously attempted to block the U.S. firm from getting a patent for the breakthrough drug in India in the hope of producing a cheaper version on its own. In September, Gilead announced similar licensing deals with seven other generic drugmakers.Sovaldi, chemically known as sofosbuvir, is a far more effective and better-tolerated treatment than older injection products, and racked up $1.7 billion in sales for Gilead in the fourth quarter alone.But the firm has come under fire over the drug's price tag, its cost presenting a huge barrier in poorer countries. About 150 million people in the world live with chronic hepatitis C infection, most of them in low- and middle-income countries. Drugs under the deal with Natco include sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), a combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir - a follow-on drug called Harvoni - and a treatment known as GS-5816, which is in late-stage clinical trials, Natco said in a statement.As with the other deals, Natco will fix its own price for the generic versions, and will pay a royalty on sales to Gilead.Natco had earlier joined the New York-based Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK), the Delhi Network of Positive People, and privately-held BDR Pharmaceuticals International Ltd in filing opposition to a patent on Sovaldi in India. A Natco spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking further details on the deal announced on Monday.In early reactions, some of those who had opposed a patent for Sovaldi said the Natco deal hadn't altered their position. ""We do not think this weakens our case. The drug's prices may be low under the deals, but they can be much lower without a patent, so we will continue to oppose it,"" said Vikas Ahuja, President of the Delhi Network of Positive People.BDR Pharma Managing Director Dharmesh Shah declined to comment on Natco's Gilead deal, but said he was not seeking a similar contract.Natco shares were up 3 percent at 0837 GMT on Monday, while the wider Mumbai market was down 0.2 percent.(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Kenneth Maxwell)",2015-03-02,GILD,"Mon Mar 2, 2015 | 3:47am EST",UPDATE 1-India's Natco Pharma ties up with Gilead on hepatitis C drugs,http://www.reuters.com//article/natco-pharma-gilead-sciences-deals-idUSL4N0W42NA20150302?type=companyNews

Equity market gains ebbed and flowed, tracking the behavior of energy stocks as crude oil prices were caught between the weakness in the U.S. dollar and concerns about oversupply. The S&P 500 energy sector was up 0.1 percent after earlier gaining as much as 0.9 percent.The action in the dollar has closely affected stocks of late as traders anticipate monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve some time later this year. The 20-day correlation between the dollar index and the S&P 500 sits at -0.79. The dollar index was down 0.9 percent on the day.The recent dollar strength ""is probably already at the point where it is going to have a significant impact to earnings,"" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. While the dollar's rise has been beneficial for consumers, its rapid strengthening has been a problem for a large portion of the market, such as commodities firms and exporters.""Given what is going on with commodity prices and what is going on with energy prices, if anything the inflation news is getting better, not worse,"" said Massocca.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62.07 points, or 0.34 percent, to 18,189.72, the S&P 500 gained 3.81 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,111.91 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 0.37 points, or 0.01 percent, to 5,026.05.

211,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Gilead Sciences is seeking to convince governments and multilateral agencies worldwide that hepatitis C can be eliminated with a demonstration project in Georgia offering free drugs to all those who need them.The unprecedented program will make the Caucasian country a testbed for uprooting the liver-destroying disease, using Gilead's highly effective but costly pill Sovaldi, plus its newer product Harvoni once approved.Georgia has the world's third highest prevalence of hepatitis C, after Egypt and Mongolia, with nearly 7 percent of adults carrying the virus. It also has a wide range of viral variations and different types of patients.What is more, the country is a manageable size, with a population of around 5 million, and has viral screening systems, making it ideal for scientific study, according to Gregg Alton, the U.S. drugmaker's head of corporate and medical affairs. ""It is a nice country for us to evaluate,"" he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday from the European Association for the Study of the Liver annual meeting in Vienna.The scheme, which has the backing of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will cover an initial 5,000 patients in 2015, with a second phase treating up to 20,000 a year.Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, and rival products from the likes of AbbVie, can cure hepatitis C but are out of reach at Western prices to patients in poor countries, with a single Sovaldi pill costing $1,000 in the United States. While Gilead has slashed the price for several low-income countries to $300 per bottle of 28 pills, it also wants to involve international donors in a broad eradication drive.""We will take the Georgia data to other countries around the world to really make the case that investment can fundamentally change the disease over time,"" Alton said. Alton admits the scheme may prompt other governments to ask for free drugs as well, but he said it was unrealistic to simply give away product globally. Instead, he wants to see international funding along the lines of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.""Gilead cannot cure hepatitis C globally on our backs alone. There have to be other players that come in and make that investment,"" he said.

212,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Sinead Carew | NEW YORK, April 24  NEW YORK, April 24 Healthcare companies on a seven-year tear have been top performers so far in 2015, helping to push broad stock indexes to record levels, but traders are now looking to protect themselves from a selloff as they await major earnings reports in the sector.Companies reporting first-quarter earnings next week include Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co, Boston Scientific Corp , Merck & Co, Pfizer Inc, Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp.So far, companies that have reported in this sector have seen positive moves in share prices, and many investors say they think healthcare stocks have room to run.But options traders are not taking chances. Options on a key healthcare exchange-traded fund (ETF) are set near their most defensive posture ever.So far this year, the S&P healthcare sector index  has risen 8.7 percent, leading all other S&P sector indexes. Since 2008, it has increased 179 percent while the broader S&P 500 is up 135 percent. On Thursday, healthcare's strong performance helped push the S&P 500 to an intraday record and the Nasdaq composite index to its all-time closing high.Investors have been drawn to healthcare stocks by a spate of mergers and expectations for more buyouts on top of major drug launches and strong demand from an aging population. ""It's kind of tough to punch holes into the healthcare bull story,"" said Sven Borho, founding general partner at health specialist fund OrbiMed Advisors LLC, in New York.""What worries me is the long stretch of outperformance relative to the rest of the market,"" he said. Even so, ""it's not that healthcare valuations broadly have gone off the roof.""The sector is trading at 18.8 times earnings estimates for the year ahead compared to S&P's P/E ratio of 17.5. Traders in the options market, however, are preparing for possible downside. Activity in puts, which can be used to hedge against a drop in shares, has picked up noticeably in April for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF.The average daily puts volume has risen to 16,000, from 9,000 for the first three months of 2015. For every call option, usually used for bullish bets, there are 4.6 put options open, the highest ratio since early 2007, right after their launch, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.""It's really just a function of investors looking to protect their gains,"" said Max Breier, senior equity derivatives trader at BMO Capital Markets. ""In a market cap-weighted ETF like the XLV, if you get a number of the top-weighted names kind of disappointing at once you can get a pretty violent reaction,"" Breier said. Companies reporting next week include Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co, Boston Scientific Corp, Merck & Co, Pfizer Inc, Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp.Medical device maker Boston Scientific is the second-best S&P healthcare performer with a 39-percent share price gain so far this year. The most accurate analysts say it could meet earnings per share estimates for 20.4 cents per share or miss by a thread, according to StarMine.Gilead could beat analysts' $2.30 EPS estimate by over 22 cents while Bristol-Meyers and Celgene could beat their EPS estimates by about a penny, according to StarMine.Shares are more likely to react to comments about drug studies or pricing than to results, Borho said.Wall Street analysts expect the S&P healthcare sector to report a 10.2 percent first-quarter earnings increase, compared with 7.2 percent expected on April 1 and 12.4 percent in October, Reuters data showed.Other big events investors will watch next week include  first-quarter GDP numbers and the Federal Reserve's statement after its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Apple Inc  reports earnings on Monday afternoon in a week when oil companies are expected to report grim results.

213,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Gilead Sciences Inc on Thursday said its quarterly profit nearly doubled, driven by strong sales of its hepatitis C drugs, as it topped Wall Street estimates.Gilead signaled that, with its hepatitis C franchise established, it is a good time for the company to consider business development opportunities. ""We want to stick very closely to therapeutic areas we are in today,"" Gilead Chief Operating Officer John Milligan said on a conference call.Excluding items, Gilead earned $2.94 per share in the first quarter, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $2.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's shares, which fell 1.8 percent in regular trading, rose 2 percent to $102.52 after hours.Product sales rose 52 percent to $7.41 billion, including $4.55 billion for hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Analysts had expected hepatitis C sales of $3.54 billion, according to Deutsche Bank.""It was an extremely strong quarter,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, noting that the sales guidance ""signals confidence in the year."" Gilead said it now expects full-year product sales of $28 billion to $29 billion, up from a previous estimate of $26 billion to $27 billion.In late 2013, Gilead prompted howls of protest about prescription drug prices when it launched Sovaldi at $1,000 a pill, and later Harvoni at an even higher price. But since AbbVie Inc launched a rival treatment late last year, both have fought for market share by offering rebates to group payers.Gilead said earlier this year that its ""gross-to-net"" adjustment for hepatitis C sales would average 46 percent in 2015. The company declined to revisit that estimate on Thursday. Gilead said more than 70,000 U.S. patients and 20,000 European patients were started on its hepatitis C drugs in the first quarter. Because the drugs cure nearly all patients, the market opportunity is limited.Around 3.3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus, but only about half of them are aware that they are infected. Gilead posted net income of $4.3 billion, or $2.76 per share, up from $2.2 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier.     Cash on hand at the end of the quarter totaled $14.5 billion.""They could pretty much buy anything,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.

226,"   By Brendan Pierson and Adam Jourdan | NEW YORK/SHANGHAI  NEW YORK/SHANGHAI China has rejected a Gilead Sciences Inc patent application related to its costly hepatitis C drug, a U.S. advocacy group said, adding the move may lead to other countries to consider rejecting patents for the controversial treatment.Gilead has drawn fire for the cost of its top-selling drug Sovaldi, priced at $1,000 per pill in the United States or $84,000 for a typical 12-week course and its patents have been challenged in the U.S., India and Europe.The application China has rejected was for a so-called prodrug, the inactive form of the drug which then converts into the chemically active compound once in the body, the New York-based Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK) said.Gilead, however, holds the China patent to the base compound in the drug, also known by its generic name sofosbuvir and  China's rejection of the prodrug patent does not open the way for copycat drugs to be made in the world's No. 2 drug market.China-based officials for Gilead were not immediately available for comment. Emails and calls to Gilead's U.S. offices outside office hours went unanswered. Officials at China's State Intellectual Property Office did not confirm the decision when contacted by Reuters, but a notice posted on the body's website said Gilead's application for ""nucleoside phosphramidates"", a kind of prodrug, had recently been rejected.China's move follows a decision by India's patent office in January to reject Gilead's patent application for Sovaldi, finding it was not inventive enough. Gilead is appealing the ruling. Under pressure to cut prices, the California-based firm agreed last year to make the drug available for lower prices in 91 developing countries.I-MAK has brought legal challenges against Gilead's patents or patent applications in five countries not covered by the agreement: China, Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.Charities in Europe have also challenged Gilead's patent over its prices. The World Health Organization says as many as 150 million people worldwide live with chronic hepatitis C infection, most of them in low and middle-income countries. It recently added Sovaldi to its essential medicines list and urged lower prices, especially in middle income countries.

227,"   By Brendan Pierson | June 19  June 19 China has rejected Gilead Sciences Inc's application for a new patent related to its costly hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, removing a potential barrier to generic versions of the drug there, a U.S. legal group announced on Friday.The New York-based group, Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge, or I-MAK, challenged Gilead's patent application this year as part of its campaign to make generic Sovaldi available in several countries. The group said on Friday it had received notice of the patent application rejection from officials in the China State Intellectual Property Office.I-MAK said it challenged the Gilead patent applications in China and other countries so hepatitis C patients could get cheaper generic versions of the drug. Tahir Amin, I-MAK's director of intellectual property, said the latest decision makes it more likely that advocates may challenge another Gilead drug patent in China that currently prevents the introduction of generic treatments for hepatitis C.The application China has rejected was on a so-called prodrug, a chemical used to activate Sovaldi's active chemical once it is in the body, according to I-MAK. Gilead still has a patent in China on sofosbuvir, the main ingredient of Sovaldi, a highly effective treatment for hepatitis C which costs $1,000 per pill in the United States. That adds up to $84,000 for a typical 12-week course.California-based Gilead agreed last year to make the drug available for lower prices in 91 developing countries, although I-MAK has said that more than 59 million low-income hepatitis C patients worldwide are still without access to the drug. In May I-MAK said it had brought legal challenges against Gilead's patents or patent applications in five countries not covered by the agreement: China, Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine.Amin said he believed the decision by China's patent office to reject the prodrug patent application would encourage challenges to the sofosbuvir patent as well. If that patent were invalidated, he said, it would open the door for Chinese companies to sell generic Sovaldi, as well as to supply raw materials for the drug to manufacturers in other countries.In January, India's patent office refused to grant Gilead a patent on Sovaldi, finding it was not inventive enough. Gilead is appealing the ruling.Last month, the United Nations' World Health Organization added Sovaldi to its essential medicines list and urged lower prices, especially in middle income countries.

236,"  (Adds details, analyst comments)By Natalie GroverSept 21 Gilead Sciences Inc is edging closer to the approval of the first drug to fight all forms of hepatitis C as the drugmaker's experimental combination showed high rates of effectiveness in four late-stage studies.The trials were evaluating a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of the drugmaker's approved hep C blockbuster, Sovaldi, with experimental NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir.The combination is Gilead's second single-tablet treatment for the viral infection. Harvoni, its approved drug, targets the most common form - genotype 1 infections.The main goal of each trial testing the experimental combination was to achieve a cure 12 weeks after the completion of therapy.Of the 1,053 patients treated with the drug for 12 weeks in three trials, 98 percent were cured. Data from the fourth trial, in more advanced and weaker patients, showed higher cure rates when patients also received ribavirin, an older antiviral.Treatment-related side effects caused the death of nine patients in the trial, the company said.The combination reduces the need for genotyping and potential confusion about which regimen works in which patients, UBS AG's Matthew Roden said. Gilead's twin blockbuster hep C offerings, Sovaldi and Harvoni, brought in combined sales of about $4.9 billion last quarter.Harvoni is expected to remain the treatment of choice in genotype 1, given it is taken for eight weeks, JP Morgan's Cory Casimov said.Gilead's Sovaldi/velpatasvir combination demonstrated significant cure rates after 12 weeks. William Blair's John Sonnier said the combination along with Gilead's GS-9857 could decrease treatment to six weeks while maintaining pan-genotypic potency.In July, the FDA approved two new treatments for less common forms of hep C - AbbVie Inc's Technivie for genotype 4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Daklinza for genotype 3.""A single, pan-genotypic approach may be particularly attractive in regions outside the United States where genotyping is less routine (or not possible),"" Casimov said.The Sovaldi/velpatasvir combination bodes well for Gilead to penetrate markets outside the United States, where non-genotype 1 hep C is more prevalent, Sonnier added.The Foster City, California-based drugmaker plans to file marketing applications for the combination by the fourth quarter.The company's stock, however, fell 2 percent after Hillary Clinton said she will propose a plan to take on specialty drug price gouging.

240,"   By Sinead Carew | Sept 29  Sept 29 A seven-day selloff of U.S. biotechnology stocks has hit sector investors - especially hedge funds - hard. But some managers say it was overdone and are already eyeing bargains such as Gilead Sciences Inc and Amgen Inc.The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has fallen 18.7 percent over the last seven sessions as investors took flight after Hillary Clinton, front-runner to be the Democratic nominee in next year's U.S. presidential election, vowed on Sept. 21 to take steps to curb high drug prices. Since its July 20 high, the index has fallen around 27 percent.The selloff was exacerbated by general market volatility as investors have been grappling with uncertainty about when policy makers will raise U.S. interest rates and concerns over the global economy.Biotech stocks, which had risen 31 percent this year to their July high after annual increases for the last six years, were also in sellers' sights because they had become richly valued. And the selling was intensified as investment managers did not want to issue third quarter reports showing big holdings in a beaten-down sector.""What you're seeing is that generalist money is getting very worried and thinking that maybe the healthcare trade is over and they're rotating into something else,"" said John Fraunces, co-portfolio manager of the $137 million Turner Medical Sciences Long-Short fund in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.Health-focused hedge funds including Baker Brothers Advisors, Healthcor Management, Palo Alto Investors, and Deerfield Management are each nursing losses of more than 10 percent for September based on their publicly disclosed portfolio at the end of June, data calculated by industry tracking firm Symmetric IO show.Symetric data points to broad holdings of specialty biopharmaceutical company Horizon Pharma, which has tumbled 47.3 percent in the last 7 days and which was listed in six hedge fund portfolios. The stock was a big holding for Deerfield, which manages $7.5 billion, for Healthcor, which oversees $2.6 billion, and for Broadfin Capital, which has held the stock for nearly two years. Horizon Pharma's losses also weighed on Iguana Healthcare Management.At the same time, a sharp drop in pharmaceutical company Valeant  weighed on a number of hedge funds, including prominent activists Pershing Square Capital Management and Jana Partners.A lot of selling took place in healthcare ETFs such as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology EFT, which fell almost 19 percent in the last seven days with an average daily trading volume that was 1.6 times higher than its 50 day average. NIBBLES AROUND THE EDGES In the options market, most of the activity was still on the side of expecting further declines, with protective puts outweighing other biotech index trades. But some traders appear to have been snapping up call options in hopes for a sharp rebound, said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global.""People who are in the sector are looking for hedges and people who are not in it are looking for bargains,"" he said. Fraunces has been shorting the ETF, but now he and other investors are already eyeing bargains in the sector. He has been moving money to companies including Horizon Pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest casualties in the biotech sell-off.Some big name stocks, such as Gilead, Amgen, Biogen Inc  and Celgene Corp have sold off sharply enough to make their valuations attractive, according to several investors.Gilead's forward valuation of 8.1 is now less than half its 10-year median of 16.7 and its competitors' average valuations of 14.4. Amgen's forward P/E is 12.5 compared with an average valuation of 16 for its peers. Meanwhile the S&P 500's forward P/E was 15.4 on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data.""That's pretty unusual because the absolute growth rate for those companies is two to three times higher than the S&P,"" said Sven Borho, founding general partner and fund manager at health science investment specialist Orbimed Advisors LLC, in New York.High valuations prompted Seattle-based Smead Capital Management to cut biotech and pharma holdings in its $1.2 billion Smead Value Investor fund in the last 18 months to 16.5 percent from 29 percent, Tony Scherrer, director of research said.But Scherrer, now interested in Amgen and Gilead, described the last week's ETF trading as ""throwing out the baby with the bathwater.""

248,"  Drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the expanded use of its blockbuster hepatitis C drug, Harvoni.The drug can now be used to treat patients with subtypes of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and patients who are co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Gilead said in a statement.The once-daily pill, used in combination with antiviral ribavirin, was also approved to be used for 12 weeks as an alternate therapy to Harvoni alone, which is used for 24 weeks to treat patients with cirrhosis.Results from the study showed that about 93 percent of the patients with subtypes of the virus and 96 percent of patients co-infected with HIV showed a sustained response to the virus within 12 weeks of treatment. Sustained viral response is the term for a successful hepatitis C treatment outcome. It means that hepatitis-C virus is undetectable for 12 or more weeks after the end of treatment.Gilead's blockbuster Harvoni was first approved by the FDA in October 2014. The drug had sales of about $3.3 billion in the latest quarter ended Sept 30. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure.Patients with HCV and HIV co-infection represent about 30 percent of the total HIV-infected population in the United States, Gilead says.

The Gilead drugs represent a vast improvement over prior treatments that had far lower cure rates and many troublesome side effects.

253,"  (Adds details, share reaction, analyst comment)BRUSSELS Dec 17 Belgium's Galapagos  has signed a deal potentially worth more than $2 billion with U.S. firm Gilead to develop a drug targeting inflammatory diseases, reviving a project abandoned by former partner AbbVie.Galapagos will receive a $725 million upfront payment for the development of experimental drug filgotinib, made up of a $300 million licence payment and a $425 million equity investment, the Belgian company said.Under the deal, Gilead will buy a 15 percent stake of Galapagos at 58 euros per share, a 20 percent premium to the average closing price over the past 30 days. On top of the upfront payment, Galapagos may receive up to $1.35 billion from Gilead if targets are met, as well as royalties once the drug enters the market.""In the hands of Gilead, filgotinib has found a strong partner,"" said KBC analyst Jan De Kerpel. ""The deal should also remove doubts investors had on the reason why AbbVie didn't lift the option."" Galapagos shares rose as much as 15 percent to a record 60.55 euros early on Thursday.In September, AbbVie scrapped a development deal with Galapagos for filgotinib, a new class of medicine that blocks an inflammation-causing enzyme known as JAK1, in favour of its own project instead. Founded in 1999, Galapagos has several experimental drugs in clinical trials. Filgotinib is its most advanced candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Filgotinib may start final clinical trials (Phase III) in 2016 pending regulatory approvals, Galapagos said.Belgium has become an important hub for biotech firms, partly because of its lenient tax treatment for international research staff and patents.Galapagos has other research alliances, with Morphosys  and Servier, as well as a development partnership for cystic fibrosis with AbbVie.

Gilead has been harshly criticized by insurers, politicians and patient groups for prices of the two treatments, which can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. The Foster City, California-based company has defended its prices, saying the drugs greatly reduce long-term costs to the healthcare system by preventing liver cancer and the need for liver transplants. Gilead did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Brian Skorney, an analyst at financial services firm Baird, said Merck will likely discount its price by at least 20 percent, due in part to rebates that are required by law to certain government-sponsored healthcare plans.

Gilead, with its two blockbuster drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi, has dominated the market for hepatitis C, which affects about 185 million people worldwide. Harvoni's total sales were $13.86 billion in 2015. However, the company has been facing growing competition from rival treatments developed by AbbVie Inc and Merck Inc. Gilead's shares fell 2 percent to $89.22 following Regulus's announcement.Wedbush securities analyst Liana Moussatos said she expected Regulus's drug to be priced either in line or less than the oral pills.Regulus enrolled 79 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus and 38 of these patients were being evaluated through eight weeks of follow up. The data showed 97 percent of these patients had a sustained reduction of the virus at eight weeks of the treatment.Analysts called Regulus's interim data set impressive but cautioned that longer follow-up period would be needed to asses the drug's curative potential.    Regulus said it expected to report 12-week response data in the second quarter. Most adverse events were mild to moderate though it appears there were two serious adverse events that required hospitalization, one possibly occurred after dosing, Abrahams said.Investors will be keen to know whether there will be any other adverse effects related to the treatment during the study, Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt wrote in a note.Regulus shares were up 13 percent at $7.10 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

No other large U.S. pharmaceutical or biotechnology company trades below a ratio of 10.9, according to Thomson Reuters data.Gilead's valuation in recent weeks has been the lowest since it became a solidly profitable company more than a decade ago. Over the past 10 years, the stock has traded at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6 times, on average.By other metrics, the stock does not look as appealing. Using a measure of a stock's value called a PEG ratio, which factors in Gilead's lackluster growth outlook and its price-to-earnings ratio, the shares look at least twice as expensive as the average big biotech stock, analysts' estimates show.""People are just skeptical about the long term earnings power of the company,"" said John Fraunces, co-manager for the Turner Investments medical sciences fund in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which does not own Gilead shares. VICTIM OF OWN SUCCESS To an extent, Gilead is a victim of its own success. The company, the largest biotech by market value at $120 billion, built upon a leading HIV medicine franchise by adding hepatitis C treatments that revolutionized care for the serious liver disease.That medical advance was reflected in its financial performance. From 2013 through last year, Gilead's sales tripled to nearly $33 billion, while earnings shot up more than six times to $12.61 per share. But investors are concerned that Gilead's hepatitis C franchise sales may have peaked.Earnings per share are expected to fall 3 percent this year with no growth expected through 2019, while sales are expected to recede to about $29 billion over the next four years, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Gilead shares have declined 11 percent in 2016, though that is less than the 19 percent drops for big biotech peers Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) and Celgene Corp (CELG.O), while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index .NBI has fallen 27 percent. Investors said the company's future could rest in part on what it does with its balance sheet: Gilead amassed $26.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by the end of 2015.The company's dividend yield sits at 1.9 percent, below the roughly 2.3 percent average for companies in the S&P 500 Health Care index .SPXHC, while it bought back $10 billion worth of its stock last year.A major acquisition of promising companies or new medicines could help propel sales and earnings, but investors are worried about the price of buying such growth.

Merck has also asked for a royalty of 10 percent going forward on Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, which generated $19.2 billion in worldwide sales last year.

In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Merck's Zepatier drug.In 2013 Merck contacted Gilead saying the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs, sofosbuvir, infringed Merck's patents, according to court papers.  Foster City, California-based Gilead then asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose to declare the patents invalid, saying they do not clearly describe any disease fighting effects. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, countersued for infringement. Gilead said in court filings that Merck played no role in sofosbuvir's discovery, but that when its breakthrough potential became clear, ""Merck came knocking on Gilead’s door with its two patents in hand."" Last month, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that the sale and use of Gilead's drugs infringe Merck's patents.   Michael Yee, biotech analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said ""while it does not sound good that Gilead could theoretically owe billions of dollars in financial damages...it is a small amount relative to Gilead's $127 billion market cap."" He said he expected Gilead to appeal. The case is Gilead Sciences, Inc v Merck & Co, Inc, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 13-cv-4057.

294,"   By Rory Carroll and Andrew Chung | SAN JOSE  SAN JOSE Merck & Co told a federal jury on Tuesday it was seeking more than $2 billion in damages from rival Gilead Sciences Inc after the jury upheld the validity of two Merck patents in a high-profile dispute over Gilead's blockbuster cure for hepatitis C.After returning its verdict in favor of Merck on Tuesday, the jury in San Jose, California immediately began hearing evidence on how much Gilead owes Merck for infringing the patents.Bruce Genderson, an attorney for Merck, said the company is seeking a 10 percent royalty on Gilead's U.S. sales of nearly $21 billion for 2014 and 2015. Merck has also asked for a royalty of 10 percent going forward on Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, which generated $19.2 billion in worldwide sales last year.  Following the verdict, Gilead shares fell $1.92 to $91.80 in after-hours trading. Merck rose 57 cents to $53.60.In a statement, Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest said, ""Although we are disappointed by the jury’s verdict today, there are a number of remaining issues to be decided by the jury and the judge."" She declined to comment on any potential appeal. A spokeswoman for Merck said the verdict ""accurately reflects the evidence in this case."" The trial, which began on March 7, came as pharmaceutical companies race to capture a slice of the lucrative market for the newest hepatitis C treatments, which can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. Insurers, politicians and patient groups have denounced the list prices of the drugs. Harvoni, at $1,125 per pill before discounts, costs $94,000 for a 12-week regimen. In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Merck's Zepatier drug.In 2013 Merck contacted Gilead saying the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs, sofosbuvir, infringed Merck's patents, according to court papers.  Foster City, California-based Gilead then asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose to declare the patents invalid, saying they do not clearly describe any disease fighting effects. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, countersued for infringement. Gilead said in court filings that Merck played no role in sofosbuvir's discovery, but that when its breakthrough potential became clear, ""Merck came knocking on Gilead’s door with its two patents in hand."" Last month, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that the sale and use of Gilead's drugs infringe Merck's patents.   Michael Yee, biotech analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said ""while it does not sound good that Gilead could theoretically owe billions of dollars in financial damages...it is a small amount relative to Gilead's $127 billion market cap."" He said he expected Gilead to appeal. The case is Gilead Sciences, Inc v Merck & Co, Inc, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 13-cv-4057.

The benchmark S&P 500 index fell back into negative territory for the year after closing positive on Friday for the first time in 2016.U.S. stocks' fading five-week rally was further diminished by comments over the past two days by Federal Reserve officials, who expressed views that suggested an appetite for more U.S. interest rate hikes than investors had anticipated.The possibility of more than the two expected rate hikes through December has sent the dollar higher .DXY, pushing down commodity prices .TRJCRB.""That's basically what's leaning on the market today,"" said Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

300,"   By Andrew Chung  By Andrew Chung Gilead Sciences Inc on Wednesday will attempt to wipe out $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck & Co patents with its blockbuster hepatitis C treatments by claiming that Merck was dishonest in obtaining the patents, an argument that attorneys say could be difficult to prove. A bench trial on Wednesday will pit Gilead's Fish & Richardson attorneys against Merck's lawyers from Williams & Connolly, on Gilead's claim that Merck has ""unclean hands"" because it used Gilead's technology in its own patent applications and so should be precluded from enforcing its patents. Merck says the jury has already found that its patents are valid, foreclosing any unclean hands defense.

301,"   By Ritsuko  Shimizu | TOKYO  TOKYO Global drugmakers said they could cut research spending in Japan due to new rules requiring them to slash prices on some blockbuster drugs, including Gilead Sciences Inc's highly effective but expensive hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.Drugmakers such as the Japanese arms of Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co said the change, which could as much as half the price of popular medication, risks penalizing companies for developing revolutionary drugs like Sovaldi. ""Without stability and predictability in drug prices, investments will go elsewhere,"" Patrick Johnson, chief executive of Eli Lilly in Japan, recently told reporters.The comments come as the government works to attract research and development investment from pharmaceutical firms as a key part of a broader economic growth agenda.But the government also needs to curb soaring medical and nursing costs in a rapidly aging society, to help balance its primary budget by the fiscal year through March 2021.Policies focusing on medical costs rather than advanced development ""raise the risk of less investment in Japan,"" Pfizer's Japan head Ichiro Umeda told Reuters. ""A market that appreciates innovation allows for more investment and enables continuous development of revolutionary new drugs,"" he said.Beginning April 1, the government will lower the prices drugmakers can charge for popular drugs. For instance, prices will be cut by as much as 50 percent for drugs with annual Japan sales exceeding 150 billion yen ($1.34 billion) and that are 30 percent over estimates manufacturers file with the government.For Gilead's Sovaldi, the price will fall about 30 percent. Sovaldi has been shown to cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver-destroying hepatitis C, without the side effects of older medicines. However, a price of $84,000 for a course of treatment in the United States drew criticism from insurers, politicians and patient groups.Gilead has since agreed to lower the price in over 90 mostly developing countries. But not in Japan, where about 1.5 million people are diagnosed with hepatitis C, and where Gilead said sales had helped push up global sales in the three months through December.When asked about Japan's rule change, the drugmaker told Reuters it was committed to ""delivering new treatments to as many patients as possible amid a changing market environment."" Others were more critical. Akira Kawahara, senior managing director of the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, told Reuters the rules were ""suddenly proposed and suddenly implemented.""Drugmakers had advised the government against the move when it came up for debate late last year. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents U.S. biopharmaceutical firms and researchers, had said the change would penalize firms for successful drug development.($1 = 112.2900 yen) (Reporting by Ritsuko Shimizu; Writing by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",2016-04-01,GILD,"Fri Apr 1, 2016 | 5:54am EDT",Drugmakers say Japan R&D spending at risk after government forces price cuts,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-japan-drug-idUSKCN0WY46I?type=companyNews
302,"   By Bill Berkrot  An experimental once-daily combination hepatitis C treatment being developed by AbbVie Inc demonstrated very high cure rates across a wide range of disease genotypes, according to data presented on Saturday, likely giving the company a more competitive product if approved. Cure rates of 97 percent to 100 percent over either eight or 12 weeks of treatment were achieved in the clinical trials with the one pill, once-a-day combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530, which use different methods to block virus replication.The combination would provide greater convenience for a wider variety of patients than AbbVie's Viekira Pak, improving  chances of making inroads into the market domination currently enjoyed by Gilead Sciences Inc.Viekira Pak, which is approved for genotype 1, the most common form of the serious liver disease in the United States, consists of four drugs and involves taking three pills in the morning and one in the evening. It currently has only about 5 percent of the market, with Gilead owning about 90 percent.Another AbbVie product treats genotype 4, which is most common in Egypt and other parts of Africa. The new one pill combination proved effective across the spectrum of genotypes 1-6 in the midstage studies presented at a European liver disease meeting in Barcelona.In patients without cirrhosis who were not helped by an older regimen, 97 percent of those with genotype 1 and 98 percent of those with genotype 2 had no detectable hepatitis C virus in the blood 12 weeks after completing eight weeks of therapy, which is considered cured. Patients with genotype 3 and no cirrhosis receiving treatment for the first time had a 97 percent cure rate with eight weeks of therapy.Cure rates of 100 percent were achieved with 12 weeks of treatment in genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis, and in non-cirrhotic patients with genotypes 4, 5 and 6.""These new data show us the potential of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in genotype 3 patients new to therapy even with the added complication of compensated cirrhosis,"" Dr. Paul Kwo, one of the lead investigators and professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine, said in a statement.  Cirrhosis, a form or severe scarring, is an indication of advanced disease that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure.The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, nausea and diarrhea, the company reported.

304,"   By Deena Beasley  Gilead Sciences Inc's first quarter net profit fell 18 percent as pricing pressure resulted in lower U.S. sales of hepatitis C drug Harvoni.The biotechnology company's shares, which fell 3.7 percent in regular trading, were down another 5.4 percent at $91.75 after hours.Gilead's total product sales rose 4 percent to $7.7 billion. Sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, the company's second generation hepatitis treatment, totaled $4.29 billion, which was short of the $4.63 billion average Wall Street estimate, as compiled by ISI Evercore. ""The hep C numbers are a little light in the USA and that could be due to higher rebating and more competition,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.Gilead Chief Financial Officer Robin Washington said on a conference call that U.S. Harvoni sales declined due to an ""increase in discounts required to open up access to patients with lower (liver) fibrosis scores,"" as well as a modest shift in sales to deeply-discounted government payers, including the  Department of Veterans Affairs. Gilead drew fire more than two years ago when it launched Sovaldi, the first in a new class of hepatitis C drugs considered to be a cure for the liver-destroying disease, at a price of $84,000 per course of treatment. An estimated 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C and insurers have responded by closely monitoring which patients should be treated with the new drugs.The Foster City, California-based company has since faced competition from new hepatitis C treatments sold by other drugmakers - first AbbVie followed more recently by Merck & Co Inc.Gilead said it continues to assess business development opportunities.  ""M&A (mergers and acquisition) is always a process,"" said Chief Executive Officer John Milligan, noting that Gilead has never said it would be unwilling to pursue a hostile deal, although ""we do prefer a friendly process.""Adjusting for one-time items, Gilead earned $3.03 per share in the quarter, compared with the average Wall Street estimate of $3.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The biotechnology company's first quarter net profit fell to $3.57 billion from $4.33 billion a year earlier.RBC's Yee said results were also hurt by a $200 million charge for litigation with Merck. For full-year 2016, Gilead said it still expects total product sales of $30 billion to $31 billion, in line with the average Wall Street estimate of $30.16 billion.

307,"   By Deena Beasley  India has reversed course and granted approval to Gilead Sciences Inc's patent for its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, marking a setback for patient groups who said the move could stop affordable copies of the drug.The drug, which has a list price of $1,000 a pill in the United States, was rejected for a patent by the Indian patent authority in January 2015 on the basis it represented only minor changes to a previous formulation, and the company already had licensing deals with manufacturers in India.After an appeal by Gilead, the Indian Patent Office of New Delhi on Monday approved its application for the drug saying it found its compounds to be ""novel"" and ""inventive."" Gilead, in a statement, welcomed the move, but said it will have no impact on availability of the compound, which is already licensed to 11 generic manufacturers in India for distribution in 101 developing countries. Patents guarantee drugmakers exclusive sales for a decade or more, before generic competition is allowed, so the companies can recoup their investment and use profits to then develop new medicines. Gilead said the goal of its voluntary licensing program, and ""partnership"" with Indian manufacturers, is to enable access to medicines for as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.But patient groups said Gilead's licensing deals do not serve patients and the patent approval could prevent exports of raw materials to other countries seeking to make the drug, hailed by some as a breakthrough in the global fight against hepatitis. ""Like unmerited patents, these schemes manipulate the market, violate patients' rights and block millions of people from getting the medicines they need,"" the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge said in a statement. Gilead said eight of its licensees have launched sales in India and other licensed territories under the company's program for supplying its hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV drugs to ""resource-challenged countries.""

308,"   By Deena Beasley  India has reversed course and granted approval to Gilead Sciences Inc's patent for its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, marking a setback for patient groups who said the move could stop affordable copies of the drug.The drug, which has a list price of $1,000 a pill in the United States, was rejected for a patent by the Indian patent authority in January 2015 on the basis it represented only minor changes to a previous formulation, and the company already had licensing deals with manufacturers in India.After an appeal by Gilead, the Indian Patent Office of New Delhi on Monday approved its application for the drug saying it found its compounds to be ""novel"" and ""inventive."" Gilead, in a statement, welcomed the move, but said it will have no impact on availability of the compound, which is already licensed to 11 generic manufacturers in India for distribution in 101 developing countries. Patents guarantee drugmakers exclusive sales for a decade or more, before generic competition is allowed, so the companies can recoup their investment and use profits to then develop new medicines. Gilead said the goal of its voluntary licensing program, and ""partnership"" with Indian manufacturers, is to enable access to medicines for as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.But patient groups said Gilead's licensing deals do not serve patients and the patent approval could prevent exports of raw materials to other countries seeking to make the drug, hailed by some as a breakthrough in the global fight against hepatitis. ""Like unmerited patents, these schemes manipulate the market, violate patients' rights and block millions of people from getting the medicines they need,"" the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge said in a statement. Gilead said eight of its licensees have launched sales in India and other licensed territories under the company's program for supplying its hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV drugs to ""resource-challenged countries."" Licenses have also been granted to two manufacturers in Egypt and one in Pakistan.Sovaldi was first launched in the United States in 2013 at a  list price of $28,000 for a 28-tablet bottle, or $1,000 a pill.

Sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni dropped to $4 billion from $4.9 billion. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast hepatitis C sales of $4.09 billion, according to a poll by ISI Evercore.Gilead lowered its 2016 product sales outlook to between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion, from a previous range of $30 billion to $31 billion. The company said non-government U.S. health insurance plans were still limiting the number of patients who get the treatments, which many critics have said are far too expensive. Other factors behind the lower sales forecast include weaker hepatitis C drug pricing in some European markets, a trend toward shorter treatments and the loss of market share to competition, Chief Financial Officer Robin Washington told analysts on conference call after the results were released.    Gilead drew fire more than two years ago when it charged $84,000 per course of treatment for Sovaldi, the first in a new class of hepatitis C drugs considered to be a cure for the liver-destroying disease.While the list price has not changed, Gilead has offered discounts to certain insurers. Competing therapies have been launched by AbbVie Inc ABBV.O and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) over the past year. The number of U.S. patients who started undergoing treatment with hepatitis C drugs was little changed from the first quarter, suggesting that the market has stabilized, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note on Monday.Gilead's quarterly net profit fell to $3.5 billion from $4.5 billion a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, Gilead earned $3.08 per share, which beat analysts' average estimate of $3.02, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. An estimated 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C and insurers have responded by closely monitoring which patients should be treated with the new drugs.The virus is spread by contact with contaminated blood of an infected person, by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. Most patients have no symptoms, but some have fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and yellowing of the eyes and skin.

341,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Natalie Grover  Botox maker Allergan Plc, in its third acquisition this month, said it would pay up to $1.7 billion for Tobira Therapeutics Inc to get a leg up in the race to develop therapies for NASH, an incurable fatty liver disease closely linked to obesity.Just hours later on Tuesday, Allergan announced it would also pay $50 million upfront and make future milestone payments for Akarna Therapeutics Ltd, a privately held company that is planning early-stage studies of a treatment for NASH.There are no approved treatments for the disease affecting more than 15 million Americans, which involves accumulation of fat in the liver not caused by alcohol, and can lead to cirrhosis, liver transplants or liver cancer.""Allergan is making an excellent move into the NASH space, which is under appreciated by Wall Street and one of the major categories of untreated diseases,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of StocDoc Partners who holds shares of Tobira.Allergan's offer on Tuesday of $28.35 upfront per Tobira share is a whopping 500 percent premium to the stock's close on Monday, which had given Tobira a market capitalization of about $89 million. Tobira shareholders could receive up to $49.84 per share, contingent on the company achieving certain milestones.Tobira's stock surged 720 percent to $38.91 on Tuesday. But Allergan's fell 2.7 percent to $238.67 as some industry analysts said the deal came at a steep price. Tobira shares have been on a roller coaster ride since July 25, when they tumbled 60 percent to $4.50 after the company's lead product, cenicriviroc, failed its main goal in a mid-stage trial of showing a 2-point reduction on a scale that measures features of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis).    But cenicriviroc achieved a secondary goal by reducing by at least one stage the extent of fibrosis, a scarring of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, without worsening of NASH. Tobira said the drug has potential to be approved if that favorable secondary finding can be duplicated in a larger late-stage study.Yaffe said cenicriviroc and related therapies being developed by the company have potential to reap annual sales of $5 billion.He said experimental NASH drugs being developed by Gilead Sciences Inc have similar sales potential and that treatments being studied by Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc and others also have blockbuster sales potential. Allergan research chief David Nicholson, in an interview, said liver biopsies are now required to confirm NASH, but less-invasive diagnostic tests should be available by the time the first NASH treatments reach the market, or soon after.""The science in NASH is breaking now and this could become one of Allergan's largest categories"" of medicines, Nicholson said.  The proposed acquisition is the latest in a string of deals orchestrated by Brent Saunders, Allergan's chief executive, since the company's planned $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc collapsed in April because of unfavorable new U.S. tax regulations.Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment,  last week said it would pay $639 million for Vitae Pharmaceuticals, which is developing drugs for psoriasis, eczema and autoimmune disorders. It agreed on Sept. 6 to pay $60 million for RetroSense, a privately held company developing an ophthalmology gene therapy. Other major contenders in the race to develop a drug to treat NASH include Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc, whose shares rose 19.4 percent, and Galectin Therapeutics Inc, whose stock gained 14.8 percent.Covington & Burling are Allergan's lead legal counsel.  Centerview Partners and Citi are Tobira's financial advisers, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian LLP are its legal counsel.

350,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV.Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV.The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, evaluated monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey version of HIV, and showed the treatments were much more effective when used together than separately.All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three of them, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for six months after antiretroviral therapy or ART drugs were stopped.The study is part of ongoing efforts to develop a so-called functional cure for HIV that would allow people infected with the virus to stop taking daily antiretroviral therapy. [L1N1CJ134] ""Current antiretroviral drugs, although they're lifesaving, do not cure HIV. They merely hold it in check. We are trying to develop strategies to achieve ART-free, long-term viral suppression,"" said study author Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.For the study, the team used what is known as a ""kick and kill"" approach. The two-punch strategy is designed to lure dormant HIV-infected immune cells out of hiding places in the body and then attempt to eradicate them.The trial evaluated a therapeutic vaccine called Ad26/MVA, which J&J and partners are testing in early-stage human trials. The vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity. They combined this with Gilead's experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body's initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients.In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo.Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead's TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group. In this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound.“If all the animals' viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,” said Barouch. “But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that’s a solid base hit. It’s definitely something that we can work from.”Barouch said his team has been in talks with both companies to test the combination therapy in patients with HIV.

They combined this with Gilead's experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body's initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients.In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo.Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead's TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group. In this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound.“If all the animals' viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,” said Barouch. “But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that’s a solid base hit. It’s definitely something that we can work from.”Barouch said his team has been in talks with both companies to test the combination therapy in patients with HIV.

352,"  (Adds details)Nov 10 Gilead Sciences Inc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its drug to treat chronic hepatitis B infection in patients with scarred liver.The drug, Vemlidy, comes with a boxed warning, the strongest warning issued by the FDA that highlights serious risks such as lactic acid buildup, accumulation of fat on the liver or aggravation of the infection. The drug has been approved as a once-daily treatment for the condition, which the World Health Organization estimates is responsible for more than 686,000 deaths every year worldwide. Data from a late-stage study showed in January that the drug was not only effective, but also safer than the company's approved treatment, Viread.

358,"   By Jilian Mincer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Gilead Sciences Inc has begun marketing its HIV treatment Truvada in a way thousands of consumers already use it – to prevent infection with the virus that causes AIDS.The company introduced Truvada to the U.S. market in 2004 for HIV treatment. In 2012, Gilead won approval to market it for prevention after two large, peer-reviewed studies showed it also was effective at preventing infections in healthy people. But the company decided against promoting the drug as a preventative treatment, deferring to patient advocates who feared it could encourage promiscuity and unsafe practices, such as having sex without condoms.Even without Gilead's help, many consumers learned Truvada was more than 90 percent effective in tests at preventing HIV infection. In 2014, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended it as an option for people at high risk for HIV infection.As many as 90,000 people in the United States used the drug for prevention, or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), last quarter. That's up from 60,000 to 70,000 earlier this year, the company said. Usage also is growing in France, where about 2,000 people have been prescribed Truvada for prevention since January.In July, the drugmaker began marketing Truvada for PrEP to doctors through professional publications, digital advertising and other channels, including the website PreventHIV.com.And this fall, the drugmaker began marketing directly to consumers with print advertisements in publications geared toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, including OUT, Advocate and SWERV. It plans soon to expand to social media and digital.Gilead said it wants to reach people whose doctors are either unaware or reluctant to prescribe Truvada for prevention. The marketing ""is primarily driven by demand by patients,"" said David Piontkowsky, Gilead's vice president of HIV Medical Affairs, in an interview. Attitudes toward Truvada started to change a couple years ago as doctors, AIDS activists and potential users saw its effectiveness, he said. The ""criticism now is we're not saying enough.""Truvada is helping bolster Gilead's profits as sales of its biggest moneymakers – treatments for hepatitis C – decline. U.S. net product sales of Truvada for the first nine months of 2016 were $1.8 billion compared with $1.5 billion for the same period in 2015. The company said in its earnings report that the gain was driven by price increases as well as ""increased usage of Truvada for PrEP.""""We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead's growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S.,"" Gilead Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young recently told investors.The new Truvada campaign has been well received, even by those who once opposed promoting the drug for prevention. They include David Duran, a writer and HIV advocate, who helped popularize the term ""Truvada Whore"" in a 2012 article describing his fear that it would encourage people to have sex without condoms. Duran began rethinking that concern about a year later in light of newer research showing that PrEP helped prevent more cases of HIV, without a rise in other sexually transmitted disease, which suggested people were using condoms.""I'm thrilled they are starting to pump some money into marketing and awareness,"" Duran said. ""There is a solid base of folks who know about PrEP, but it's still not a topic the country as a whole knows about."" GROWTH POTENTIAL As a preventive measure, the blue Truvada pill is taken once daily. Some people experience nausea, vomiting or headaches during the first few weeks on the drug. Users must be tested every three months to ensure they don't have HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases and to monitor kidney function and bone density.Some Medicaid programs and most private insurance cover the treatment, which lists for $1,500 a month before any negotiated discounts. With greater awareness and favorable coverage for preventative treatments, the number of Americans using Truvada could rise, said the company and healthcare providers. An estimated 50,000 new U.S. HIV infections are diagnosed each year. The CDC estimated in 2015 that about 1.2 million Americans were at substantial risk of HIV infection and could benefit from PrEP.  That includes men who have sex with men, transgender women who have sex with men, partners of people who are HIV-positive and intravenous drug users who share needles.The number of high risk groups ""is much broader than one might think,"" said Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. ""It is not just men with multiple partners. There are a whole host of folks who could benefit.""At least 15 patients have gone on Truvada for prevention since Planned Parenthood's six Massachusetts clinics began offering it this fall. Planned Parenthood of New York City plans to offer the treatment to all of its 50,000 patients, said Julia Sullivan, associate director of quality management. Wider use also could buffer Gilead when Truvada, the only drug currently approved in the United States for PrEP, loses patent protection in 2021. Gilead has a successor treatment in the works. The once-daily F/TAF (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) has been approved for HIV treatment and is under study as a preventative.""PrEP is indeed a significant part of Truvada,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges. ""It can certainly keep Truvada relatively flat but the key question is, when will they show that TAF works for PrEP?""In the meantime, the concept of taking an HIV drug to prevent infection is making inroads in popular U.S. culture. It came up in an episode of ""Transparent,"" the Emmy award-winning Amazon series about a family with a transgender parent, when a character was contemplating sex with an HIV-positive partner.""We were trying to make the conversation reflect what happens in real life,"" said a writer on the show who works under the name Our Lady J. ""PrEP is a big part of that conversation. As an HIV positive person, I'm struck with the level of ignorance around PrEP.""
