2,"   By Bill Berkrot  A cholesterol fighter developed by Amgen Inc from a highly promising new class of medicines significantly lowered levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in a late stage trial in patients unable to tolerate statin drugs, the company said on Thursday.The results marked the third successful Phase III test of the drug evolocumab reported by Amgen in recent months - this one in a patient population among the most in need of alternative therapies.An estimated five to 20 percent of heart patients are intolerant of statin medications for lowering cholesterol due to side effects such as muscle weakness or fatigue, Amgen said.Evolocumab belongs to a class of medicine called PCSK9 inhibitors that work by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.Based on dramatic LDL lowering demonstrated by Amgen and other companies in earlier studies, PCSK9 inhibitors could be the most important new heart drugs to come along in several years with multibillion-dollar sales potential.The injected medicines are likely to be used in high risk heart patients unable to lower their LDL levels sufficiently with high doses of widely used statin drugs, such as Pfizer's Lipitor, and in those unable to take statins. Many patients remain at high risk of heart attack and stroke ""despite the use of all available therapies,"" Amgen research and development chief Sean Harper said in a telephone interview.""The ability to treat those individuals with a completely distinct mechanism and see this very large effect size of dropping LDL cholesterol by roughly 50 percent, that's a pretty big deal for those patients,"" Harper said.The company expects during the current quarter to have results of its final two Phase III studies - one in patients already taking high doses of statins and one in patients genetically predisposed to dangerously high cholesterol levels. Amgen will provide details of its latest 307-patient Phase III study, called GAUSS-2, which compared evolocumab to Merck & Co's Zetia (ezetimibe), at an upcoming medical meeting.However, the world's largest biotech company said the percentage of cholesterol lowering was consistent with those observed in a similar, smaller Phase II trial. In that study, evolocumab led to 51 percent reduction in LDL levels and 63 percent when combined with Zetia versus a 15 percent reduction seen with Zetia alone.""It's very unusual to have a therapeutic that addresses one of the underlying factors that drive the greatest mortality risk that exists in Western countries, and increasingly in developing countries - cardiovascular disease driven by atherosclerosis,"" Harper said.

10,"  By Ransdell PiersonFeb 5 Merck & Co Inc's quarterly profit and sales just missed expectations as its medicines faced competition from cheaper generics, but the company announced potentially lucrative new cancer-drug partnerships with rival U.S. drugmakers.For the full year, Merck expected to earn $3.35 to $3.53 per share, excluding special items. The average analyst estimate was $3.48 per share.""Overall, I view this guidance as 'good enough,' given fairly widespread Street concerns about a 'mega-miss,'"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said, adding that investors remain more focused on prospects for the company's array of experimental drugs.Separately on Wednesday, Merck said it plans to test its closely followed immuno-oncology drug MK-3475, in combination with medicines being developed by Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc  and Incyte Corp. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed.Merck shares were up 0.3 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as much as 3.1 percent earlier on Wednesday.Schoenebaum said investors were enthused about the planned new studies of MK-3475, a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that works by harnessing the immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. Industry analysts believe the medicine, if approved, could generate annual sales of $2 billion or more and greatly improve treatment of melanoma and potentially other cancers. They also believe such immuno-oncology drugs may have special promise if used in combination with each other.The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday it earned $781 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $908 million, or 30 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.Excluding special items, Merck earned 88 cents per share. The average analyst forecast was 89 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 4 percent to $11.32 billion. Wall Street was expecting $11.36 billion.Merck shares rose 22 percent in 2013, underperforming a 27 percent average gain for other large U.S. and European drugmakers, amid waning sales of its Januvia diabetes medicines and uncertainty about its drug pipeline.The company is hoping that MK-3475 and other drugs will be approved and revive sales and earnings growth, following failures or setbacks over the past five years for its treatments for heart disease, osteoporosis and other diseases.Sales of Januvia, Merck's biggest product, fell 1 percent to $1.12 billion in the fourth quarter, while sales of a related combination medicine called Janumet rose 11 percent to $503 million. Double-digit sales gains were seen for arthritis treatment Remicade and HIV treatment Isentress. But sales of asthma drug, Singulair, now facing generics, tumbled 38 percent to $298 million.Sales of the company's animal health products, which usually prop up results, slipped 3 percent to $871 million in the quarter. They were hurt by the company's voluntary suspension of sales earlier in the year of Zilmax, a feed supplement that some critics have alleged caused dangerous weight gains in cattle.Merck said on Wednesday it will study MK-3475 in combination with Pfizer's approved kidney-cancer drug Inlyta, and separately test MK-3475 against various cancers in combination with a Pfizer immuno-oncology drug called PF-05082566 (PF-2566). The Pfizer drug targets a protein called the human 4-1BB receptor.Incyte and Merck will conduct an early-stage trial of MK-3475 in combination with Incyte's experimental INCB24360 - a so-called IDO inhibitor. They will be tested on patients with advanced lung cancer, and other advanced cancers.The Merck drug will be tested with Amgen's experimental  medicine, called talimogene laherparepvec, in an early-stage study of patients with advanced melanoma. The drug, nicknamed ""T-VEC,"" is a virus that is injected directly into tumor tissue in hopes of stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells.Shares of Incyte slipped 1.5 percent to $61.97, while Pfizer shares eased 1.3 percent to $30.78.

12,"   By Bill Berkrot  An experimental Amgen Inc cancer vaccine used to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, proved effective in a late-stage study in shrinking tumors in a way that suggests the drug triggered the intended systemic immune response, according to data presented on Friday.The vaccine shrank tumors that were directly injected with the drug and tumors around the body that were not injected, according to the data.The drug, talimogene laherparepvec, also known as T-vec, is an engineered virus designed to replicate inside the injected tumor, killing cancer cells there, as well as prime the immune system to attack other cancer cells around body.Dr. Robert Andtbacka, one of the study's lead investigators, in a telephone interview, called the results ""very encouraging.""Amgen last year released initial data from the 295-patient Phase III study showing that T-vec succeeded in demonstrating a significant tumor response that lasted at least six months. The latest data analyzed 4,000 tumor lesions to study the response to the drug in injected versus non-injected tumors.Of the directly injected tumors, 64 percent shrank by at least half, and 47 percent of those had a complete response, meaning the lesion had disappeared, researchers said. Of the uninjected lesions in the skin or lymph nodes, known as non-visceral tumor lesions, 34 percent shrank by at least half with a complete response seen in 21 percent of those.""We also want to see responses in distant lesions that are not injected such as in the liver, in the lung and other places,"" Andtbacka explained.Of those so-called visceral tumors on solid organs, 15 percent shrank by at least 50 percent, said Andtbacka, who presented the data at the Society of Surgical Oncology Cancer Symposium in Phoenix. ""This indicates to us that we have activation of the immune system to fight these tumors at a distant site,"" Andtbacka said.""This is a new generation of oncolytic immunotherapy where you're seeing very robust responses in injected lesions but also robust responses in non-injected lesions. This bodes well for the future for this product,"" added Andtbacka, an associate professor in the division of surgical oncology at the University of Utah School of Medicine.Amgen said it expects to have further data in the first half of this year showing whether T-vec ultimately helped patients in the study to live longer. The company has not yet said when it will apply for approval of the medicine. Andtbacka said he expects the future of the drug will involve its use in combination with other types of cancer immunotherapies, especially in treating patients with non injectable visceral tumors.Amgen is already testing T-vec in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's melanoma drug Yervoy and has agreed to study T-vec in combination with Merck & Co's experimental immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors.Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. About 132,000 melanoma cases occur globally each year, according to World Health Organization.""We are extremely excited about the data and the potential for combinations with other treatments,"" said David Chang, Amgen's head of global oncology development.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Leslie Adler)(This story was refiled to add dropped word ""not"" to show that vaccine also shrank tumors not injected with the drug in the second paragraph .)",2014-03-14,AMGN,"Fri Mar 14, 2014 | 5:23pm EDT",Amgen vaccine triggers immune response in advanced melanoma -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-amgen-cancer-idUSBREA2D1U920140314?type=companyNews

Of those so-called visceral tumors on solid organs, 15 percent shrank by at least 50 percent, said Andtbacka, who presented the data at the Society of Surgical Oncology Cancer Symposium in Phoenix.""This indicates to us that we have activation of the immune system to fight these tumors at a distant site,"" Andtbacka said.""This is a new generation of oncolytic immunotherapy where you're seeing very robust responses in injected lesions but  also robust responses in non-injected lesions. This bodes well for the future for this product,"" added Andtbacka, an associate professor in the division of surgical oncology at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Amgen said it expects to have further data in the first half of this year showing whether T-vec ultimately helped patients in the study to live longer. The company has not yet said when it will apply for approval of the medicine.Andtbacka said he expects the future of the drug will involve its use in combination with other types of cancer immunotherapies, especially in treating patients with non injectable visceral tumors.Amgen is already testing T-vec in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's melanoma drug Yervoy and has agreed to study T-vec in combination with Merck & Co's  experimental immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors.Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer.

14,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Amgen Inc said its experimental new type of cholesterol-fighting drug met the primary goal of a late-stage trial by slashing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol levels in patients with a genetic tendency towards high levels of the artery-clogging fat.Amgen said on Monday patients given its injectable drug evolocumab once a month, on top of standard daily statin treatments, showed ""clinically meaningful"" improvement compared with taking statins alone after 12 weeks of treatment. The drug is also known as AMG-145.The Phase 3 study, called TESLA, involved 49 adult and adolescent patients with a rare condition called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The condition, seen in about one in a million individuals, can cause a four-fold increase in levels of LDL cholesterol, greatly raising the risk of heart disease.Evolocumab works by blocking PCSK9, a naturally occurring protein that keeps LDL levels elevated in the bloodstream.Other drugmakers, including Pfizer Inc, and a partnership between Regeneron Inc and Sanofi, are racing with Amgen to complete trials of potentially lucrative anti-PCSK9 antibodies. ""You could have two or three drugs here, each with upwards of $3 billion to $4 billion in annual sales,"" said Richard Purkiss, an analyst with Atlantic Equities.The PCSK9 inhibitors are one of the most closely followed new classes of medicines, Purkiss said, even though they will probably not be prescribed for the average patient with high cholesterol.If approved, ""they would be used mainly for very high-risk patients, who have frustratingly high LDL despite statin treatment,"" he said. Purkiss said Regeneron and Sanofi had been ahead of the pack in terms of completing clinical trials, but that Amgen's trials had picked up speed and its drug could be the first to market.In Amgen's now-completed TESLA study, the safety risk was similar between those taking evolocumab in combination with statins, and those taking statins alone, Amgen said, with the most common adverse events including upper respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal inflammation and stuffy nose.Data from the trial will be presented at a future medical conference, Amgen said. The world's largest biotechnology company noted that favorable results have previously been reported in five other Phase III trials of its experimental medicine, which involved different populations. They have included trials among mainstream populations whose high cholesterol is not due to serious genetic causes, as well as trials among those who cannot tolerate statins and instead take a different type of cholesterol fighter called Zetia (ezetimibe) from Merck & Co.In mid-stage studies, evolocumab has cut LDL levels by as much as 60 percent more than with statins alone.Such results have bolstered faith among doctors and industry analysts that the drug and other PCSK9 inhibitors might be a good option for patients who are unable to reach target LDL levels with statins and other standard treatments.Amgen shares were up 1.8 percent in midday trading on the Nasdaq, amid a 1.5 percent gain for the NYSARC Biotech Index.(Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid and Bernadette Baum)",2014-03-17,AMGN,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 12:28pm EDT",Amgen drug meets goal for those with high genetic cholesterol,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-amgen-cholesterol-idUSBREA2G0ZA20140317?type=companyNews

Results of the other two Phase III studies will be presented at the meeting on Sunday.The data also showed that two dosing regimens of the injected drug - 140 milligrams every two weeks or 420 mg once a month - were equally effective in reducing LDL levels.""We're seeing excellent efficacy and the safety profile appears no different than placebo, so you can't get better than that,"" Dr. Michael Koren, one of the lead investigators on two of the evolocumab studies, said in a telephone interview.Evolocumab belongs to a highly promising class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL from the blood. They are expected to be used in patients who cannot tolerate widely used and highly effective statins, such as Pfizer Inc's Lipitor, and in those unable to get their cholesterol levels low enough using currently available medicines.""In terms of the LDL lowering, these drugs are as good or better than anything we have,"" said Koren, who presented data from the trial called Mendel-2 at the ACC meeting. In that 614-patient study, evolocumab reduced LDL 55-57 percent more than a placebo and up to 40 percent more than Merck & Co's cholesterol fighter Zetia in patients not on any other cholesterol drugs.It also helped about 70 percent of patients get their LDL down to 70 or lower, Koren said. That had been the target for high risk patients before controversial new guidelines announced last year eliminated specific target numbers.Amgen said it will file its application seeking U.S. approval of evolocumab sometime this year. The drug is expected to compete with similar medicines also in late stages of development from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi and from Pfizer.Analysts have forecast eventual annual sales of $3 billion or more for each of the drugs, assuming insurers agree to pay for them.

22,"  Amgen Inc said its experimental drug to treat a deadly form of skin cancer did not significantly improve overall survival rates in patients enrolled in a late-stage study.The company said the drug met the study's main goal of shrinking tumors, as it had previously reported, but did not meet the secondary goal of improving overall survival in patients with melanoma.The most common serious adverse events observed in the trial include disease progression, a bacterial skin infection and fever, the company said.ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the drug's failure to significantly improve survival rates could affect its chances for approval and limit its commercial opportunity as a single therapy.Amgen said in June that data from the pivotal study showed that the drug improved survival by 21 percent for patients with advanced forms of melanoma compared with a standard white blood cell-boosting drug. The company first reported in March last year that the drug,talimogene laherparepvec, met the study's main goal of inducing a durable response rate (DRR) — defined as a complete or partial tumor shrinkage lasting at least six months — in 16 percent of patients. Also known as T-Vec, the drug is injected directly into a tumor and is designed to replicate until the cancer cells rupture. It then activates the body's immune response to fight cancer cells that have spread to other areas.Amgen is also testing the drug in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's melanoma drug Yervoy. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States, but melanoma, which begins in skin cells that make the pigment melanin, accounts for less than 2 percent of skin-cancer cases.The American Cancer Society estimates that 76,100 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed this year, and that the disease will kill about 9,710 patients.The company's shares were little changed at $122.20 in morning trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.

Wall Street on average is looking for earnings of $8.16 per share and sales of $19.61 billion.""We are confident that we can meet our full year revenue guidance,"" Chief Executive Robert Bradway said on a conference call with analysts and investors.The world's largest biotechnology company said net profit fell to $1.07 billion, or $1.40 per share, compared with a profit of $1.43 billion, or $1.88 per share, a year ago, when earnings were helped by a tax gain.Excluding special items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $1.87 per share, missing analysts' average expectations by 7 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""This quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Amgen,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. ""Given this is all about wholesaler inventory changes, they were able to reiterate the guidance for the year, so we still think that things are on track, but Q1 does tend to be a tough period.""The results were also impacted by increased research and development spending and higher acquisition-related expenses. Amgen said it still expects to begin filing for global approvals of its high profile new type of cholesterol fighter, evolocumab, this year. The drug is seen as a potentially important future growth driver as Amgen enters the arena of heart care.Revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to $4.52 billion, but fell short of Wall Street estimates of $4.76 billion.The company generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 9 percent.Product sales, while up from a year ago, declined 9 percent from the previous quarter, which the company said was primarily due to inventory stocking late in 2013 ahead of potential 2014 price increases.First quarter demand for Enbrel was hit by the draw down of inventory sold in the fourth quarter of last year, Amgen said. Enbrel sales fell 5 percent to $988 million. Analysts had been estimating sales of about $1.1 billion for the quarter.Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said disappointing Enbrel sales ""may be an indication that Enbrel is starting to suffer from too much competition.""Inventory drawdowns hurt sales of other products as well, Amgen said.Some of Amgen's more important newer products also came in below Wall Street estimates. Sales of the new multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen's nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, were $68 million. That was down from the previous quarter's $73 million and well below analysts' expectations of about $82 million.The company is expecting important clinical data later this year on Kyprolis that could help spark sales if it leads to a wider approval that would allow for the drug's use early in treatment of the disease rather than only after multiple prior medicines have been used.""What really matters for this drug going forward is whether they are able to dramatically expand the label and get into earlier lines of therapy. That will all be data driven,"" Cowen's Schmidt said.Sales of Xgeva, to prevent fractures when cancer has spread to the bones, rose 25 percent to $279 million, below Wall Street estimates of about $292 million.The related osteoporosis drug Prolia saw sales jump 38 percent to $196 million, but that still missed analysts' estimates of about $209 million.The company's white blood cell boosters Neulasta and Neupogen had combined worldwide sales of $1.38 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations.Amgen shares fell to $116 in after hours trading from a Nasdaq close at $119.30.(Additional reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-04-22,AMGN,"Tue Apr 22, 2014 | 6:05pm EDT",Amgen profit falls on inventory draw downs; sales disappoint,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-amgen-results-idUSBREA3L1LH20140422?type=companyNews

The drug is seen as a potentially important future growth driver as Amgen enters the arena of heart care.Revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to $4.52 billion, but fell short of Wall Street estimates of $4.76 billion.The company generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 9 percent.Product sales, while up from a year ago, declined 9 percent from the previous quarter, which the company said was primarily due to inventory stocking late in 2013 ahead of potential 2014 price increases. First quarter demand for Enbrel was hit by the draw down of inventory sold in the fourth quarter of last year, Amgen said.Enbrel sales fell 5 percent to $988 million. Analysts had been estimating sales of about $1.1 billion for the quarter.Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said disappointing Enbrel sales ""may be an indication that Enbrel is starting to suffer from too much competition.""Inventory drawdowns hurt sales of other products as well, Amgen said. Some of Amgen's more important newer products also came in below Wall Street estimates.Sales of the new multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen's nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, were $68 million. That was down from the previous quarter's $73 million and well below analysts' expectations of about $82 million.The company is expecting important clinical data later this year on Kyprolis that could help spark sales if it leads to a wider approval that would allow for the drug's use early in treatment of the disease rather than only after multiple prior medicines have been used.""What really matters for this drug going forward is whether they are able to dramatically expand the label and get into  earlier lines of therapy. That will all be data driven,"" Cowen's Schmidt said.Sales of Xgeva, to prevent fractures when cancer has spread to the bones, rose 25 percent to $279 million, below Wall Street estimates of about $292 million.The related osteoporosis drug Prolia saw sales jump 38 percent to $196 million, but that still missed analysts' estimates of about $209 million.The company's white blood cell boosters Neulasta and Neupogen had combined worldwide sales of $1.38 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations.Amgen shares fell to $116 in after hours trading from a Nasdaq close at $119.30.

25,"  April 22 Amgen Inc on Tuesday reported lower first quarter profit as results were hurt by acquisition-related costs as well as sales of several key products that fell short of Wall Street estimates.The world's largest biotechnology company said net profit fell to $1.07 billion, or $1.40 per share, compared with a profit of $1.43 billion, or $1.88 per share, a year ago,      when earnings were helped by a tax gain. Excluding special items, Amgen had adjusted earnings of $1.87 per share. Analysts on average expected $1.94 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company left its full year forecast unchanged, which is likely to disappoint investors who have become accustomed to Amgen raising its outlook as the year progresses. Amgen still expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $7.90 to $8.20 per share and revenue $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion. Wall Street on average is looking for earnings of $8.16 per share and sales of $19.61 billion.

29,"  * Initial 30 pct cash component too low for AZ investors* Pfizer may give more cash but limited by UK domicile move* ""White knights"" thin on ground, Amgen said not interestedBy Ben Hirschler and Simon JessopLONDON, April 29 U.S. drugmaker Pfizer  will need to raise its bid for AstraZeneca to around $105-110 billion and increase the proportion of cash in the offer to win its British rival, investors believe.After showing his hand and pressuring his smaller competitor on Monday by disclosing two bid approaches, both of which were rebuffed, Pfizer CEO Ian Read has until May 26 to ""put up or shut up"" under UK takeover rules.Importantly, after a jump in Pfizer shares, Read knows he has the backing of many of his own shareholders, while the threat of a counterbid does not appear imminent.Read and his team will be using the time available to consider how they can sweeten an offer made in January worth 58.8 billion pounds ($98.8 billion), or 46.61 pounds a share, comprising 30 percent cash and 70 percent shares.AstraZeneca said that offer fell ""very significantly"" short and it specifically flagged the small cash component, which would leave investors exposed to the risks faced by Pfizer in executing an ambitious mega-merger.So far, the British group has refused to talk to Pfizer - but it has not ruled out discussions altogether and one person close to the company said the cash component of any fresh offer would be key in determining if there was engagement in future. Cash is uppermost in the minds of AstraZeneca shareholders, too.""For it to move forward from here, they (Pfizer) need to find a way of getting Astra management engaged and that feels like it needs a specific value being applied to the group, and it needs the cash element to be higher,"" said Alastair Gunn of Jupiter Fund Management, which is a top-20 investor in AstraZeneca.Analysts at Jefferies believe a deal could get done with Pfizer offering a 50/50 split between cash and shares at a price of at least 50 pounds a share.Several investors contacted by Reuters confirmed they were looking for 50 pounds a share or more, with Neil Veitch of SVM Asset Management predicting an agreed deal somewhere between 52 and 53 pounds. Because a key goal of the planned takeover is to get the tax advantages of re-domiciling the enlarged group in Britain, there is a limit to how much cash Pfizer can offer, since at least 20 percent of its shareholders are required to be UK-based.""We estimate Pfizer will need to issue a minimum of around $55 billion in shares to comfortably meet this requirement,"" Jefferies said.Based on the original 30 percent cash element, Moody's analyst Michael Levesque said Pfizer could fund the whole of the cash portion with offshore funds.Pushing the cash element to 50 percent, however, would require taking on some incremental debt. SORIOT CANVASSES INVESTORS AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, whose efforts to revive the firm's drug pipeline have proved a key draw for Pfizer, will now be canvassing the views of shareholders as a ""priority"", with machinery in place for meetings with big and small investors, two people close to the company said.Soriot and chairman Leif Johansson will also be weighing strategic alternatives for the drugmaker, including the potential spin-off of non-core therapy areas like infection and neuroscience, as well as possible acquisitions.But ""white knight"" counterbidders ready to take on Pfizer are likely to be thin on the ground - not least because few other companies would enjoy the same cost and tax benefits from acquiring AstraZeneca as Pfizer.Amgen is one player for whom an AstraZeneca deal might make sense, since the two companies are co-developing a number of drugs, but a person familiar with the U.S. biotech firm said on Tuesday it was not interested in entering the fray.French drugmaker Sanofi is another company with the heft and M&A experience to consider intervening, yet its CEO Chris Viehbacher said on Tuesday he planned to stick to smaller bolt-on acquisitions.GlaxoSmithKline, the British company with arguably the greatest potential to extract synergies from buying AstraZeneca, has meanwhile said for several years it is not interested in large deals.($1 = 0.5950 British Pounds)   (Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-04-29,AMGN,"Tue Apr 29, 2014 | 9:59am EDT",Pfizer may have to pay more cash and top $105 bln to win AstraZeneca,http://www.reuters.com//article/astrazeneca-pfizer-investors-idUSL6N0NL1O420140429?type=companyNews
30,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to Amgen  Inc.'s (Amgen) proposed $4.5 billion unsecured notes offering. Fitch expects  Amgen to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding  the repayment of preferred shares under its Master Repurchase Agreement or  outstanding term loan borrowings, and pre-funding a portion of its outstanding  1.875% unsecured notes and 4.85% unsecured notes maturing in November 2014. A  full list of ratings is listed at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Debt leverage increased significantly because of the Onyx acquisition; --The acquisition of Onyx was strategically sound and it will likely mitigate  Amgen's patent expiry risks; --Fitch anticipates Amgen will refrain from share repurchases in the  intermediate term to preserve U.S. cash balances; --Fitch forecasts strong free cash flow (FCF), although significant cash  balances are expected to be held outside the U.S. Leverage Increased from Onyx Acquisition Debt leverage rose from incremental debt required to consummate the purchase of  Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Onyx) for approximately $9.7 billion (net of Onyx  cash balances) in October 2013. Total debt leverage was 4.2x for the latest  12-month (LTM) period ending March 31, 2014. Fitch expects the level to remain  above 3.0x through 2015-2016, leaving the company little flexibility within its  'BBB' rating category. However, the company should deleverage during the  forecast period primarily through growth in EBITDA, with possibly some modest  debt reduction.          Long-Term Revenue Growth Supported by Onyx Fitch sees sales from Onyx's three marketed pharmaceuticals - Nexavar, Stivarga,  and Kyprolis - helping to mitigate pressure from expiring drug patents, notably  in 2015, when two of Amgen's top-5 selling drugs, Neupogen and Neulasta, could  face generic competition. Coupled with continued solid uptake of the promising  medicines, Xgeva and Prolia, Fitch anticipates compound annual growth of 3.2% in  2012 to 2017. Revenues generated by the Onyx portfolio, notably Kyprolis, add  nearly 2% to the CAGR during this period.  Biosimilar Risks Significant, But Less Than Traditional Generic Drugs As mentioned above, Fitch expects to see competing biological drugs in the U.S.  to two top-5 selling drugs - Neupogen and Neulasta - over the next three years  including a first-generation filgrastim treatment, Granix, introduced by Teva  Pharmaceutical Industries in November 2013. However, new competition to Amgen's  biological therapies, biosimilars, will not benefit from interchangeability upon  launch, limiting their inroads into the marketplace. Moreover, the number of  potential drugmakers may be modest given the high cost to develop and market  biosimilar pharmaceuticals. As such, Fitch anticipates revenue declines from  patent expirations at around 20% to 30% as opposed to the 80% to 90% typically  seen with patent lapses of small-molecule drugs. Share Repurchases Paused, Dividends to Rise Given the higher debt burden following the Onyx acquisition, Fitch expects share  repurchases will be on hold through 2015. Amgen currently has no plans to make  any significant repurchases during 2014 and 2015. The focus of shareholder  returns during this period will turn to dividends, forecasted to increase  annually during the intermediate term. Amgen's board increased the annual rate  of dividends 30% to $2.44 per share in 2014 from $1.88 per share in 2013, which  will result in payments of $1.9 billion this year.  Strong Free Cash Flow Sustained, U.S. Cash Balances Limited Amgen has maintained significant free cash flow (FCF) generation annually since  2005, and FCF was $4.2 billion for the LTM period ending March 31, 2014,  representing a margin of 21.9%. Fitch anticipates steady and strong annual FCF  (at least $4 billion), despite higher dividend and interest payments. As a  result, Fitch expects FCF margins of 20% to 25% through 2015.  Amgen had cash (including restricted cash) and short-term investments of $23.2  billion at March 31, 2014, the majority of which resides outside of the U.S.  Fitch believes that Amgen will continue to struggle with diminishing U.S. cash  balances due to capital demands for shareholder-friendly actions. At March 31,  2014, the company had full capacity under a $2.5 billion credit facility  maturing December 2016, which provides added liquidity. Fitch believes Amgen  will maintain adequate access to the credit markets to refinance coming debt  maturities, including $2 billion of debt that matures in 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch expects Amgen will reduce debt leverage that increased as a result of the  Onyx acquisition by roughly 0.5x per year through 2015. A material deviation  from this pace of deleveraging would likely result in a downgrade. Such a  scenario could result from leveraging acquisitions, debt-financed share  repurchases or operational stress that decreases profitability.  No positive rating momentum is seen for the near term if the acquisition is  executed. A positive revision of the Rating Outlook to Stable would depend upon  Fitch's belief that the company will sustainably operate with total debt  leverage of roughly 2.5x to 3.0x. A decrease to this leverage range will require  strong operational performance (including solid FCF generation) coupled with  relatively stable debt levels.  Amgen's current ratings are: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR)'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB'; --Bank loan 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The ratings apply to approximately $32 billion of debt at March 31, 2014.

Both approvals could pave the way for increased use of Vectibix, which has been largely a disappointment for Amgen.

Amgen had $389 million in sales from Vectibix last year, $126 million of which came from U.S. sales.Close to 40 percent of colorectal cancer patients have tumors with mutated forms of the KRAS gene, which make them poor candidates for Vectibix.

33,"  (Corrects to Reimbursement Intelligence from Intelligence Reimbursement, to Whang as co-president from president, to Steve Miller from Stuart Miller)By Caroline Humer and Deena BeasleyNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES May 28 Shocked by the rapid adoption of a new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, U.S. health insurers are trying to make sure they aren't blindsided by other drugs being developed and are looking for ways to limit their use from the day they are launched.Manufacturer Gilead Sciences Inc says 30,000 people have received hepatitis drug Sovaldi so far, and that sales hit a record-breaking $2.3 billion within a few months. The treatment, typically 84 pills taken over 12 weeks, completely cures the disease in more than 90 percent of patients.As many as 3.2 million Americans are infected by hepatitis C, and the cost of giving most of them Sovaldi would surpass $200 billion. Some insurers have already put conditions on who can get the drug, and states including California and Texas have slowed or put treatment on hold while they study what to do.Insurers warned that these unforeseen costs will cut 2014 earnings and require rate hikes. Now, at industry conferences, in conversations with investors, and in private, they are pushing Gilead's rivals, a group that includes AbbVie Inc , Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , to discount their own new hepatitis C treatments when they come to market starting this fall. Such a high-profile campaign by insurers before drugs are even approved is new.They are also signaling they will restrict who can get coverage for new cholesterol drugs being developed by Amgen Inc , Pfizer Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA.By law, insurers cannot deny access to new drugs if they represent a real improvement for patients, leaving drug companies with the upper hand in most price discussions. When comparable competitors, or a generic version is on the market about a decade later, insurers have room to steer patients away from the new drugs, and pharmaceutical companies cut prices steeply and give big discounts.But insurers have not faced such a highly effective drug aimed at a widespread disease that is so expensive and so quickly adopted. The previous record for a drug reaching blockbuster status was set in 2011, when hepatitis C therapy Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals raked in $1.56 billion for the entire year. Sovaldi has sold more in a quarter of the time.As a result, insurers are taking a harder line on which patients should get Sovaldi, based on the drug's clinical data.Sovaldi is ""game-changing"" for insurers' thinking, said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, a consulting firm that helps pharmaceutical companies set prices. The only way for them to respond is to control the volume of treatment used, he said.PUBLIC SHAMING  In a sign of how serious the industry has become, the largest insurer lobby group last week took Gilead to task at a public conference.""The company in this case is asking for a blank check and you can't give anyone anymore a blank check because it will blow up family budgets, state Medicaid budgets, employer costs and wreak havoc on the federal debt,"" said Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans.Gilead argues that Sovaldi's price is worth it, since it will replace even costlier spending on hospital visits and treatments for cirrhosis or liver failure. It has not budged on price for the hepatitis C drug, although Gregg Alton, Gilead's executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, acknowledged that insurers are going to start negotiating.U.S. drug spending reached a record $329 billion in 2013, driven by a double-digit increase in prices for new cancer, HIV and hepatitis C therapies. Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, expects spending on such specialty drugs to rise an additional 63 percent from 2014 to 2016, driven by an 1,800 percent increase in hepatitis C drug costs.Successful drugs can cost $1 billion to bring to market, including spending on research, development and marketing. Supporters of drug companies say big advances necessitate high prices.""We are the only country in the world that pays exorbitant prices to provide innovation first here, but that's what we need and that's what the American people have come to expect,"" said Richard Burr, a Republican Senator from North Carolina who has spent decades working on bipartisan health bills.LIMITING USE  Hepatitis C complications can take years to develop, which gives insurers and government health agencies leeway to determine when treatment should start.Many insurers, which manage most of the 150 million people covered by employer-based plans as well as some government Medicare and Medicaid plans, require patients to get authorization before using Sovaldi. Some limit the drug to patients with a certain genetic type of the disease.Express Scripts has been pushing for all but the sickest patients to wait for new therapies that are expected to compete head-to-head with Sovaldi late this year. It is also pressing rival manufacturers for low prices, hoping to avoid the shock of Sovaldi, which sped through trials and regulatory approval and caught insurers by surprise.""In this particular case there was very little discussion pre-launch. But other companies are now already discussing potential future price points in response,"" said Steve Miller, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer.AbbVie and Merck both declined to comment on whether discussions with insurers about their new drugs were underway.Gilead, which says it discussed the Sovaldi launch with insurers, is in talks over which patients should be treated with its next hepatitis C pill. That will be a two-drug combination that will eliminate the need for a companion drug that nearly doubles Sovaldi's current total cost. Industry analysts expect the company will price it closer to Sovaldi's $84,000 than to the $150,000 cost of a combination of Sovaldi and a Johnson & Johnson drug that some doctors prescribe.Mick Kolassa, chairman of pricing consultancy Medical Marketing Economics, in Oxford, Mississippi, who advises pharma companies, says insurers are being aggressive. ""We are seeing some of them step up and flex their muscles,"" he said.CHOLESTEROL DRUGS IN SIGHT More scrutiny of new pricing is likely ahead as the country comes to terms with how it should pay for expensive drugs, according to John Castellani, Chief Executive Officer of leading drug industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA.Sovaldi has shown that patients are bearing too much of the drug's costs because of rising co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, he told Reuters, laying the blame on factors controlled by insurance companies.But patient advocates are not choosing sides yet, which may have the effect of giving insurers room for action.""I think the fault lies with both the for-profit insurers and the drug companies,"" said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at the San Francisco-based Project Inform, which advocates for hepatitis C patients. The system has not changed to reflect the impact of new effective, expensive drugs, she said.The next big price battle centers on a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which help the liver to clear ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from the blood.Large-scale studies show the new drugs can help patients who cannot tolerate, or get enough benefit from, the most widely-used cholesterol drugs, statins. The PCSK9 therapies are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the price of statins sold as generics.Drugmakers are expected to push for the new medicines to be used by 7 million to 20 million people, or up to 30 percent of the 71 million Americans with high cholesterol. Insurers already are questioning whether the estimates of use are legitimate.""There is really no need to take these new medications and spread them out across a larger community of people who will respond to existing treatments, many of which are generic,"" Aetna Inc's National Medical Director for Pharmacy Policy Ed Pezalla said in an interview.

36,"   By Bill Berkrot | June 11  June 11 A drug being developed by Amgen Inc  for psoriatic arthritis demonstrated sustained effectiveness after a year of treatment with no new safety concerns, according to data from a midstage trial.Amgen and partner AstraZeneca Plc had previously presented 12-week data from the 168-patient trial of the biotech drug, brodalumab, showing it to be significantly more effective than a placebo.After 12 weeks, all patients - those who received 140 milligrams of brodalumab every two weeks, those who got the 280-mg dose and the placebo group - were given the high dose over the next 40 weeks with significant disease improvement seen.At 52 weeks, 71 percent of patients who originally received the 140-mg dose had achieved the study's main goal known as ACR20 - a measure of at least 20 percent improvement in signs and symptoms of the painful condition, such as tender and swollen joints. Among those who got 280 mg from the start, 56 percent were at ACR20 after a year, as was 50 percent of the original placebo group.After 12 weeks, 37 percent of the low-dose group and 39 percent on the high dose had achieved ACR20 versus 18 percent for placebo. ACR50, a 50 percent improvement in disease signs and symptoms, was achieved by 47 percent of the original 140-mg patients and 27 percent of the original 280-mg patients at a year, while ACR70 was achieved by 22 percent and 7 percent, respectively. For placebo patients who switched to 280 mg, the ACR50 rate was 38 percent and ACR70, 14 percent.""From an efficacy point of view the drug worked,"" Dr. Philip Mease, the study's lead researcher who will present the data at the European League Against Rheumatism meeting in Paris on Saturday, said in a telephone interview. The results were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.Brodalumab belongs to a class of drugs called IL-17 inhibitors that work by blocking a signaling pathway that plays a key role in inducing and promoting inflammatory diseases.Research firm ISI Group has forecast eventual annual peak sales for the drug of about $2 billion. Patients in the study had moderate to severe versions of the   inflammatory disease related to the skin condition psoriasis, for which the drug is also being tested. They had already failed at least one therapy, including about half who were no longer being helped by injectable biologic medicines known as anti-TNF drugs, such as AbbVie Inc's top-selling Humira and Amgen's Enbrel.""It's hopeful that this (anti-IL-17) mechanism is central enough that they're going to have responses despite the failure of anti-TNF therapy,"" Mease said.Doctors are looking for new treatments for psoriatic arthritis and related diseases as effectiveness of even the powerful anti-TNF drugs tends to diminish over time.There were four cases of serious adverse events reported, including one serious infection and one patient hospitalized with abdominal pain, but no deaths.

The release of three patented Amgen drugs in Brazil this year boosted sales and helped expand the drugmaker's local business beyond its unpatented medicines, which will face rising competition in coming years.Brazil's aging population and rapidly growing access to private healthcare have sparked growth of a market for innovative and expensive pharmaceuticals of the kind Amgen develops to treat cancer, kidney failure and other diseases. In the interview at Amgen's offices in Sao Paulo, Santos said an ongoing slump in Latin America's largest economy has put some pressure on government budgets, but it will do little to reduce demand for Amgen's medicines. ""The market for new cars may contract, but our patients' diagnoses will remain.""He added that the company's challenge is stronger competition, not weaker demand.

Its shares rose more than 4 percent to $129. Amgen now expects 2014 adjusted earnings of $8.20 to $8.40 per share, up from its prior view of $7.90 to $8.20 per share. It sees full-year revenue of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion compared with its previous forecast of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion.Wall Street was looking for $8.09 per share and revenue of $19.41 billion.""The company was pretty roundly criticized for a seasonally weak Q1,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. ""Q2 tends to be strong and we're seeing that in spades. ""It's a solid beat and raise,"" Schmidt said. ""This is not necessarily a high expectation stock like some others in biotech, so people are going to be pleased.""Amgen said it will slash 2,400 to 2,900 jobs, primarily in the United States, in 2014 and 2015 and close plants in Colorado and Washington. It plans to expand in South San Francisco, California, and Cambridge, Massachusetts.Amgen will maintain its Southern California headquarters with reduced staff in fewer buildings. The company will take accounting charges of $775 million to $950 million primarily this year and next. The moves will reduce operating expenses by about $700 million in 2016, Amgen said, adding that most of the savings will be reinvested in new product launches.""They're not being very clear about whether it will result in significant improvement in profitability,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said of the restructuring moves.Excluding items, Amgen earned $2.37 per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 30 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net profit rose to $1.55 billion, or $2.01 per share, from $1.26 billion, or $1.65 per share, a year ago.Revenue rose 11 percent to $5.2 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates of $4.89 billion.The results were helped by solid demand for rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, which had sales of $1.24 billion.

44,"  * Sanofi to file drug for US and EU approval by year-end* Nine Phase III ODYSSEY trials meet primary endpoint* Alirocumab ""generally well tolerated"" in trialsBy Natalie HuetPARIS, July 30 A new drug being developed by French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S. partner Regeneron  cut ""bad"" LDL cholesterol more than placebo and existing treatments in nine late-stage clinical trials, the companies said on Wednesday.The injectable drug, called alirocumab, is from a promising new class of medicines, called PCSK9 inhibitors, also being developed by Amgen Inc and other drugmakers. If approved, these drugs could reap annual sales of $3 billion or more, according to some industry analysts. The Phase III ODYSSEY trials showed that after 24 weeks, the mean percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol with alirocumab was consistent with results seen in previous trials, the companies said in a statement.The trials involved patients whose high LDL cholesterol levels are not sufficiently controlled by existing treatments such as statins, who cannot tolerate these or who present a high or very high cardiovascular risk.""The robust data from these studies in more than 5,000 patients is the basis of our global regulatory submissions, which we expect in the U.S. and EU by year-end,"" said Sanofi R&D chief Elias Zerhouni. PCSK9 inhibitors block a protein that prevents the body from eliminating LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and offer a new way of fighting the build-up of artery-clogging fat that puts patients at risk of heart attacks.These drugs are mainly aimed at the millions of people who either cannot tolerate statins such as Pfizer Inc's  Lipitor or AstraZeneca Plc's Crestor or who cannot get their cholesterol levels under control with statins alone. In earlier mid-stage studies, when combined with statins, alirocumab and Amgen's own PCSK9 drug cut levels of LDL cholesterol by close to 70 percent, more than statins alone.The drug was ""generally well tolerated"" in the trials, with most common adverse events being nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections and injection site reactions.Serious adverse events and deaths were ""generally balanced"" between treatment groups as were musculoskeletal, neurocognitive and liver-related events, the companies added.An interim safety analysis showed that after 18 months of treatment, patients on alirocumab were less prone to cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization) compared with those on placebo.Alirocumab's potential to cut cardiovascular risk is being assessed in an ongoing 18,000-patient long-term outcomes trial.

45,"  Amgen Inc said a late-stage study found that its blood cancer drug helped patients live significantly longer without the disease worsening, compared with standard treatment.The world's largest biotechnology company's shares rose as much as 4.3 percent to $131.00 in premarket trading, after it released interim data for its injectable drug, Kyprolis.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2012, granted the drug accelerated approval for use in multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer.Accelerated approval is granted to drugs for serious diseases with little or no treatment options, based on data from initial trials. However, manufacturers still need to conduct larger trials to bolster initial findings.The trial tested Kyprolis in combination with two other treatments, against those two treatments alone, in 792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received prior therapy. Patients treated with Kyprolis lived for a median of 26.3 months without disease progression, compared with 17.6 months for those not given the drug, Amgen said.The data may support the conversion of accelerated approval to full approval and help the company expand the current indication in the United States, Amgen said. Amgen shares were up 3.14 percent at $129.50 in premarket trading on the Nasdaq on Monday.Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen's nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, had sales of $68 million in the first quarter.

46,"  (Adds upcoming data, analyst comment, share move)By Bill BerkrotAug 4 Amgen Inc said on Monday its Kyprolis combined with standard treatment helped patients with relapsed multiple myeloma live significantly longer before their blood cancer worsened, compared with the standard therapy, according to interim data from an eagerly-anticipated late stage study.Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen's nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year, has recorded sales of $146 million in the first half of this year. Celgene Corp's rival multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst by comparison had sales of $296.5 million over the first six months.Analysts have said positive results from the study announced on Monday and another Phase III trial called Focus, testing the blood cancer drug as an initial multiple myeloma treatment, were critical to help jumpstart Kyprolis sales growth. In the trial called Aspire of 792 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who had undergone prior therapy, those who received Kyprolis plus Celgene's older Revlimid and the chemotherapy agent dexamethasone on average went 26.3 months before the disease began to worsen. That compared with progression free survival of 17.6 months for two drugs without Kyprolis, Amgen said.""Although this result was mostly anticipated, there will be some relief at the news,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. ""The Aspire study is critical for the conversion of the drug's current approval from accelerated, or conditional, approval to full approval in the U.S., as well as for initial approval of the drug in Europe,"" noted Porges, who has forecast Kyprolis sales of $425 million in 2015 reaching $800 million in 2017.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2012, granted the drug accelerated approval for use in multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer, after prior therapies have stopped working. With accelerated approval, manufacturers must still conduct larger trials to bolster initial findings and gain final approval. The data may support the conversion of accelerated approval to full approval and help the company expand the current indication in the United States, Amgen said.Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, is expecting the Focus trial data, which could allow for use of Kyprolis earlier in the disease treatment, to be available in the current quarter.Meanwhile, the Aspire results were also good news for Celgene, Porges said, ""as it provides additional evidence that Revlimid is the indispensable backbone for myeloma on which newer drugs and regimens are built.""Amgen shares were up $1.41, or 1.1 percent at $126.96 on Nasdaq.

55,"   By Ransdell Pierson  An experimental new psoriasis treatment from Eli Lilly and Co proved superior to Amgen Inc's blockbuster Enbrel, drawing it closer to a potential marketing battle with new products being developed by Amgen and Novartis AG.Based on favorable results from Phase III trials, Lilly said Thursday it would seek marketing approval in the first half of 2015 for its drug ixekizumab for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Cowen and Company analysts have forecast that ixekizumab, if approved, could generate annual sales for Lilly of $600 million by 2020. That would make it a mid-sized product for the company, which has annual sales of about $20 billion.Lilly needs new drugs to restore earnings growth, as profits have dropped for several years due to the expiration of patents on big products.Like rival injectable drugs being tested by Amgen and Novartis, Lilly's treatment works by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called IL-17, deemed to be a major culprit in the skin disease. Enbrel, Amgen's older drug, is the most widely prescribed treatment for psoriasis and works by blocking a different protein, called tumor necrosis factor.  After 12 weeks, patients treated with ixekizumab had significantly greater clearance of raised skin patches that are a hallmark of psoriasis, compared with those who took placebos or Enbrel (etanercept) in the large trials, Lilly said.In all three studies, patients received either a placebo or ixekizumab every two or four weeks, for three months. In two of those studies, called UNCOVER-2 and 3, patients could receive Enbrel twice weekly. In UNCOVER-1, those responding to treatment continued to take either placebos or ixekizumab for up to 60 weeks.    Among patients treated with Lilly's drug, 78 to 90 percent  experienced at least a 75 percent reduction of skin plaque at 12 weeks, based on a standard scale of psoriasis area and severity. Moreover, some 31 to 41 percent achieved clear skin. That compared with 5 to 7 percent of those treated with Enbrel in the UNCOVER-2 and 3 studies. In the UNCOVER-1 study, high levels of effectiveness were maintained through 60 weeks of treatment. The overall rate and severity of side effects for ixekizumab were similar to those seen for Enbrel, including stuffy nose and reactions at the injection site, Lilly said.Novartis' treatment against IL-17, secukinumab, recently met all its primary and secondary goals in late-stage trials, showing superiority to Enbrel in one study.

The negative result in the sub-group of 12,000 patients with severe angina meant it failed.The increase in the combined risk of cardiovascular death and heart attack in this patient group was small but statistically significant, with 7.6 percent of them suffering an adverse event against 6.5 percent of those on placebo. A commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the results were also published, said more research was needed to understand the finding and in the meantime doctors should ""exercise caution"" in using the drug in severe angina patients.The European Medicines Agency said in May it had launched a review into the safety of the medicine, which is sold under the brand name Procoralan, because of the signal from the SIGNIFY trial.

63,"  * Good news for new PCSK9 drug class but needs confirmation* Sanofi, Regeneron vying with drugs from Amgen and Pfizer* Data from four alirocumab studies unveiled at ESC congressBy Ben HirschlerBARCELONA, Aug 31 An experimental cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals roughly halved the number of heart attacks and strokes in a clinical trial, researchers reported on Sunday.The result is not conclusive, because the analysis was done retrospectively, but it provides the first evidence that targeting a protein known as PCSK9 could slash cardiovascular risks for millions of patients.The injectable drug, alirocumab, is from a new class of medicines, which are also being developed by Amgen and Pfizer. They lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in a new way and are widely expected to reap multibillion-dollar sales.The finding is likely to spur enthusiasm about the drugs, which could reach the market next year, although experts said it still needed to be confirmed in a much larger trial.Sanofi and Regeneron said in July that nine big studies showed consistent LDL reductions with alirocumab, but details from four of these trials have only now been unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting in Barcelona.The encouraging cardiovascular data come from an interim safety analysis of one of these studies showing patients on alirocumab were less prone to a combination of cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalisation.Both groups of patients got traditional anti-cholesterol statin pills in addition to alirocumab or a placebo. Among the alirocumab group, 1.4 percent of patients suffered a major cardiovascular event against 3.0 percent of those on placebo. The ongoing 2,341-patient study, called Odyssey Long Term, is expected to conclude early next year but researchers said the early sign of efficacy was clearly positive.""To have this result emerge so quickly in this study is very encouraging,"" said Jennifer Robinson, a cardiologist at the University of Iowa, who led the study.No other drugmaker has previously released data suggesting reduced cardiovascular risk from PCSK9 inhibitors.Patrick O'Gara of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and president of the American College of Cardiology said the finding was ""biologically plausible"" but the post-hoc or retrospective nature of the analysis necessitated caution.""It's so much wished-for that we must be careful,"" he said. WATCHING SIDE EFFECTS Sanofi and Regeneron are in a fierce race with Amgen, which last week became the first company to file with regulators to sell its product evolocumab.The French and U.S. partners hope to close the gap after paying $67.5 million last month for a voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical designed to assure alirocumab an expedited U.S. regulatory review.It is unclear if the rival PCSK9 drugs will prove to be very different from each other but Sanofi's research head Elias Zerhouni thinks alirocumab should enjoy an early advantage from the preliminary indication of improved cardiovascular results. That may help convince cost-conscious healthcare providers to pay up for an expensive new medicine before results from the large 18,000-patient trial are available in 2017 or 2018.""It has to be confirmed by the big outcomes study but it is the first scientific indication that there is something other than a statin that potentially shows you can get a reduction in risk,"" Zerhouni told Reuters.All four trials presented in Barcelona showed alirocumab cut LDL by around 50-60 percent after 24 weeks. Side effects included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections.Doctors and regulatory authorities are watching closely to see if cutting LDL so sharply may have an adverse effect on other parts of the body, notably the brain.So far, there is no sign of this. There was a small non-statistically significant trend towards more neurocognitive problems in Odyssey Long Term but the other three studies showed alirocumab patients had fewer such issues.PCSK9 drugs will be targeted first at people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously, as well as statin-intolerant patients and those at high-risk of a heart attack who struggle to control LDL on current medicines.Sanofi and Regeneron estimate this high-risk group totals around 21 million patients in the United States and Europe.Whether the drugs, which will be offered in pre-filled syringes and auto-injector pens, will be used more generally depends on how their cost-effective they are deemed to be.The companies say it is premature to talk about price but it is clear the antibody-based therapies will not be cheap, with Barclays analysts suggesting $6,000 a year as a possible price in the United States, with a lower price likely in Europe.

72,"   By Deena Beasley  Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), one of the world's largest biotechnology companies, will unveil next week its first strategy update since early 2013, but few expect a major shift like the split-up recently proposed by Daniel Loeb's Third Point hedge fund.In a letter to investors on Tuesday, Loeb said Amgen has ""all the hallmarks of a hidden value situation"" and should divide into an innovation-driven entity and a low-spending, slower-growth company made up of its older drugs.Third Point is not the first among investors or analysts to suggest the company would benefit from splitting into different companies, echoing a blueprint activists have advanced in various industries. But Amgen is likely to resist such calls. At least some investors in the biotech say that is fine with them, given the company's steady returns as well as the potential disruption from a split to its distribution model and tax structure.""This thing is a massively successful money machine. Why anybody would want to interrupt that I don't know,"" said Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the Smead Value Fund, which owns 357,000 Amgen shares.An ISI Group survey this week, taken after Loeb kicked off his campaign, found 65 percent of responding investors think the company should not split up. Amgen will announce its third quarter earnings on Monday, followed by a ""business review"" meeting in New York with analysts on Tuesday. The company last updated its long-term strategy in February 2013, shortly after Chief Executive Robert Bradway took office.Since then, Amgen's shares have climbed 71 percent, compared with a 98 percent gain for the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index .NBI over the same period. Unlike other biotechnology companies, Amgen also pays an annual dividend yielding around 2 percent.Loeb argued that shareholder value would be unlocked by separating Amgen's older products, like anemia drugs Epogen and Aranesp and white blood cell booster Neupogen, from the company's experimental prospects, which include cholesterol treatment evolocumab and leukemia drug blinatumomab. But at a Wall Street forum last month, Bradway said Amgen had considered such a breakup, but did not believe it would create significant value because of the company's single manufacturing and distribution channel. He also cited the company's ""very efficient tax structure,"" which stems from its practice of producing many of its drugs in Puerto Rico. Under a nearly 100-year-old section of U.S. tax law, companies that have Puerto Rican manufacturing operations are allowed to exclude from federal tax much of the income generated by those plants.That structure, along with tax credits and other tax reduction strategies, has helped cap Amgen's effective tax rate, which the company forecasts at 15 to 18 percent this year, well below the 35 percent top U.S. corporate tax rate. Breaking up the company could push the tax rate for Amgen's ""legacy"" business as high as 35 percent, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in a research note.Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges, who first proposed an Amgen split-up in June, dismissed that argument, saying ""there are a thousand ways companies could manage tax.""Porges, and others on Wall Street, expect Amgen to unveil on Tuesday plans to improve its operating profit margin, which he estimated in the low 40 percent range this year, compared with rates of 52 percent and 70 percent, respectively, for peers like Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O).That might be enough to stave off calls for more radical change, especially since Amgen shares, after dipping in May, are up nearly 30 percent year to date, he said.

93,"   By Brendan Pierson  The top U.S. patent appeals court has upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Sandoz Inc that sought to shield its planned version of Amgen Inc's psoriasis and arthritis drug Enbrel from patent lawsuits.The ruling, handed down Friday by Judge Richard Taranto of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, does not stop Sandoz from developing its drug. Taranto only ruled that the lawsuit against Amgen was premature because Sandoz had not yet sought approval for the drug from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Sandoz, the generics arm of Novartis AG, sued Amgen in June 2013 seeking a judgment that its planned ""biosimilar"" version of Enbrel, a so-called biologic drug, would not infringe two of Amgen's patents. At the same time, Sandoz announced it was launching a late-stage clinical trial of the drug.A U.S. District judge in Northern California dismissed the case in November 2013, and Sandoz appealed.    Biologic drugs such as Enbrel are complex substances derived from living organisms. Unlike traditional chemical drugs, they are difficult to replicate. The 2009 federal Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act allows drugmakers to introduce biosimilar versions of existing biologics that need not be identical to the original. The law around biologics is largely untested. The FDA accepted its first biosimilar application only this year.

98,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Amgen Inc on Wednesday said its new type of treatment for a deadly form of leukemia would cost about $178,000 when it becomes available on Thursday, which would make it one of the world's most expensive cancer drugs. Company spokeswoman Danielle Bertrand said the price for the infused medicine, called Blincyto, would reflect two courses of treatment, at $89,000 per cycle.""We believe the price reflects the significant clinical, economic and humanistic value of the product to patients and the healthcare system, for an ultra-orphan population with a dramatic impact on a serious illness,"" Amgen said in an emailed statement. U.S. regulators on Dec. 3 approved Blincyto to treat a rare blood cancer called acute lyphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The initial approval is for patients whose cancer has returned after treatment or did not respond to previous treatment, such as a stem cell transplant or chemotherapy. In a clinical trial used for the approval decision, 32 percent of patients achieved complete remission for nearly seven months after receiving the drug via infusion for four weeks.An estimated 6,020 Americans in 2014, almost half of them children, will be diagnosed with ALL and 1,440 will die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute.""The overall price of Blincyto is definitely on the high side for cancer drugs,"" said Michael Yee, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. But he said the price was not surprising given the drug's impressive effectiveness and that only about 1,000 Americans who had failed previous therapy would be eligible to take it. Yee estimated Blincyto could reap annual sales of $100 million for ALL, assuming that half of all eligible patients take the medicine. ""That would make it a pretty small drug,"" he said. Amgen acquired Blincyto through its $1.2 billion purchase in 2012 of Micromet, a biotechnology company founded in Germany. At the time, Blincyto was known by its chemical name, blinatumomab. The drug is a so-called bispecific antibody, a hot emerging technology that could prove more potent than conventional antibodies, which have become mainstay treatments for a wide array of cancers.Other costly immuno-oncology drugs, which work by harnessing the immune system, include Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Yervoy treatment for melanoma, which costs about $120,000 for a complete course of four infusions. Merck & Co's new Keytruda melanoma drug costs $150,000 for a year of treatment.Amgen shares were up 1.7 percent in afternoon trading.

99,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year.On Monday, Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's   rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. [ID: nL1N0U61N4]The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead, and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players, including Amgen Inc and Biogen Inc, will face steeper U.S. pricing pressure from insurers. Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products, such as Shire Plc, Novo Nordisk and Theravance Inc , may also be particularly vulnerable, analysts said. Neither Shire, Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment.Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won't cover for 2016, including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension and arthritis, said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller, in an interview earlier this month. In some cases, Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field, he said. The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U.S. market.Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014, with 44 medications, and increased that number to 66 for 2015.The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts' biggest ""formulary"" list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices, Miller said.Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs, and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than $1 billion in annual spending, Miller said.Employers ""are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk,"" Miller said. ""We are going to be opportunistic"" in looking for savings in the future.Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading to $92.90.

100,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Express Scripts (ESRX.O), the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year.On Monday, Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's (GILD.O)  rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount.The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead, and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players, including Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) and Biogen Inc (BIIB.O), will face steeper U.S. pricing pressure from insurers. Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products, such as Shire Plc (SHP.L), Novo Nordisk NOVN.VX and Theravance Inc (THRX.O), may also be particularly vulnerable, analysts said. Neither Shire, Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment.Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won't cover for 2016, including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension and arthritis, said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller, in an interview earlier this month. In some cases, Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field, he said. The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U.S. market.Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014, with 44 medications, and increased that number to 66 for 2015.The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts' biggest ""formulary"" list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices, Miller said.Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs, and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than $1 billion in annual spending, Miller said.Employers ""are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk,"" Miller said. ""We are going to be opportunistic” in looking for savings in the future.Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading to $92.90.

109,"  (Adds Amgen, Regeneron comments)By Susan Kelly and Bill BerkrotJan 13 Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, on Tuesday said cost savings on expensive cancer treatments could be achieved if the company were involved earlier in the decision-making process.Express Scripts, which has become more aggressive in negotiating discounts on drugs for insurance plans and employers, in December stopped covering Gilead Sciences Inc's  hepatitis C treatments after lining up a cheaper price for AbbVie's newly-approved alternative.Gilead's Sovaldi and follow-up combination pill Harvoni have been shown to cure hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients. But Express deemed the more than $90,000 price for 12 weeks of Harvoni treatment unaffordable. The move reignited investor concerns that drugmakers will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.For cancer patients, treatment decisions typically go through health insurance plans first, and medicines are not changed once people have begun their regimens, Express Scripts Chief Executive George Paz said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. He said PBMs should be included in the decision-making process at a much earlier stage.""The big opportunity out there is really in cancer,"" Paz said. ""If we can get out in front of that, that is a huge opportunity."" Paz said he is also focused on a new crop of cholesterol-lowering drugs expected to hit the market this year, and is talking to companies about market share, positioning and pricing.""They are pretty astonishing, but they are also very expensive,"" Paz said of the drugs which target a protein known as PCSK9. Manufacturers include Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi . The key is to determine which are real breakthrough treatments and which are ""me too"" drugs, Paz said. Amgen said it was talking to payers about its evolocumab, and believes they can only exclude a drug from formularies if there is no clinical difference between rival medicines.""If not, payers will have to leave choices to physicians,"" said Tony Hooper, Amgen's head of commercial operations.Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Len Schleifer was asked if he was concerned about Paz's comments that PCSK9 drugs were in his sights.""It's not a worry. It's a reality that we will deal with,"" Schleifer said. ""I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace.""

110,"   By Bill Berkrot  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on Monday said U.S. health regulators accepted its application to review a potent  cholesterol drug on a priority basis, potentially giving it the upper hand in a fierce race with Amgen to bring a new medicine from the promising class to market.Regeneron, which is developing the drug, alirocumab, in partnership with Sanofi, said the target date for a Food and Drug Administration approval decision was July 24, following a six-month review period.That could put the medicine on the U.S. market a month ahead of Amgen's rival evolocumab. Amgen was first to file its application, but received a standard 10-month review from the FDA, giving it an action date of Aug 27.Regeneron and Sanofi, which were seen as lagging Amgen, employed an unusual strategy to catch up, purchasing a special priority review voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical for $67.5 million. The drugs belong to a highly promising new class called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that prevents the liver from removing bad LDL cholesterol from the blood. In clinical trials, they have shown an ability to lower LDL levels by more than 50 percent.The injectable biotech medicines are expected to be used in high-risk heart patients who are unable to tolerate statins, such as Pfizer's Lipitor, or those who cannot get LDL levels low enough with statins. They are expected to be expensive, with analysts forecasting annual sales of $3 billion for each of the drugs. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding said it was looking at the class with an eye toward negotiating a lower price from one company in exchange for priority status on its formulary for its millions of customers. Express used the strategy with new hepatitis C treatments, getting a lower price from AbbVie and excluding Gilead's drugs.The first company to bring a PCSK9 drug to market would not only have a period to launch the medicine without competition, but would set the price for the class. Pfizer is also working on a PCSK9 drug that will likely be third to market. Regeneron and Sanofi submitted an application for European approval of alirocumab earlier this month. The companies have proposed the brand name Praluent for their product once approved.

Analysts are estimating earnings of $9.28 per share and revenue of $20.87 billion.Amgen is less exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations than other large drugmakers as only about 25 percent of its sales come from outside the United States.Excluding items, Amgen earned $2.16 per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results were helped by a research and development tax credit that came through in the quarter, adding about 10 cents per share to earnings, the company said.On the positive side, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said ""they affirmed the strong 2015 outlook."" But, he added, a good chunk of the earnings beat ""came from a tax credit that was not in the guidance."" The world's largest biotechnology company posted a net profit of $1.29 billion, or $1.68 per share, compared with a profit of $1.02 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year ago.Revenue rose 6 percent to $5.33 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $5.19 billion. Enbrel sales rose 11 percent in the quarter to $1.34 billion, topping analyst expectations of $1.21 billion.The white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta had combined worldwide sales of $1.45 billion. The older Neupogen is expected to face competition this year from the first U.S. approved biosimilar version.Kyprolis, the multiple myeloma drug Amgen acquired with its $10 billion purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, had sales of $91 million, falling short of Wall Street estimates of $109 million. However, based on positive clinical trial data, Amgen said it filed applications with U.S. and European regulators to approve Kyprolis use earlier in the disease, after one prior treatment has failed rather than two. This should boost future sales.U.S. approval decisions on two new drugs, ivabradine for heart failure and T-Vec for melanoma, will be delayed by three months each as regulators asked for additional data, which Amgen said it has supplied.

116,"  (Adds comment from CVS rival Express Scripts, other background)By Ransdell PiersonFeb 17 CVS Health warned on Tuesday that the costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments could eclipse those of other expensive medicines and overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system ""if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.""Two of the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could gain U.S. approval this summer. CVS said they could eventually be used by as many as 15 million patients at an annual cost of up to $150 billion a year if priced at $7,000 to $12,000 a year, making it the highest-selling class of drugs in history.""The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,"" William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement.CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans. The CVS call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians over the high cost of new, highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, especially two medicines from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500 per patient for a course of treatment.Unlike those drugs, which are typically taken for about 12 weeks, the PCSK9s would be used for a lifetime.Express Scripts, the largest U.S. PBM, which has waged a campaign against Gilead's hepatitis C drugs and is now scrutinizing costly cancer medications, provided a slightly different view of the new cholesterol drug market. Express Scripts also expects annual costs of around $10,000 per year per patient. But it sees a patient population that will start small before it ever reaches a possible high of 10 million people and a potential annual cost of $100 billion.Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview that limits set by regulators and the fact that the first wave of drugs are injections may slow their uptake. ""We are going to work to get these products at the best price possible, but they also deserve to get value in the marketplace,"" Miller said.Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors.They are expected to be used first by patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol - a population that CVS and Express peg at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used by those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc's Lipitor.Amgen declined to comment on the pricing issue and Regeneron did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of Amgen closed up 0.5 percent at $154.24, while Regeneron's stock gained 0.4 percent to $404.18.

""The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,"" William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement.The company added that the sky-high prices of the new cholesterol drugs could pave the way for other very costly specialty drugs.CVS' call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians of the high costs of recently approved oral treatments for hepatitis C, especially two brands from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500. Those drugs wipe out the liver virus in more than 90 percent of patients and don't need to be used beyond 12 weeks for most patients. By contrast, CVS warned that the new cholesterol drugs might be needed ""for the duration of patients' lives"" and eventually be deemed appropriate for as many as 15 million Americans.Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting U.S. approval of their rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be approved for patients who are genetically prone to high levels of cholesterol - a population that CVS pegs at 620,000 Americans.

118,"  (Adds Kyprolis price, details of prior trial in relapsed patients, details of oral Velcade)By Deena BeasleyMarch 1 Amgen Inc's Kyprolis helped patients with relapsed multiple myeloma live twice as long before their blood cancer worsened compared to a regimen containing rival drug Velcade, according to an interim analysis announced by the company on Sunday.Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen's nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013, had sales last year of $331 million. Velcade, sold by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co  and Johnson & Johnson, had 2014 sales of nearly $3 billion.The interim look showed that patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with Kyprolis and chemotherapy dexamethasone lived for a median of 18.7 months before their disease worsened, compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with Velcade and the chemotherapy drug. Amgen said the study has yet to show a difference in  survival between the two groups, but said it did demonstrate superiority for Kyprolis in secondary goals of higher overall response rate and lower incidence of nerve pain.Sean Harper, Amgen's head of research and development, said the study will continue until overall survival can be determined.""This was the bet we made when we acquired Onyx,"" he said. ""To be able to demonstrate something compelling enough with respect to the difference between Kyprolis and Velcade,"" which will lose U.S. patent protection in 2017. Rates of cardiac failure and kidney failure for Kyprolis were higher than for patients treated with Velcade. There was also an increase in the incidence of hypertension and shortness of breath in the Kyprolis group compared to Velcade.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2012, granted Kyprolis accelerated approval for use in multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer, after prior therapies  stopped working. The Amgen drug has a wholesale price of over $10,000 a month. Amgen filed earlier this year for FDA approval of Kyprolis as a second-line myeloma treatment based on positive results from a study comparing the drug in combination with dexamethasone and Celgene Corp's Revlimid, to a regimen containing just Revlimid and the chemotherapy drug.Results from a head-to-head trial comparing Kyprolis to Velcade in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are likely to come in 2016, Harper said.Takeda has announced positive results from a trial of its oral version of Velcade, which like Kyprolis, must be given by infusion. Harper said Amgen expects that oral drugs in this class, proteosome inhibitors, will likely be used as ""maintenance"" treatments for myeloma patients whose disease is first controlled by existing, infused drugs.""Demonstrating superiority over Velcade in this head-to-head trial supports our goal of ensuring continued improvement of patient outcomes and potentially establishing Kyprolis as the backbone of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma,"" Pablo Cagnoni, president of Amgen's Onyx unit, said in a statement.

119,"  * Zarxio from Novartis generics unit Sandoz approved by FDA* Copy of Amgen's white cell-boosting medicine Neupogen* Sandoz exec says Zarxio will be priced ""competitively""* Amgen seeking to block biosimilar's launch   (Adds Amgen comment)By Deena Beasley and Ben HirschlerMarch 6 U.S. regulators on Friday gave a green light to sales of the country's first ""biosimilar,"" or copied version of a biotechnology drug, by approving Novartis'  white blood cell-boosting Zarxio. The drug contains the same active ingredient as Amgen Inc's   Neupogen, or filgrastim, which generated 2014 sales of $1.2 billion worldwide.The Food and Drug Administration said it approved Zarxio for  the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used - preventing infections in cancer patients undergoing various treatments.The move had been expected after Zarxio, which is made by Novartis' Sandoz generics unit, won unanimous backing from an FDA panel in January. Biosimilars have been available in Europe since 2006. Health insurers have said biotech drugs with expired patents should also face lower-cost competition in the United States, leading to savings in the same way generic versions of conventional medicines have cut prescription costs.The FDA, however, only received the authority to approve biosimilars with the passing of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in 2010.Biological medicines, whose price tags can run into tens of thousands of dollars per patient per year, account for about 30 percent of U.S. drug spending. Unlike chemical compounds, such as aspirin or statins, biotech drugs are made inside living cells, and tiny variations are inevitable, depending on the exact production process. As a result, a copycat version can only ever be similar to the original, rather than identical.One technical uncertainty with a biosimilar is its official generic name, an important point for pharmacists filling prescriptions. The FDA said Zarxio would, for now, carry the hyphenated name ""filgrastim-sndz"" while the agency works on a comprehensive naming policy.In a statement, Amgen said it believed Neupogen, with a wholesale price of $315 for the lowest packaged daily dose,  ""continues to have an important role to play in helping patients.""Sandoz declined to specify Zarxio's pricing ahead of the U.S. introduction. ""The only thing we can say is it will be competitively priced,"" Carol Lynch, global head of biopharmaceuticals and oncology injectables, told Reuters.Amgen has sued to block Zarxio. Sandoz previously agreed to delay its U.S. launch until a court decision on Amgen's request for a preliminary injunction, or until April 10, whichever comes first. A U.S. District Court hearing is scheduled for March 13.

120,"   By Ben Hirschler and Deena Beasley | LONDON/LOS ANGELES  LONDON/LOS ANGELES A revolution is brewing in healthcare with lower-cost copies of complex biotech drugs finally set to reach the United States, nine years after so-called biosimilars were launched in Europe.The potential for copycats to take business from original biotech brands is grabbing investors' attention and was a key factor in Pfizer's recent move to buy injectable drugmaker Hospira for about $15 billion.The first approval for a biosimilar in the United States is expected imminently - Zarxio, Novartis' copy of Amgen's white blood cell-boosting product Neupogen.But Europe's experience shows the economics of biosimilars can be unpredictable.The conventional wisdom has been that such copycats, which are still far more difficult to make than standard chemical drugs, will sell at a modest discount of perhaps 20 to 30 percent to the original biotech brands.    Yet when Norway's drug procurement agency held its latest national hospital tender in January for a biosimilar copy of Johnson & Johnson and Merck's Remicade it was offered a whopping 69 percent discount to the original brand.     The decision to slash the price was made by Orion Pharma, which distributes the biosimilar known as Remsima in Norway for South Korea's Celltrion. Both Remsima and Remicade, which is forecast to be the world's second-biggest drug this year with sales of more than $9 billion, contain the antibody infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.Orion's move raises questions about the economics of biosimilars and the competitive threat they pose to originator companies - as well as the profit margins they offer to companies making them. An Orion spokeswoman said the deep discount reflected the ""tough pricing competition"" in the Nordic region.MEGABUCKS AT STAKE   As an early adopter, Norway is a biosimilars test-bed and Remsima is particularly important as the first copy of an antibody drug, while Norway's tender system makes it especially price-sensitive.Norwegian doctors have cheered the low price, which frees up resources to treat more patients or pay for other newer medicines, such as cancer immunotherapy.""Our experience has been very good,"" said Jorgen Jahnsen, professor of medicine at the University of Oslo, who has treated around 80 patients with Remsima since January 2014 and believes it works just like Remicade.""Other countries may not achieve the same price reduction as in Norway but it can still be significant,"" he added.With a population of only 5 million, Norway is a minnow in the global pharmaceuticals marketplace.The megabucks are at stake in larger European nations like Germany, France and Britain, countries where Remsima was launched last month, and in the United States. Express Scripts, the biggest U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits, predicts competition to Remicade and 10 other big biotech drugs could save the United States $250 billion over the next decade.And Steve Miller, the firm's chief medical officer, reckons that's conservative, since discounts could be larger than the 30 percent his company has assumed, while new competitors could force originators to discount their prices.  He sees biosimilars acting like conventional generic drugs in driving down costs and creating financial headroom for new medicines.Americans have been using standard generic drugs - exact copies of drugs with expired patents - for 30 years. But the regulatory pathway for biosimilars, which are made in living cells and can never be exact replicas of originals, was only established by healthcare reform in 2010.FDA DECISION  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is due to give its verdict by March 8 on Zarxio, made by Novartis' generics unit Sandoz. A green light is expected after it won unanimous backing from an FDA panel in January.The arrival of biosimilars threatens companies heavily reliant on biotech drugs, like AbbVie and Roche, and Citigroup predicts a transfer of at least $110 billion of value from innovator companies to copycat producers in the next decade.Some big pharma companies, like Pfizer and Amgen, are hedging their bets with plans to produce their own biosimilars.The big unknown is how quickly biosimilars will be adopted in clinical practice. Europe's experience suggests that take-up hinges on the stance of governments and insurers.A analysis published in October by consultancy IMS Health found biosimilar penetration in Europe ranged from 1 percent to 99 percent across different products and markets, depending on whether countries had prescription quotas for biosimilar drugs, tenders or other mechanisms to encourage use.Key U.S. unknowns include the FDA's stance on naming biosimilars on pharmacy lists, questions over the extrapolation of a drug's use to multiple diseases, and the extent to which states will allow any prescription switching.There are also legal challenges, with Amgen seeking an injunction to block the launch of Zarxio, while a crucial FDA panel to consider Remsima was recently postponed.""We hope that there is not a problem with the application,"" said Express Scripts' Miller. ""The sooner we can get these great new products to the marketplace, the sooner Americans can enjoy the same savings Europeans have been enjoying.""

If Novartis were to initiate such an ""at-risk"" launch, it might later have to pay costly damages in the event that Amgen's patent is declared valid and enforceable by the appeals court. ""Given the importance of this case for future biosimilars, we agreed with Amgen before this hearing to jointly request expedited review of any appeal to the Federal Circuit,"" Novartis said in an emailed statement on Thursday.

126,"   By Bill Berkrot  U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved Amgen Inc's Corlanor to treat patients with chronic heart failure, giving the world's largest biotechnology company its first cardiovascular product.The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Corlanor (ivabradine) on top of current standard of care beta blockers for patients whose symptoms of heart failure are stable and who have a normal heartbeat and a resting heart rate of at least 70 beats per minute.Chronic heart failure is a common and debilitating condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood throughout the body.""We see in the realm of a million patients in the U.S. who would be in this class and might have a heart rate in the range,"" Amgen's research chief, Sean Harper, said in an interview.Amgen acquired U.S. commercial rights to Corlanor from French drugmaker Servier, which sells the medicine in Europe. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said that long term Corlanor could become a $500 million a year drug for Amgen.Amgen shares rose 1.3 percent in extended trading following the FDA announcement.In a large clinical trial comparing Corlanor with a placebo, the drug significantly reduced the risk of rehospitalization, a common and costly event associated with chronic heart failure.   Corlanor decreases the heart rate by blocking a function of the heart's natural pacemaker cells. Heart failure patients tend to have an increased heart rate that can prove harmful over time as the muscle works to compensate for diminished pumping ability.""Heart failure is a leading cause of death and disability in adults,"" Norman Stockbridge, director of the FDA's Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products, said in a statement. ""Corlanor ... represents the first approved product in this drug class.""   The FDA decision came after a delay following a request for additional clinical data from Amgen.The most common side effects observed in clinical trial subjects were excessive slowing of the heart rate, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and temporary vision disturbance. Corlanor will be dispensed with a patient medication guide with safety information and instructions for its use, the FDA said.  While Corlanor marks Amgen's entry into cardiovascular medicine, the company is awaiting an approval decision on a much more high profile heart drug with multibillion-dollar sales potential. An FDA decision is expected by late August on Amgen's injectable cholesterol fighter Repatha (evolocumab) from a promising new class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors.

140,"  (Adds Novartis statement)By Dan LevineMay 7 A U.S. appeals court has blocked the sale of Novartis AG's recently approved ""biosimilar"" form of Neupogen, the  blockbuster Amgen Inc drug used to prevent infections in cancer patients. A lower court judge rejected Amgen's request for an injunction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on Tuesday, however, that the injunction could take effect while Amgen's appeal is pending. Oral arguments on the appeal have been set for June 3.In a statement, Amgen said it is pleased with the ruling. Novartis said it looks forward to a ""prompt resolution"" of the appeal so it can launch its drug ""in the near future."" The Novartis drug, Zarxio, contains the same active ingredient as Amgen's $1.2 billion-a-year Neupogen, and once launched, would become the first biosimilar in the United States. Because biosimilars are made in living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates of original brands. Insurers are hoping biosimilars will be sold for discounts of 40 percent to 50 percent from the cost of original brands in the United States. Novartis has not yet disclosed the intended U.S. price for Zarxio. Biosimilars have been on the market since 2006 in Europe.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zarxio in March for the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used  among cancer patients undergoing various treatments.

Amgen's Repatha is in a race to market with Praluent, which is being developed by Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, but widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other serious heart problems.

The company needs drugs like brodalumab at a time when many of its drugs face competition from cheaper copies, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said.Although returning a late-stage drug does not have a major impact, it highlights incremental risks for Amgen, he said.Brodalumab belongs to a class of drugs called IL-17 inhibitors that work by blocking a signaling pathway that plays a key role in inducing and promoting inflammatory diseases. Two late-stage studies evaluating the drug for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis were started in 2014. It was also being tested for treatment of other inflammatory conditions like psoriasis and spondyloarthritis.Research firm ISI Group last year forecast annual peak sales of about $2 billion for the drug. AstraZeneca could decide on the development and marketing of the drug for all territories, except for Japan and certain Asian territories, where Kyowa Hakko Kirin has the rights to it, Amgen said. Amgen and AstraZeneca partnered in April 2012 to develop and market brodalumab and four other drugs from Amgen's inflammation portfolio.A number of Amgen drugs, including Neulasta, its immune-system strengthening drug, face the risk of being copied into biosimilars in the next few years.

150,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Novartis AG unit Sandoz asked a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday to lift a preliminary injunction barring it from selling its biosimilar Zarxio, a cheaper version of a drug that fends off infections in cancer patients.In October, Amgen Inc, maker of the $1.2 billion-a-year drug Neupogen, sued Sandoz in district court in San Francisco, saying Zarxio infringed the patent on Amgen's drug. The court refused to grant a preliminary injunction barring the sale of Zarxio while the lawsuit continued, but in May the injunction was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.The hearing on Wednesday was to discuss if the Federal Circuit's order would remain. Zarxio is a biosimilar, which is essentially a close copy of a brand name biologic medicine. Since biosimilars are copies of biologic products, which are made of living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates. Insurers hope they will cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original brands. Zarxio would become the first biosimilar sold in the United States.  Much of the discussion on Wednesday focused on whether Sandoz had made appropriate disclosures to Amgen that it planned to bring out a copy of Neupogen, as the law requires. Sandoz lawyer Deanne Maynard of Morrison Foerster said the company had done so twice, once when it applied for approval for Zarxio from the Food and Drug Administration and again when it received that approval.

152,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of Amgen Inc's cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha on Wednesday, but said it should be used only in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.    The panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of the drug, known also as evolocumab, for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a hereditary disorder characterized by high LDL levels that can cause heart attacks in very young people.The panel also recommended approval of Repatha in patients without HoFH who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and are taking other cholesterol treatments, with a 11-4 vote.The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.Repatha is one of a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Unlike statins such as Pfizer Inc's Lipitor, which are pills, PCSK9 inhibitors are biologic drugs given by injection. They are expected to be far more expensive than statins.  The panel on Tuesday recommended approval for another PCSK9 drug, Praluent, made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA.The FDA is expected to makes its approval decisions this summer.Repatha is designed to be given in biweekly doses of 140 mg or a monthly dose of 420 mg, on top of statins if patients can tolerate them. Panelists raised questions about what physicians should do if Repatha, combined with statins, were to cause LDL, or so-called bad cholesterol, to drop too low. They fear that if physicians become alarmed by very low LDL levels they could cut back on the patient's statin, which would not be desirable since there is a large body of data showing that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.Panelists were reluctant to recommend the drug for a wider patient population until Amgen completes a large trial to assess whether Repatha's cholesterol-lowering impact translates into a reduction in cardiovascular risk.  Positive results from the outcomes study could eventually expand use of the medicines. If approved, Praluent and Repatha are expected to generate annual sales of more than $2.5 billion each by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.However, pharmacy benefit managers, such as Express Scripts and CVS Health, are expected to demand steep discounts from the drugmakers in exchange for favoring use of one medicine or the other as they have with new hepatitis C treatments.Amgen's shares were flat in after-hours trading after rising 0.5 percent to close at $155.55 on Nasdaq.

The drug is part of a new class of LDL-lowering drugs that inhibit a protein known as PCSK9. LDL is also called bad cholesterol.

165,"  (Adds Amgen comment)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 29 Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States, on Wednesday said the cost of potent, newly approved cholesterol drugs could ""wreak financial havoc"" among its clients.U.S. regulators last Friday approved the first of the new medicines, Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  and Sanofi SA. Given every other week by injection, Regeneron said it will have a wholesale price of $1,120 for a 28-day supply. That comes to almost $15,000 a year.Standard older cholesterol fighters such as statins, including generic forms of Pfizer Inc's Lipitor and Merck & Co's Zocor, can cost less than $50 a month.A rival treatment from Amgen Inc, called Repatha, is expected to gain U.S. approval next month. The new drugs work by blocking the protein PCSK9, whose natural function is to prevent ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from being removed from the bloodstream. Express Scripts, which administers drug benefits for employers and health plans and also runs large mail-order pharmacies, has been challenging the rising cost of new medications.""While these drugs are being viewed as breakthroughs, they also have the potential to wreak financial havoc on clients who do not proactively manage"" their drug costs, Express Scripts President Tim Wentworth said during a conference call to discuss the company's quarterly earnings.Glen Stettin, a senior Express Scripts executive, said an estimated 70 million Americans have high cholesterol. He estimates fewer than 10 percent of them should qualify for Praluent, based on restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration, which limited the drug's use mostly to patients with a hereditary form of high cholesterol and people with cardiovascular disease.""The big worry for our clients, given the cost of these drugs, is whether they will be used beyond ways they were tested,"" Stettin said. Before getting their prescriptions filled, patients in Express Scripts plans will be asked for documentation of their diagnosis, their cholesterol levels, diet and maximum tolerated statin therapy, Stettin said.Express Scripts has become a vocal critic of highly priced medicines, including Sovaldi, an $84,000 hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc. A rival treatment from AbbVie Inc was approved late last year, and Express Scripts successfully pressured both companies to lower prices.Similarly, Stettin said the expected approval of Amgen's cholesterol fighter, Repatha, should help Express Scripts push for lower prices on both drugs.""We love competition because we know we can leverage that,"" Stettin said. He declined to estimate how big the discounts might be.Officials at Regeneron were not available to comment. Amgen, in an emailed statement, said it believes its Repatha will offer value for those who need to further reduce their LDL. ""We look forward to working with payers to ensure that these patients can access Repatha, and that it fits within the needs of the overall healthcare system,"" the company said.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)       The two U.S. personal care products companies, Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co, report results for the fourth-quarter and second quarter, respectively. Both companies, with big operations outside the United States, have been working to reduce the impact of a stronger dollar on sales. While Colgate has raised prices in emerging markets, P&G is setting up manufacturing plants there to localize supply chain activities. Both companies are expected to beat analysts' estimates on revenue, but miss on profit, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Investors will be keen on any forecast updates and changes in strategy.      The Commerce Department's data is likely to show the U.S. economy expanded at a much faster pace in the second quarter. The gross domestic product is projected to have risen at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, compared with a contraction of 0.2 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter. (0830/1230) Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits is expected to have advanced 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 270,000. (0830/1230) Separately, the U.S. Census Bureau will issue ""Advance Report: U.S. International Trade in Goods"" for June, which will contain statistics for international trade in goods on a Census basis by principal end-use category.      Amgen Inc is expected to report higher second-quarter sales and profit and may revise its full-year forecasts. Investors will be looking for details on the company's plans for the European launch of its recently approved injectable cholesterol treatment, as well as its expectations for the drug's U.S. approval and launch in the coming weeks.      Cigna Corp, which agreed to be bought by larger rival Anthem Inc, is expected to report a rise in second-quarter profit. The company specializes in employer-based healthcare.      Mondelez International Inc, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company has been grappling with volatility in markets such as Europe, where sales have fallen for the last three quarters. Sales in North America were also weak last quarter partly due to a strategy change by Wal-Mart to reduce in-store displays, which hurt impulse-driven buying by customers. Investors will be looking for updates on the company's discussion with Wal-Mart to ""revisit"" the strategy change, as well as on market conditions in Europe and progress on the sale of its French coffee brand Carte Noir.      Cable provider Time Warner Cable Inc, which is being bought by Charter Communications, is expected to report second-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Last quarter, the company added 30,000 residential video customers, its first increase since 2009 and well above analysts' estimates, indicating a turnaround for the company. Analysts are looking for any update on the deal, future investments and guidance.      LinkedIn Corp, the professional social network is expected to report second-quarter revenue slightly above analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Investors will keep a close watch on the company's hiring business, in which revenue growth slowed to 36 percent in the first quarter.

Finnish network equipment maker Nokia Corp reports second-quarter results on the same week it is expected to finalize a deal to sell its HERE map business to Germany's premium car makers for between 2.5 billion and 3 billion euros. Nokia is shedding HERE as part of efforts to focus on integrating its planned acquisition of France's Alcatel-Lucent.      Broadcom Corp, the wireless chip maker is expected to report better-than-expected profit and revenue for the second-quarter, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company has been benefiting from strong demand for Apple Inc's iPhone 6, launched last September, and Samsung Electronics Inc Ltd's Galaxy S6, launched in April. Investors will be looking for details on whether Broadcom's exit from the baseband chips business is creating competitive disadvantage due to the lack of a 4G product.      T-Mobile US Inc, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, is expected to report second-quarter revenue ahead of analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by customer wins who are drawn to its low cost plans. The company's profit, however, is expected to take a hit from costs related to an aggressive marketing campaign. Last quarter T-Mobile unveiled its ""Mobile without Borders"" plan, which offers free calling, texting and high-speed data services at no extra cost, for certain U.S customers traveling in Mexico and Canada. The move is aimed at helping it compete better with AT&T Inc, which is strengthening its presence in Mexico.      Electronic Arts Inc, the video game publisher known for titles such as ""FIFA"" and ""Madden NFL"", is expected to report first-quarter profit above analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.

CME Group Inc reports second-quarter earnings, after closing its open-outcry futures trading pits because of the shift of volume to computers.      A year on from the soccer World Cup, the world's largest beer maker Anheuser Busch Inbev SA is unlikely to experience much of a bump in volumes in Brazil in the second quarter. Still the company has forecast a growth of premium lagers there, growing sales in Mexico and China and better performance in the United States, which may mean a lesser decline, rather than growth, than in 2014 after having reported falling volumes in all but one of the past six years.      Diageo plc, the world's largest spirits company, reports full-year results. There will be questions about recent changes in management, including its chief financial officer going to run North America. A replacement CFO has not been named yet.      ConocoPhillips, the largest independent U.S. energy company, reports second-quarter results. The company said it will reduce future spending on deepwater drilling due to low crude oil prices, and also raise its dividend.      U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp is expected to report a higher second-quarter profit, helped by strong margins. Gasoline crack spreads, the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices, have risen on weak crude prices and robust gasoline demand. The company expanded into natural gas processing with its $15.6 billion acquisition of MarkWest Energy Partners LP announced earlier this month. Investors will for details on the company's expectations for the natural gas processing business.      U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp is expected to report a rise in second-quarter profit, helped by robust demand for gasoline and a steep fall in oil prices.

Goldcorp Inc, the world's most valuable gold miner, is expected to report a decline in second-quarter earnings, as the price of bullion continues to drop.

Oil producer Penn West Petroleum Ltd is expected to announce a second-quarter loss, compared with a year-ago profit, hurt by weak oil prices. Investors will look for comments on the company's plans to improve liquidity, cut costs and possible asset sales.

Canada's Cameco Corp, one of the biggest uranium producers in the world, reports second-quarter results. Of interest is any update on production guidance for Cigar Lake, its newest mine in northern Saskatchewan. The company has said forest fires have not affected operations.      Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV reports second-quarter results.

Investors will be looking for updates on strategic and financial alternatives announcement made last quarter.      Western Union Co, the world's largest money-transfer company, is expected to report a second-quarter profit, helped by higher fees from its money-transfer services.

The company has cut prices and invested heavily in its online and mobile businesses to better compete with fast-growing rivals Xoom and privately owned Boom Financial.      Scientific instruments maker PerkinElmer Inc will report marginally better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by strong demand for its screening tests for newborns in developing markets. The company, which also sells environmental and food safety testing equipment, had cut its full-year earnings forecast in April due to a stronger dollar. The company, which gets more than half of its revenue from sales outside the United States, may raise its full-year guidance.      Tempur Sealy International Inc, the world's largest bedding maker by revenue, is expected to report second-quarter profit above analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, benefiting from higher sales in North America. Tempur Sealy removed its Chief Executive Mark Sarvary in May, two days after shareholders voted to remove him from the board. Investors will be looking for updates on the search for a new CEO, changes in strategy under its newly formed board as well as any changes to full-year forecasts.

Outerwall Inc, the operator of Redbox video rental kiosks, is expected to post a second-quarter profit above analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Outerwall, which also operates coin-exchange kiosks under the Coinstar brand, has been reining in costs in recent quarters to combat a decline in DVD rentals as people switch to streaming movies. Outerwall has also been ramping up its ecoATM brand of electronics recycling kiosks, which have contributed to revenue growth. Investors will look for any updates to the company's plans and forecast for the remainder of 2015.      Virgin America Inc's U.S. focus has insulated it from the effects of a strong dollar, which crimped revenues this year at its rivals with international exposure. The company is also not a party in the Justice Department's investigation into whether some U.S. airlines worked together illegally to keep air fares high by signaling plans to limit flights. Still, investors across the industry have voiced concern that airlines are not cutting capacity fast enough to match slowing domestic demand. When Virgin America reports its second-quarter results, investors' focus will be on the company's capacity forecast for the rest of the year and whether lower fuel costs have been able to offset rising costs and wages.      Coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a bigger second-quarter loss, hurt by tepid demand for both steel-making coal and thermal coal. The company is reportedly in talks with restructuring advisers as it seeks to reduce its debt. Depressed coal prices for the last four years have forced rivals such as Walter Energy Inc and Patriot Coal to file for bankruptcy in the last two months.      Mexico's central bank is expected to hold its key rate at 3.0 percent, thanks to tame inflation and despite a dramatic tumble in the peso to a new record low this month. Most of Mexico's central bankers think inflation will remain below their 3 percent target for the rest of the year because of the sluggish economy.

A sharp selloff in Chinese shares over the past weeks has stoked concerns about a slowdown in growth in the world's second-biggest economy.At 9:50 a.m. ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 58.66 points, or 0.33 percent, at 17,687.32, the S&P 500 was down 1.85 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,106.78 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.62 points, or 0.07 percent, at 5,132.41.Seven of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were higher with the utilities index's 1.13 percent rise leading the advancers. The energy index fell 1.9 percent.Wall Street ended flat on Thursday as investors digested ho-hum corporate earnings and new data showed that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter. With more than half of the S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results, analysts expect overall earnings to edge up 1 percent and revenue to decline 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Earnings beating expectations is all well and good but revenue growth hasn't been encouraging and that's the real fly in the ointment, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.Valuations remain a concern. The S&P 500 is trading near 16.8 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.LinkedIn shares fell 9.4 percent to $206.19 after the operator of the biggest social networking site for professionals reported a bigger net loss.Expedia rose 10.2 percent to $118.78 after the company posted a second-quarter profit above analysts' expectations and announced a larger dividend.YRC Worldwide soared 24.5 percent to $19.02 a day after the trucking company reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,837 to 898. On the Nasdaq, 1,332 issues rose and 969 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 30 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 36 new highs and 31 new lows.

The study tested the safety, tolerability and efficacy of romosozumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis that had been previously treated with the commonly used therapy, bisphosphonate. More than 5 percent of patients on romosozumab experienced adverse events like common cold, join pain, back pain and headache, Amgen said on Tuesday.Romosozumab is being developed with Belgium's UCB SA.

Other companies such as Eli Lilly, Biogen and Roche are developing injectable antibody drugs to target beta-amyloid, which have shown some promise in clinical trials.BACE inhibitors would be more convenient, since they are pills, and they also offer an opportunity to intervene earlier in the disease process -- but they are further behind in development and have yet to prove themselves in clinical trials. Novartis' experimental compound CNP520, currently in early Phase I/IIa studies, will be the lead BACE inhibitor molecule. CNP520 is planned to be included in a prevention study in people with a genetic risk of developing Alzheimer's, in collaboration with the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in the United States.The product is relatively late to the party, since Merck already has a BACE inhibitor in Phase III development, with data expected in 2017, while AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly started a large Phase II/III study in December. But Novartis believes CNP520 has a particularly attractive profile and could potentially avoid some of the side effects seen with some other BACE products, such as fluid build-up.Under the Alzheimer's deal, Amgen will pay an undisclosed upfront payment and milestone payments as well as disproportional research and development costs for a period, followed by a 50/50 cost and profit share arrangement.For migraine, the collaboration will focus on Amgen's experimental drugs AMG 334, currently in Phase III, and AMG 301, in Phase I.

Prices have yet to be determined for other European Union markets. Repatha is a so-called PCSK9 inhibitor, which is more powerful than cheap statin pills that are effective for most people with high cholesterol.A rival PCSK9 product called Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, which has a U.S. price tag of $14,600, is still awaiting final European approval.Both drugs are expected to generate more than $2 billion a year each in sales by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.The fact that U.S. drug prices are often significantly higher than those in other markets has led to persistent complaints that Americans effectively subsidize the rest of the world in paying for drug development.While PCSK9 drugs could help millions of people who fail to hit their LDL goals on statins, managers of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers say their high cost could ""wreak havoc"" on the healthcare system. Manufacturers, however, argue that the drugs can save money by preventing heart attacks and keeping patients out of costly hospital beds. As the medicines consist of antibodies, they are also more expensive to make than conventional statins.CARDIOLOGISTS DEBATE USE  The question of how PCSK9 drugs should be prescribed has dominated debate at this week's annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in London. Many heart specialists believe they will be given sparingly, at least at first. In Europe, in particular, demand is likely to be curbed by budget-conscious governments, many of which have set up healthcare cost agencies to assess new drug use.In Britain, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is expected to issue guidance next April on whether Repatha should be used on the state health service.A desire by companies to ensure products are recommended by such agencies is one reason why drug prices are often set lower in Europe than in the United States.An Amgen spokeswoman said prices were set to reflect ""the unique healthcare environment and marketplace"" of different countries.Lars Ryden, a cardiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said he expected PCSK9 costs would come down within a couple of years as other companies, like Pfizer, enter the market. But for the time being authorities will be cautious. ""I'm quite sure that in Sweden the use will be very selective,"" he told Reuters.Austrian cardiologist Heinz Drexel said the new drugs were likely to be reserved at first mainly for patients with severe familial high cholesterol or those suffering successive heart attacks.Among his acute coronary syndrome patients, Drexel said he expected to give PCSK9 injections to only a ""single digit percent"" over the coming year.

190,"  * Cheaper copies of biotech drugs promise big savings* Zarxio priced at 15 pct less than Amgen's Neupogen* Amgen unsuccessful in attempt to block Zarxio launch   (Adds Amgen comment)By Ben Hirschler and Michael ShieldsLONDON/ZURICH, Sept 3 Novartis kicked off a new era in U.S. medicine on Thursday with the launch of the first ""biosimilar"" copy of a biotechnology drug approved in the United States, at a discount of 15 percent to the original.The Swiss drugmaker's generics unit Sandoz said Zarxio, its form of Amgen's white blood cell-boosting product Neupogen, would increase access to an important treatment by offering a ""high-quality, more affordable version"".U.S. biotech group Amgen had tried to stop the sale of Zarxio, also known as filgrastim-sndz, but the Washington-based appeals court rejected its attempt to block the launch. The potential for copycats to take business from original biotech drug brands is increasingly grabbing investors' attention, although uncertainties remain as to how quickly so-called biosimilars will win business.Biosimilars have been on the market in Europe since 2006. However, the U.S. regulatory pathway for biosimilars, which are made in living cells and can never be exact replicas of originals, was only established by a healthcare reform in 2010.Amgen said it intended to compete effectively with the new product and would base promotion on its 24 years of clinical experience with Neupogen. ""All biologics, including biosimilars, are highly complex molecules and each manufacturer's product will be distinct,"" the U.S. drugmaker said in a statement.The arrival of biosimilars threatens companies heavily reliant on biotech drugs, such as Amgen, AbbVie and Roche, and Citigroup analysts have predicted a transfer of at least $110 billion of value from innovator companies to copycat producers in the next decade. As a result, investors have been watching the Zarxio case closely, since it could determine the way in which a wave of other lower-cost biosimilars are received by regulators, courts and healthcare providers.ANTIBODY DRUGS NEXT  Novartis said the U.S. wholesale list price for a 300 microgram syringe of Zarxio was $275.66, with the 480 mcg version costing $438.98. Neupogen costs $324.30 and $516.45 for the same syringe formulations, according to Amgen.The 15 percent discount is the same price gap set when Zarxio was launched in Europe in 2009, although the discount in Europe has since widened to an average of around 20 to 30 percent.Insurers hope biosimilars will eventually cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original brands.Neupogen is a $1.2 billion-a-year medicine for Amgen that boosts white blood cell counts to fight infections in cancer patients. The majority of its sales are generated in the United States.An even bigger prize lies in the development of copies of multibillion-dollar antibody drugs for the treatment of diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, where Sandoz and rivals are also working to bring products to market.Express Scripts, the largest manager of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers, has estimated the United States could save $250 billion between 2014 and 2024 if 11 of the likeliest biosimilars reach the market.

Praluent, which is given every other week by injection in doses of 75 mg or 150 mg.Praluent has a U.S. price of $14,600 for a year of treatment, while Repatha costs about $14,100.

209,"   By Sinead Carew | Sept 29  Sept 29 A seven-day selloff of U.S. biotechnology stocks has hit sector investors - especially hedge funds - hard. But some managers say it was overdone and are already eyeing bargains such as Gilead Sciences Inc and Amgen Inc.The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has fallen 18.7 percent over the last seven sessions as investors took flight after Hillary Clinton, front-runner to be the Democratic nominee in next year's U.S. presidential election, vowed on Sept. 21 to take steps to curb high drug prices. Since its July 20 high, the index has fallen around 27 percent.The selloff was exacerbated by general market volatility as investors have been grappling with uncertainty about when policy makers will raise U.S. interest rates and concerns over the global economy.Biotech stocks, which had risen 31 percent this year to their July high after annual increases for the last six years, were also in sellers' sights because they had become richly valued. And the selling was intensified as investment managers did not want to issue third quarter reports showing big holdings in a beaten-down sector.""What you're seeing is that generalist money is getting very worried and thinking that maybe the healthcare trade is over and they're rotating into something else,"" said John Fraunces, co-portfolio manager of the $137 million Turner Medical Sciences Long-Short fund in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.Health-focused hedge funds including Baker Brothers Advisors, Healthcor Management, Palo Alto Investors, and Deerfield Management are each nursing losses of more than 10 percent for September based on their publicly disclosed portfolio at the end of June, data calculated by industry tracking firm Symmetric IO show.Symetric data points to broad holdings of specialty biopharmaceutical company Horizon Pharma, which has tumbled 47.3 percent in the last 7 days and which was listed in six hedge fund portfolios. The stock was a big holding for Deerfield, which manages $7.5 billion, for Healthcor, which oversees $2.6 billion, and for Broadfin Capital, which has held the stock for nearly two years. Horizon Pharma's losses also weighed on Iguana Healthcare Management.At the same time, a sharp drop in pharmaceutical company Valeant  weighed on a number of hedge funds, including prominent activists Pershing Square Capital Management and Jana Partners.A lot of selling took place in healthcare ETFs such as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology EFT, which fell almost 19 percent in the last seven days with an average daily trading volume that was 1.6 times higher than its 50 day average. NIBBLES AROUND THE EDGES In the options market, most of the activity was still on the side of expecting further declines, with protective puts outweighing other biotech index trades. But some traders appear to have been snapping up call options in hopes for a sharp rebound, said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global.""People who are in the sector are looking for hedges and people who are not in it are looking for bargains,"" he said. Fraunces has been shorting the ETF, but now he and other investors are already eyeing bargains in the sector. He has been moving money to companies including Horizon Pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest casualties in the biotech sell-off.Some big name stocks, such as Gilead, Amgen, Biogen Inc  and Celgene Corp have sold off sharply enough to make their valuations attractive, according to several investors.Gilead's forward valuation of 8.1 is now less than half its 10-year median of 16.7 and its competitors' average valuations of 14.4. Amgen's forward P/E is 12.5 compared with an average valuation of 16 for its peers. Meanwhile the S&P 500's forward P/E was 15.4 on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data.""That's pretty unusual because the absolute growth rate for those companies is two to three times higher than the S&P,"" said Sven Borho, founding general partner and fund manager at health science investment specialist Orbimed Advisors LLC, in New York.High valuations prompted Seattle-based Smead Capital Management to cut biotech and pharma holdings in its $1.2 billion Smead Value Investor fund in the last 18 months to 16.5 percent from 29 percent, Tony Scherrer, director of research said.But Scherrer, now interested in Amgen and Gilead, described the last week's ETF trading as ""throwing out the baby with the bathwater.""

210,"   By Bill Berkrot and Krista Hughes | NEW YORK/ATLANTA  NEW YORK/ATLANTA Oct 5 The Pacific trade deal agreed on Monday, which grants biotechnology drug producers less protection than offered by the United States, could put more downward pressures on the costly drugs' pricing in the industry's most lucrative market.The United States and 11 trading partners, including Mexico, Japan, Canada and Australia, wrapped up five years of talks after securing a compromise on protection for biotech drugs that would help determine when less expensive versions known as biosimilars can enter the market. [ID: nL3N1252R6]The terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership give drugmakers at least five and potentially up to eight years of protection of data needed to produce biosimilar medicines. Countries can sign on for a minimum of five years of data exclusivity that with added time for regulatory processes, would in effect provide a ""comparable outcome"" to an eight-year time frame.The agreement falls far short of the 12 years of data protection enforced in the United States and which U.S. lobby groups representing biotech and pharmaceutical companies from Amgen Inc to Pfizer Inc sought to extend to other nations.The United States could still maintain 12 years in its own market, since the trade deal language only sets minimum standards.Over time, however, the longer protection period compared with its trading partners could come under pressure at home, where anger over rising costs of medicines is growing among doctors, patients and some lawmakers.""If you see too much of a price discrepancy (between the United States and trade partners), at some point you're going to see a push back,"" said Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities which focuses on smaller biotechs.U.S. lobbies representing pharmaceutical and biotech companies voiced their disappointment that the negotiators failed to uphold the 12-year period as an international standard. ""This term was not a random number, but the result of a long debate in Congress, which determined that this period of time captured the appropriate balance that stimulated research but gave access to biosimilars in a timely manner,"" Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America CEO John Castellani said.Early launch of biosimilars outside the United States could  hit overseas sales of the larger biotechs, such as Amgen, Celgene and Biogen, and pharmaceutical companies with important biotech drugs, such as new cancer treatments from Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb .Many of those companies are hedging their bets by developing their own biosimilars of rivals' drugs, including copycat versions of AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine which is on track for $14 billion in sales this year.The Nasdaq Biotech Index, which had been up earlier on Monday, turned negative and was off about 0.7 percent.However, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, which supports the development of biosimilars, said the agreement hit the right balance between innovation and saving lives. SIMILAR, NOT THE SAME As the cost of biotech medicines for cancer and other diseases has surged to more than $100,000 per treatment regimen, U.S. health insurers, medical societies and politicians are pushing for greater discounts and the faster introduction of competing treatments.Biologics, which are made from living cells and therefore tougher to replicate than conventional pharmaceuticals, now account for about one-quarter of U.S. spending on drugs. That amounted to $93 billion in 2013, according to consultancy EY. They are expected to contribute to a surge in costs over the next decade as new, and far more expensive, treatments reach the market. As a result, some U.S. consumer advocates sided with countries looking to significantly shorten data protection, beyond the de-facto eight year period and the 12-year protection advocated by the industry.Such critics say it protects the interests of the drug industry by making it almost impossible for Congress to set a shorter period even if it wanted to do so because the trade agreement would prevent this.""Why should we pay more than the rest of the world?,"" said KJ Hertz, analyst with AARP, which lobbies on behalf of U.S. seniors. AARP sided with a 5-year minimum proposed by Australia and others. ""We want an agreement that leaves flexibility to make changes to U.S. law.""Data protection, which refers to the information on a new biotech drug that is submitted to regulators, differs from traditional patent protection, which typically runs 20 years.Since it is impossible to produce exact copies of biotech drugs, drugmakers fear that their original patents could be circumvented with access to the data on the molecules and other scientific research needed to produce them.WBB Securities' Brozak said one of the biggest losers from the new trade pact could be smaller biotechs, many of which do not yet have revenue but are developing the breakthrough medicines of the future.For example, the work of smaller company Pharmasset led to the development of the first drug that cured hepatitis C in nearly all patients. Gilead Sciences Inc bought the company in 2012 and has since seen billions of dollars in sales for the drug. But Gilead may never have made the bet if it could not enjoy a long enough period of protection, Brozak argues.""The period of exclusivity draws the investors to these companies,"" said Brozak.

212,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Oct 12 The odds that Merck & Co's  high-stakes cholesterol drug will succeed have dropped dramatically after Eli Lilly and Co said its similar medicine failed to reduce heart attacks and strokes, top U.S. heart doctors said.Lilly on Monday said it was halting a 12,000-patient study of its drug, evacetrapib, an oral medication. In earlier studies, the treatment cut ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by 30 to 35 percent and doubled the levels of ""good"" LDL cholesterol. But the influence on cholesterol levels did not ultimately improve patients' health, dashing hopes for this approach to treating heart disease.Merck's anacetrapib is now the only drug in a novel class known as CETP inhibitors that remains in late-stage trials. Data from a 30,000-patient study is expected by 2017 to show whether it reduces the incidence of heart attack and strokes. Wall Street analysts have estimated the drug could reap eventual annual sales of up to $10 billion, if approved.But with the outlook dimmed for CETP inhibitors, Wall Street analysts on Monday predicted a boost to a competing class of drugs just approved for the U.S. market that work by sharply lowering LDL cholesterol. Shares in Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals rose on expectations the Lilly decision removed a competitive threat to sales of their injectable drugs, which block a protein called PCSK9.""CETP inhibitors as legitimate drug targets are dead as of today,"" said Dr. P.K. Shah, director of atherosclerosis research at Cedars-Sinai Heart Center in Los Angeles, referring to Lilly's setback. ""For cardiologists looking for heart protection, these drugs were a dream, but they haven't come true."" Dr. Steve Nissen, head of cardiology for the Cleveland Clinic, noted that Lilly's failure follows the demise of two other high-profile drugs in the same class. Pfizer's Inc's  torcetrapib was discontinued in 2006 due to safety worries, while Roche Holding AG's dalcetrapib was terminated in 2012 for lack of benefit.""In baseball you don't get four strikes,"" he said of prospects for Merck's candidate. Nissen was chairman of the halted Lilly study, which involved trials at 540 sites in 37 countries.Merck, in an emailed statement, said it looks forward to better understanding Lilly's decision to pull the plug on evacetrapib, but remains confident in its own drug's potential success. CETP inhibitors block a protein that transfers HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol, resulting in higher levels of HDL and lower LDL levels. Statins, by contrast, work by reducing the liver's production of cholesterol.Amgen and Regeneron's treatments work by blocking a protein named PSCK9 whose normal function in the body is to maximize the presence of LDL cholesterol that enters the bloodstream. However, investors are still waiting for proof that PCSK9 inhibitors actually reduce heart attacks and strokes, and don't just reduce cholesterol. Data from such an ""outcomes"" trial for Regeneron's Praluent are expected by late 2016, while those from Repatha's trial are due in 2017.Dr. Allen Taylor, chief of cardiology at MedStar Heart and Vascular Institute in Washington, D.C., said it would be unwise to assume the PCSK9 inhibitors are heart-protective just because they slash LDL levels.""Until you see the trial results, all bets are off,"" he said.Should Merck's own outcomes data for anacetrapib prove positive, the pill could be a much preferred method for patients over the injections required for PCSK9 treatments.Lilly shares closed down 7.8 percent on Monday. Merck slipped 0.5 percent. Regeneron shares jumped 4.5 percent, while its PCSK9 partner, Sanofi SA, rose 1.3 percent in Paris. Amgen shares rose 2.4 percent.

213,"   By Deena Beasley  Oct 16 The most influential source for U.S. oncology treatment guidelines on Friday unveiled ratings aimed at helping doctors and patients assess the costs versus benefits of current therapies for two types of blood cancer.The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), a nonprofit alliance of 26 leading cancer centers, said its new ""Evidence Blocks"" for multiple myeloma and chronic myelogenous leukemia are the first in a series that by the end of next year will encompass all oncology therapies, other than surgery or radiation. The blocks give each therapy a score of between one and five in five categories: efficacy, safety, quality and consistency of evidence and affordability. They will supplement NCCN's widely followed guidelines for oncology care.In examples released on Friday, NCCN rated primary treatments for CML: Bristol-Myers Squibb's Sprycel, and Novartis AG's Gleevec and Tasigna. Ratings for all three were nearly identical: highly effective and very expensive. For newly diagnosed myeloma patients eligible for a stem cell transplant, NCCN lists six ""preferred"" regimens, four of which contain Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's Velcade and various chemotherapies, one that includes Celgene Corp's  Revlimid and another that combines Velcade and Revlimid. The Velcade/Revlimid/dexamethasone regimen is rated as the most effective and the most expensive. NCCN lists Amgen Inc's Kyprolis, in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone, as another upfront therapy for myeloma. The Kyprolis regimen was rated highly effective, mildly toxic, average in terms of evidence, mainly consistent in terms of trial data, and very expensive.Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, while CML starts in certain blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in about 27,000 Americans each year, and CML is occurs in about 7,000, according to the American Cancer Society.

214,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON A first-in-class drug from Amgen based on a tumour-killing virus was given a green light by European regulators on Friday, paving the way for its approval within a couple of months.The decision is a further milestone for a technology that has long fascinated scientists but has previously proved difficult to harness.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its experts had recommended approval of Imlygic, also known as talimogene laherparepvec or ""T-Vec"", for treating melanoma, making it another option among several new drugs for the most deadly form of skin cancer.“Viral immunotherapy represents a completely new way of treating cancer, so it’s extremely exciting to see T-Vec become the first treatment of this type to gain the green light from European regulators,"" said Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London.The drug is recommended for treating melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery and has spread without affecting internal organs.  Imlygic uses a herpes simplex virus, the type that causes cold sores, which has been modified to only infect cancer cells. It is injected directly into tumours where it replicates and causes cancer cells to rupture and die, also stimulating a system-wide immune response.Until three years ago, chemotherapy was the only available treatment for patients whose melanoma had spread. But recently there have been a number of new treatments, including immunotherapies, BRAF V600 inhibitors and MEK inhibitors.Despite this progress, the EMA said there was still a need for new treatments with acceptable safety profiles to continue to improve the outlook for patients.

The company said it is studying the drug in combination with other immunotherapies in advanced melanoma and other solid tumor cancers. This represents the sixth U.S. approval for Amgen in the last 12 months, including another cancer drug, Blincyto, and its potent new cholesterol fighter Repatha.The U.S. Imlygic approval was widely expected after an advisory panel to the FDA in April voted 22-1 to support its approval, despite a lack of definitive overall survival data on the treatment.

Novartis in September launched the first biosimilar drug in the United States after a U.S. appeals court declined to stop the sale of the company's copycat version of Amgen's blockbuster cancer drug Neupogen.Insurers and government healthcare systems hope biosimilars will cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original drugs and experience in Europe suggests that steep discounts are being offered in some markets.The potential for biosimilars to take a large slice of the market is grabbing the attention of both healthcare providers, who see big budget savings, and investors, worried about the impact on the profits of companies making original products.

228,"   By Bill Berkrot  Amgen Inc on Wednesday said it filed with U.S. health regulators seeking approval to sell its first biosimilar drug, which would be a less expensive alternative to AbbVie's Humira, the world's top-selling prescription medicine.Amgen said its drug, ABP 501, has demonstrated clinical equivalence and comparable safety to Humira (adalimumab) in late stage clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and the skin condition plaque psoriasis.Data to support the switching of patients from Humira to  ABP 501 was included in the submission to regulators, Amgen said. Several companies developing biosimilars are targeting Humira, which is still growing with annual sales approaching $13 billion. Amgen said it believes it is the first to seek approval of a Humira biosimilar with the Food and Drug Administration using the new approval pathway outlined by the agency. Unlike cheap generic versions of traditional chemical drugs, biotech medicines are made from living cells and cannot be exactly copied, thus the term biosimilar, and the need to demonstrate clinical equivalence with the target biologic treatment.Because they are far more complicated to produce, biosimilars will not offer the huge discounts of standard generics, but they are still expected to eventually generate billions of dollars in healthcare savings. ""Amgen's branded biologic medicines and biosimilars are developed and manufactured according to the same high standards, and we are committed to delivering high-quality medicines to patients with serious inflammatory diseases,"" Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.The first biosimilar approved in the United States earlier this year is a cheaper version of Amgen's infection-fighting white blood cell booster Neupogen, produced by Swiss drugmaker Novartis. While several other Amgen products are likely to eventually face competition from less expensive versions, the world's largest biotechnology company has ambitious plans to profit from the new market for biosimilars as well.The company last year said it was developing biosimilars of nine blockbuster medicines, with plans to begin launches in 2017.

244,"  Jan 28 Amgen Inc on Thursday reported much higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, helped by increased sales of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and lower costs, and the company raised its 2016 profit forecast.Amgen said it now expects 2016 adjusted earnings of $10.60 to $11.00 per share, up from its prior view of $10.35 to $10.75, reflecting U.S. congressional approval of the research and development tax credit and delays in competition from biosimilar versions of some of its products. Analysts on average were estimating 2016 earnings of $10.67 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The world's largest biotechnology company posted a net profit of $1.8 billion, or $2.37 per share, compared with a profit of $1.29 billion, or $1.68 a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Amgen said it had adjusted earnings of $2.61. Analysts on average expected $2.29 per share.

246,"  Feb 15 Biopharmaceutical company Amgen Inc  said on Monday its Aranesp drug met its primary goal of reducing the incidence of red blood cell transfusions in anemic patients suffering from Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) in a phase 3 trial.MDS, which is among the most common type of bone marrow failure syndromes in adults, occurs when blood cells do not mature in the bone marrow, putting patients at risk of infection, anemia or bleeding.The company said Aranesp also significantly improved erythroid response, a key measure of the formation of new red blood cells. Amgen said data from the trial was consistent with the known safety profile of Aranesp and the adverse effects were generally balanced between those given the drug in the trial and those given a placebo. However, adverse effects such as fatigue, pyrexia, headache and myalgia were at least five percent more frequent than the placebo group. Amgen last year reached a $71 million settlement with 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia to resolve claims that it promoted Enbrel and Aranesp drugs for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The company was accused by authorities of marketing Aranesp for off-label uses, such as to treat anemia caused by cancer.Aranesp sales totaled $1.93 billion in 2014.

249,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Amgen Inc.'s (Amgen)  Swiss franc-denominated notes offering a 'BBB' rating.  The company intends to use the net proceeds from this issue to repay outstanding  indebtedness, including borrowings under a term loan credit agreement, to  repurchase shares of common stock and for general corporate purposes.  The notes are rated at the same level as Amgen's Long-term Issuer Default  Rating, as they represent senior unsecured obligations of the company The company had USD31.6bn of debt outstanding at end-2015, which are also rated  at 'BBB'.  A full list of Amgen's ratings is available at the end of this commentary. Amgen's profitability improved during 2015. This is largely the result of a  change in the Enbrel co-promotion agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) resulting  in declining royalty payments to Pfizer through 2016. Fitch expects further  margin expansion in 2016, driven by increasing sales, improving mix, lower  royalty payments to Pfizer, additional cost savings. Growth of a number of established products, progress with ramping up newer  medicines and advancing pipeline projects should help to offset some of the risk  of anticipated branded and biosimilar competition to Neulasta, Neupogen and  Epogen.  Amgen has made significant progress with its drug development pipeline during  the past two years with a number of key approvals and positive clinical data for  other projects in late-stage development. Fitch expects Amgen to continue generating solid free cash flow (FCF: cash from  operations less capital expenditure and dividends) of at least USD6bn annually,  representing about a 30% FCF margin, supported by improving sales and margins,  modestly offset by an increasing dividend. At 3.0x Amgen's gross debt-to-EBITDA is at the high end of the range for its  'BBB' rating. In 2015, the company issued USD3.5bn of debt to fund share  repurchases, which offset the deleveraging from EBITDA growth driven by recently  strong operational performance.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Continued Margin Improvement Expected  Fitch expects Amgen's margins will continue to improve during the intermediate  term. EBITDA margin will benefit from an improving sales mix, and a reduction in  selling, general and administration expense. The declining royalty payments by  Amgen to Pfizer associated with the start of a three-year phase out period for  the co-promotion agreement of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada will also support  margin improvement in 2016. In addition, prioritisation of product pipeline  projects has reduced research and development spending as a percentage of sales.  Younger Portfolio Products Growing Newer therapies such as XGEVA (bone metastases), Prolia (osteoporosis), Nplate  (thrombocytopenia), Vectibix (metastatic colorectal cancer) and Kyprolis  (relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma) are posting strong double-digit  growth, as good clinical experience drives increased acceptance in the medical  community. These four products accounted for only 18% of sales during 2015  compared with 16% in 2014. Aggregrate growth for these five products was 23%  during 2015, while total sales grew 8% during the same period.  In addition,  2016 sales will benefit from recent market introductions of Repatha and Imlygic.  Significant Pipeline Progress Amgen has also experienced a number of successes in advancing products through  its pipeline. The company received FDA approval for Blincyto (acute  lymphoblastic leukemia) in December 2014, Corlanor (heart failure) in April  2015, Repatha (hyperlipidemia) in August 2015 and Imlygic (cancer) in October  2015. Brodalumumab (rheumatoid arthritis) and romosozumab (osteoporosis) have  generated positive clinical trial data. These drugs all have the potential to  improve outcomes in a number of patients that currently face sub-optimal  treatment options. Intellectual Property Challenges The base patent for Neulasta in the U.S. expired in October 2015, and in Europe  it expired in February 2015. International patents for Sensipar lapsed in  October 2015. In addition, the European patent for the second-generation  erythropoietin medicine, Aranesp, expired in August 2014. Collectively, these  maturing pharmaceuticals represent roughly 30% of total revenues that are at  risk to branded or biosimilar competition. Amgen has already lost patent protection in the U.S. for Epogen and Neupogen.  Teva's branded medication and Sandoz's recently-approved biosimilar therapy will  take share directly from Neupogen and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta, Amgen's  long-acting filagrastim treatment. However, the competing products will not  benefit from interchangeability with the originator biologics, requiring   competitors to spend on marketing and selling. This means that stiff price  competition will be less likely for Amgen's products. In addition, Amgen's  On-Body injector for Neulasta could help mitigate biosimilar competition. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for 2016 within the rating case for Amgen include: --Low to mid-single digit organic top-line growth driven by the uptake of new  product commercialisation offset by increased competitive pressure for some  established products .  --FCF of about USD6bn with   a roughly 50 bps improvement in the operating  EBITDA margin. --Cash deployment prioritised for dividends, share repurchases and targeted  acquisitions. --Gross leverage is maintained at or below 3.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  positive rating action include the following: --An upgrade of the ratings is not likely in the near-term given currently high  leverage; --An upgrade could occur if the company maintains leverage in the 2.2x to 2.6x  range and operational performance remains strong.  Negative: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Gross leverage sustained above 3.0x, which would likely result in a Negative  Outlook or a one-notch downgrade; --Stressed leverage driven by financial decisions that include debt-financed  share repurchases, dividends or acquisitions. In addition, operational stress  that decreases profitability, greater-than-expected biosimilar and brand name  drug competition and/or unsuccessful commercialisation of the late-stage  research pipeline can put ratings under pressure. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY The biggest risk to Amgen's liquidity profile is the increasing amount of cash  balances held overseas. The company had cash and short-term investments of  USD30bn on 30 September, 2015, of which only USD1.1bn resides domestically.   Unless the company chooses to repatriate cash, Fitch believes that Amgen will  continue to issue debt to fund domestic capital deployment, including payments  to shareholders.   Fitch forecasts FCF  to remain above USD6bn annually, representing a FCF margin  of around 30% through 2018, included a growing dividend that is currently at  USD2.26bn for the latest 12 months (LTM) to September 2015. FCF was USD6.6bn for  the LTM to September 2015. Additional liquidity comes from full availability of a recently amended and  extended USD2.5bn credit facility that matures on 30 July2019. The facility  backstops an untapped USD2.5bn commercial paper programme providing additional  financial flexibility. Fitch expects Amgen will refinance the vast majority of  its debt maturities. The company has roughly USD2.3bn of debt maturing in 2016,  USD4.3bn in 2017, USD2bn in 2018 and USD3.4bn in 2019.

250,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Calls in the U.S. presidential campaign to cut pharmaceutical prices are not helping to revive a barely two-month-old exchange-traded fund that invests in shares of generic drugmakers.In fact, low prices that define generic drugs may be the ETF's biggest stumbling block, analysts said this week.The Market Vectors Generic Drugs ETF, which fund manager Van Eck Associates Corp launched with $2.5 million in assets on Jan. 12, has fallen 5 percent through Wednesday and has failed to attract even $1 in new money, according to Lipper.The iShares Global Healthcare ETF, with three-quarters of its portfolio in pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, fell only 0.9 percent.The Market Vectors fund, which tracks the Indxx LLC-built generic index, is the only U.S. ETF built on shares of generic drugmakers, which have been languishing.Attacks on soaring drug prices by Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and other politicians have failed to boost profits on cheaper alternatives to patented branded drugs. Distributors like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc are squeezing prices of generics. ""Generic drugs are essentially commodity products chosen on cost and as the purchasers consolidate and exert their leverage we would expect downward pressure,"" said Michael Levesque, analyst for Moody's Corp.""There is a lot of discussion around drug-pricing reform and different initiatives such as letting Medicare negotiate drug pricing, but none of those become a reality unless Congress implements them through the passage of a law, and that has not happened despite the statements in campaigns.""Mylan NV, the Market Vectors ETF's fifth-largest holding, is off 16 percent this year after posting weak results and as investors panned the company's deal to acquire Swedish rival Meda AB. Another top holding, Endo International PLC, is off 29 percent this year in part after February earnings were dented by pricing pressure on its generic drugs. Two of the Market Vectors fund's top three holdings, Allergan Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, have lost value this year, while the third, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, has risen 6 percent.Enthusiasm has faded for biosimilars, drugs designed to have properties similar to those licensed previously, during the long wait for U.S. regulatory approval.Only one biosimilar, by Novartis AG, has come on the U.S. market. The treatment for chemotherapy side effects, designed to rival Amgen Inc's Neupogen, has been less successful than investors such as Andy Acker, manager of the Janus Global Life Sciences Fund, had expected. Amgen is Acker's top holding. Celltrion Inc, a top-10 holding of the Market Vectors generic ETF, backs a biosimilar drug expected to win approval. The stock has rallied 30 percent this year, but that has not been enough to make up for losses in the ETF's other stocks.Indxx LLC, whose index the Market Vectors generic ETF tracks, said 15 percent of the fund's returns come from companies that stand to profit from biosimilars, and that just half of its return comes from U.S. companies.""You tend to see a lot of companies get caught up in"" market selloffs, said James Duffy, ETF product manager for Van Eck. ""This is an area that we feel may have the potential to drive a lot of growth in the near future.""

251,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal jury upheld the validity of two Amgen Inc patents related to the company's newly-approved drug to reduce bad cholesterol, in a defeat for Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which make a rival drug.In a joint statement on Wednesday, Sanofi and Regeneron said they strongly disagreed with the verdict by jurors in Wilmington, Delaware upholding the validity of Amgen's patents, which followed a weeklong trial. Damages have yet to be set. The defendants said they plan to appeal to the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviews patent disputes.In its October 2014 lawsuit, Amgen sought to stop Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron from selling Praluent, a drug intended to lower bad LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9.Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha, and said Praluent infringed the Thousand Oaks, California-based company's patents related to the protein. Last summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent and Repatha to reduce bad cholesterol.U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson, who presided over the trial, is expected to consider whether to issue a permanent injunction against the sale of Praluent.Sanofi and Regeneron said the verdict will not keep them from selling Praluent for now. But they may owe royalties to Amgen if the litigation, following any appeals, ultimately concludes in Amgen's favor.Amgen in a statement said it was ""thankful"" for the verdict.The drugs are costlier than other treatments targeting bad cholesterol, with a list price topping $14,000 annually. Sales have been slow because insurers have resisted the cost, while many doctors are awaiting the results of clinical trials about whether the treatments also reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.""A permanent injunction is unlikely,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said in a research note.

255,"   By Bill Berkrot  Amgen Inc on Thursday reported much higher-than-expected first-quarter profit as sales of several key drugs beat Wall Street estimates, and the company significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast.The rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, bone fracture preventers Prolia and Xgeva and infection fighter Neulasta all performed better than analysts had projected.Excluding one-time items, the world's largest biotechnology company reported adjusted earnings of $2.90 per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 30 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Amgen said it now expected 2016 adjusted earnings of $10.85 to $11.20 per share, up from its prior forecast of $10.60 to $11.00 per share, and well ahead of analysts' average expectations of $10.82.Amgen slightly raised its full-year revenue forecast to $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion from $22 billion to $22.5 billion.Sales of Enbrel, which also treats psoriasis, jumped 24 percent to $1.39 billion, largely due to a price increase. Analysts had expected about $1.25 billion. Sales of Neulasta rose 4 percent to $1.18 billion, while Prolia sales jumped 29 percent to $352 million.""We expect continued growth from Prolia for years,""  commercial operations chief Tony Hooper told analysts on a conference call after the company released earnings. Quarterly results were also helped by payments from a licensing deal and a recently adopted accounting standard on how taxes are calculated on compensation.The company for the first time reported sales of its potent new cholesterol fighter, Repatha, which totaled just $16 million for the quarter. Insurers have made it difficult for patients prescribed with Repatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  to qualify for reimbursement. The policies are not expected to change until large studies prove the expensive treatments prevent heart attacks and deaths in addition to dramatically lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.""Ongoing results continue to be good as they manage the business while awaiting important clinical data to open up a multibillion-dollar product. That's pretty exciting,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said.Amgen has said it was expecting the first of those results in the second half of this year. ""We will continue to work with payers to improve access to Repatha,"" Hooper said, adding that cardiologists trying to get  the treatment for appropriate patients are ""extremely frustrated.""The company said net profit rose to $1.9 billion, or $2.50 per share, from $1.62 billion, or $2.11 per share, a year ago.

259,"  LONDON Two rival cholesterol-lowering injections from Sanofi and Amgen have been recommended by Britain's healthcare cost watchdog after the manufacturers offered special discounts to the country's state-run health service.Sanofi's Praluent, which was developed with Regeneron, and Amgen's Repatha are both so-called PCSK9 medicines that work in a different way to existing cholesterol fighters such as statins.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said in draft guidance on Friday that both drugs could be considered for use by people whose cholesterol is still not under control despite trying other treatments.It stressed that the medicines would only be cost-effective with the promised discounts.   Both drugs cost more than 4,000 pounds ($5,780) per patient a year in Britain. That is already a lot less than their U.S. list price of around $14,000, but Sanofi and Amgen have committed to discount the British price by a further undisclosed amount for the UK National Health Service. While Praluent and Repatha are both viewed by analysts as eventual multi-billion-dollar-a-year sellers, demand for the medicines in markets worldwide so far has proved disappointing.

260,"  NEW YORK May 11 Cigna Corp signed deals that will pay the makers of Repatha and Praluent, two powerful but pricey cholesterol lowering treatments, based on how well their customers respond to the medicines, the health insurer said on Wednesday.The treatments hit the market last year with a list price of more than $14,000 per year. They were approved for patients who are not able to adequately control ""bad cholesterol"" with statins, the most commonly prescribed drugs for cholesterol.

261,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer on Thursday took aim at an influential drug pricing watchdog, saying a critique of the company's new cholesterol lowering therapy was non-scientific.The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) last fall reviewed two new potent cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors. It concluded that the treatments should cost about 67 percent less than the list prices set by Regeneron with partner Sanofi, and by Amgen Inc.Health insurers have refused to cover the cost of the treatments in most cases, intensifying a high-profile fight over rising drug prices. ICER began doing value-based analyses last year with a review of new hepatitis C drugs, and has become a prominent voice casting doubt on the price and value of medications.Schleifer emphasized the importance of value-based drug pricing. On Wednesday, health insurer Cigna Corp said it had reached new reimbursement contracts for the cholesterol medicines based on how well they perform for patients. Speaking at the Financial Times U.S. Healthcare & Life Sciences Summit, Schleifer said ICER's method, which reduced the value of the treatments based on its assumption of what the United States could afford, lacked scientific basis.""They did all the calculations and they said it's X, which is ok. I could have lived with that. But ... they said society can't afford X, so we are going to say it's one-third X,"" Schleifer said during a panel discussion. ""They had value-based pricing, but they just decided that well we can't afford it. That wasn't scientific. There was no intellectual honesty there."" ICER Chief Operating Officer Sarah Emond, on a panel with Schleifer, countered that budget impact is part of the equation. ""You're attacking the science of an independent non-profit whose entire mission is tied to opening the black box of pricing,"" she said. Insurers and the government say value-based pricing can help keep drug prices from climbing too fast. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said at the conference that it is ""incumbent upon our industry to make sure we are moving towards more outcomes based models.""The new cholesterol fighters were approved for patients with a hereditary form of extreme high cholesterol and those with heart disease. Clinical data designed to show whether they can reduce the risk of heart attack and death in addition to lowering cholesterol are expected late this year and could help  expand their reach to more patients.

262,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to Amgen  Inc.'s (Amgen) notes offering. The company intends to use the net proceeds from  this offering to repay select outstanding notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  The ratings apply to $34.5 billion of debt outstanding at Mar. 31, 2016. A full  list of Amgen's ratings can be found at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --At 3.1x gross debt-to-EBITDA, Amgen's gross debt leverage is at the high end  of the range for its 'BBB' rating. In 2015, the company issued $3.5 billion of  debt to fund share repurchases which offset the deleveraging from EBITDA growth  driven by its recently strong operational performance.  --Amgen's profitability improved during 2015. This was largely the result of a  change in the Enbrel co-promotion agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) which led  to declining royalty payments to Pfizer through 2016. Fitch expects further  margin expansion in 2016 driven by increasing sales, improving sales mix, lower  royalty payments to Pfizer, and additional cost savings. --Growth of a number of established products, progress in ramping up newer  medicines and advancing pipeline projects should help to offset some of the risk  of anticipated branded and biosimilar competition with Neulasta, Neupogen and  Epogen.  --Amgen has made significant progress in its drug development pipeline during  the past two years with a number of key approvals and positive clinical data for  other projects in late-stage development. --Fitch expects Amgen to continue generating solid free cash flow (FCF; CFFO  less capital expenditure and dividends) of at least $6 billion annually,  representing about a 30% FCF margin, supported by improving sales and margins,  modestly offset by an increasing dividend. --Fitch expects Amgen's margins will continue to improve during the intermediate  term. EBITDA margin will benefit from an improving sales mix, and a reduction in  selling, general and administration expense. The declining royalty payments by  Amgen to Pfizer associated with the start of a three-year phase-out period for  the co-promotion agreement of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada will also support  margin improvement in 2016. In addition, prioritization of product pipeline  projects has reduced research and development spending as a percentage of sales.  --Newer therapies such as XGEVA (bone metastases), Prolia (osteoporosis), Nplate  (thrombocytopenia), Vectibix (metastatic colorectal cancer) and Kyprolis  (relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma) are posting strong double-digit  growth, as good clinical experience drives increased acceptance in the medical  community. These five products accounted for only 18% of sales during 2015  compared to 16% in 2014. Aggregrate growth for these five products was 23%  during 2015, while total firm sales grew 8% during the same period. In addition,  we believe 2016 sales will benefit from recent market introductions of Repatha  and Imlygic.  --Amgen has also experienced a number of successes in advancing products through  its pipeline. The company received FDA approval for Blincyto (acute  lymphoblastic leukemia) in December 2014, Corlanor (heart failure) in April  2015, Repatha (hyperlipidemia) in August 2015 and Imlygic (cancer) in October  2015. Brodalumumab (rheumatoid arthritis) and romosozumab (osteoporosis) have  generated positive clinical trial data. These drugs all have the potential to  improve outcomes in a number of patients that currently face suboptimal  treatment options. --Amgen has already lost patent protection in the U.S. for Epogen and Neupogen.  Teva's branded medication and Sandoz's recently approved biosimilar therapy will  take share directly from Neupogen and to a lesser extent Neulasta, Amgen's  long-acting filagrastim treatment. However, the competing products will not  benefit from interchangeability with the originator biologics, requiring  competitors to spend on marketing and selling. This means that stiff price  competition will be less likely for Amgen's products. In addition, Amgen's  On-Body injector for Neulasta could help mitigate biosimilar competition. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for 2016 within the rating case for Amgen include: --Low- to mid-single-digit organic topline growth driven by the uptake of new  product commercialization offset by increased competitive pressure for some  established products.  --FCF of about $6 billion with a roughly 50bp improvement in the operating  EBITDA margin. --Cash deployment prioritized for dividends, share repurchases and targeted  acquisitions. --Total leverage maintained at or below 3x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  positive rating action include the following: --An upgrade of the ratings is not likely in the near term given currently high  leverage; --An upgrade could occur if the company maintained leverage in the 2.2x to 2.6x  range and operational performance remained strong.  Negative: Future developments, individually or collectively, that may lead to  negative rating action include the following: --An expectation for gross debt leverage maintained durably above 3x would  likely result in a Negative Outlook or a one-notch downgrade; --Stressed leverage could be driven by financial decisions that include  debt-financed share repurchases, dividends or acquisitions. In addition,  operational stress that decreases profitability, greater-than-expected  biosimilar and brand name drug competition and/or unsuccessful commercialization  of the late-stage research pipeline have the potential to stress its current  rating. LIQUIDITY The biggest concern in Amgen's liquidity profile is the growing amount of cash  balances held overseas. The company had cash and short-term investments of $34.7  billion on Mar. 31, 2016, of which only $6.8 billion resides domestically.  Unless the company chooses to repatriate cash, Fitch believes that Amgen will  continue to issue debt to fund domestic capital deployment, including payments  to shareholders. Fitch projects FCF (CFFO less capital expenditures and  dividends) to remain above $6 billion annually, representing FCF margins of  around 30% through 2018, included a growing dividend that is currently at $2.55  billion for the latest 12 months (LTM) as of Mar. 31, 2016. FCF was $6.5 billion  for the LTM as of Mar. 31, 2016. Additional liquidity comes from full availability of a recently amended and  extended $2.5 billion credit facility that matures on July 30, 2019. The  facility backstops an untapped $2.5 billion commercial paper program providing  additional financial flexibility. Fitch expects Amgen will refinance the vast  majority of its debt maturities. The company has roughly $2.1 billion of debt  maturing in 2016, $4.3 billion in 2017, $2.1 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in  2019. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates Amgen as follows: --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB'; --Bank loan 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2';  --Commercial paper 'F2'.

263,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch  France's Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) was moving ahead on Friday with preparations to replace Medivation Inc's MDVN.O board of directors after the U.S. cancer drug maker refused to engage with it in sale talks based on a $9.3 billion acquisition offer.Sanofi could unveil a slate of nominees to replace Medivation's board as early as this month, people familiar with the matter said, in line with a threat it made in a May 4 letter to the company that reiterated its acquisition proposal. Medivation has signed non-disclosure agreements to share confidential information with other pharmaceutical companies interested in an acquisition, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), sources told Reuters on Monday.However, Medivation will not engage in sale talks with Sanofi unless the latter raises its $52.50 per share cash offer, the people said. Sanofi has said it is willing to raise its offer only after Medivation engages in talks. Medivation shares were trading at $61.43 in New York on Friday. Sanofi this week added Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) as a financial advisor, while continuing to receive advice from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the people said. Goldman also has a close relationship with Pfizer, having advised it on many deals, including its abandoned $160 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc (AGN.N).Pfizer on Friday continued to work with advice from investment banks on a possible bid for Medivation, though there is no certainty such an offer would be submitted, some of the sources said.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Sanofi, Medivation, Goldman Sachs and Pfizer declined to comment. Sanofi is vying for Medivation in an attempt to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it struggles to compensate for declining revenues from a key diabetes drug that recently lost patent protection.Should Medivation agree to a sale, it would mark a bittersweet moment for Chief Executive David Hung, who founded the company in 2003. In 13 years, he built Medivation from a penny stock peddling a 20-year-old Russian treatment for hay fever into a $10 billion market capitalization oncology company. In the process, he overcame numerous obstacles, including the failure of Alzheimer's treatment Dimebon, which used to be sold as an antihistamine in Russia. In 2009, Hung took a bet on a chemical compound called MDV3100, which was developed at the University of California, Los Angeles. In partnership with Japan's Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T), Medivation turned MDV3100 into a nearly $2 billion prostate cancer drug called Xtandi.

266,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  France's Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) is preparing to name candidates it will put forward to replace the entire board of U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter.Sanofi has threatened to oust the board after Medivation rejected its unsolicited $9.3 billion acquisition offer late last month, taking advantage of a so-called 'written consent' rule that gives Medivation shareholders the ability to act at any time to replace directors.Medivation has declined to engage in sale talks with Sanofi unless the latter raises its $52.50 per share cash offer first, sources have said. The French drugmaker has said it is willing to raise its bid only after Medivation engages with it in negotiations.Medivation shares ended trading on Tuesday in New York at $61.91. Among Sanofi's eight nominees are Michael Campbell, the former chief executive of Arch Chemicals Inc, Ronald Rolfe, a retired partner at law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, and Barbara Deptula, a former executive vice president and chief corporate development officer of biopharmaceutical company Shire Plc (SHP.L), one of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the names of the nominees have not been disclosed. Medivation and Sanofi representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Medivation has signed non-disclosure agreements to share confidential information with other pharmaceutical companies interested in an acquisition, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), sources told Reuters earlier this month.However, no other company is close to tabling an offer for Medivation, according to the sources. Sanofi is vying for Medivation in an attempt to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it struggles to compensate for declining revenues from a key diabetes drug that recently lost patent protection.Medivation has argued that Sanofi's offer fails to value fairly the prospects of its recently developed prostate cancer drug XTANDI, as well as two other products currently in clinical trials; Talazoparib, for the treatment of breast cancer, and Pidilizumab, for the treatment of blood cancers. Campbell served as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Arch Chemicals, a maker of products that kill bacteria and fungi, between 1999 and 2011. Switzerland's Lonza AG (LONN.S) agreed in 2011 to buy the company for $1.2 billion.Rolfe retired from Cravath's litigation department in 2010, having worked on major antitrust and securities cases, as well as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and grand jury investigations. His clients included IBM Corp (IBM.N), PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) and Sprint Corp (S.N).Deptula worked at Shire between 2004 and 2012, where she led efforts to expand its product portfolio. She has been a director on the board of AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc (AMAG.O), a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on maternal health, anemia and cancer supportive care, since 2013.

267,"   By Ben Hirschler and Greg Roumeliotis  French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) named eight candidates to replace the entire board of Medivation Inc MDVN.O on Wednesday, stepping up pressure on the U.S. cancer drug company which has rejected its $9.3 billion takeover approach.Reuters reported earlier that Sanofi was about to propose a new board line-up, taking advantage of a so-called written consent rule that gives Medivation shareholders the ability to act at any time to replace directors.Sanofi filed documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the approval of Medivation shareholders for the board's overthrow. ""Despite multiple attempts, both prior to and following the public disclosure of Sanofi's proposal, Medivation has thus far refused to engage with us regarding the merits of a value creating transaction,"" said Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt.""Unfortunately, this has left us with no choice but to commence a process to elect directors who are more open to supporting the best interests of Medivation shareholders regarding a potential transaction.""Medivation urged its stockholders to reject Sanofi's election attempt and said it would promptly file materials with the SEC to try and block it.Efforts to remove a board usually occur through dissident shareholders at a company's annual meeting. But some companies also grant shareholders the right to act by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting, where the results of such a vote are either binding or non-binding, depending on what bylaws permit.  Medivation's bylaws allow written consent votes to be immediately binding, as long as at least a majority, or 50.1 percent, of shareholders vote in favor of the proposal, according to people familiar with the matter. Written consents are rare and usually employed by activist investors for various reasons, which include pressing a campaign after a director nomination deadline has passed. Carl Icahn threatened consent last year at AIG (AIG.N) to get a director on the insurer's board. Since the start of 2010, there have been only 37 activism campaigns that pursued written consent, according to FactSet.""HAND-PICKED NOMINEES""   Sanofi's nominees for Medivation's board are Michael Campbell, Barbara Deptula, Wendy Lane, Ronald Rolfe, Steven Shulman, Charles Slacik, James Tyree and David Wilson -- a roster of independent candidates with experience in the drug industry, finance and the law.Campbell led Arch Chemicals, before it was sold to Lonza (LONN.S) in 2011 for $1.2 billion, while Deptula headed corporate development at Shire (SHP.L). Lane chairs investment firm Lane Holdings and Rolfe retired from Cravath's litigation department in 2010.Medivation, which rejected Sanofi's approach last month, said again that its $52.50 per share cash offer was ""substantially inadequate"".""Its proposal to replace our existing directors with its own hand-picked nominees is simply a tactical maneuver to facilitate a transaction that will transfer value that rightly belongs to Medivation stockholders to Sanofi,"" said CEO David Hung. In a new letter to Medivation's board, Brandicourt reiterated that Sanofi could raise its offer if the U.S. firm engaged in talks.Medivation shares were down 0.7 percent at $61.46 in New York on Wednesday.The U.S. company has signed non-disclosure agreements to share confidential information with other potential acquirers, including Pfizer (PFE.N) and Amgen (AMGN.O), sources told Reuters earlier this month.Brandicourt expressed frustration at this. ""There have been published reports that you have signed confidentiality agreements with other parties. If that is accurate, we cannot see how you have not done so with us,"" he wrote.Sanofi wants Medivation - which sells a successful prostate cancer drug called Xtandi and has others in development - to expand in the lucrative oncology sector, as it seeks new businesses to compensate for flagging diabetes revenues.Brandicourt said Sanofi was in a position to provide more value than any other party, given the strategic importance of the transaction to the Paris-based company.

269,"  An experimental drug for prevention of chronic migraine headaches from Amgen Inc met the main goal of a midstage study by reducing the number of monthly attacks compared with a placebo, the company said on Wednesday.The biotech drug, erenumab, which is being co-developed with Swiss drugmaker Novartis, was tested at two doses in a 12-week, 667-patient Phase II study of subjects who were experiencing about 18 migraine days a month.Patients who received either the 70 milligram or 140 mg doses injected once monthly experienced a 6.6-day reduction in monthly migraine days, according to initial results. That compared with a 4.2-day reduction for those who received a placebo, a difference deemed to be statistically significant.Amgen expects to release more detailed data, including secondary goals such as reduction of at least 50 percent in monthly migraine days and change in cumulative monthly headache hours, at a later date.The company is also expecting data later this year from a late stage study of the medicine for patients who suffer from episodic migraines. Chronic was defined as having at least 15 headache days per month over 3 months, while 4 to 14 headache days per month was considered episodic. Between three and seven million Americans suffer from chronic migraines, which often involve nausea, vomiting and intense sensitivity to light and sound, in addition to incapacitating head pain.""Migraine is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide,"" Sean Harper, Amgen's research chief, said in a statement. The safety of erenumab was similar to placebo, the company said.

270,"  An experimental drug for prevention of chronic migraine headaches from Amgen Inc met the main goal of a midstage study by reducing the number of monthly attacks compared with a placebo, the company said on Wednesday.The biotech drug, erenumab, which is being co-developed with Swiss drugmaker Novartis, was tested at two doses in a 12-week, 667-patient Phase II study of subjects who were experiencing about 18 migraine days a month.Patients who received either the 70 milligram or 140 mg doses injected once monthly experienced a 6.6-day reduction in monthly migraine days, according to initial results. That compared with a 4.2-day reduction for those who received a placebo, a difference deemed to be statistically significant.Amgen expects to release more detailed data, including secondary goals such as reduction of at least 50 percent in monthly migraine days and change in cumulative monthly headache hours, at a later date.The company is also expecting data later this year from a late stage study of the medicine for patients who suffer from episodic migraines. Chronic was defined as having at least 15 headache days per month over 3 months, while 4 to 14 headache days per month was considered episodic. Between three and seven million Americans suffer from chronic migraines, which often involve nausea, vomiting and intense sensitivity to light and sound, in addition to incapacitating head pain.""Migraine is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide,"" Sean Harper, Amgen's research chief, said in a statement. The safety of erenumab was similar to placebo, the company said. The most common side effects involved injection site pain and upper respiratory tract infections.Under the collaboration agreement with Novartis, Amgen holds the sales rights for the United States, Canada and Japan, while Novartis would sell the drug in Europe and the rest of the world if it wins regulatory approval.

273,"  NEW YORK Doctors and hospitals in the United States received $7.52 billion in payments and ownership and investment interests from the makers of drugs and medical devices in 2015, according to data released by a government health agency.The data includes payments for items and services such as food and beverage, travel, education, honoraria as well as research, and is based on information related to 618,000 doctors, more than 1,110 teaching hospitals and 1,456 companies.The Open Payments program, which was created under the Affordable Care Act healthcare reform with the aim of improving transparency, requires drug and device manufacturers to report payments to healthcare providers for items like speaking engagements about their products and research grants.The report allows individuals to track payments to their physicians by drug companies. The need for greater transparency was spawned by concerns that physician prescribing habits and choices could be driven by payments from pharmaceutical and medical device companies.The program reported $2.6 billion in general payments, $3.89 billion in research payments and $1.02 billion of ownership or investment interests. This is the third annual report in the program, which has a searchable website. In 2014, payments totaled $7.49 billion.The agency said it had determined that 2.26 percent of all financial transactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians were related to opioid medications.Among companies with the highest payments is the largest U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, which made $44.7 million in total general payments and $391.7 million in research payments.  Merck & Co made $34.4 million in general payments and $128 million in research payments, according to the searchable database. Amgen Inc, another big drugmaker, made $31.4 million in general payments and $222.2 million in total research payments.Allergan Inc made $35.6 million in general payments and $27.5 million in research payments and Actavis Inc - which now goes by the name Allergan after a merger - made $13.4 million in general payments and $36.6 million in research payments, according to the database. Amgen said it supports initiatives that bring greater transparency to interactions between industry and healthcare providers. Such collaboration ""contributes to bringing innovative medicines and therapies to patients,"" the company said in an emailed statement. Merck declined to comment, while representatives for the other companies were not immediately available for comment.

In two large Amgen studies, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company said it showed similar effectiveness to Humira.In documents posted on the FDA's website, staff scientists said those trials suggested ABP 501 and Humira are ""highly similar"" in their safety, purity and potency in treating rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis.The staff's briefing report said Amgen's data also supported use of ABP 501 against other diseases Humira treats.Amgen stock rose 1.9 percent, while shares of suburban Chicago-based AbbVie advanced 1 percent, amid broad gains for the stock market.Injectable biotech drugs like Humira are made in living cells and cannot be identical, so copies of them are called biosimilars.

Like Amgen's Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade, it blocks a protein called tumor necrosis factor.Investors are nervous because Humira's main patent lapses in December, opening the drug up to potential competition from cheaper biosimilars being developed by companies that also include Coherus Biosciences Inc and Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim. Amgen, as the first to seek U.S. approval, could have the inside track to become the first to market.AbbVie says numerous other patents will stave off the introduction of biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022, ensuring continued strong U.S. sales. Any company introducing a biosimilar before resolving patent disputes with the maker of the original product risks facing triple damages from an unfavorable court ruling.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, however, said the first biosimilar of Humira would win U.S. approval and be available well before 2022, causing sales of the branded drug to fall about 5 percent in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019.""There will be litigation back and forth, but we think these biosimilars will be launched and probably do more damage to Humira than (Wall Street) is expecting,"" Conover said.  Although Amgen has suggested it will introduce ABP 501 by 2018, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said he expected no Humira biosimilars in the United States until 2021 because of AbbVie's ""broad patent estate.""Even as Amgen pushes its copy of Humira to market, it is fighting to fend off biosimilar competition for Enbrel.

284,"   By Toni Clarke  Novartis AG's cheaper version of Amgen Inc's arthritis drug Enbrel is highly similar in potency and safety to the original and should be approved, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Wednesday.The panel voted 20-O that there is no clinically meaningful difference between Novartis's drug, a biologic made of living cells, and Enbrel. Copies of biologics are called biosimilars, not generics, because they are more difficult to imitate with precision.Enbrel has been approved to treat multiple conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Novartis tested the drug, GP2015, in patients with plaque psoriasis but if approved by the FDA, it would be approved for all sought conditions.The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.Novartis, through its Sandoz division, tested the drug, GP2015, in patients with plaque psoriasis but if approved it would be approved for all conditions.The panel discussed the merits of extrapolating data from one condition to the others and though some members had reservations, was reassured by the fact that the drug works the same way in all the approved conditions. On Tuesday the panel unanimously recommended approval for Amgen's biosimilar version of AbbVie Inc's arthritis drug Humira.Panelists had reservations about extrapolating results from trials Amgen's drug in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, saying it is unclear how the drug works in those conditions.Unlike Humira, Enbrel is not approved to treat irritable bowel disorders. Some patient advocates who addressed the meeting said the committee should in future be allowed to vote on different indications individually rather than Enbrel was approved in 1998 and generated more than $5 billion in U.S. sales last year. Like Humira it works by blocking a protein known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, that plays a role in inflammatory conditions. Humira generated U.S. sales last year of more than $8 billion.AbbVie is fighting a legal battle to keep Amgen's biosimilar from the market.

286,"  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's experimental drug to treat the skin disorder psoriasis carries a potential risk of suicide that is challenging to assess due to limited data, according to a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published on Friday.The review comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside experts who will advise the FDA on whether the drug should be approved. The agency is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.In clinical trials of the drug, brodalumab, there were six suicides across all programs: four in psoriasis studies, one in a rheumatoid arthritis study and one in a psoriatic arthritis study.""We have uncertainty about whether the signal for completed suicide is a risk related to brodalumab treatment,"" FDA reviewers said. ""From the available data, we cannot conclude whether or not suicide is a drug-related risk.""If approved, brodalumab has the potential to be used in a large number of patients in the United States and likely prescribed by a doctor that may not be familiar with screening for and diagnosing suicidal thinking and behavior, the reviewers said.There are several risk management options that could provide some assurance that doctors and patients understand the safe use conditions of taking the drug. ""However, no risk management strategy will completely eliminate the risk"" they said.Brodalumab, was initially developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Amgen Inc. In May, 2015, Amgen withdrew from the partnership after trials revealed the potential suicide risk.AstraZeneca subsequently licensed global rights to the drug to Valeant, whose fortunes have plummeted over the past year amid criticism of its high drug prices and suspect relationship with a specialty pharmacy. AstraZeneca recently terminated Valeant's license to market brodalumab in Europe and signed an exclusive license instead with Denmark's LEO Pharma.Before the trial results, AstraZeneca said brodalumab could generate annual sales of up to $1.5 billion a year. David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, recently projected it would, if approved, generate just $250 million by 2020. ""Given the drug's safety profile, we expect a challenging commercial launch,"" he said in a research report.Brodalumab is known as an interleukin-17 inhibitor. Other drugs in the same class include Novartis AG's Cosentyx and Eli Lilly & Co's Taltz.The drug would also compete with Amgen's Enbrel and AbbVie's Humira.

288,"   By Toni Clarke  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's experimental drug to treat the skin disorder psoriasis should be approved as long as certain measures are put in place to mitigate the risk of suicide, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Tuesday.The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory committees but typically does so.In clinical trials of the drug, brodalumab, there were six suicides across all programs: four in psoriasis studies, one in a rheumatoid arthritis study and one in a psoriatic arthritis study. Even so, the committee voted 18-0 that the drug should be approved, saying the benefit outweighed the potential risk.Of those, 14 voted that the drug should only be prescribed alongside a strong risk management program that goes beyond simply including the information in the label. Such programs can include medication guides and communications plans for healthcare providers. Panelists said there was a need for new drugs for psoriasis and they would like to have brodalumab available as an option. They offered various suggestions about how to mitigate the suicide risk, including a boxed warning and a patient registry to collect patient data and more clearly assess suicide risk.Some thought the registry should be mandatory and others thought it should be voluntary. Some thought any registry would create unnecessary barriers to accessing the drug and may not reflect a true estimate of the suicide risk.Valeant itself has a risk management proposal that includes participation in a registry and enhanced communication but no boxed warning. Brodalumab blocks a cell receptor known as interleukin-17 to tamp down inflammation. Several other IL-17 inhibitors are already on the market, including Cosentyx from Novartis AGand Taltz from Eli Lilly & Co. The drug would also compete with Amgen's Enbrel, Johnson & Johnson's Remicade and AbbVie's Humira.About 7.5 million people in the United States suffer from psoriasis, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. The disorder, characterized by raised, scaly skin patches, can be associated with other conditions, including diabetes and heart disease.  Brodalumab was initially developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Amgen Inc. In May, 2015, Amgen withdrew from the partnership because of the suicides.  AstraZeneca subsequently licensed global rights to the drug to Valeant, whose fortunes have plummeted over the past year amid criticism of its high drug prices and cloudy relationship with a specialty pharmacy.

291,"  (Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text.)By Carl O'DonnellJuly 19 Some of the world's largest drug companies are taking out their checkbooks for acquisitions of smaller peers whose cancer drugs have the potential to cure not just patients, but corporate growth prospects as well.After decades in which progress meant extending life by weeks or months, new cancer treatments hold promise of adding years to patients' lives and billions of dollars in revenue to the companies that own them. Some of the most promising, known as immunotherapy, harness the body's own defense system to fight cancer.For many pharmaceutical companies, this wave of innovation couldn't have come at a better time. A generation of mainstay drugs have gone off patent, raising the stakes for companies vying for a foothold in the burgeoning oncology market.In recent months, executives at many big pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in building cancer treatment portfolios through acquisitions.They range from well-established incumbents, such as Roche Holding AG and Amgen Inc, to relative outsiders, including Sanofi and Gilead, according to public statements from the companies and several sources familiar with the companies plans and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Amgen declined to comment. Roche, Sanofi and Gilead did not respond to requests to comment.Among the most logical acquisition targets are Incyte Corporation and Seattle Genetics, which have respective market capitalizations of about $16 billion and $6 billion, said Michael King, a biotechnology analyst at JMP Securities.Incyte's blood cancer drug, Jakafi, produced more than $600 million in sales last year. Seattle Genetic's lymphoma drug, ADCETRIS, earned revenues of nearly $450 million. Both companies declined to comment.The acquisition of promising cancer drugs is ""going to be a major theme in the life sciences sector for the next several years,"" said Kennen MacKay, a biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. MORE DEALS EXPECTED Acquisitions of cancer drug companies accounted for about 20 percent of the $63 billion in pharmaceutical and biotech M&A announced this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Cancer deals accounted for a smaller share - 16 percent - of a larger pharmaceutical M&A pie during the first half of 2015.Deals involving cancer drugs are expected to rise in the second half of the year, as corporate boards of potential target companies begin to accept the lower valuations the sector has seen in recent months and become more open to deals.The Nasdaq Biotech Index, a common measure of life sciences companies' performance, has plunged more than 30 percent from 2015 highs, as political criticism of drug prices fueled investor concerns.Global spending on cancer drugs is on the rise and may reach $178 billion by 2020, up from $107 billion in 2015, according to market research firm IMS Health. About half of that will occur in the United States.That makes oncology medication to be one of the single biggest anticipated drivers of prescription drug revenue growth over the next five years, according to data from consultancy Ernst and Young. ""I think an uptick in activity is very likely,"" said Jeff Greene, global transactions leader for life sciences at EY. ""We have seen some big deals already, and we are likely to see even more, large and small, in the second half of this year.""Recent deals include AbbVie Inc's $10 billion acquisition of lung cancer company Stemcentryx, Jazz Pharmaceuticals' $1.5 billion takeover of leukemia drug maker Celator Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's roughly $500 million acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals.More dealmaking is on the way. Earlier this month, Medivation Inc, a U.S. prostate cancer drug company with a market capitalization of $10 billion, said it would open its books to Sanofi SA as part of a sale process that sources said also has attracted Pfizer Inc and Celgene Corp.REFRESHING PORTFOLIOS  For some, laying claim to a piece of the oncology sector's blockbuster growth could help offset the waning fortunes of mature drugs.For example, Sanofi's blockbuster diabetes drug, Lantus, will face heightened generic drug competition in December. Gilead faces increased pressure on its liver disease franchise, which makes up two-thirds of its revenues.Abbvie, which purchased two oncology companies in the past year, Pharmacyclics and Stemcentryx, is facing potential competition for its biggest drug, Humira, for arthritis. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel recently recommended approval of an application by Amgen to sell a similar product.Best equipped to play a leading role are major pharmaceutical companies because bringing the new generation of cancer medicines under development to market requires scale and resources.""Oncology is a go-big-or-go-home category,"" said Brian Corvino, a life sciences consultant at Decision Resources Group. ""The amount of investment to develop and commercialize oncology drugs is massive and only becomes efficient at a certain scale.""The benefits of scale have only grown in recent years, as insurance companies increasingly have demanded drug makers justify prices in terms of the value they add to patient's health.A large player in oncology is better equipped to partner with health care providers to collect data on a drug's efficacy and argue the case to major insurers, Corvino said.From an acquirer's perspective, the most attractive targets are companies with drugs that are already generating some revenue and are treating diseases where competition is scant.""For players that are looking to build an oncology presence, you need to buy a company that already has a blockbuster out there,"" MacKay said.Companies whose drugs are still in development pose greater risk. Shares of Juno Therapeutics, for example, dropped about 30 percent earlier this month when the FDA placed a hold on a clinical trial for its main leukemia drug after two people died.

303,"  LONDON Aug 9 Britain's cost-effectiveness agency NICE has recommended use of a virus-based melanoma drug from Amgen, reversing an earlier negative decision after the company provided further information.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)said on Tuesday that Imlygic could be used on the state health service for around 10 to 15 percent of patients with advanced disease whose melanoma cannot be removed surgically. NICE said it should only be used if treatment with systemic immunotherapies was not suitable and as long as Amgen provided it at an agreed -- but undisclosed -- price discount. Imlygic uses a herpes simplex virus, the type that causes cold sores, which has been modified to only infect cancer cells. It is injected directly into tumours. Until a few years ago, chemotherapy was the only available treatment for patients whose melanoma had spread. But recently there have been a number of new treatments, including immunotherapies from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck  that have been recommended by NICE.

306,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Novartis AG's biosimilar version of Amgen Inc's arthritis drug Enbrel.The FDA approved the drug, Erelzi, known also as etanercept-szzs, for multiple inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis, a skin condition.The agency approved the drug as a biosimilar, meaning there are no clinically meaningful differences between Erelzi and Enbrel. But the two drugs are not considered interchangeable and are therefore not called generics.Enbrel is a biologic drug made from living cells. Biologics are more difficult to imitate.The FDA's ruling followed a unanimous vote by the agency's advisory panel in July in favor of approval. ""We are committed to bringing Erelzi to the U.S. market as soon as possible,"" said Carol Lynch, global head of biopharmaceuticals at Novartis' Sandoz unit in Germany.Enbrel was approved in 1998 and generated more than $5 billion in U.S. sales last year. It works by blocking a protein known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, that plays a role in inflammatory conditions.Amgen believes Enbrel has U.S. patent protection until 2029 and is fighting in court to keep Novartis' drug off the market. The FDA is also weighing approval of Amgen's biosimilar version of AbbVie's arthritis drug Humira, a TNF inhibitor that last year generated U.S. sales of more than $8 billion. AbbVie is in turn trying to block Amgen's drug from reaching the market, saying it has patents in place to protect Humira in the United States until at least 2022.

307,"   By John Miller | ZURICH  ZURICH Novartis has won U.S. approval for a copy of Amgen's blockbuster arthritis drug Enbrel, but the Swiss drugmaker's bid to muscle in on the medicine's $4.7 billion in annual U.S. revenue remains blocked by court battles.Novartis's Sandoz unit said on Tuesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Erelzi, its biosimilar copy of Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other diseases.Yet Erelzi remains stuck in the starting blocks because U.S. courts have ruled makers of biosimilars must wait 180 days after winning FDA approval before beginning sales of the near-copies. [tinyurl.com/he4govy]That could delay Erelzi's sales launch until March 2017.Amgen is also waging an aggressive patent war, seeking to fend off Novartis's incursion on Enbrel's turf by arguing in U.S. federal court its drug has patent protection until 2029.""We are fully committed to bringing Erelzi to U.S. patients and payers as soon as possible,"" Novartis said in a statement, adding: ""However, we cannot speculate on product commercial availability."" Biosimilars aim to copy biologic products made inside living cells.Novartis, whose first biosimilar Zarxio was approved last year after a separate court fight with Amgen, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in biosimilar manufacturing in Austria and France to make cheaper biotech copies of brand-name drugs.The Basel-based company is betting these copies will be irresistible for insurers, healthcare systems and governments aiming to contain costs.  In Erelzi's case, the prize is big as Enbrel was the world's fifth-biggest selling medicine in 2014.In trying to accelerate sales, Novartis has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the ruling by a U.S. federal appeals court forcing biosimilar makers to wait six months after FDA approval. [tinyurl.com/jncdnhx]Meanwhile, Amgen's battle to prolong patents it maintains shield Enbrel for another 13 years is far from resolved. In an Aug. 11 ruling, a U.S. federal judge in New Jersey blocked Sandoz from selling its version.  While court documents indicate Novartis and Amgen have struck a pact over the matter, their agreement has been sealed by U.S. District Judge Claire Cecchi and is not public. ""We will not comment on the pending litigation at this time,"" Novartis said in a statement.However, the patent fight could take months or years to resolve. Cecchi has released a schedule for hearings, with a potential trial due to begin only in April 2018.

312,"  Amgen Inc said on Tuesday its potent new cholesterol fighter, Repatha, met the primary and secondary goals of a study designed to show it can decrease plaque buildup in heart arteries of patients already taking widely used statin drugs, such as Lipitor.The biotechnology company, whose shares were up 1.6 percent, will present detailed data from the study at a major heart conference in November.Repatha belongs to an expensive new class of injectable drugs that dramatically lower levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The new medicines have a list price of more than $14,000 a year. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi sell a rival drug called Praluent. They are far more expensive than statins, which are almost all now available in cheap generic versions.Health insurers and other companies that negotiate prescription drug usage have been slow to cover the new medicines without evidence that they actually reduce heart attacks and deaths as statins do. Data from large studies expected to show that is expected next year. ""One year after the FDA approved Repatha, nearly two-thirds of patients prescribed Repatha are still being denied access,"" Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.If the new drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, can halt or significantly reverse atherosclerosis, that could be a strong indicator they will be able to reduce heart attack risk. ""Atherosclerosis is the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide,"" Harper said.In the 78-week study of 968 heart patients already on optimum statin therapy, Repatha lowered the percentage of atheroma volume in coronary arteries and demonstrated some plaque regression.

Last month the agency approved Novartis AG's biosimilar version of Amgen's arthritis drug, Enbrel.Unlike generics, which are interchangeable with their branded counterparts, biosimilars approved by the FDA to date are not considered interchangeable and therefore are not called generic.The FDA has determined, however, that there is no clinically meaningful difference between the two products.In approving the drug the FDA followed the advice of its advisory panel, which in July voted unanimously that the drug was similar in safety and effectiveness to the original. The approvals come amid a heated national debate about the rising price of prescription drugs.AbbVie is trying to block Amgen's drug from reaching the market, saying it has patents in place to protect Humira in the United States until at least 2022.Amgen could introduce the drug before its patent dispute with AbbVie is resolved but risks facing triple damages from an unfavorable court ruling. Still, some analysts expect the drug to be available well before 2022 and see sales of Humira falling as much as 18 percent in 2019.

316,"   By Natalie Grover  Amgen Inc said on Tuesday its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, did not fare better than Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's older therapy Velcade in a study involving patients who had not yet been treated for the disease.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved Kyprolis for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have previously undergone treatment.Patients treated with Kyprolis did not show a statistically significant improvement in slowing the cancer's progression compared with those given Velcade in the late-stage study.Expectations of peak annual sales of about $2.3 billion for Kyprolis are now likely to cool, particularly since newly diagnosed patients constitute the largest market in terms of the number of patients and duration of therapy, some analysts said.Multiple myeloma, a type of aggressive and incurable blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, kills about 12,600 people annually and will be diagnosed in about 30,000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society.Baird analyst Brian Skorney said approval for previously untreated patients was ""off the table"" for now. The head-to-head study tested Kyprolis against the older Velcade in patients who were also given the chemothereutic agent melphalan and the immunosuppressant prednisone, and were deemed to be ineligible for stem-cell transplants.On a conference call with analysts, the company and experts said the ""treatment landscape"" for multiple myeloma was evolving dramatically and that melphalan/prednisone-based regimens were now rarely used due to their low efficacy and high toxicity. Dr. Andrzej Jakubowiak, who was involved in the development of the Amgen drug, said on the call that the study was not the ideal way to evaluate Kyprolis in previously untreated patients. Amgen, whose shares were down 1.2 percent at $171.45, said it would continue to explore the drug's benefit in combination with other agents.Kyprolis is also being tested in a separate late-stage trial in combination with Celgene Corp's Revlimid and the steroid dexamethasone, or KRd, in this ""front-line setting.""Jakubowiak said KRd was his first choice for previously untreated patients, and the results of the melphalan/prednisone study would not change this. Kyprolis has already been shown to be superior to Velcade, which is expected to go generic in 2017, in the later stages of multiple myeloma.Kyprolis faces greater competitive pressure as newer entrants in the multiple myeloma market gain traction, including Johnson & Johnson's Darzalex, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Empliciti and Takeda's Ninlaro.The Amgen drug generated $172 million in revenue in the second quarter.

317,"   By Natalie Grover  Amgen Inc said on Thursday it would buy a stake in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc and collaborate with the company to develop gene-silencing therapies for heart disease.Arrowhead will get $35 million up front and a $21.5 million injection from Amgen that will give the world's No. 1 biotech company by market value an equity stake of 4.5 percent.Pasadena, California-based Arrowhead will also eligible for up to $617 million in further milestone and equity payments.Shares of the company, whose shareholders include BlackRock Inc, Novartis AG  and JPMorgan Chase & Co, rose as much as 15 percent to $8.09 in early trading.Arrowhead, along with competitors such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc, Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc   and privately held Quark Pharmaceuticals, focuses on ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi), which aims to silence certain genes to curb the production of disease-causing proteins. RNAi has long interested drug developers, but has frequently met with clinical failure. Existing drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, work by trying to inactivate disease-causing proteins by binding to them.The license and collaboration deal includes two agreements, under which Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen will take charge of clinical development and commercialization.Under the first agreement, Amgen will get an exclusive global license to Arrowhead's ARC-LPA program, which has not been tested in humans. The RNAi drug is designed to reduce elevated levels of a form of cholesterol called Lp(a) that raises the risk of heart disease caused by plaque build-up. One in five people inherit high levels of Lp(a), which leads to the gradual narrowing of arteries, limiting blood supply to the heart, brain, kidneys and legs, thereby raising the risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke.So far, there is no treatment for the condition. Under the second agreement, Amgen will receive an option to an exclusive global license for a RNAi therapy for an undisclosed cardiovascular target. Amgen has a growing suite of cardiovascular therapies, both on the market and in development.These include its potent, expensive new cholesterol fighter Repatha, chronic heart failure treatment Corlanor, and omecamtiv mecarbil, which is in the final stages of development.

318,"   By Natalie Grover  Amgen Inc said on Thursday it would buy a stake in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc and collaborate with the company to develop gene-silencing therapies for heart disease.Arrowhead will get $35 million up front and a $21.5 million injection from Amgen that will give the world's No. 1 biotech company by market value an equity stake of 4.5 percent.Pasadena, California-based Arrowhead will also eligible for up to $617 million in further milestone and equity payments.Shares of the company, whose shareholders include BlackRock Inc, Novartis AG  and JPMorgan Chase & Co, rose as much as 15 percent to $8.09 in early trading.Arrowhead, along with competitors such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc, Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc   and privately held Quark Pharmaceuticals, focuses on ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi), which aims to silence certain genes to curb the production of disease-causing proteins. RNAi has long interested drug developers, but has frequently met with clinical failure. Existing drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, work by trying to inactivate disease-causing proteins by binding to them.The license and collaboration deal includes two agreements, under which Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen will take charge of clinical development and commercialization.Under the first agreement, Amgen will get an exclusive global license to Arrowhead's ARC-LPA program, which has not been tested in humans. The RNAi drug is designed to reduce elevated levels of a form of cholesterol called Lp(a) that raises the risk of heart disease caused by plaque build-up. One in five people inherit high levels of Lp(a), which leads to the gradual narrowing of arteries, limiting blood supply to the heart, brain, kidneys and legs, thereby raising the risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke.So far, there is no treatment for the condition. Under the second agreement, Amgen will receive an option to an exclusive global license for a RNAi therapy for an undisclosed cardiovascular target. Amgen has a growing suite of cardiovascular therapies, both on the market and in development.These include its potent, expensive new cholesterol fighter Repatha, chronic heart failure treatment Corlanor, and omecamtiv mecarbil, which is in the final stages of development.

But the percentage of patients who experienced a decrease of the substance that is the underlying cause of heart disease and magnitude of plaque regression was revealed at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday.The 968-patient trial compared the effect of monthly injections with Repatha plus a cholesterol-lowering statin with statins alone on the plaques that can break off and cause heart attacks. The plaque measurements were collected with an ultrasound probe placed inside the diseased artery.Patients in the study had symptomatic heart disease and blockages of 20 percent to 50 percent in the tested artery.""We saw profound regression,"" said Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at Cleveland Clinic who presented the data.The combination therapy led to a further 60 percent reduction in LDL levels beyond statins alone to an average LDL of a mere 36.6. That translated into a decrease in percent of blockage volume of about 1 percent compared with no change for statins alone.In all, 64.3 percent on the combination therapy experienced plaque regression compared with 52.7 percent with statin monotherapy. ""We didn't know what would happen to disease progression at LDL cholesterol levels when we go to below about 60,"" Nissen explained. For those who began the trial with LDL below 70, the lowest target guideline for high risk patients, 81 percent experienced coronary plaque regression with the addition of Repatha compared with 48 percent for statins alone. Those Repatha patients on average saw LDL levels drop to 24 with a low of about 15.""That's unbelievable. So when you get down to 24 you've got a really high chance of your plaques melting away,"" Nissen said. Repatha and Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi belong to an expensive new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. They carry a list price of more than $14,000 a year before discounts and rebates.Many heart doctors have been upset by barriers to access to these drugs they encounter from health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, even for their sickest patients who meet all the criteria mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.More than 100,000 prescriptions have been written for Repatha in the United States since its approval, but two-thirds of patients are ultimately denied, Amgen said. ""It's crazy what's going on. They've basically destroyed our capacity to treat our patients with the drugs that we need to treat them with,"" said Dr. Seth Baum, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology. In the third quarter, Repatha had anemic sales of just $40 million, while Praluent took in $38 million for drugs forecast to be multibillion-dollar products.It is widely believed that payers will not lift reimbursement restrictions until they see results from huge studies designed to show that the new medicines cut the risk of heart attacks and death in addition to their ability to slash LDL levels. The Repatha outcomes data is expected in early 2017.But the plaque regression data unveiled on Tuesday is likely a strong indictor that those trials will be positive.""These findings suggest that the large clinical outcome trials currently underway are likely to show major benefits,"" said Dr. Stephen Nicholls, one of the study's lead directors.

Patients receiving 70 milligram of the drug, erenumab, experienced reduction of 3.2 days from baseline in monthly migraine days, while those on 140 milligram experienced reduction of 3.7 days. Those in the placebo experienced a 1.8-day reduction, the company said.At baseline, patients were experiencing an average of 8.3 migraine days per month, Amgen said.Amgen, which is co-developing the treatment with Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG (NOVN.S), said patients received the injectable drug once monthly for six months. Erenumab is also being tested for episodic migraine prevention and chronic migraine prevention.Worldwide, about 90 percent of people diagnosed with migraine have episodic migraine, which is characterized by up to 14 migraine days a month, the company said.
