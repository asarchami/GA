11,"   By Nate Raymond | June 10  June 10 A former senior editor at TheStreet Inc  has agreed to pay $10,225 to resolve claims he participated in an insider trading ring involving a group of high school friends, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday.The SEC's case against Michael Baron, 43, followed a related criminal prosecution of six other men involved in an insider trading scheme focused on pharmaceutical and medical technology stocks.Baron was never criminally charged. But in a civil lawsuit filed in New Jersey on Tuesday, the SEC said Baron provided a relative illegal tips about Celgene Corp's 2007 acquisition of Pharmion Corp and Stryker Corp's tender offer for Orthovita Inc in 2011.The unnamed relative traded on the information and made more than $6,500 in ill-gotten gains, the SEC said. The SEC said the tip about the Celgene-Pharmion deal came from John Lazorchak, at the time an employee in Celgene's financial reporting department and a high school friend of Baron's.The tip about Stryker's offer, meanwhile, came from Mark Foldy, an employee in its marketing department who likewise attended high school with Baron, the SEC said.The SEC does not in its lawsuit name TheStreet, saying only that Baron, a Belford, New Jersey, resident, was a ""former senior editor at a financial publication."" His employment had previously been reported by The Wall Street Journal. Representatives for Baron and the TheStreet did not respond to a request for comment.Lazorchak was sentenced in April to 1-1/3 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges. Foldy that same month was sentenced to two years supervised release, with six months of home confinement, after pleading guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges.Four other men also pleaded guilty in the criminal case, and the SEC charged an eighth man civilly as well.Among those to plead guilty were Lawrence Grum and Michael Castelli, the two main traders in the case. Grum was sentenced in April to one year and one day in prison, while Castelli, a high school classmate, received nine months.The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

12,"  (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)By Chris TaylorNEW YORK, June 19 It's the secret fear of every American parent: failure to launch.What if, despite your best efforts, your adult kids just aren't able to sustain themselves financially?The idea used to give Andy Byron the cold sweats. With a whopping five kids, the 57-year-old financial planner from Pleasanton, California wanted no part of 'delayed adults' hanging out in his basement well into their thirties.So he and his wife turned their household into a virtual factory for churning out financially independent kids. The eldest girl, 29, is an English language teacher. The 26-year-old twin boys work for Apple and PricewaterhouseCoopers, respectively. Their 22-year-old son scored a paid summer internship with medical device manufacturer Stryker Corp, with an eye toward a career in medical sales.The 19-year-old daughter, a college sophomore in the fall, is combining her studies with a paid summer internship and a part-time accounting job during the school year.So what's their secret sauce?""Start early, be consistent, and make sure they know what their responsibilities are,"" Byron says.As soon as they were 16 or 17, the parents told their kids that they had to get jobs, and would be on their own after graduation. As a result, the three oldest are out of the house and get no more monthly cash from the bank of Mom and Dad; the younger two will follow suit soon.While the Byron clan appears to have figured it all out, it's no easy task to nudge kids from the nest. Among people in their 40s and 50s who have adult kids, a stunning 73 percent report lending financial help over the previous year, according to Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Are the successful launches of the 27 percent due to thoughtful, years-long projects to educate kids about handling finances? Or are they product of tough love, throwing adult kids into the deep end of the pool in order to force them to swim?""They are more the result of financial education, and talking about money, which ranks right up there with sex as a taboo subject,"" says Sally Koslow, author of the book ""Slouching Toward Adulthood.""For those with children who have yet to launch, there is plenty of time left on the clock. Here is how to prep kids for true financial independence, during college and the critical years that follow:DO YOUR PART  If you don't want your kids financially hanging on, do whatever you can to help them graduate from college debt-free. Seven out of 10 college grads last year had outstanding loans, at an average debt of $29,400, according to the advocacy group Project On Student Debt. To help them avoid indentured servitude, start saving as soon as they're in swaddling clothes.Andy Byron and his wife contributed at least $50 a month, and often much more, into 529 college-savings plans for each one of their five kids - ""as soon as each child had a Social Security number,"" he says.Byron supplemented that aggressive strategy by ""strongly suggesting"" the kids go to public, in-state universities. The payoff: All the Byron grads have emerged from their college years free of student debt.DRAFT A WINGMAN  The popular HBO series ""Girls"" was premised on a key event: Lena Dunham's character getting financially cut off by her parents.That can be excruciating for everyone involved, but necessary nonetheless. ""Parents get so emotionally involved,"" says Matt Curfman, a vice president with financial advisers Richmond Brothers in Jackson, Michigan. ""That's why I tell them, 'If you need me to jump in and help, even if I end up being the bad guy, I'm happy to do so.'""It doesn't have to be done in one fell swoop, Curfman notes. If your adult kid runs into financial trouble, write down a concrete plan to help with a certain amount of dollars for a certain number of months - ""but that's it.""BECOME A PART-TIME PROFESSOR Kids get plenty of calculus and chemistry in high school and college, but personal finance? Not so much.That's where parents can make themselves a critical resource. For 24-year-old Annie-Rose Strasser, home instruction was what set her on the path to become the financially independent young adult she is now. Strasser has a full-time job as a journalist in Washington and lives in her own apartment. ""I never learned personal finance when I was in school - 401(k)s, saving, balancing a budget: I learned it all from my parents,"" she says.Paired with that informal home-study was the early expectation that Strasser would put herself to work as soon as she was able. A constant stream of it - at summer camps, at office jobs, at paid internships - helped set the table for her successful launch.""My parents aren't the kind of people who would say, 'Go off and explore yourself,'"" she laughs.

28,"   By Andrew Chung  Dec 19 A U.S. federal appeals court has slashed the damages that Zimmer Holdings Inc will have to pay Stryker Corp for infringing its patents on a surgical cleaning wand.The top U.S. patent court said on Friday that Zimmer's infringement against Stryker had not been willful, and thus a jury award for $70 million could not be tripled. A lower court had awarded $228 million, including legal fees.Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker sued Zimmer in 2010, saying its competitor's Pulsavac Plus device for cleaning wounds during orthopedic surgical procedures infringed three of its patents. Last year a jury in Grand Rapids, Michigan, awarded medical device maker Stryker $70 million in lost profits and found Zimmer's conduct to have been willful.U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker said the evidence showed Warsaw, Indiana-based Zimmer had all but instructed its design team to copy Stryker's products, and he trebled the damages. With other fees, the award came to $228 million. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday agreed Zimmer had violated the patents but overturned the awarding of treble damages.Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Sharon Prost said Zimmer's defenses were reasonable and that the company did not act recklessly. The appeals panel also vacated the district judge's decision to award legal fees to Stryker, sending that part of the case back to the lower court.A spokeswoman for Zimmer said the company was pleased with the ruling. A Stryker representative declined to comment.The case is Stryker Corp et al v. Zimmer Inc et al, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 13-1668.

It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said.After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar  has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand.The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining.""You have companies who don't normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. ""It's really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening."" HEDGING HELP LIMITED WITH SHARP MOVES The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors.While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts' ability to estimate losses.One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates. Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share.The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps.American icon Apple Inc is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations.Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple's 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report.Apple's Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a ""clear headwind"" included in the company's guidance for the year ahead.Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics.Medical device maker Stryker Corp said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent.Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson and IBM .Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps. But actual losses may be much higher as many firms citing currency impacts did not disclose the amount, it noted.

The slump saw the shares hit their lowest level since late December. The stock leapt nearly 8 percent then on media reports that a bid for Smith and Nephew would be made.""The fact that the U.S. companies are no longer looking to British shores for takeovers takes a lot of value of UK firms like Smith & Nephew,"" said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets.""Some sort of deal had been priced into the stock and it could fall back towards 900p now, unless we get news that the deal is still on.""

47,"  LONDON Plans by Stryker (SYK.N) to launch a new $2 billion share buyback program punctured hopes the U.S. surgical implant firm would bid for rival Smith & Nephew (SN.L), sending shares in the British group some 5 percent lower on Tuesday.""It probably tells you that the prospect of a deal has receded,"" said one analyst as the stock staged its sharpest one-day drop in four years.Smith & Nephew, which has a market value of around $16 billion, is a perennial target of takeover talk. It is a relatively small player in a consolidating healthcare sector and Stryker has long been seen as a likely acquirer.The U.S. company formally declared last May that it was not working on a takeover offer, following earlier reports of its interest, which meant that under British takeover rules it could not make a bid for another six months. The Smith & Nephew share price fall echoes a similar situation with AstraZeneca (AZN.L) last October, when a decision by Pfizer (PFE.N) to approve a new buyback program deflated bid hopes surrounding the British drugmaker.Stryker Chief Executive Kevin Lobo said his company was committed to a capital allocation strategy that included acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. ""While M&A activity across the breadth of our product and service offerings will remain the primary focus of our long-term growth strategy, this new authorization recognizes that the strength of our balance sheet is sufficient to enable more significant share repurchases,"" he said in a statement. Smith & Nephew also announced a small deal on Tuesday to buy its distributor in Colombia, following similar deals in Brazil, Turkey and India. Financial terms of the acquisition of EuroCiencia Colombia were not disclosed.

60,"   By Andrew Chung | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled a willingness to give federal judges more discretion to boost penalties for patent infringement as the justices heard arguments in cases brought by Stryker Corp and Halo Electronics Inc.Stryker, a medical device maker, and Halo, which makes circuit board transformers, were denied enhanced damages by a federal appeals court after winning patent infringement lawsuits against competitors.During oral arguments before the high court, the companies said they should have been awarded enhanced damages because the infringement of their patents was willful, which can allow for a tripling of damages.The nation's top patent court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, has said that to be awarded enhanced damages, a patent owner must prove a defendant acted despite a high likelihood of infringement and had no reasonable explanation for doing so.Several of the justices indicated they might be willing to relax that standard, giving federal judges increased discretion in awarding enhanced damages. Chief Justice John Roberts called the elaborate test ""surprising"" and said that ""courts have been used to dealing with discretionary standards for a long time.""Halo and Stryker both contended the test is too rigid, allowing a willful infringer to escape liability if it can muster any reasonable defense, even if it acted in bad faith.Justice Elena Kagan said the existing standard may serve as an incentive for patent infringement because it gives willful violators a way to escape liability. Carter Phillips, the lawyer arguing for Halo and Stryker's opponents, told Kagan there are not enough deliberate infringers to justify changing the standard.""My sense is there aren't that many pirates out there,"" Phillips said. Industry groups are closely watching the cases because a lower bar to award enhanced damages, meant as punishment for deliberate and reckless copying, could hand patent owners a potent new weapon.Stryker sued Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc in 2010 for infringing its patented handheld surgical cleaning wand and was awarded more than $210 million for willful infringement. But the Federal Circuit in 2014 overturned a lower court's finding of willfulness, saying Zimmer's defenses were reasonable.Halo sued Pulse Electronics Corp in 2007. The Federal Circuit similarly found that Pulse Electronics' infringement of several Halo patents was not willful.The cases were heard by the high court's eight remaining justices following the Feb. 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia.The cases are Halo Electronics Inc v.

62,"   By Andrew Chung | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled a willingness to give federal judges more discretion to boost penalties for patent infringement as the justices heard arguments in cases brought by Stryker Corp and Halo Electronics Inc.Stryker, a medical device maker, and Halo, which makes circuit board transformers, were denied enhanced damages by a federal appeals court after winning patent infringement lawsuits against competitors.During oral arguments before the high court, the companies said they should have been awarded enhanced damages because the infringement of their patents was willful, which can allow for a tripling of damages.The nation's top patent court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, has said that to be awarded enhanced damages, a patent owner must prove a defendant acted despite a high likelihood of infringement and had no reasonable explanation for doing so.Several of the justices indicated they might be willing to relax that standard, giving federal judges increased discretion in awarding enhanced damages.Chief Justice John Roberts called the elaborate test ""surprising"" and said that ""courts have been used to dealing with discretionary standards for a long time.""  Halo and Stryker both contended the test is too rigid, allowing a willful infringer to escape liability if it can muster any reasonable defense, even if it acted in bad faith.Justice Elena Kagan said the existing standard may serve as an incentive for patent infringement because it gives willful violators a way to escape liability.Carter Phillips, the lawyer arguing for Halo and Stryker's opponents, told Kagan there are not enough deliberate infringers to justify changing the standard. ""My sense is there aren't that many pirates out there,"" Phillips said. Industry groups are closely watching the cases because a lower bar to award enhanced damages, meant as punishment for deliberate and reckless copying, could hand patent owners a potent new weapon. Stryker sued Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc in 2010 for infringing its patented handheld surgical cleaning wand and was awarded more than $210 million for willful infringement.

63,"   By Andrew Chung  By Andrew Chung While some U.S. Supreme Court justices appeared receptive to Halo Electronics Inc and Stryker Corp's plea to overrule an elaborate test for determining when patent infringement is willful, a skeptical Justice Stephen Breyer on Tuesday suggested a change could be devastating for small businesses and startups. Arguing for both companies, Jeffrey Wall of Sullivan & Cromwell told the justices during oral argument that the current test makes willfulness very difficult to find and so deliberate infringers are ""immunized"" from this punitive measure if they can come up with any reasonable defense.

67,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday said federal judges should have more discretion to boost penalties in patent infringement cases and ordered an appeals court to review whether Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc (ZBH.N) willfully violated Stryker Corp (SYK.N) patents on a surgical cleaning wand.In a unanimous opinion, the high court also ordered the appeals court in a separate case to review whether Pulse Electronics Corp willfully infringed Halo Electronics Inc's patents. The justices said a test for determining willful infringement, which can allow judges to triple damages awarded to a patent owner, was too rigid and allowed some egregious infringers to escape liability.
