0,"  (Adds details on Gap Inc sales)By Phil WahbaApril 10 Family Dollar Stores Inc, seeking to reverse declining sales and profit, said on Thursday it is slashing prices to win shoppers, cutting jobs, and shutting hundreds of stores.Other retailers, including Gap Inc, posted disappointing monthly sales and store traffic.Family Dollar, which caters to lower-income shoppers, many living paycheck to paycheck, reported sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.8 percent in the quarter ended March 1. It expects sales to decline this quarter, too.Family Dollar Chief Executive Officer Howard Levine, on a call with investors, pointed to ""a more financially constrained consumer,"" echoing recent comments from rivals. Wal-Mart Stores Inc a few weeks ago said sharp cuts in food stamp benefits and higher payroll taxes had pinched its customers.""There's still in a big part of the economy where price matters,"" said Wharton Business School professor Barbara Kahn.A group of U.S. retailers posted sales figures that suggested  consumers remained cautious in March.The Thomson Reuters Same Store Sales Index, which tracks monthly sales at stores open at least a year at some key retailers, registered a 2.2 percent increase for March, below last year's result of 2.7 percent.Gap Inc reported a 6 percent decline in comparable sales, with store traffic at its namesake clothes stores ""well below"" its expectations. Sales also fell at its Banana Republic and Old Navy stores. To be sure, retailers were not helped by cold weather last month and a later Easter, which this year will fall on April 20.The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dipped to 80.0 in March from 81.6 in February, its lowest point since November.Apparel retailers Victoria Secret parent company L Brands Inc, Cato Corp, The Buckle Inc, and Zumiez Inc all reported same-store sales declines for March, while Stein-Mart Inc reported a smaller increase than Wall Street analysts expected.Rite Aid Corp reported a 5 percent decline in same-store sales of general merchandise. But the drugstore company gave a better-than-expected profit for its new fiscal year, and shares rose 10 percent to $7.04, their highest level since 2001.Costco Wholesale Corp reported a better-than-expected 5 percent increase in March same-store sales. The S&P Retail Index closed down 2.1 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent decline for the broader S&P 500  L. Brands shares were down 5.2 percent. Gap shares fell 3.2 percent after hours.MORE $1 ITEMS  Family Dollar, which has struggled to compete with rivals Dollar General Corp and Dollar Tree Inc, has created many of its own problems.It has found that customers balk at higher prices, especially as rivals were lowering theirs, and expanded its store fleet aggressively.The retailer has begun to try to remedy that by implementing price cuts on 1,000 basic items, though the company did not give specifics on which products.""That magical $1 price point that has been so important to us over the years, it's hard to find sometimes,"" Family Dollar's Levine said on a call. ""These investments will make us more competitive.""Family Dollar, which operates 8,100 stores across the United States, also said it would close 370 unprofitable stores, and slow its expansion. The company will open between 350 and 400 new stores next fiscal year, rather than the 500 initially planned.Comparable sales last quarter at the stores Family Dollar will close were down 8 percent.Overall sales at Family Dollar in the quarter fell 6.1 percent to $2.72 billion, below the $2.77 billion analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income was $168.9 million, or $1.47 per share, down 35 percent from $220.4 million, or $1.90 per share.The discount chain's gross profit fell 6.7 percent points, as shoppers gravitated toward buying everyday products such as food and cigarettes, which have lower profit margins than items like clothing and house wares.

21,"  * Nasdaq closes at highest since March 2000* Other Wall Street indexes up nearly 1 percent* Oil prices drop as Ukraine tensions ease, supply improves* Dollar rises; Gold dips under $1,300   (Adds closing prices, Nasdaq record and quotes)By Michael ConnorNEW YORK, Aug 18 U.S. and European stock prices surged on Monday, taking a leading U.S. equities index to a 14-year high, as investors breathed easier over the Ukraine crisis and knocked oil prices to lows not seen in more than a year.U.S. bond prices dropped and the dollar rose after dipping on Friday, when the government in Kiev said its artillery had hit a Russian armored column. Russia denied its forces had crossed into Ukraine.On Wall Street, a homebuilders rally and an $8.95 billion bid by discount retailer Dollar General Corp for Family Dollar Inc that trumped a bid by Dollar Tree Inc  also helped prices. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up unofficially at 175.8 points, or 1.06 percent, to 16,838.74 while the S&P 500 gained 16.7 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,971.74.The Nasdaq Composite added 43.39 points, or 0.97 percent, to 4,508.31. It was the tech-heavy Nasdaq's first day above the key 4,500 mark since March 2000.Homebuilders' stocks were prominent after the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index showed that U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose for the third straight month in August.  The PHLX housing sector index climbed 1.66 percent. ""People left Friday unsure of whether or not the Ukrainian conflict was escalating and they seem to have come back today thinking it's not,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  rose 1.2 percent. German blue chips, which are considered especially vulnerable to tensions between the West and Russia, were among the top gainers.The easing of geopolitical anxieties helped Brent crude oil shed nearly $2 a barrel to reach its lowest price in over a year. Higher Libyan oil output added to already ample supplies.Brent crude fell $1.93 to settle at $101.60 a barrel, after notching a session low of $101.11, the lowest since June 2013. U.S. crude for September fell by 94 cents to settle at $96.41, after paring losses from an earlier low of $95.81.U.S. Treasury debt prices fell after three days of gains last week. Risk appetite grew on upbeat U.S. housing data and the easing tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine.In late trading, U.S. 10-year notes fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.387 percent from 2.339 percent late on Friday. U.S. 30-year bond prices also slid, dropping more than a point to yield 3.195 percent from 3.129 percent the previous session.Yields on German 10-year debt, the euro zone benchmark, rose 2.6 basis points to a shade above 1.001 percent.As equities rose, gold slipped below $1,300 an ounce and was last trading at $1,298.70.In currency markets, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.19 percent.

23,"  (Adds Family Dollar comment)By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Devika  Krishna KumarAug 18 Dollar General Corp offered to buy Family Dollar Stores Inc for $8.95 billion, trumping a bid by Dollar Tree Inc that had threatened to unseat the biggest U.S. discount retailer from the peak of a highly competitive market.Shares of Family Dollar, the No. 2 U.S. discount chain, rose 5 percent to $79.87, above the offer price of $78.50 per share in cash, suggesting that investors anticipate a bidding war.""Both Dollar General and Dollar Tree have some capacity to go a little bit higher with the offer price,"" said Joseph Feldman, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.Dollar stores have been a popular choice for U.S. consumers in a weak economy. Competition to woo penny-pinching customers has intensified, particularly as Wal-Mart Stores Inc has opened more small-format stores."" ... They are trying to rally forces in order to compete more effectively,"" said Barbara Kahn, a professor at Wharton University of Pennsylvania.Many large retailers that cater to low- and middle-income consumers reported disappointing quarterly sales at their established stores last week, pointing to a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home.Sales at discount chains, however, have grown consistently since 2009 as shoppers have been spending more cautiously.The U.S. market for dollar stores grew 45.7 percent to $48.2 billion between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to grow 18 percent in the next five years, according to Euromonitor International.But the growth has recently started slowing due to intense competition, Kahn said.""We have a tremendous amount of strength in the rural communities and we have things to learn in the metro,"" Dollar General Chief Executive Rick Dreiling said on a conference call. ""Family Dollar is just the reverse."" A combined company will have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion.It would also allow Dollar General to retain its No. 1 spot among U.S. dollar stores. Dollar Tree's $8.5 billion bid for Family Dollar, announced on July 28, would have vaulted that merged company ahead of Dollar General.Combined, the three dollar chains' annual sales total about $35 billion - less than a tenth of Wal-Mart's $473 billion.Dreiling, who will postpone a retirement planned for next year to stay on as CEO of the combined company through May 2016, said Dollar General had faced stiffer competition from new Family Dollar stores than from Wal-Mart.Both Dollar General and Family Dollar offer goods at multiple price points, while Dollar Tree sticks rigidly to a $1 or less format. This - along with the location of Dollar General and Family Dollar stores - would make Dollar General a more likely buyer, analysts said.Family Dollar's presence is biggest in Texas and the eastern United States. Texas is also home to more Dollar General stores than any other state - more than 1,000 stores, or about a tenth of the total. Family Dollar said it is reviewing Dollar General's offer and has not changed its recommendation in support for a merger with Dollar Tree.Dollar General's shares were up 11 percent at $63.75, while Dollar Tree's shares were down 2 percent at $54.47.Dollar General's offer, made in a letter to Family Dollar's board, represents a premium of 3.2 percent to Family Dollar's Friday close.The enterprise value of the offer is $9.7 billion, higher than Dollar Tree's $9.2 billion.Billionaire investor Carl Icahn had pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General. Dollar Tree offered last month to pay $74.50 per share in cash and stock. Since then, Icahn has cut his stake in Family Dollar to 3.6 percent as of July 30 from 9.4 percent.Activist investor Nelson Peltz-led Trian Partners was Family Dollar's second largest shareholder as of July 27 with a 7.34 percent stake.GROWING COMPETITION Dreiling, who said he would not have announced his retirement had he known a deal between Family Dollar and Dollar Tree was under way, said antitrust approval for Dollar General's bid was not a concern.Dollar General is prepared to divest up to 700 retail stores to get regulatory approval for the deal, the same percentage that Dollar Tree had proposed.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough, however, said closing 700 stores might not be enough for Dollar General to get antitrust approval.""Any market where they are dominant, and they are the only two players, is going to be questioned. They will either have to be closed or sold,"" he said.Dollar Tree declined to comment.Dollar General said it expected annual synergies of $550 million-$600 million three years after the deal closes.

26,"   By Jennifer Ablan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn told Reuters late Monday that efforts by Family Dollar’s  board to fend off competing bids in favor of a deal with Dollar Tree have resulted in more than $300 million being needlessly spent on breakup fees.Icahn has pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General and has been openly critical of Family Dollar Chief Executive Howard Levine, who would have retained his position after an acquisition by Dollar Tree. On Monday, Dollar General offered to buy Family Dollar Stores for $8.9 billion, trumping an agreed-to merger with its rival Dollar Tree and aiming to strengthen its dominance of a growing segment of retailers serving penny-pinching customers.Dollar General has also offered to pay the $305 million breakup fee that would be owed to Dollar Tree if its deal with Family Dollar were to fall apart.""This is a quintessential example and a reflection of what is wrong with Corporate America,"" Icahn said. ""The Family Dollar board is wasting more than $300 million (in breakup fees to Dollar Tree) in an attempt to chill a competing bid from Dollar General, which would keep Howard Levine out of the company once and for all even though the Dollar General bid would enhance the value of Family Dollar stock.""     Icahn, who in June took a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar, had encouraged Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General. On Monday, Icahn said he was ""surprised"" by Family Dollar's deal with Dollar Tree and questioned whether Levine's future role at Dollar Tree could have influenced the company to go ahead with the deal.Dollar Tree said last month that Levine would remain as Family Dollar CEO after the acquisition.Icahn has cut his stake in Family Dollar to 3.6 percent from 9.4 percent as of July 30. In a regulatory filing in August, it was revealed that on June 6, Icahn telephoned Levine to discuss Icahn's stake in Family Dollar and to express an interest in additional communications with Family Dollar's management regarding the company's current operations and future plans, including potential strategic opportunities and business combination transactions. According to the filing, Levine asked Icahn whether he would be willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement and Icahn declined.   ""It appears that Levine and Family Dollar wanted to neutralize me by getting me to sign a confidentiality agreement,"" Icahn said. ""If Levine and Family Dollar had gotten me to sign it, that would have kept me from doing a proxy fight and in my opinion this would have given Levine 2-3 more years to mismanage the company and keep a competing bid from materializing. I refused to sign the confidentiality agreement.""Icahn said: ""In my humble opinion, Family Dollar would still be in the hands of Levine and the board if it had not been for my activism.""Company officials at Family Dollar declined to comment on Icahn's remarks.

28,"  (Adds Dollar General's comments)By Sruthi Ramakrishnan, Devika  Krishna Kumar and Lawrence HurleyAug 21 Family Dollar Stores Inc rejected a $9 billion buyout offer from Dollar General Corp that it said could run foul of competition law, opting instead for a smaller bid from Dollar Tree Inc that guarantees a job for its CEO.Family Dollar, the second-largest dollar store in the United States, said it believed a deal with its larger rival would be unlikely to win antitrust approval, despite a promise by Dollar General to close some stores.""We will not jeopardize the Dollar Tree deal for a transaction with Dollar General that has a high likelihood of not closing due to antitrust considerations,"" said Ed Garden, an independent director on Family Dollar's board and co-founder of Trian Fund Management LP, a large shareholder.Trian Fund Management, led by activist investor Nelson Peltz, owned 7.3 percent stake in Family Dollar as of July 27.Dollar stores, a popular choice for penny-pinching customers  in a weak U.S. economy, have come under pressure to merge as competition intensifies, particularly with Wal-Mart Stores Inc  opening more small-format stores.The formal rejection came a day after Dollar General Chief Executive Rick Dreiling questioned whether his counterpart at Family Dollar, Howard Levine, was serving his own interests in supporting Dollar Tree's $8.5 billion offer.As friction escalated, Levine responded on Thursday by saying that Dreiling's letter ""contained blatant mischaracterizations and did nothing to address the antitrust issues in Dollar General's proposal.""Dreiling said in a rebuttal that Dollar General had ""done extensive antitrust analysis using experienced advisers, the results of which confirm that the transaction as proposed is capable of being completed.""The U.S. market for dollar stores grew 46 percent to $48.2 billion between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to grow 18 percent in the next five years, according to Euromonitor International. A combined Dollar General-Family Dollar would have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion.Dollar Tree and Family Dollar combined would have 13,000 stores across the United States and Canada and $18 billion in annual sales - enough to vault it ahead of Dollar General as the biggest discount retailer in North America.Diana Moss, vice president of the pro-competition American Antitrust Institute, said a union between Dollar General and Family Dollar would create a company that controls the market.""That's going to raise some eyebrows,"" she said. ""I can see this will get some heavy scrutiny.""Rahul Sharma, managing director of investment advisory Neev Capital, said antitrust issues were not insurmountable given the much bigger size of retailers such as Wal-Mart and Kroger Co , which also cater to low- and middle-income consumers.Combined, the three dollar chains' annual sales total about $35 billion - less than a tenth of Wal-Mart's $473 billion. ""It is not clear to us why the antitrust concerns could not be resolved via methods such as store divestitures,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Efraim Levy. ""It might be that antitrust was not the full reason.""'UNFRIENDLY' Certainly, the Dollar Tree cash-and-stock bid is friendlier to Family Dollar's management. Levine, son of Family Dollar's founder, would remain CEO of the Matthews, North Carolina-based company were it to be bought by Dollar Tree.Were Dollar General to buy Family Dollar, Levine is expected to lose his job, although this has not been confirmed. ""The Dollar General offer, while it clearly makes sense in the form of synergies, was unfriendly to Family Dollar,"" said Joan Storms, retail analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has whittled down his stake in Family Dollar to 3.6 percent as of July 30 after buying 9.4 percent, has also questioned whether Levine's future could have swung the decision to favor Dollar Tree.There are reasons to argue that Dollar General and Family Dollar might be an easier fit. Both offer goods at multiple price points, while Dollar Tree sticks to a $1 or less format.Family Dollar's presence is biggest in Texas and the eastern United States.

33,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Nadia Damouni and Olivia OranNEW YORK, Sept 5 Dollar General Corp's  sweetened $9.1 billion proposal to buy Family Dollar Stores Inc  may fall short of allaying its smaller rival's fears U.S. antitrust regulators will block the deal, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Family Dollar already has a deal to sell itself to rival discount retailer Dollar Tree Inc for $8.5 billion. Dollar General, the largest U.S. dollar store, first appeared as an interloper last month with a $8.95 billion competing bid, or $78.50 per share, but Family Dollar rejected the offer saying it could run afoul of competition laws.Earlier this week, Dollar General returned with a new proposal, offering $80 per share and saying it would pay a $500 million reverse break-up fee to Family Dollar if regulators scuttle the proposed deal. Dollar General also said it would be willing to divest up to 1,500 stores, an increase from the 700 it originally proposed last month.But the sources familiar with the matter said the two key remedies offered by Dollar General - the  break-up fee and offer to sell more stores - failed to compensate the company for regulatory risk and may not work.Family Dollar's board has yet to convene to review the new proposal and a final decision on whether it should reject the bid has not been made, the sources said. But they added that the early sense within Family Dollar was that the new proposal still did not go far enough.Ideally, Family Dollar would want Dollar General to say it will do whatever it takes to close a deal, especially if it believes the proposed combination would pass regulatory muster, they said.However, Family Dollar has not engaged in a formal discussion with Dollar General, which has prevented it from  analyzing its larger rival's data. A spokeswoman for Dollar General declined to comment. But  in a press release on Tuesday the company said, ""we are confident that our enhanced proposal sufficiently addressed any concerns that led Family Dollar's Board of Directors to reject our prior proposal without any discussions between our companies.""A spokesman for Family Dollar declined to comment.If Family Dollar does reject the new bid, it could set the stage for a protracted battle for its future at a time when the dollar-store sector is struggling amid increased competition from big box stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp.Some pressure from investors has eased, however. Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who until recently was a vocal critic of Family Dollar management and had advocated for a sale to Dollar General, had sold his stake. ANTITRUST CONCERNS A combined Dollar General-Family Dollar would have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion.Dollar General's proposed $500 million break-up fee represents roughly 5.5 percent of the total transaction value. But the sources said it falls short of the agreed amount in some other situations where there were big regulatory risks to the deal. For example in 2011, when AT&T Inc negotiated a deal to buy T-Mobile USA from its parent Deutsche Telekom AG, it agreed to pay cash and assets worth about $6 billion to compensate the seller if regulators shot down the deal.While the cash agreement was already unusually high at 7.7 percent of the total deal price, the addition of assets and services of a similar value meant the companies broke global records with a 15.4 percent break-up fee, according to Thomson Reuters Data.Family Dollar thinks that the deal, which would unite the two largest U.S. discount retailers, would face the same amount of scrutiny, if not more, as AT&T's T-Mobile bid, the sources said. And so it should come with equally huge break-up fees, they added.Further, one of the sources said Dollar General's promise to divest up to 1,500 stores does not remove regulatory risk either in the company's view. There are almost 3,000 zones where Family Dollar and Dollar General have stores within three miles of each other and there are no other competitors, the source said.One antitrust lawyer who is not involved in the transaction said Family Dollar's insistence on antitrust risk could be a strategy to drive up the price.""I wouldn't get too hung up on Family Dollar pointing to the antitrust risk,"" said Jonathan Klarfeld, an antitrust lawyer with Ropes & Gray LLP. ""It's still in their interest to say that there's an antitrust problem because they're still in negotiation.""But he added that Dollar General may not know enough to rule out antitrust issues since it does not  have access to Family Dollar's confidential files. Klarfeld also said the Federal Trade Commission would challenge the deal if the regulator and the companies could not agree on which stores to divest or if acceptable buyers for the stores could not be found.(Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim in New York and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Tom Brown)",2014-09-05,DLTR,"Fri Sep 5, 2014 | 1:00am EDT",DEALTALK-Dollar General new bid may not sway Family Dollar-sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/familydollar-ma-dollargeneral-antitrust-idUSL1N0R51FW20140905?type=companyNews

But Family Dollar has said it plans to stick with an $8.5 billion offer from Dollar Tree.Investors, judging by the low levels of volatility in the options contracts, were not betting on a bidding war that would cause major gyrations in the shares. The 30-day and 60-day implied volatility levels for Family Dollar options are near all-time lows and at the level that any other ""normal"" takeover candidate would trade at, said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive officer at Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories LLC.Implied volatility projects what the marketplace is implying the volatility of the stock will be in the future, based on price changes in an option.

""Family Dollar is trading as if it is a deal stock that has been acquired,"" Gottlieb said.At the same time the 30-day implied risk as reflected by the options market in Dollar General is in the 25th percentile on an annual basis, which shows low risk in the stock, Gottlieb said.Dollar General's shares are still trading about 10 percent higher than when the company first bid on Family Dollar on Aug. 18.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)   Apparel retailer Gap Inc reports third-quarter results. The company estimated revenue below analysts' expectations, citing weak October sales at its Gap and Banana Republic brands. Analysts expect the company to have a good holiday quarter given the clearance of fall merchandise from stores and stocking of better, more colorful products to attract shoppers. Investors will look out for commentary on the holiday season quarter and plans for expansion outside North America.  The latest release on U.S. consumer prices is likely to garner more than the usual interest, given lingering concerns at the Federal Reserve about low inflation. Falling gasoline prices are seen dragging the CPI down by 0.1 percent in October, while a core gauge is expected to edge up just 0.1 percent, which would do little to ease lingering angst at the Federal Reserve about the difficulties of getting inflation back up to target. The latest readings from the Labor Department are expected to leave the 12-month change in the core CPI at just 1.7 percent, and the Fed targets 2 percent inflation as gauged by a measure that is running even softer. Separately, the Labor Department issues weekly jobless claims (0830/1330). National Association of Realtors issues Existing Home Sales for October. Existing homes sales are seen holding steady in October, but economists are likely to say a grudging housing recovery is still on the rails. Also, the Conference Board issues Leading Indicators for October (1000/1500).   Dollar Tree Inc, whose shareholders are set to vote on its proposed acquisition of Family Dollar Stores in December, is likely to report third-quarter profit above analysts' estimates, according to StarMine. It is expected to have had strong sales in both food and non-food categories, boosted by Halloween shopping. Lower gas prices and improved consumer confidence also indicate a good holiday quarter for the company, most of whose stores are located in low-income neighborhoods. Investors will be looking out for the holiday quarter outlook, comments on the pending acquisition and Dollar General's tender offer for Family Dollar's shares.  Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc's third-quarter profit is expected to beat estimates, benefiting from the launch of the new iPhones and sales of ultra high-definition 4K televisions. The company, however, warned same-store sales could fall amid stiff competition from online retailers. The company also said higher discounting could erode margins in the second half of the year.  Federal Reserve Board Governor Daniel Tarullo speaks on ""Liquidity Regulation"" before the ClearingHouse Annual Conference Kickoff Breakfast (0745/1245). Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester speaks on ""Forward Guidance and Communications in U.S. Monetary Policy"" (1330/1830).  Autodesk Inc, a software and services company, is expected to report third-quarter earnings above analysts' average estimate, according to StarMine. The company has been benefiting from strong demand for its computer-aided design software and as more people sign up for its could-based subscription model. Investors will be looking for impact on revenue as multi-year cloud subscription brings in less money upfront but assures a steady stream of revenue.  Video game retailer GameStop Corp reports third-quarter earnings. Investors will keep an eye out for any changes to the full-year outlook ahead of the holiday season that has kicked off with highly-anticipated game launches such as Activision's ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare"" and upcoming releases such as Nintendo's upcoming release ""Super Smash Bros"".   A non-jury trial is set to begin in the long-running court battle between Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific over the latter's acquisition of Guidant. Johnson & Johnson claims Guidant improperly scuttled J&J's bid by allowing Abbott Labs to examine its books in order to facilitate the merger, which included spinning off a portion of its business to Abbott. J&J is seeking more than $5 billion in damages. The trial is scheduled in two parts, with the second half to take place in mid-December. The case is before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan at 40 Foley Square in New York.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich will face scrutiny over Intel's slow progress in mobile when the company holds its annual investor day. The company this year has become the No. 2 supplier of tablet chips by offering customers subsidies leading to billions of dollars of losses in its mobile unit. Krzanich says future tablet chips won't need to be subsidized but Wall Street is skeptical.   A top U.S. safety regulator will join auto industry executives to testify at a Senate hearing that will investigate defective automobile air bags linked to deaths and severe injuries. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Deputy Administrator David Friedman will attend the Senate Commerce Committee hearing looking into the Takata air bag problem. He will be joined by Honda North America Executive Vice President Rick Schostek and Hiroshi Shimizu, Takata Senior VP in charge of global quality assurance. The U.S. government is investigating Takata's air bags, which can explode and hurl metal shards into the vehicle.   Splunk Inc, a data analytics software maker, is expected to post third-quarter profit above analysts' average expectations, according to StarMine. In early August, the company cut prices for its cloud software which boosted demand for Splunk Cloud and Splunk apps with Stream and Enterprise Security apps experiencing the highest growth over the quarter, according to analysts.  Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd is expected to report third-quarter profit below estimates, according to StarMine. The company had previously forecast revenue below estimates as demand for its 3G chips continues to dip. Marvell has been investing heavily in 4G LTE chips to offset the weakness it is seeing as more mobile phones move away from 3G. A number of U.S. chipmakers have in recent weeks suggested demand for chips from various industries, including automobiles and network equipment, was falling across regions, particularly Asia and Europe.   U.S. Senator Carl Levin's powerful committee will hold a two-day hearing on Wall Street banks' ownership of physical commodities and assets from pipelines to warehouses, touching off a two-year probe into potential market abuses. Wall Street banks - Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley - and regulators will appear before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations committee ahead of possible tougher rules from the Federal Reserve. The hearing will likely renew political scrutiny of banks that have faced pressure from the Fed over whether it is appropriate for them to maintain vast holdings in metals warehouses and other physical commodities businesses.  Chinese solar panel maker JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd's third-quarter revenue is expected to jump, helped by higher shipments to and demand from new markets such as the Middle East and Latin America - the company's new focus areas due to higher U.S. tariffs. Investors will want to know about the future of panel prices amid a developing supply glut, and how the tariffs affect the company's profit. Investors will also want to know about any plans to move manufacturing outside China.  Shares of the Cnova NV, the e-commerce business of French retailer Casino, are expected to start trading on the Nasdaq. The company's initial public offering comes after an active several months for e-commerce IPOs, culminating in the bumper New York flotation of China's Alibaba in September. Cnova is expected to raise up to $431.5 million, at the $12.50-$14 per share price range. The company, which has nearly $4 billion in annual sales in France, Brazil, Colombia, Thailand, Vietnam and Africa, would be valued at about $6.2 billion at the top end of the range.  Habit Restaurants Inc's initial public offering is expected to raise $80 million, valuing the fast-food restaurant chain at about $400 million. The California-based company has 98 restaurants in four U.S. states and its shareholders include private investment firm KarpReilly LLC. The company will join the list of casual dining chains, including El Pollo Loco Holdings and Zoe's Kitchen, that have listed this year.  Statistics Canada releases wholesale trade data for September.

55,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 9 Some 20 state attorneys general have joined the federal antitrust investigation of competing bids by Dollar General Corp and Dollar Tree Inc  to buy Family Dollar Stores  Inc, a development that potentially complicates the companies' efforts to win U.S. approval for a deal.The attorneys general concern focuses on the likelihood that the loss of one of the chains would lead to higher prices for discount store customers, many of whom are poor, said two sources who spoke privately because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.Family Dollar had previously disclosed that state attorneys general were involved in the federal investigation but gave no details.The 20 states looking at this deal are similar in number to those looking at Comcast Corp's plan to buy Time Warner Cable Inc and Sysco Corp's bid for US Foods Inc, both of them high-profile deals.Florida is a member of the multi-state group, which joined the Federal Trade Commission to determine if the deals were legal under antitrust law, according to Whitney Ray, spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi. Vermont had also joined, said Jill Abrams, an assistant attorney general in the state.Iowa is also in the group, according to a source who was not authorized to speak to reporters. Indiana is looking into the mergers, but a spokesperson declined to say if it had formally joined the multi-state group of attorneys general.The presence of the state attorneys general gives the FTC additional lawyers to look at the case, much-needed knowledge of how the merging companies function in the state and how the deal would affect the state's consumers, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust attorney with the Konkurrenz Group in Washington, DC.""There are times where federal government wants to do one remedy and you have a state or two who believe that there should be more done in their state. They at times will negotiate additional divestitures,"" said Grunes. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar declined comment for this story. Dollar General said only that it remained committed to the transaction and would continue to work with the FTC.Family Dollar, which has 8,100 discount stores in 46 states, has been targeted for a takeover by both Dollar Tree, which has 5,282 stores in 48 states, and by the big dog in discount retailing, Dollar General, which has 11,000 stores in 40 states.Family Dollar agreed to be bought by smaller rival Dollar Tree for $8.50 billion in cash and stock and rejected a hostile, $9.1 billion offer from Dollar General because of antitrust concerns.In December, Family Dollar shareholders voted by a wide margin to put off a vote approving the Dollar Tree offer, indicating interest in the higher offer despite its risk.

Dollar General bid $9.1 billion in cash but has not shown willingness to shed more than 1,500 stores. ""While not official, today's DG press release will more or less end the 7-plus month dollar store drama with the Family Dollar assets ending up in the hands of Dollar Tree,"" Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Charles Grom wrote in a note.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is evaluating the offers over worries that a deal could inflate prices at discount stores.Dollar General called the FTC's method to predict price increases ""controversial"". ""The FTC has departed from the approach used to analyze retail mergers over recent years and has instead relied heavily on an untested theoretical model,"" Dollar General said.Family Dollar on Monday estimated that regulators would need Dollar General to divest 3,500-4,000 stores. It also asked shareholders to vote for Dollar Tree's offer at its Jan. 22 shareholder meeting. A source close to Family Dollar told Reuters that the only path for Dollar General to work with the FTC now was through litigation, which could last many months.Dollar General said it would defend any lawsuit and expects to certify substantial compliance with the FTC's requests for information by Feb. 10, which would put a 30-day limit on how long the agency could mull over the proposed transaction.Several antitrust experts said Family Dollar shareholders were unlikely to vote against Dollar Tree after Thursday's developments.""It seems like (Dollar General) is giving up,"" said an expert, who spoke privately because he had not run a conflict check with his law firm.Dollar General's shares were down 2.5 percent, while Dollar Tree was up 1.3 percent.

76,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Dollar General Corp (DG.N) could make smaller acquisitions and build its store footprint to better compete with Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O), which is poised to become the largest discount retailer after its acquisition of Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N.  On Thursday, Family Dollar shareholders approved a cash-and-stock deal to be bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion, derailing Dollar General's $9.1 billion all-cash offer. The deal, which will give the combined company more than 13,000 stores and more than $18 billion in annual sales, is not expected to hurt Dollar General's growth and competitive standing, analysts said.        Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Taylor LaBarr said that Dollar General is now expected to focus on expanding its footprint of more than 11,500 stores, while Dollar Tree slows store openings to integrate Family Dollar. The company also has a competitive edge for up to two years as Dollar Tree enters a period of financial and operational frictions related to the integration, he wrote.          Dollar General said in December it was on track to open about 700 stores in the year ending in January. The company declined to comment for this story.""With gas prices down considerably over the past two months and home heating bills likely to (be) far lower than last year, there are several reasons to be more optimistic on the sales front in the coming periods for Dollar General,"" Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Charles Grom wrote in a note.Grom also said the extension of Dollar General chief executive officer's term was a ""big win"" for the company at a time it is facing growing competition from smaller format stores by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).   The company said its Chief Executive Officer Rick Dreiling, slated to step down at the end of May, would now stay on till January 2016. Grom said Dreiling needs to focus on expansion and prepare the company to face competitive threats, which now includes the Dollar Tree-Family Dollar combination. Dollar General has not detailed its strategy after losing out on Family Dollar.  On an analyst call in December, the company outlined a strategy that included focusing on affordability, selling more higher-margin private label goods, and promoting its digital coupon program. Analysts including S&P Capital IQ's Efraim Levy said Dollar General could look to grow faster by making tuck-in acquisitions.History shows that Dollar General, founded in 1939, has been averse to making acquisitions. Had it acquired Family Dollar, it would have been its first acquisition in three decades.Dollar General's shares closed up 3.8 percent at $69.77 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

The biggest U.S. discount retailer then took its offer directly to Family Dollar shareholders. Dollar Tree later threatened to walk away after Family Dollar shareholders twice postponed voting to approve the deal.""... today was the drop dead day. Shareholders got nervous,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.The Dollar Tree deal was the right one for shareholders as it has a better chance of passing regulatory muster, Family Dollar Chief Executive Howard Levine said, showing little emotion in discussing the sale of the company his father founded. Dollar General CEO Rick Dreiling called the vote a loss for consumers and Family Dollar shareholders.Levine said he expects the Federal Trade Commission to approve the deal by the end of March.If approved, the deal will give Dollar Tree more than 13,000 stores across the United States and Canada, and more than $18 billion in annual sales.Dollar General, which has about 11,500 stores, had revenue of $17.5 billion for the year ended Jan. 31, 2014. Dollar Tree said it would stick to selling food items, household products and party goods at $1, while Family Dollar stores would continue to have multiple price points.While Dollar Tree has suburban stores across most U.S. states, Family Dollar and Dollar General have a large presence in low-income neighborhoods.They have been facing competition from the smaller format stores started by retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Target Corp.The combination would help Dollar Tree increase its clout with vendors, S&P Capital IQ analyst Levy Efraim told Reuters.Family Dollar shares were up 1.3 percent at $76.50, while Dollar Tree rose 3.8 percent to $70.38.Dollar General shares rose 4 percent to $69.90 after the company said Dreiling would continue as CEO through January 2016, unless a successor was appointed earlier. He was slated to step down at the end of May.

(1.usa.gov/1EolGvx)The hedge fund was Family Dollar's second-largest shareholder before the sale with nearly 8.4 million shares, according to a Jan. 22 filing. Trian bought the bulk of its shares in 2010 for around $36 each, SEC filings show. Family Dollar shares have more than doubled in price since then.However, the fund has bought and sold parcels of shares in recent years, making it hard to calculate its profit on the holding.Trian Chief Investment Officer Edward Garden has been a member of Family Dollar's board since 2011, after Peltz withdrew an offer to buy the discount retailer. Garden also served on a committee of four directors that oversaw Family Dollar's review of strategic alternatives including the Dollar Tree deal.Family Dollar's shareholders approved Dollar Tree's cash-and-stock offer last week, scuppering a higher hostile offer from larger rival Dollar General Corp . The fund supported the Dollar Tree deal, unlike other activist investors such as Elliot Management Corp who said the Dollar General bid was ""superior"" and Carl Icahn who had pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General.Trian did not provide a reason for the sale of its stake.Activist investor Icahn, who once was Family Dollar's largest shareholder, sold his entire stake last September, indicating he did not expect a higher bid for the company.Family Dollar shares little changed at $76.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

83,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg and Michelle Sierra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 30 Two jumbo M&A loans totaling $12 billion in the challenging retail sector are giving a volatile and cautious U.S. leveraged loan market its first test of the year as increased government scrutiny makes it more difficult to syndicate riskier deals.Dollar Tree Inc's $6.95 billion loan facility, which backs the acquisition of fellow discount chain store Family Dollar Stores Inc, is the biggest U.S. M&A loan and biggest leveraged loan of the year to date and is a positive sign for continued M&A in 2015 after a record 2014.U.S. M&A volume last year totaled $457 billion, some 27 percent higher than the $361 billion in 2013 and the highest figure since the financial crisis.Meanwhile, PetSmart brought a $1.9 billion bridge loan to the market ahead of plans to line up a $4.3 billion financing to back its buyout by a BC Partners-led group.The two loans are hitting a market in price discovery mode with a mixed picture on demand. Net demand dipped negative for the second time in a year after strong outflows from loan funds in December, but demand was supported by collateralized loan obligation buying. Banks and investors are focusing firmly on credit amid a flight to quality and are showing a clear preference for bigger, more liquid deals for stronger credits with lower leverage ratios to avoid attracting unwanted government attention.Several deals have been priced wider than expected, including a $600m covenant-lite term loan for information technology consulting company Presidio, which was priced at 525bp over Libor, up from 475bp, after pushback from investors citing credit concerns. The loan was allocated and started to trade, but the company's high-yield bond was cancelled.""It's a very credit-specific analysis in the syndicated market. There are deals being flexed up and deals being flexed down, and deals being pushed back with the credit or the sponsor,"" an industry source said. Poles apartAlthough they both hail from the retail sector, Dollar Tree and PetSmart are very different credits and could see differences in appetite and pricing as a result. Dollar Tree is viewed as the stronger credit, with a Ba2/BB rating, which is reflected in pricing. A $5.2 billion seven-year Term Loan B is guided at 375bp-400bp, which one lender described as slightly wide as the company is paying a premium for size.  The yield is about 5 percent, well below the 6.4 percent average yield for new first-lien loans in January. Leverage on the deal is around five times.PetSmart is at the other end of the credit spectrum and is on negative CreditWatch with a BB+ rating by S&P. The company is in the market with a $1.9 billion 364-day bridge loan with guidance in the 700bp over Libor area before a planned $4.3 billion term loan. This puts the company's leverage above the six times level at which scrutiny from Federal regulators increases.Some banks pulled out of PetSmart's deal in December due to concerns over leverage and investors are also wary about buying loans that may be viewed suspiciously by the government.""(PetSmart and Dollar Tree) are both retailers, so the fact that they're receiving very different treatment indicates that people are looking at credits and leverage and risk returns,"" said Steven Rutkovsky, a finance partner at Ropes & Gray.(Additional reporting by Mariana Santibanez.)

103,"   By Kristen Haunss | NEW YORK, July 13  NEW YORK, July 13 A final standard for an electronic messaging system that seeks to eliminate the use of faxes in the $840 billion U.S. leveraged loan market may be released as early as this week.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is preparing to release a final version of Financial products Markup Language (FpML) for loan servicing messages that communicate events between the agent bank and lender through the life cycle of the loan, including inventory holding positions and interest rate resets, according to Bhavik Katira, chief executive officer at consulting-firm TenDelta and chair of the ISDA loan FpML working group.""If you can automatically process these events and then reduce manual labor there will be cleaner data then there is today because it's not being transmitted by fax,"" Katira said. ""It's clear, it's structured and everyone has the same view. It will also lead to a lot of cost savings.""Members of the leveraged loan market, which provides credit to non-investment grade borrowers such as retailer Dollar Tree Inc, are seeking to automate parts of the business that are communicated through fax and e-mail, and require manual data input, which can be costly and can lead to mistakes. It is also seeking to improve settlement times, which are significantly longer than the three days it takes to close a bond trade. This version of FpML, which is expected to be released on July 15, ""contains a major addition in the coverage for the syndicated loan asset class,"" Karel Engelen, co-head of data, reporting and FpML at ISDA, said in an e-mailed statement. It ""contains almost all major aspects of agent-lender communication for the purposes of asset servicing.""A final version for a loan FpML standard related to settlement information exchanged between a bank arranging a loan and the two counterparties to the trade is expected to be released next year, Katira said. When this portion is adopted, removing many of the manual aspects of the loan market, it should help facilitate decreased settlement times, he said.In the next version, the working group ""will expand the FpML confirmation view to cover secondary market loan trading messages,"" Engelen said. It took 19.3 days, on average, last quarter to settle a leveraged loan, more than twice the seven days recommended by the New York-based Loan Syndications & Trading Association (LSTA), according to Markit data.Loan settlement times are a concern of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is updating some of the rules related to registered funds and is considering making changes to liquidity management rules. ""If it takes over a month to settle, it is reasonable to wonder how the fund could possibly meet the seven day redemption requirement in the Investment Company Act in times of market stress,"" SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said in a speech in Washington on June 15.While these FpML versions are final, there is the ability to amend them going forward if issues arise, Katira said.And then it will be onto the next part of the loan market.""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Katira said of the FpML messages. ""We haven't even thought about the primary market, the syndication process or two-way communication between agent and lenders, like voting, so that's a whole other part of the process we haven't looked at.""

125,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Discount retailer Dollar General Corp (DG.N) said it was cutting prices on its most popular items such as bread, eggs and milk, intensifying a price war with retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to win back market share.Dollar General's shares fell as much as 14 percent on Thursday after the company reported quarterly sales below estimates, blaming aggressive competition, lower food prices and a reduction of food stamp coverage in several U.S. states.Larger rival Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) also reported lower-than-expected sales, sending its shares down 8.3 percent.Dollar General cut prices by 10 percent on average on about 450 of its best-selling items across 2,200 stores during the quarter, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a conference call.He said the company expects to extend the price reductions to more product categories and markets. Wal-Mart's strategy of cutting prices has helped the world's largest retailer to boost sales in the latest two quarters. ""Wal-Mart's been doing better lately, lowering prices, and that's been a concern that (it) could impact dollar stores,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""Historically, it hasn't as much but maybe we are seeing something different here."" Dollar store operators have expanded aggressively in recent years, taking market share from Wal-Mart and other retailers, thanks to their smaller store sizes, improving product assortment and price points starting $1.Dollar Tree's Chief Financial officer Kevin Wampler downplayed any impact from competition. ""I can't tell you (competition) is an issue anymore for us than it usually is."" Retailers are also grappling with a drop in grocery prices that has pressured margins in the second quarter .Dollar General said prices for milk were down about 8 percent and for eggs over 50 percent. 'SNAP' CUTS HURT Some states changed in April the criteria for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamp program, as they brought back a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults.More than 500,000 people are estimated to lose SNAP benefits this year, according to research group Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  Dollar General said the changes in SNAP along with grocery deflation reduced same-store sales by 60-70 basis points in the second quarter ended July 29 and were expected to hurt results in the second half of the year as well.Though Dollar Tree said the impact from changes to food stamps was small, the company's acquisition of larger rival Family Dollar last year has increased its exposure to the program.Dollar Tree, which traditionally caters to middle-income consumers, attributed the ""challenging retail environment"" to consumers being pressured by higher rent and healthcare costs.Dollar Tree also cut its full-year sales forecast to $20.69 billion-$20.87 billion.The company's net sales rose 66 percent to $5 billion in the second quarter ended July 30, helped by the Family Dollar deal.Dollar General's net sales rose 5.8 percent to $5.39 billion.
