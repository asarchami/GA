0,"  * Railcars don't meet industry's latest safety standards* Crude loaded in North Dakota, bound for MissouriBy Alicia Underlee NelsonFARGO, N.D., Dec 31 The railcars carrying crude oil that crashed into a derailed grain train in North Dakota on Monday were all older types that do not meet the latest industry safety standards, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday.Robert Sumwalt, who is leading the NTSB's investigation into the collision of two BNSF Railway Co trains, said the cylindrical tank cars on the oil train were known as DOT-111s, which are widely used to move crude and ethanol.In October 2011, the American Association of Railroads, the rail industry's trade group, adopted new standards requiring tank cars manufactured after that date to have thicker hulls and reinforced valves to better protect against punctures and leaks in derailments. U.S. regulators also are considering tougher safety standards.""Our preliminary information is that none of the cars were of the newer design,"" Sumwalt said at a news conference in Fargo, North Dakota, east of the crash site.Those details go to the heart of growing debate about stronger safety measures as the oil-by-rail movement grows in tandem with the U.S. shale oil boom. Such measures could include tighter rules for moving highly flammable types of crude, such as the light-sweet variety produced in the Bakken shale play, or costly retrofits of older tank railcars.Monday's crash of the 106-car eastbound BNSF crude train into a derailed westbound BNSF grain train set off explosions near a small town west of Fargo, North Dakota, and a fire that still burned more than 24 hours later.No injuries were reported, but the crash was among several explosive derailments in 2013 involving trains hauling oil. The worst accident by far happened in July in a small Quebec town when a runaway train derailed and exploded, killing 47 people.OLDER RAILCARS  The NTSB has said at least 69 percent of railcars in use were built before 2011. The rail industry also has said it could cost $1 billion to retrofit all those railcars to meet the post-October 2011 standard.BNSF Chief Executive Officer Matt Rose, who is stepping down as CEO on Wednesday but will remain chairman, told Reuters in an interview in November that the company supports phasing out those older cars over seven years, which allows companies enough time to build replacements.BNSF is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc . 1300-MILE TRIP Sumwalt said the crude involved in the crash was loaded onto the train in Fryburg, North Dakota, and was headed nearly 1,300 miles (2,092 km) to Hayti, Missouri.Sources familiar with the loading operations told Reuters on Tuesday that Houston-based logistics company Great Northern Midstream loaded the crude at Fryburg, and it was to be unloaded at Marquis Energy's storage terminal and barge loading facility at Hayti, along the Mississippi River.Great Northern Midstream referred all questions to the NTSB, and Marquis Energy did not return a call seeking comment. Both companies are privately held.Marquis Energy's Hayti operation receives crude via rail, then transports it via barge to refiners along the river and the U.S. Gulf Coast.The U.S. East and West coasts are the major destinations for railed Bakken crude, as it is cheaper than imports and rail is the main transport choice because pipeline infrastructure is lacking.The U.S. Gulf Coast market has less demand for Bakken crude because growing pipeline infrastructure in Texas increasingly moves burgeoning Texas output - also largely light sweet crudes that are cheaper than imports - to Gulf Coast refineries.",2014-01-01,BRKB,"Tue Dec 31, 2013 | 8:27pm EST","Railcars in North Dakota crude train crash older, less safe -investigators",http://www.reuters.com//article/northdakota-derailment-energy-idUSL2N0KB01920140101?type=companyNews
1,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) has converted much of its debt in building products company USG Corp (USG.N) into more than $600 million of common stock in a successful investment made in the wake of the financial crisis.According to regulatory filings on Tuesday and Thursday, Berkshire acquired 21.39 million USG shares last month by exchanging $243.8 million of convertible notes it held in Chicago-based USG.That boosted its USG stake to 38.46 million shares, or more than 27 percent, worth $1.09 billion as of Tuesday's close.The stake makes Berkshire the largest shareholder of USG. It could rise above 30 percent if Berkshire was to swap its remaining $56.2 million of USG notes, a filing shows.Shares of USG rose 0.7 percent to $28.60 on Thursday. A USG spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire's stake. He said USG has roughly 139 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis following last month's redemption.Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, and Canada's Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO) in late 2008 acquired $400 million of USG convertible senior notes in a private placement. With that deal and others in the same time period, Berkshire gained a reputation as a lender of last resort when financial markets come under strain.The USG notes had a 10 percent interest rate, the same that Berkshire got when it invested $8 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N).Berkshire also bought $300 million of senior notes with a 15 percent rate from motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N). USG last month redeemed $325 million of the notes at a premium, and Berkshire exercised its right to swap its securities into USG common stock at just $11.40 per share.As of September 30, Berkshire held 15.7 percent of USG's common stock, regulatory filings show.

3,"  HOUSTON Jan 2 BNSF Railway Co said it reopened the two mainline tracks that it shut after a crude oil train exploded after it hit a derailed grain train earlier in the week.The company said in an advisory to customers that it reopened one track at 3 a.m. CST (0900 GMT) and the other at 3:15 a.m. on Thursday. BNSF said customers might experience delays of up to 36 hours on shipments through that corridor. A 106-car eastbound BNSF train carrying crude oil crashed into a railcar of a derailed westbound BNSF grain train from an opposing track on Monday, setting off explosions and a fire that burned for more than 24 hours, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. No injuries were reported. The NTSB is investigating the incident. BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc , had been rerouting trains while the tracks were closed since Monday. Some oil trains were being routed through Sheridan, Wyoming, while some coal and merchandise trains were rerouted from Aberdeen, South Dakota, to Laurel, Montana. BNSF spokesman Steven Forsberg said on Thursday that some trains were still being rerouted, as ""it will take time to get traffic flows back to normal on the route involving the derailment.""The train crashed just west of Casselton, North Dakota, which is about 25 miles (40 km) west of Fargo at the North Dakota/Minnesota state line.",2014-01-02,BRKB,"Thu Jan 2, 2014 | 11:50am EST",UPDATE 1-BNSF Railway reopens tracks after train crash,http://www.reuters.com//article/northdakota-derailment-idUSL2N0KC0KM20140102?type=companyNews

5,"  By Brendan O'BrienJan 13 Eighteen of 20 tanker cars carrying oil that derailed in the fiery crash of two trains in North Dakota in late December were punctured, spilling more than 400,000 gallons of crude oil, safety regulators reported on Monday.In a preliminary report, the National Transportation Safety Board said the oil train heading east struck a derailed car from a westbound grain train, leading to the derailment and fire about a mile (1.6 km) outside the small town of Casselton, North Dakota, on Dec. 30.Both trains were operated by BNSF Railway Co, more than 100 cars long each and were traveling well below the posted 65-mile-per-hour speed limit, the NTSB report said. BNSF is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.The grain train was traveling at 28 mph (45 km per hour) and the oil train at 43 mph (69 kph) when emergency braking systems were applied on both trains, the report said. A series of powerful explosions and fireballs followed the collision, with the blaze creating plumes of thick, black smoke that passed over Casselton, forcing about 1,400 people in the area from their homes. No injuries were reported.The incident caused about $6.1 million in damage, according to the NTSB report. A broken axle and two wheels were shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for further evaluation, as were locomotive event and video recorders, the agency said. ""Thankfully, no one was hurt, but this accident underscores the need to work to prevent derailments in the first place, and to upgrade the tanker fleet to reduce the risk of fires and explosions if an accident does occur,"" U.S. Senator John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, said in a statement.Hoeven said he reviewed the preliminary report and called on the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to issue new standards for tanker car construction.The crash came five months after a runaway oil train carrying Bakken crude derailed and exploded in the center of the Quebec town of Lac Megantic, killing 47 people. The incident fueled a drive for tougher standards for such shipments, including potentially costly retrofits to improve the safety of tank cars that regulators have cited as prone to puncture.In early November, two dozen cars on another 90-car oil train derailed in rural Alabama, erupting into flames that took several days to extinguish.The Association of American Railroads recently proposed costly fixes to older tank cars that do not meet its latest standards, but continue to carry hazardous fuels such as oil.The fixes include protective steel jackets, thermal protection and pressure relief valves, which could cost billions of dollars.

11,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 30 A federal judge who has questioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's practice of settling cases without admissions of wrongdoing is raising concerns about a proposed agreement over insider trading in H.J. Heinz Co.Concerns voiced by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff were detailed by the SEC in a court filing in New York federal court Thursday as it seeks approval of a $5 million settlement with two brothers from Brazil.The SEC said that in November, Rakoff questioned the agency's decision to allow the brothers to settle while neither admitting nor denying the charges. Despite a revision to the settlement, the judge has continued to raise issues, the SEC said.The dispute, which has not been previously reported, came despite a new settlement policy ushered in by SEC Chair Mary Jo White in June that would require defendants in some cases to make admissions, in contrast to letting them resolve lawsuits without admitting or denying the charges.The shift followed a public debate over the practice prompted in large part by Rakoff, who in 2011 refused to approve the SEC's $285 million financial crisis-related settlement with Citigroup Inc.Rakoff at the time said he had no way to know if the accord was in the public interest. The SEC is awaiting a decision by 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on whether it will reverse the judge. The commission's latest run-in with Rakoff came in lawsuit filed in February 2013 initially against unknown traders in H.K. Heinz over suspicious trades ahead of the announcement that the ketchup maker would be acquired for $23 billion by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazil's 3G Capital.In October, the SEC filed an amended complaint while simultaneously settling with the two brothers in Brazil now named in the case, Michel Terpins and Rodrigo Terpins.The SEC said the brothers had used a family-owned Cayman Islands entity called Alpine Swift to buy $90,000 in options positions a day before the takeover was announced.After the deal became public, the positions' jumped in value by 2000 percent, the SEC said. As part of the settlement, the Terpins agreed to forfeit all $1.81 million in profits made from trading Heinz options and also pay $3 million in penalties.Neither brother admitted nor denied the charges as part of the settlement as initially drafted.No transcripts exist of the calls between Rakoff and the parties where the SEC said he raised his concerns. But from the start, Rakoff's only concern was the inclusion of the no-admit, no-deny language, the SEC said. The SEC said that after further negotiations, it submitted on Dec. 26 revised proposed consent judgments for Rakoff's approval that dropped the language. But the proposed judgments contained clauses that made clear that the lack of the language didn't constitute an admission, the SEC said.Rakoff on a Dec. 31 call expressed continued concerns and gave the parties three options, the SEC said: remove the new clauses, require the brothers to admit to the allegations for the limited purpose of the proceedings, or have an evidentiary hearing.On a call that followed on Jan. 9, Rakoff ordered the SEC to submit a court filing providing the evidence supporting its claims. Rakoff had required a similar filing in the Citigroup case as well.In Thursday's filing, which provided that evidence, the SEC said the settlements with the brothers ""reflect a fair, adequate, and reasonable resolution of this matter.""Dwight Bostwick, a lawyer for Michel Terpins, declined comment. A lawyer for Rodrigo Terpins did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the SEC also declined comment.The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Starr & Co, which was set up by AIG founder Cornelius Vander Starr in 1943.The MultiPlan deal could be the clearest sign yet of how Greenberg, 88, has been working on a Wall Street comeback after spending the last few years dealing with a multitude of lawsuits and investigations while suffering huge losses in the value of his AIG holdings as the insurance giant tottered during the financial crisis.Although Greenberg's closely held company does not disclose financial details, people familiar with the matter said its private investments arm, Starr Investment Holdings LLC, had more than $3 billion in assets under management. It is tiny compared with Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $283 billion.In the MultiPlan deal, Greenberg deployed some of the same tactics as Buffett - using cash flow from a set of operating companies and assets as well as his relationships to pull off a large deal.""We have a rapidly growing insurance arm, we have a real estate business, and we also have a unit that helps Chinese companies invest in the U.S.,"" Greenberg said in an interview. ""We are private, we don't advertise what we are doing, and we will stay private,"" added Greenberg, who described the private investments arm as a significant driver of earnings.Greenberg, who - according to Forbes - had a net worth of $3.2 billion around the time he was ousted as AIG boss, last year told talk show host Charlie Rose he had lost around 90 percent of his wealth as a result of AIG's collapse. AIG shares are still trading at a tiny fraction of their pre-crisis levels.Leading Starr Investment Holdings is Geoff Clark, already a veteran private equity dealmaker at the age of 41. After co-founding Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity group in 1996 and being its co-head until 2004, Clark joined Starr in 2007, at a time when it invested in private equity funds but also made direct private equity investments.He led Starr Investment Holdings as it launched as a dedicated private investments business in 2012 and adopted an investment horizon that can go beyond the typical five-to-seven-year period that buyout firms tend to hold companies before selling them or doing an initial public offering.RISING STARR Rather than manage a traditional private equity fund that raises money from investors and then decides how to invest it, Starr Investment Holdings reaches out to investors on a deal-by-deal basis to seek their participation. Greenberg brought Swiss alternative asset manager Partners Group Holding AG (PGHN.S) and three other investors into the MultiPlan deal.The identity of the other investors, and information about the size of their stakes, was not disclosed but a person familiar with the deal said they included Bill Gross' Pacific Investment Management Co, the world's largest bond fund manager. A Pimco spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.""Mr Greenberg was very involved on the Starr side,"" Joel Schwartz, Partners Group managing director, said in an interview.

17,"   By Kristen Hays and Cezary Podkul | HOUSTON/NEW YORK  HOUSTON/NEW YORK BNSF Railway Co plans to move into tank car ownership and buy its own fleet of up to 5,000 new crude oil tank cars with safety features that exceed the latest industry standards, the unit of investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) said on Thursday.The unusual step by one of the largest U.S. railroads aims to reduce the risks of moving crude by rail after several recent accidents, including one involving a BNSF train in North Dakota in December.The company, a major mover of crude by rail throughout the United States, plans to seek bids from railcar makers for up to 5,000 new tank cars with thicker walls and ends, increased protection of safety and pressure valves, and other features that go beyond industry standards adopted two years ago.The news sent shares of several U.S. railcar makers higher.Railroads like BNSF generally own only the tracks and locomotives that pull trains. Railcars are usually owned by leasing companies or firms such as refiners that sometimes buy cars for their own fleets. In some cases, shippers buy railcars, sell them to leasing companies, and then lease them back.The December crash of a BNSF crude train in North Dakota involved railcars that did not meet industry safety standards, according to investigators. The train collided with a derailed grain train, setting off fires that burned for more than a day. No one was hurt.Crude-carrying tank cars built after October 2011 are based on stronger design standards recommended by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) trade group. Those design standards feature stronger hulls and reinforced valves less likely to puncture or leak in a derailment.The U.S. Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is considering new rules for safer tank cars as crude transport via rail surges in tandem with the booming onshore oil production in the United States and Canada.Last week, Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) said they would charge higher rates for customers that move crude in railcars built before October 2011, which the National Transportation Safety Board said in 2009 were unsafe.BNSF declined to comment on possible pricing to shippers opting to use the railroad's tank cars once they are built, saying such information is proprietary. Other U.S. railroads also declined to comment last week on the Canadian railroads' decision to charge shippers more for using older tank cars.BNSF's plan to move into tank car ownership and the Canadian railroads' pricing decisions to push shippers to use newer railcars all come before U.S. regulators have issued any new safety standards. BNSF did not identify railcar makers that it will invite to bid, but manufacturers in the United States include Trinity Industries Inc (TRN.N), American Railcar Industries Inc (ARII.O) and Greenbrier Cos Inc (GBX.N).Shares of American Railcar rose as much as 15 percent, while Trinity jumped 10 percent and Greenbrier climbed 6 percent. A Trinity said it would look at BNSF's needs.Earlier this month, before saying it would take bids for new oil railcars, BNSF said it would spend $1.6 billion this year on locomotive, freight car and other equipment purchases. That was part of a $1 billion increase in its annual capital budget to $5 billion.BNSF did not say when it expects to take delivery of the cars. American Railcar Industries said on Thursday that its tank railcar manufacturing unit was maxed out, though Greenbrier recently said it had capacity for more work.CRUDE BY RAIL GROWTH Rapid proliferation of moving oil by train started more than three years ago, with shipments surpassing 780,000 barrels a day in 2013 - a 71 percent jump from 2012, according to AAR. The growth resulted from a lack of pipeline infrastructure to move burgeoning inland output to refining markets, particularly on the U.S. West and East coasts, where refiners were otherwise highly dependent on more expensive imports.Refiners with coastal plants have heavily embraced oil by train, building offloading facilities to receive it. BNSF moves more crude from North Dakota's Bakken shale than its peers.However, crude via rail has come under intense scrutiny from regulators after multiple crashes, particularly those that involved pre-October 2011 older railcars without reinforcements.AAR in November issued stronger recommendations, including the addition of reclosing high-pressure relief valves, metal jackets and full-height head shields.The Railway Supply Institute, a lobbying group that represents tank car manufacturers, last week proposed requirements that are essentially the same as AAR's. The worst oil-by-rail accident happened last July when a runaway Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway train carrying Bakken crude crashed in a small Quebec town, causing explosions and fires that killed 47 people and obliterated half of the main downtown strip. Other accidents that did not cause deaths followed.LIGHT ENDS, REFINERS BUYING CARS In addition to considering stricter standards for tank cars, U.S. regulators are studying the volatility of lighter crude like that produced in the Bakken that moves via rail.Such light crudes are considered by experts to be more dangerous than Canadian heavy crude because they contain more light ends - such as propane and butane - that can catch fire and explode amid sparks that fly in a crash.In January, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx met with railroads and shippers to look at railcar safety issues, train speeds and rail inspections. At the time, he asked them to respond with ideas in 30 days. On Thursday, he emphasized there were no quick fixes.""We are not going to figure this entire issue out in 30-days,"" Foxx told reporters. ""There is going to be a much longer-term look at how we strengthen our safety measures for the movement of crude oil in our country, but we also recognize there is some goodwill in getting some voluntary measures done.""Some refiners are not waiting to switch to newer railcars.Phillips 66's (PSX.N) crude tank car fleet consists entirely of post-October 2011 cars, and some others are phasing out older DOT-111s. PBF Energy Inc (PBF.N) last week said it will rely on entirely newer railcars by April 1 - much faster than previous estimates of the end of 2014.Canadian refiner Irving Oil, the destination for the crude on the train that crashed in Quebec last year, said on Monday it would replace all pre-October 2011 railcars in its fleet with the newer design by the end of April.Tesoro Corp (TSO.N) is replacing the last older cars in its fleet by mid-summer, and Valero Energy Corp, the largest U.S. refiner, has ordered more than 5,300 newer cars.(Additional reporting by Joshua Schneyer in New York and Patrick Rucker in Washington; Editing by Terry Wade, Lisa Von Ahn, Leslie Adler and Marguerita Choy)",2014-02-20,BRKB,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 6:08pm EST",Exclusive: BNSF to move into tank car ownership with safer oil fleet,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bnsf-crude-rail-idUSBREA1J1BE20140220?type=companyNews

24,"  NEW YORK Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, known for his folksy straightforward communication style, turned to farming to recommend his winning strategy for investors to follow.In an excerpt of his annual letter to shareholders published online by Fortune on Monday, Buffett used a 1986 purchase of a farm located 50 miles north of Omaha to support his case about simple, diversified and low-cost investing.He had bought the farm because he could weigh how much the property would yield in corn and soybeans against its operating costs - and not to speculate on the value of the land or to sell it as soon as prices rose.""Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or more what I paid,"" Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders, adding that he has visited the property only twice.""So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in a farm."" Buffett's advice reflected, as well, his bias toward holding assets for the long term. Rather than a constant flux of buying and selling, Buffett said investors should treat daily price changes as background noise, to be ignored in pursuit of a greater objective.""The goal of the nonprofessional should not be to pick winners - neither he nor his 'helpers' can do that - but should rather be to own a cross section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well,"" he wrote.For nonprofessionals, such as mom-and-pop investors saving for retirement, Buffett recommended a low-cost S&P 500 index fund, particularly highlighting Vanguard's. That mutual fund has a net expense ratio of 0.17 percent. Buffett - ranked the world's fourth-richest person by Forbes magazine, with a fortune of $53.5 billion - also dismissed much of the market- and economy-watching that informs daily price fluctuations and, often, future price speculation.""Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time,"" wrote the man dubbed ""the Oracle of Omaha"" because of his performance in the markets. Investors should instead focus on the future productivity of assets, rather than speculating on price movements, which Buffett said that he was unable to do successfully.""Games are won by players who focus on the playing field - not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard.""Berkshire Hathaway is expected to report its 2013 earnings on Saturday.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2014-02-24,BRKB,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 1:06pm EST","Don't bet the farm; keep investments simple, diversified: Buffett",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-buffett-letter-idUSBREA1N1H520140224?type=companyNews
25,"   By Luciana Lopez | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A five-year bull market may have finally outdueled one of the U.S. stock market's biggest bulls, and Warren Buffett will probably tell investors on Saturday that his 43-year run of beating the Street has come to an end.By his own benchmark for performance, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc almost certainly lagged a red-hot stock market in 2013 and probably also fell short over the previous five years, his favored timeframe for measuring the firm's return for its investors.Using the gain in Berkshire's book value per share after taxes, which Buffett traditionally contrasts with the pre-tax total return, including dividends, on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, Berkshire will be hard pressed to match the S&P's 128.2 percent gain in the five years ended December 31, 2013.Investors will learn for sure when the world's fourth-richest man releases his annual letter to investors on Saturday around 8 a.m. Eastern time.Buffett, 83, had already warned last year that he might miss his target, noting that his conglomerate of more than 80 companies and investments might fare relatively better in weaker markets than stronger ones.The S&P's sharp rally since 2008 has made Buffett's benchmark particularly difficult to maintain over the past five years due to a flood of money from the Federal Reserve boosting equity markets. The whopping 32 percent total return on the S&P last year only makes it more likely that Berkshire's book value did not match the index's five-year performance.In fact, he would have required a one-year gain of more than 40 percent in book value per share from 2012's $114,214 to keep his prized streak alive. Ironically, Buffett took on the role of cheerleader for the American stock market during the depths of the recession, writing an Op-Ed piece in the New York Times on October 17, 2008 imploring readers to ""buy America.""WORRY LIST GROWS FOR BERKSHIRE Berkshire has grown so big that some investors worry it will not be able to grow as quickly in the future.Hedge fund investor Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, questioned Buffett about that very issue last year at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, which draws thousands of people to Nebraska to a question-and-answer with Buffett and other company executives. Kass was invited as Berkshire's first ""credentialed bear"" to ask tough questions about the company's performance.Kass, who remains short Berkshire stock, noted then that Buffett is now looking for larger and larger acquisitions, which are harder to find at attractively undervalued prices.That said, Buffett has hardly become a slouch at making money.Berkshire Hathaway will probably report operating earnings per share of $2,203.91, according to the average analyst estimate as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and full-year net income of about $15 billion. The annual letter to shareholders mixes Berkshire's results with everything from Buffett's views on the business climate to common-sense wisdowm about investing - as well as an update on Berkshire's dozens of businesses, from lollipops to insurance.In an excerpt that leaked earlier this week, for example, Buffett yet again banged the drum on the need for simple, disciplined, low-cost investing, especially for nonprofessional investors such as retirement savers.Investors will also scour this year's letter for any word on a possible successor to Buffett at Berkshire.The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known, has already talked a bit about what Berkshire could look like without him, but he's shied away from naming the next person to take the baton.Meyer Shields, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc, said he expects ""no real information on transition. I'd love to be wrong here, but the odds are ... against the idea of any useful information in terms of who takes over.""The letter is also something of a preview for Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, when Buffett and other Berkshire executives hold forth in Omaha on where the company could be headed.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-02-28,BRKB,"Fri Feb 28, 2014 | 6:07pm EST",Buffett letter could show Berkshire winning streak over,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-buffett-letter-preview-idUSBREA1R22B20140228?type=companyNews
26,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett on Saturday signaled he plans to make more large acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway Inc to expand his conglomerate, which posted a record profit in 2013 with the help of a recovering U.S. economy.""America's best days lie ahead,"" Buffett, 83, said in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders.""Charlie and I have always considered a 'bet' on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing,"" he added, referring to his 90-year-old vice chairman Charlie Munger. ""Though we invest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.""The annual letter is widely read not just by Berkshire shareholders, but by investors and others looking for wisdom and guidance from the so-called Oracle of Omaha, the world's fourth-richest person.Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, and the Omaha, Nebraska-based company now has more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities and ice cream. It also owns more than $117.5 billion of stocks.Buffett again signaled that he has no plans to leave his company soon, telling shareholders he intends in next year's letter to review his first 50 years at Berkshire, and what the future may bring.RECORD PROFIT Full-year profit rose 31 percent to $19.48 billion, or $11,850 per Class A share, while operating profit rose 20 percent to $15.14 billion, or $9,211 per share.For the fourth quarter, net profit rose nearly 10 percent to $4.99 billion, or $3,035 per share, and operating profit rose 34 percent to $3.78 billion, or $2,297 per share.Berkshire's book value per share, Buffett's preferred yardstick for measuring net worth, grew 18.2 percent after taxes in 2013 to $134,973. Despite that, the 2009-to-2013 period marked the first time since Buffett took over Berkshire that book value per share rose more slowly over five years than the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends on a pre-tax basis.Berkshire's per share net worth was up about 91 percent during that period, while the index gained about 128 percent.Net worth per share has nonetheless grown at 19.7 percent annual clip under Buffett since 1965, when it was a mere $19. The S&P 500 annual growth rate was just 9.8 percent.Buffett said he remains on the prowl for more big acquisitions, which he calls ""elephants,"" after two recent big purchases: a $5.6 billion acquisition of Nevada utility NV Energy by Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy unit, and a $12.25 billion investment in ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co.He said future purchases could follow the ""partnership"" structure he used when teaming up with Brazil's 3G Capital to buy Heinz. Buffett also said Berkshire's 50 percent Heinz stake could grow if 3G investors decide to sell their shares to him. Berkshire ended last year with $48.19 billion of cash and equivalents, giving Buffett the freedom to make big acquisitions and retain a $20 billion cushion.Munger told Reuters last year that Berkshire would be ""stark raving mad"" not to pursue another giant acquisition, but that it was difficult to do so because low interest rates had pushed up takeover prices.Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who oversees around $9 billion with about 11 percent of that in Berkshire, said Munger and Buffett have the luxury ""to do nothing"" until opportunities arise, which strengthens Berkshire's strategy.In the fourth quarter, Berkshire was a net seller of stock, selling $191 million more than it bought.While Berkshire is known for its insurance businesses, Buffett has been acquiring businesses in other, sometimes boring sectors that are capable of steadily boosting revenue. He said profit from a ""Powerhouse Five"" of large non-insurance unit -- the BNSF railway, Iscar for metalworking, Lubrizol for chemicals, Marmon for industrial products, and MidAmerican Energy -- might boost pre-tax profit in 2014 by $1 billion from the $10.8 billion they collected in 2013.BUFFETT GETS BEATEN Buffett also heaped praise on portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who help choose stocks for Berkshire and now each invest more than $7 billion.""I must again confess that their investments outperformed mine. (Charlie says I should add 'by a lot.'),"" Buffett said, referring again to Munger. ""Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.""Berkshire's succession plan calls for Buffett's responsibilities to be split in three after he leaves. Buffett's son Howard would become non-executive chairman, and others would serve as chief executive officer and chief investment officer.Buffett has not said who the candidates for the CEO position are, except that they all work at Berkshire and are men.In the letter, Buffett again praised the work of insurance executive Ajit Jain, who he called an ""idea factory,"" and called MidAmerican Chief Executive Greg Abel and BNSF Chairman Matthew Rose, as well as new BNSF CEO Carl Ice, ""extraordinary managers.""He also said Tad Montross, the head of the General Re reinsurance unit, has turned a business that Buffett once thought he had made a ""huge mistake"" in buying into a ""gem.""Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $173,708 on Friday, and its Class B shares closed at $115.78.

And, as will become so expensively clear to citizens in future decades, there has been even greater electorate ignorance of governmental pension costs."" Many state and local governments are struggling to meet their obligations to retirees, stemming from the economic crisis which put enormous pressure on state and municipal budgets as well as poor decision-making.On Saturday, Buffett said: ""During the next decade, you will read a lot of news - bad news - about public pension plans. I hope my memo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.""In the 1975 memo, Buffett said it is ""next to impossible to decrease pension benefits in a large profitable company - or even a large marginal one.""

Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pension mathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans. Investment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to Katharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and the importance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118-136. During the next decade, you will read a lot of news - bad news - about public pension plans. I hope my memo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.""ON BERKSHIRE'S EXPOSURE OF BofA: ""Berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At year-end these shares were worth $10.9 billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fifth largest equity investment and one we value highly.""ON BUYING MORE H.J. HEINZ: ""Though the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a 'private equity' transaction, there is a crucial difference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buy more, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, and we might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that it would be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at an equity valuation appropriate to the time)."" NV ENERGY 'FITS NICELY' INTO BERKSHIRE: ""NV Energy, purchased for $5.6 billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricity to about 88 percent of Nevada's population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utility operation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will not be MidAmerican's last major acquisition."" 'GEICO'S FLOAT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY GROW': ""Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO's float will almost certainly grow. In National Indemnity's reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual - at the outside no more than 3 percent in any year.""HUNT FOR BERKSHIRE'S BEAR: ""And we will again have a credentialed bear on Berkshire.

33,"   By Lauren Young | New York  New York In his most recent Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, the ever-folksy Warren Buffett sounds more like a personal finance guru than a financial mastermind, focusing on buy-and-hold investing and advocating indexing strategies.Buffett's net worth is about $60 billion, according to Forbes magazine, so he is obviously doing something right. But how sound is his advice for the rest of us? (here)I spoke to some financial advisers and pundits, some of whom are the kind of folks Buffett thinks you should ignore, to get their take.STAY PASSIVE, KEEP COSTS LOW What immediately caught my eye is Buffett's instruction that his wife back up the truck and invest in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index upon his death.That's not a huge surprise, though. Buffett is a longtime fan of Jack Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, who champions passive, low-cost investing. But this is the first time Buffett is ""putting his money where his mouth is in his own estate,"" Bogle said in a email exchange with Reuters.Specifically, Buffett wants the trustee of his estate to put 10 percent of his wife's cash inheritance in short-term government bonds and 90 percent in a low-cost S&P index fund - and he tips his hat specifically to Bogle's Vanguard in doing so. Says Buffett: ""I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors - whether pension funds, institutions or individuals.""Face value, that's a solid recommendation, although it might seem a bit odd, considering that Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P 500 in the past five years, and is trailing it slightly in 2014. But that's not surprising because Buffett tends to lag a bit in bull markets, says Robert Hagstrom, author of The Warren Buffett Way. ""I had this image of the American flag waving in the background as I read the letter,"" said Hagstrom. ""He's so bullish about the U.S., not necessarily about stocks, but about the country in general.""When it comes to equities, Buffett's recommendation to buy the S&P 500 is solid, experts say. ""The S&P 500 is probably the best index out there - it's clearly a core holding,"" says Lou Kokernak, a financial adviser at Haven Financial Advisers in Austin, Texas.However, other advisers say Buffett is endorsing an asset allocation strategy that's not optimal for most investors. That's because the S&P 500 is focused on U.S. companies, even if quite a few have a multinational tilt. ""We refer to that as a home bias, and it's very dangerous,"" says Randy Kurtz, chief investment officer at RK Investment Advisors in Kinnelon, New Jersey.That is exactly why Paul Jacobs of Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Atlanta suggests putting as much as 40 percent of Buffett's suggested equity stake in foreign stocks. Another criticism? Most investors cannot tolerate the risk of a 90/10 portfolio. ""They would be scared out at the bottom when their $1,000,000 would have turned into $500,000 in 2009,"" says Matthew Chope, a financial adviser at Raymond James in Southfield, Michigan. ""It's as easy as that. We are paid to manage risk, not just return.""INVESTING VS. SPECULATION Which brings us to another big Buffett takeaway: invest, rather than speculate. In his 24-page letter, Buffett uses the examples of an office building in New York City and a farm he has visited only twice as investments he has held for the long haul, through the ups and downs of the market.A farm and office building might strike some people as odd investments. Yet they are ""classic Buffett"" because they get to the heart of what is plaguing investors, who spend more time worrying about the price of an asset rather than its intrinsic value, Hagstrom says. ""Investment is focusing on the asset and what that asset will earn, while speculation focuses on the price and predicting what the changes in price will be,"" says Hagstrom. Writes Buffett: ""With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc heiress Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, in ninth place, at $36.7 billion. France's Liliane Bettencourt, who got much of her wealth from cosmetics company L'Oreal SA, was next among women at $34.5 billion, and ranked 11th overall.The Internet was well-represented.

42,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett is seeking to reassure shareholders about how his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) will perform in the decades after he steps down or dies, but remains as vague as ever about succession plans.And that means some followers of the 83-year-old billionaire's huge insurance and investment company remain far from comforted by his words, and worry about how well Berkshire can thrive without him.""I don't know of any good examples of an iconic CEO like Buffett ever being successfully followed,"" said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.Examples from the last 15 years show how hard this can be.Jeff Immelt, the CEO at General Electric Co (GE.N), has been unable to get his company's share price anywhere near the heights achieved by his predecessor Jack Welch. Steve Ballmer had similar problems following Bill Gates at the helm of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).And after a strong start in following the iconic Steve Jobs, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook has had some major struggles in the past 18 months and the company's share price is well off its highs.One problem for any successor is that Buffett, by dint of his long stewardship of Berkshire and the outperformance he has delivered over most of the past half century, has the freedom to make mistakes or underperform the stock market in ways that could cost other CEOs their jobs.""I feel sorry for the person who follows in his shoes,"" said Dave Sather, president at Sather Financial Group, which invests more than 5 percent of its $365 million of assets under management in Berkshire.""Buffett's in a very unique position... to where he can just think 100 percent independently. I worry that the next person will not have quite the same flexibility to be a dealmaker.""Certainly, Buffett's profitable deal-making has been a boon to Berkshire for decades, and has at times been transformative for the company.In his annual letter to shareholders this weekend, Buffett noted that Berkshire's performance trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPXTR in 2013 - and in fact, even on a five-year basis it lagged that benchmark for the first time under Buffett. Berkshire's net worth per share rose about 91 percent in the five years, while the index gained about 128 percent. Still, since 1965, Berkshire's book value per share has risen to $134,973 from $19. The nearly 20 percent annualized gain is twice the rate of growth in the S&P 500.Buffett has said that Berkshire is likelier to outperform the S&P when markets are weak or moderate, in contrast to the surge in equities last year. While it lagged over the last five years, it has outperformed over the last six, including during the 2008 financial crisis.SPLITTING ROLES Berkshire plans eventually to split Buffett's three roles as CEO, chief investment officer and chairman. The only one of those positions where succession has been clearly flagged is the last: Berkshire plans to make his son Howard non-executive chairman.Berkshire's board had previously identified three internal candidates for the CEO job, though it has never named any of them, with one of those selected to take over immediately in an emergency.But in a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire eliminated its previous statement about the number of candidates and said only that ""certain current"" managers of subsidiaries were CEO candidates. Speculation over succession has mounted in recent years, including after Buffett underwent radiation therapy treatments for prostate cancer in 2012.Buffett on Saturday praised some of the people who investors believe could be among his potential successors - including Ajit Jain (the head of his insurance operations), Greg Abel (the chief of his power utility MidAmerican), and Matthew Rose (who leads his railroad company BNSF).He also pointed out that portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler - who could be candidates for the chief investment officer job - had outperformed not only Berkshire's returns but those of the S&P 500 last year, though their portfolios of more than $7 billion each are small compared with the massive one that Buffett himself oversees.The strong bench may not mean a lot in the days immediately after Buffett disappears from the scene, investors say.""When he's gone the stock price will probably get hit a little bit, 10 percent, 20, I don't know,"" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. Still, he said, such a decline would be ""a great buying opportunity."" He cites the quality of Berkshire's assets and the teams Buffett has put in place at various subsidiary units.Lountzis invests more than 15 percent of his roughly $100 million of assets under management in Berkshire. Not that Buffett isn't preparing for the days when he isn't around.In the annual letter, Buffett said Berkshire is thinking a century ahead when the Omaha, Nebraska-based company makes big acquisitions now.Last year, he bought half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for $12.25 billion and Nevada utility NV Energy for $5.6 billion last year, to complement the more than 80 Berkshire businesses in areas from insurance to ice cream.Heinz and NV Energy are companies that ""fit us well and will be prospering a century from now,"" Buffett said.He also said the BNSF railroad and MidAmerican Energy units ""will still be playing major roles in our economy"" when the year 2114 rolls around, while ""insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses and individuals - and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.""Some investors point out that Buffett has shifted Berkshire more toward operating companies that pile up money, adding security for the future.""He literally has built a perpetual cash generating machine,"" said David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners Inc in St. Louis, which invests 9 percent of its $7 billion of assets under management in Berkshire.Buffett did drop one small hint about his eventual departure, buried in a discussion of accounting practices.Speaking about certain charges, Buffett said the full amortization ""usually takes 15 years and - alas - it will be my successor whose reported earnings get the benefit of their expiration.""Buffett would be 98 by then.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Martin Howell)",2014-03-04,BRKB,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 4:16am EST",Buffett fails to dispel investor angst over succession plan,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-buffett-succession-investors-idUSBREA2308B20140304?type=companyNews
43,"  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) trades at a lower premium and has more earnings power than Carl Icahn's Icahn Enterprises Inc (IEP.O), and investors wishing to invest alongside either billionaire may want to side with the so-called Oracle of Omaha, Barron's said in its March 10 edition.Both conglomerates posted record profit in 2013, with Berkshire recording $19.5 billion of net income and $15.14 billion of operating income while Icahn Enterprises, a so-called master limited partnership, posted a $1.03 billion profit.Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses including the BNSF Railway and Geico car insurance, and shares such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). Icahn Enterprises owns stakes in companies like auto parts maker Federal Mogul Corp (FDML.O), and through investment in an Icahn hedge fund stocks such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Herbalife Ltd (HLF.N).The two companies' shares have performed much differently so far this year. Berkshire's Class A shares closed on Friday at $183,772, after touching a record high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, Icahn Enterprises shares closed Friday at $116.69, which was 22 percent below its record set in December.According to Barron's, Berkshire looks like a better buy. Berkshire trades at 1.36 times its year-end book value of $134,973 per share, and the newspaper said it may trade at a discount to intrinsic value, citing Buffett's repeating in his annual shareholder letter this month that Berkshire's intrinsic value ""far exceeds"" its book value.Assuming some profit improvement, Berkshire's book value could approach $145,000 per share by year end, Barron's said, or 1.27 times the current share price. That would be close to the 1.2 multiple at which Buffett, 83, said in the letter he would be ""aggressive"" in buying back stock, after buying back none in 2013.In contrast, Barron's said Icahn Enterprises' share price is nearly 50 percent above what the company calls its ""indicative asset value."" The newspaper said that price ""looks excessive"" because the company wholly owns only a small group of businesses, and its performance hinges on Icahn's continued investing success.""Icahn, at 78, continues to deliver,"" Barron's said. ""But the current price of Icahn Enterprises discounts a lot more success by the billionaire.

According to Barron's, Berkshire looks like a better buy.Berkshire trades at 1.36 times its year-end book value of $134,973 per share, and the newspaper said it may trade at a discount to intrinsic value, citing Buffett's repeating in his annual shareholder letter this month that Berkshire's intrinsic value ""far exceeds"" its book value. Assuming some profit improvement, Berkshire's book value could approach $145,000 per share by year end, Barron's said, or 1.27 times the current share price.That would be close to the 1.2 multiple at which Buffett, 83, said in the letter he would be ""aggressive"" in buying back stock, after buying back none in 2013. In contrast, Barron's said Icahn Enterprises' share price is nearly 50 percent above what the company calls its ""indicative asset value.""The newspaper said that price ""looks excessive"" because the company wholly owns only a small group of businesses, and its performance hinges on Icahn's continued investing success.""Icahn, at 78, continues to deliver,"" Barron's said. ""But the current price of Icahn Enterprises discounts a lot more success by the billionaire. Berkshire looks like a better bet.""",2014-03-09,BRKB,"Sun Mar 9, 2014 | 1:10pm EDT",Bet on Buffett's company before Icahn's company -Barron's,http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSL2N0M60E920140309?type=companyNews

But we should look at his advice a bit more closely.In an earlier Buffett blog on Fortune.com, the legendary investor cited the ticker symbol for the Vanguard 500 Index fund.

52,"  March 16 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has urged shareholders to vote against a proposal that it consider spending some of its $48.2 billion of cash on a ""meaningful"" dividend.According to a Berkshire proxy filing on Friday, David Witt, a Cincinnati resident who owns nearly $8,600 of Berkshire stock, will propose the payout at the company's May 3 annual meeting.Berkshire has not paid a cash dividend since 1967.""Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners unlike Warren are not multi-billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend on the shares,"" Witt's proposal said, referring as Buffett does to shareholders as owners.Buffett was not immediately available for comment.His $58.2 billion net worth makes him the world's fourth-richest person, Forbes magazine said this month.In opposing Witt's proposal, Berkshire's board said it already considers annually whether the Omaha, Nebraska-based company should retain all earnings. Buffett, 83, has long maintained that he can generate better returns through acquisitions such as the BNSF railroad and investments such as Wells Fargo & Co.He told shareholders in 2011 that Berkshire's share price ought to fall if the company decided to pay a dividend.

53,"   By Tim Reid | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Los Angeles, faced with nearly $10 billion in unfunded pension and retirement liabilities, should adopt the pension formula used by investor Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway Inc to manage the city's growing retirement costs, a report recommended on Wednesday.The Los Angeles 2020 Commission, chaired by former U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor and former deputy mayor and investment banker Austin Beutner, recommended that America's second-largest city cut the projected return rate on its pension investments from 7.75 percent to 6 percent, the rate used by Buffett for Berkshire Hathaway's pension system.Such a move would require the city to pay an extra $560 million a year into its two main retirement funds, said Miguel Santana, the city's administrative officer, who was not party to the report's recommendations.Los Angeles projects its deficit next year at $240 million, and such a drop in the projected rate of return would pose a ""significant challenge to the city,"" Santana told Reuters.The lower the projected return rate, the more cities and employers must pay into retirement funds. Los Angeles' current 7.75 percent projected return rate is similar to that used by many other cities. The portion of the city's budget spent on retirement costs has grown from 3 percent in 2003 to 18 percent this year. Unfunded liabilities - the amount of money the city has to pay to meet its long-term obligations - have increased to $9.4 billion in the past 10 years from $87 million, according to a recent report by California Common Sense, a budget watchdog.Pension reformers argue that unless municipalities take immediate action to pour more money into public pension systems, some will face a crisis, including possible bankruptcy, in the future because they failed to set aside necessary funds to pay retirement promises made to current workers. In March, Buffett warned that the crisis in public pensions will intensify. The main reason, he wrote in a letter to shareholders, is that public entities have promised pensions they cannot afford.The Los Angeles panel wrote: ""Can anyone in City Hall claim to know more about understanding future liabilities and how to budget today for them than Warren Buffett?""It is unlikely the pension recommendation will be adopted by the current mayor, Democrat Eric Garcetti, who is scheduled to give his first State of the City address on Thursday. Yusef Robb, a spokesman for Garcetti, said: ""Mayor Garcetti always welcomes new ideas as he works to reform City Hall and improve our economy.""In its initial report in January, the commission said Los Angeles was faced with high poverty, crumbling infrastructure, terrible traffic, weak government, and unfunded pensions. It noted that L.A. is the only major U.S. city to show a net decline in jobs in the last decade.The panel made a series of recommendations, including raising the minimum wage, merging the harbors of Los Angeles and Long Beach into a single port facility, and adopting a more transparent and responsible budgeting process.(Edited by Ronald Grover, Peter Galloway and Matthew Lewis)",2014-04-09,BRKB,"Wed Apr 9, 2014 | 6:10pm EDT",Los Angeles should adopt Warren Buffett pension formula: study,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-municipalities-los-angeles-idUSBREA381US20140409?type=companyNews

The Los Angeles panel wrote: ""Can anyone in City Hall claim to know more about understanding future liabilities and how to budget today for them than Warren Buffett?""It is unlikely the pension recommendation will be adopted by the current mayor, Democrat Eric Garcetti, who is scheduled to give his first State of the City address on Thursday. Calls to his office were not immediately returned.In its initial report in January, the commission said Los Angeles was faced with high poverty, crumbling infrastructure, terrible traffic, weak government, and unfunded pensions. It noted that LA is the only major U.S. city to show a net decline in jobs in the last decade.The panel made a series of recommendations, including raising the minimum wage, merging the harbors of Los Angeles and Long Beach into a single port facility, and adopting a more transparent and responsible budgeting process.

58,"   By Luciana Lopez | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), said on Wednesday that safety is a major priority for the rail industry, after a recent spate of accidents raised concerns about how to transport oil safely.""I can tell you that's all they're thinking about,"" the investor said in an interview with Reuters.""We're going to move a lot of crude in this country, and we have to learn how to do it very safely,"" he added.He added that the delay in the construction of the Keystone pipeline was unlikely to prompt additional purchases of tank cars at Berkshire railroad unit BNSF.Earlier this year the railroad said it plans to buy its own fleet of up to 5,000 new crude oil tank cars with safety features that exceed the latest industry standards.Oil by rail has surged in recent years, helped by a boom in North Dakota. Traffic is now running 10 percent ahead of last year at this time, with BNSF accounting for roughly a third of U.S. oil-by-rail traffic.But recent accidents have underscored the dangers of transporting the volatile fuel by train, with Canada now planning to phase out older tank cars to improve safety.

67,"   By Jonathan Stempel | April 30  April 30 Berkshire Hathaway Inc's  energy unit has changed its name to Berkshire Hathaway Energy from MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, the largest of a growing list of businesses to adopt the name of the company run by billionaire Warren Buffett.The change ""reflects the benefits we gain from Berkshire Hathaway's ownership, particularly our ability to reinvest in our businesses and take a long-term view of our customers' needs,"" Greg Abel, the unit's chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday.MidAmerican's new name also reflects a recent trend in which the company Buffett took over in 1965, when it was a failing textile maker, sees its name planted on an array of units.Berkshire ranks fourth in Fortune magazine's list of the world's most admired companies. ""MidAmerican doesn't mean much to anybody. Berkshire does,"" said Andy Kilpatrick, who last week released a revised version of his book, ""Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett."" ""Having a recognized brand name could be a door opener for bringing in business.""In October 2012, a real estate brokerage owned by MidAmerican created the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brand, putting the Berkshire name on ""For Sale"" signs around the country. Eight months later, the parent launched a new commercial property casualty insurance unit called Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance. Berkshire's array of more than 70 newspapers, mostly acquired recently and including its hometown Omaha World-Herald, falls under its BH Media Group Inc umbrella.Berkshire still has many recognizable brands among the more than 80 businesses it owns, including Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and Geico auto insurance. In 2013, MidAmerican posted a $1.64 billion profit on revenue of $12.74 billion, and Berkshire's 89.8 percent stake contributed nearly 8 percent of the parent's overall profit. Berkshire had taken an initial 76 percent stake in 2000.Berkshire Hathaway Energy is based in Des Moines, Iowa, has about $70 billion of assets and serves 8.4 million customers.Its subsidiaries, including Oregon-based PacifiCorp and the Nevada-based NV Energy utility, for which MidAmerican paid $5.6 billion last year, will keep their names and continue to be run locally.Berkshire will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Saturday in Omaha.

68,"  * Profit up as focus increases on midstream and chemicals* Company ordering more railcars to keep up with crude by rail growth* Project to process more oil at Illinois refinery announced   (Adds financial details, executive comments, updates share price)By Kristen Hays and Anna DriverApril 30 Phillips 66, the second-largest independent U.S. oil refiner, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a big gain from a share exchange and its chemicals and midstream businesses.Crude oil and natural gas pumped from shale formations in the United States have lowered feedstock costs for companies such as Phillips, which is expanding its network of pipelines and processing facilities for increasing onshore output.Phillips, based in Houston, had a first-quarter profit of $1.6 billion, or $2.67 per share, compared with $1.41 billion, or $2.23 a share, in the same quarter of 2013.Excluding a one-time gain of $706 million primarily related to Berkshire Hathaway Inc's deal to swap its Phillips 66 shares for ownership of the company's specialty products unit, Phillips 66 earned $1.47 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results topped expectations on the performance of the chemicals and midstream businesses, analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients.Earnings in the company's refining business slumped to $306 million from $904 million in the first quarter of 2013, hurt by plant maintenance and lower margins.Profit from the company's interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical company was $316 million, up 12 percent from a year earlier. MORE RAILCARS Phillips 66 is increasing its capability to receive North Dakota crude via rail at its New Jersey and West Coast refineries, and has ordered 1,200 new tank railcars to move it.That is in addition to 2,000 railcars the company received last year. A spate of fiery crude train crashes last year has increased regulatory scrutiny of the safety of the oil-by-rail movement, which has boomed in tandem with growing U.S. inland oil production.Last week Canadian regulators ordered that all tank railcars that do not meet the industry's latest safety standards adopted in October 2011 be phased out in three years, and U.S. regulators are expected to recommend similar or possibly tougher rules.Phillips 66's new fleet and the railcars on order meet the latest standard, Tim Taylor, executive vice president of  commercial, marketing, transportation and business development for Phillips 66, told analysts on Wednesday. The company also is working with contractors and shippers to ensure their fleets do the same.""Certainly we will comply, but we want them to meet the newest specification,"" he said.Also on Wednesday, Cenovus Energy Inc announced a $100 million project to expand capacity at its joint-venture 333,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Wood River, Illinois, which Phillips 66 operates as part of the 50-50 agreement.The project, which will allow the plant to fully utilize processing capabilities after a $4 billion expansion to run more Canadian heavy crude, will start up in the first quarter of 2016.Shares of Phillips were up 4 cents at $83.79 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

69,"  Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) energy unit said on Thursday it will buy AltaLink, Canada's regulated electricity transmission company, from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc (SNC.TO) for about $2.9 billion in cash.AltaLink will operate as a separate company under Berkshire Hathaway Energy with its current name and will continue to be headquartered in Calgary, the two companies said in separate statements.SNC-Lavalin had said in September that it was looking to sell its equity stake in AltaLink as part of its strategic plan to trim ownership of infrastructure investments and monetize assets. AltaLink, whose assets include 280 substations and about 12,000 kilometers (roughly 7,456 miles) of transmission lines, serves about 85 percent of Alberta's population and reported revenue of C$534.1 million ($486.63 million) in 2013.

70,"  (Adds background, details on deal)May 1 Berkshire Hathaway Inc's energy unit said on Thursday it will buy AltaLink, Canada's regulated electricity transmission company, from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc  for about $2.9 billion in cash.AltaLink will operate as a separate company under Berkshire Hathaway Energy with its current name and will continue to be headquartered in Calgary, the two companies said in separate statements. SNC-Lavalin had said in September that it was looking to sell its equity stake in AltaLink as part of its strategic plan to trim ownership of infrastructure investments and monetize assets. AltaLink, whose assets include 280 substations and about 12,000 kilometers (roughly 7,456 miles) of transmission lines, serves about 85 percent of Alberta's population and reported revenue of C$534.1 million ($486.63 million) in 2013.

72,"   By Luciana Lopez | OMAHA, Nebraska  OMAHA, Nebraska A ho-hum stock market so far this year may be just what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N)(BRKb.N) shareholders needed.As they gather this week at the sprawling conglomerate's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, and rub shoulders with its iconic chairman, Warren Buffett, the fact that its shares are once again beating the broader market should help dim the sour memory of its recent run of underperformance.Last year, for the first time in nearly half a century, the gain in Berkshire's book value over five years - Buffett's preferred measure of performance - lagged the total return of the S&P 500 .SPX.Buffett himself concedes his company is just not built to run neck and neck with the kind of raging bull market that produced a 128 percent total return for the S&P from the end of 2008 through 2013. Berkshire, which saw its net worth grow just 91 percent by comparison in that run, does best in a weak market - the weaker the better, perhaps.""For impressive outperformance you need a crisis,"" said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.""He's a headline investor,"" said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management, who owns about $18 million of Berkshire's class B stock. ""If bad news comes, he's looking.""So with the S&P delivering a return, including reinvested dividends, of just 2.5 percent through the first four months of 2014 - and less than 2 percent on price alone - the 8.7 percent gain in Berkshire shares should provide shareholders some comfort.More importantly for Buffett, it could also offer him some cover as he hosts the company's annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday, even though he will still face questions about how well the company can do going forward and why, at 83, he still hasn't named a successor. Often called the called the Woodstock of capitalism, tens of thousands of people make the trek annually to hear Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, 90, answer hours of questions about the future of Berkshire, which has operations ranging from insurance to house paint.THE ELEPHANT GUN One topic of discussion is certain to be what he might buy next and how me might structure his next big deal.Analysts at Barclay's estimate that Berkshire now has about $25 billion available for purchases, but as with last year's $23 billion Heinz deal, he may opt not to go it alone as he hunts for his ""elephants."" In that deal, Buffett broke new ground for Berkshire, partnering with private equity firm 3G Capital for the deal. He could use that template again, Buffett said in an interview with Reuters last week. But he acknowledged that such deals aren't exactly thick on the ground.""If I live long enough we'll do another one,"" he joked.Buffett is transparent about his purchase criteria.""Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management,"" Berkshire noted in a regulatory filing this year. Finding a company that fits his requirements and can soak up that much cash could be a challenge, as could replicating the hands-down success of his largest-ever deal: the $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2009.In hindsight, he looks prescient for buying the railroad on the eve of a U.S. oil production renaissance that sparked a boom in an oil-by-rail business now dominated by BNSF.He called it an ""all-in wager on the economic future of the United States."" Five years later, BNSF now accounts for nearly 20 percent of Berkshire's pretax income.No less an investor than Bill Gross, in fact, pointed out how hard it will be for investing titans such as himself and Buffett to keep replicating their past success.Last year Gross, the chief investment officer of the bond firm Pacific Investment Management Co, said that he, Buffett and others had seen their returns boosted over the past few decades ""during perhaps a most advantageous period of time, the most attractive epoch, that an investor could experience.""In one of his monthly investment outlook missives, Gross mulled whether that time could be drawing to a close: ""Perhaps ... it was the epoch that made the man as opposed to the man that made the epoch.""(Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Dan Burns, Bernard Orr)",2014-05-01,BRKB,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 1:07am EDT",Berkshire share gains may offer Buffett cover at annual meeting,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-berkshire-annual-idUSBREA4003D20140501?type=companyNews
73,"  The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is likely to revise its controversial equity compensation plan for executives before it goes into effect in 2015, following pressure from Warren Buffett, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), made his reservations about the plan known privately in recent weeks to Coca-Cola's Chief Executive Muhtar Kent in three conversations, the Journal quoted sources as saying.As of February 24, Berkshire owned 400 million shares of the company, just over 9 percent of the shares outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters dataBuffett said last week that he thought Coca-Cola's controversial equity compensation plan was excessive, but Berkshire Hathaway abstained in the shareholders vote. Buffett, in an interview with CNBC, said he and partner Charlie Munger did not want to vote against the plan because he did not want to show disapproval of Coca-Cola's management.On Tuesday, Buffett said that he had spoken to Kent ""multiple times"" and to his son Howard Buffett ""very briefly"" in reference to the equity compensation plan, adding that his son served Coca-Cola shareholders and not Berkshire on the beverage maker's board. Buffett's pressure adds to that from critics, most notably activist investor David Winters, who said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders too much.Coca-Cola had said last week that 83 percent of shareholders approved the plan.

79,"   By Luciana Lopez | OMAHA, Nebraska  OMAHA, Nebraska Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his recent controversial vote on executive pay at Coca-Cola Co and disappointing performance at railroad BNSF, as investors grilled him on his Berkshire Hathaway Inc conglomerate at its annual shareholder meeting.The investment guru was peppered with questions at the meeting, part of a mostly festive weekend that Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" following concerns that Berkshire last year missed Buffett's five-year growth target for the first time in his 49 years at the helm.Buffett, 83, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 90, took the stage at a downtown Omaha arena as they faced off with the audience and a hand-picked panel often excusing recent worries at the sprawling conglomerate.""Over any cycle we will over-perform, but there's no guarantee on that,"" he said. Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 30 percent.Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire's decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola's equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive.That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket.Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that ""going to war"" would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire's abstention sent an even more effective message.""We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,"" Buffett said. ""I don't think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.""Buffett said he had conversations with Coke's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive.""I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,"" he said.Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis.""I don't think there's anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,"" Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal.""I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,"" he said. ""It's way easier to prosecute corporations - it's somebody else's money, and the prosecution knows it's going to get a win. (Corporations') calculus is such that it just doesn't make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.""WORKING ON THE RAILROAD The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts.That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company's service challenges.""We're making significant investments,"" Rose reassured the audience.Buffett added that Berkshire could spend ""many, many billions"" to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country's largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business.

80,"  (Adds details from meeting throughout)By Luciana LopezOMAHA, Neb. May 3 Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his recent controversial vote on executive pay at Coca-Cola Co and disappointing performance at railroad BNSF, as investors grilled him on his Berkshire Hathaway Inc   conglomerate at its annual shareholder meeting.The investment guru was peppered with questions at the meeting, part of a mostly festive weekend that Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" following concerns that Berkshire last year missed Buffett's five-year growth target for the first time in his 49 years at the helm.Buffett, 83, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 90, took the stage at a downtown Omaha arena as they faced off with the audience and a hand-picked panel often excusing recent worries at the sprawling conglomerate.""Over any cycle we will over-perform, but there's no guarantee on that,"" he said. Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 30 percent.Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire's decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola's equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive.That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket.Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that ""going to war"" would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire's abstention sent an even more effective message.""We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,"" Buffett said. ""I don't think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.""Buffett said he had conversations with Coke's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive.""I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,"" he said.Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis.""I don't think there's anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,"" Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal.""I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,"" he said. ""It's way easier to prosecute corporations - it's somebody else's money, and the prosecution knows it's going to get a win. (Corporations') calculus is such that it just doesn't make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.""WORKING ON THE RAILROAD The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts.That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company's service challenges.""We're making significant investments,"" Rose reassured the audience. Buffett added that Berkshire could spend ""many, many billions"" to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country's largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business.In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions.Indeed, much of Berkshire's growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle.Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J.

81,"   By Jonathan Stempel | OMAHA, Nebraska  OMAHA, Nebraska Warren Buffett on Saturday gave an endorsement for the online home rental service Airbnb Inc, after receiving many complaints from Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders about how many Omaha hotels had jacked up room rates on the weekend of the company's annual meeting.Many area hotels sell out months in advance for the event, and many rates double or even triple for the weekend. It is not unusual for hotels to charge more than $400 a night for non-luxury accommodations, or require three-night minimums, prompting complaints of price gouging.Buffett said it is understandable that rates might rise, given that Berkshire's annual meeting now attracts some 38,000 shareholders - roughly two-thirds from outside the area - for what is Omaha's largest annual tourism event other than the baseball College World Series.""Since we want to increase the demand ... that's why we have encouraged Airbnb to come in,"" he said. Airbnb promotes itself as offering reasonably priced accommodations for visitors in nearly 200 countries. The Silicon Valley start-up last month won a $450 million investment by a group led by private equity firm TPG Capital Management LP, valuing Airbnb at $10 billion.Critics say the service takes away business from legitimate hoteliers, and deprives municipalities of tax revenue. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman last month said he is examining whether the service violates state laws on subletting.Buffett explained that unlike a major convention city such as Las Vegas, Omaha lacks sufficient demand for rooms over the course of the year to justify a big expansion in supply. He likened it to Augusta, Georgia, which he said can't justify adding huge numbers of rooms for the week it hosts the Masters golf tournament.""Omaha cannot size its hotel supply to the Berkshire meeting,"" he said. ""What really bothered me was the three-day minimums. Something irritates me about coming to a one-day event and having a three-day minimum ... There were a few that were really pushing things."" According to the Berkshire-owned Omaha World-Herald, Buffett had mused about moving next year's annual meeting to Dallas, which has more hotel rooms and where Berkshire's Nebraska Furniture Mart plans to open a new location.Buffett quickly backtracked and confirmed that the meeting, which would take place in his 50th year at Berkshire's helm, will stay in Omaha, a sentiment he repeated on Saturday.""Omaha people love this event, it's an economic boon for Omaha, and people get a good impression of Omaha,"" he said. ""Fortunately, something like Airbnb is sort of a flex supply arrangement that seems to make more sense.""(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-05-03,BRKB,"Sat May 3, 2014 | 4:56pm EDT",Buffett endorses Airbnb to combat hefty Omaha hotel prices,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-berkshirehathaway-annualmeeting-airbn-idUSBREA4209L20140503?type=companyNews

84,"   By Jonathan Stempel | OMAHA, Nebraska  OMAHA, Nebraska The chief executive of a real estate brokerage business owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc said the U.S. housing market is more than halfway through its recovery from its recent depths, held back by a paucity of buyers able to obtain financing for their first homes.Ron Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America Inc, said ""our industry is probably in the sixth inning of a nine-inning recovery,"" with very strong activity in coastal markets such as Miami, Boston, New York and Silicon Valley, and in the market for higher-end homes across the country.""The single most-challenged sector of the market is the first-time home buyer,"" he said. ""Historically, they make up 40 percent of the existing home market. In the last 18 months to two years, it has been 27 to 28 percent. Twelve percent of the market has been missing. It's troubling.""Peltier spoke in an interview on the sidelines of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.HomeServices is the second-largest U.S. independent real estate brokerage, and part of a Berkshire unit that was on Wednesday rechristened Berkshire Hathaway Energy. U.S. home resales in March fell to a 1-1/2 year low, dropping to an annual rate of 4.59 million units according to the National Association of Realtors.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to an eight-month low, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 384,000 units.Bad weather was a factor in both declines. Peltier, though, said many prospective home buyers are facing hurdles that became more commonplace after the nation's housing slump. ""There are still very, very favorable (interest) rates,"" he said, but ""credit standards and down payments are excruciatingly difficult. There's a will to buy, not a way to buy.""In the first quarter, Berkshire reported a $24 million pre-tax loss from ""real estate brokerage and other"" items within Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as spending rose on employment and marketing. Revenue rose 21 percent to $405 million. Some of that extra marketing was to rebrand local brokerages as Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. That puts the Berkshire name on ""For Sale"" signs, and Peltier said it is helping business.""The brand is golden,"" he said. ""We have received an incredible number of comments from every market we've launched in that the values associated with the Berkshire brand translate into values that consumers look for: integrity, honesty, trust, value.""That may also be resonating with photographers.Peltier said that in Vail, Colorado, a winter resort that caters to many wealthy people and where Berkshire's local brokerage is using the Berkshire name, ""they've never had so many people standing in front of the signs, taking pictures.""(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2014-05-03,BRKB,"Sat May 3, 2014 | 3:36pm EDT",Berkshire housing executive laments dearth of first-time buyers,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-berkshirehathaway-annualmeeting-homes-idUSBREA4208V20140503?type=companyNews
85,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Luciana Lopez | OMAHA, Nebraska  OMAHA, Nebraska Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) on Friday said quarterly profit declined 4 percent, falling short of analyst forecasts, as earnings from insurance underwriting declined and bad weather disrupted shipping at its BNSF Railway unit.Results nonetheless benefited from strength in many businesses, including a one-third increase from underwriting at its Geico car insurance unit, and improvement at economically-sensitive businesses such as its Clayton Homes mobile home unit.First-quarter net income fell to $4.71 billion, or $2,862 per Class A share, from $4.89 billion, or $2,977, a year earlier.Quarterly operating profit fell 7 percent to $3.53 billion, or $2,149 per share, from $3.78 billion, or $2,302 per share.Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 2.6 percent from year-end to $138,426 from $134,973.Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,172 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Results were also hurt by an 80 percent drop in gains from derivatives, mainly related to contracts whose value grows faster when the stock market rises. Berkshire said such gains are ""often meaningless"" in trying to understand the company.""It's the medium- to long-term results that count,"" said Mark O'Hare, a private investor from Brisbane, Australia. He said the profit shortfall is ""consistent with what Mr. Buffett has always said: underwriting results will vary from year to year. The key is that it's a profitable underwriting result."" O'Hare was speaking in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are welcoming tens of thousands to Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists."" They will field five hours of questions on Saturday at Berkshire's annual meeting.Some may focus on Berkshire's slowing growth, after Buffett in 2013 missed his five-year target for the first time since taking over the company in 1965.Berkshire's per share net worth grew 91 percent after taxes from 2009 to 2013, while the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends rose 128 percent before taxes.The company's market value tops $316 billion. It will need big deals, such as last year's purchase of a 50 percent stake in ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, to keep growing. Heinz contributed $177 million to first-quarter profit.""In a quarter where the economy didn't grow, you wouldn't expect a company that's considered by the chief executive to be an all in bet on the U.S. economy to have stellar growth,"" said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns $34 million of Berkshire shares. A lack of big mergers has also driven up Berkshire's cash stake, which rose to $48.95 billion from $48.19 billion at the end of 2013. Buffett has said he wants a $20 billion cash cushion.BAD WEATHER HURTS BNSF Operating profit from insurance fell 31 percent to $1.18 billion. Much of the drop was attributable to a reinsurance business, whose lower results reflected currency fluctuations and the absence of a year-earlier gain.Meanwhile, operating profit from noninsurance businesses rose 5 percent to $2.35 billion. This was despite a 9 percent drop at BNSF to $724 million, which Berkshire said resulted from ""severe weather conditions and service-related challenges,"" especially in northern U.S. states. Berkshire nonetheless projected that BNSF's profit for the rest of the year will top levels in 2013.Profit generated by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of and on Wednesday changed its name from MidAmerican Energy, rose 15 percent to $453 million.That unit on Thursday agreed to pay $2.9 billion for AltaLink LP, a Calgary-based unit of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc (SNC.TO) that provides energy transmission services in Alberta.Overall, Berkshire revenue rose 4 percent to $45.45 billion.Berkshire also owns tens of billions of dollars of stocks such as American Express Co (AXP.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).Its smaller businesses sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim's jewelry, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed down $1,173 at $192,255 after earlier hitting a record high, and the Class B shares fell 97 cents to $128.09.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-05-03,BRKB,"Sat May 3, 2014 | 2:57pm EDT","Berkshire quarterly profit hurt by winter weather, insurance",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-berkshire-results-idUSBREA410WO20140503?type=companyNews

""I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke.""But he also talked about the social pressures of board votes on compensation plans.

Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company's service challenges.""We're making significant investments,"" Rose reassured the audience.And Buffett added that Berkshire could spend ""many, many billions"" to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country's largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business.Last year, Berkshire Hathaway underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett's own preferred measure: gains in the company's book value, or worth, over five years lagged total returns in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. That has prompted questions on whether the so-called Oracle of Omaha is finding it harder and harder to generate the stellar returns he's delivered for decades, particularly as the company grows so big it needs larger deals to make a difference to the bottom line.The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger answer hours of questions. The two talk about not only on the company's future, but on such topics as U.S. monetary policy and politics.The meeting includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire's holdings - from ice cream at Dairy Queen to insurance at Geico, the BNSF railroad to jewelry retailer Borsheims.While Buffett faced some pointed questioning from shareholders, many people in attendance here just listened to him because they consider themselves fans.At one point Buffett, surprisingly, was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire Hathaway. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate's trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost Standard & Poor's index fund.The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock?Because, he said, he's unconcerned about maximizing the money he will leave his wife after he passes away.""There will be loads of capital left over"" for her, Buffett said.

Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX rose 30 percent.Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire's decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola's equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive.That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket.Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that ""going to war"" would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire's abstention sent an even more effective message.""We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,"" Buffett said. ""I don't think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.""Buffett said he had conversations with Coke's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive.""I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,"" he said.Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis.""I don't think there's anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,"" Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal.""I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,"" he said. ""It's way easier to prosecute corporations - it's somebody else's money, and the prosecution knows it's going to get a win. (Corporations') calculus is such that it just doesn't make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.""WORKING ON THE RAILROAD The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts.That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company's service challenges.""We're making significant investments,"" Rose reassured the audience.Buffett added that Berkshire could spend ""many, many billions"" to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country's largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business. In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions.Indeed, much of Berkshire's growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle.Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co last year for $23.3 billion.""We're very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large,"" Buffett said. ""I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses.""Later, he added: ""What we really want to do at our present size and scope (is) buy big businesses with good management and prices, and then build them over time.Last year, Berkshire underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett's own preferred measure: gains in the company's book value, or worth, lagged the S&P 500. Shareholders at the meeting also rejected a proposal that Berkshire start paying a dividend, after having not made any cash payouts since 1967.GETTING THERE EARLY The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger talk about business, the economy, and even politics and life.It includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire's holdings, including Geico car insurance, Borsheim's jewelry and Dairy Queen ice cream. Before the meeting, Buffett paid $1 for a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar.As usual, hundreds of shareholders lined up outside the arena well before the doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT.Michael Rodin, owner of Impact Promotional Marketing Products in Des Moines, Iowa, said he arrived at 1 a.m., after having attended more than 20 prior meetings.""The excitement, to get as close to the action as possible, and see the man close, and not with his face on the video screen,"" Rodin explained on his strategy.At one point Buffett was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate's trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost S&P index fund.The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock?Because, he said, he's unconcerned about maximizing the money he will leave his wife after he passes away.""There will be loads of capital left over"" for her, Buffett said.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-05-04,BRKB,"Sun May 4, 2014 | 5:03pm EDT","Buffett defends Coke, BNSF at Berkshire annual meeting",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-berkshirehathaway-annualmeeting-idUSBREA4208N20140504?type=companyNews
90,"  NEW YORK Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett said on Monday that tax-driven mergers could attract the attention of Congress and would cause a ""fight"" in corporate America.Buffett, in reference to U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc.'s aim to lower its tax rate by changing its domicile to Britain as part of its pursuit of Britain's AstraZeneca Plc, said that more companies were seeking mergers for tax-driven reasons.""It will gather momentum and my guess is that when you get to companies of this size, this prominence, and with this speed up of momentum, my guess is that Congress one way or another addresses this,"" Buffett told cable television network CNBC.""This whole thing on the foreign situation I think will cause one hell of a fight in corporate America,"" he said.Buffett said that while there could be a new resolution to corporate taxes beyond the topic of foreign tax rates, U.S. companies were flourishing under the current tax code.""American business, I will tell you, whether it's Berkshire Hathaway or Pfizer or Apple, are doing wonderfully under this tax code."" Buffett also said that moves in U.S. government bond interest rates did not affect how Berkshire operated. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.572 percent on Monday, its lowest level in over three months.""If it moved up 50 basis points or down 50 basis points, we would not do anything differently. We don't react to macro factors at Berkshire,"" he said. He said the 10-year yield would likely be higher than 3 percent by the end of the year.Buffett also reiterated that he had no desire to ""go to war"" with Coca-Cola Co, and that his approach to the company's controversial equity compensation plan was more effective than the style that might be used by activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett, responding to criticism from Icahn regarding Buffett's decision to abstain from the shareholder vote, said, ""I think our style actually would be more effective than the style that might be proposed by Carl.""Buffett told CNBC he had not spoken to Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent since the company's annual meeting on April 23.Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said later in the interview that he agreed with Buffett's decision to abstain from the vote, and that it was not a ""difficult decision."" ""It took about 10 seconds,"" Munger said. ""I thought he handled it perfectly.""Munger also said that he was against exporting natural gas given how ""precious"" it is. ""I'm totally against exporting natural gas. I don't like oil to be exported either,"" he said.Buffett also praised Berkshire Hathaway portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, and said that while they were not candidates to succeed him as chief executive, their duties in investing would aid the next chief executive.""They will not be the chief executive officer, but they will be there to help the chief executive officer in that arena,"" he said.(Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Nick Zieminski)",2014-05-05,BRKB,"Mon May 5, 2014 | 11:20am EDT",Buffett says Congress may look at tax-driven mergers: CNBC,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-investing-buffett-cnbc-idUSBREA440AQ20140505?type=companyNews
91,"   By Joshua Schneyer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When American investor Warren Buffett addresses Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders at the conglomerate's annual meeting on Saturday, he is sure to laud the impressive growth of BNSF Railroad, his company's largest-ever acquisition.The railroad, which was struggling amid the Great Recession when Berkshire bought it for $26 billion in 2010, returned a $3.8 billion profit last year. In his annual letter to Berkshire (BRKa.N) shareholders in February, Buffett called BNSF, whose 32,000 miles of track spans 28 states, ""the most important artery in our economy's circulatory system,"" handling 15 percent of all inter-city freight across America.Praising BNSF's smooth relations with customers and regulators, Buffett wrote: ""Like Noah, who foresaw early on the need for dependable transportation, we know it's our job to plan ahead."" Buffett was likening BNSF's foresight to the biblical figure Noah and his vessel.He added: ""America's rail system has never been in better shape.""What Buffett didn't mention is that a growing number of BNSF's customers say the vital artery is clogged, causing economic losses for industrial firms and farmers scrambling to get their products to market.As more U.S. goods ride the rails amid an economic recovery, delays can reverberate widely. A harsh winter bungled rail schedules this year, causing slower train speeds, terminal log-jams and stranded crews and locomotives.Other major railroads, including giant Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N), also have experienced interruptions. Railyards in and around Chicago, a gateway for several major lines, have been backed up for months after record snowfall there over the winter. Even BNSF itself has suffered: Berkshire said on Friday that its first quarter rail unit's earnings, which fell 9 percent to $724 million, was ""negatively affected by severe weather conditions and service-related challenges.Some shippers believe the winter woes are only part of the problem. The concerns have been greatest across the Great Plains and the Upper Midwest, where BNSF is among the dominant rail players and has been the biggest beneficiary of a boom in shipping a high-value commodity - crude oil - from the Bakken oil patch of North Dakota and Montana.According to a Reuters analysis of filings made to the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), the rail industry's economic regulator, over the last month more than four dozen industrial trade groups, lawmakers or commodity firms who rely on BNSF and other major Class 1 railroads have lodged complaints or pleas for regulator action to improve their rail service.One common claim is that railroads including BNSF may be de-prioritizing the shipment of other commodities to make way for higher-priced crude oil on their trains, which railroads deny.""BNSF is not favoring crude shipments over other shippers. This is a case of rapid growth for several commodities using parts of our railroad network that hadn't previously seen that kind of volume,"" said BNSF spokeswoman Roxanne Butler in an email. Amid a shale drilling boom, crude-by-rail cargoes are up by around 44-fold since 2008, to nearly a million barrels per day according to industry data. Most of the crude riding the rails originates in the Bakken. BNSF said crude still represents just 4 percent of its total traffic.BUFFETT'S ‘ALL IN WAGER' When Berkshire bought BNSF, Buffett called it ""an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States."" At the time, he told TV commentator Charlie Rose that BNSF was ""interwoven with the American economy in a way that, if the American economy prospers, the business will prosper.""And prospered it has. Last year, amid a boost in rail cargoes, BNSF's revenue topped $20 billion and the firm invested nearly $4 billion. It plans to boost spending to $5 billion this year. And despite a weaker first quarter, Berkshire said it expects BNSF's profits to top 2013 for the rest of the year.But some analysts say the pace of BNSF's investment has failed to keep up with demand. In a March 14 research note, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that the winter service woes ""indicate too little capex was invested given the growth.""At an STB hearing on April 10, BNSF executives apologized for winter-related delays and pledged to deploy more locomotives and crews to improve service in coming months. Their assurances haven't convinced all customers. United Sugars, whose member firms supply about a fourth of U.S. sugar demand, informed the STB it ""harbors grave concerns that BNSF will not be able to quickly resolve its service problems."" Interruptions will cost it tens of millions of dollars this year, and part of the stranded beet crop may rot on the ground.ROTTING BEETS, WAITING PASSENGERS Among others to raise concern are producers of coal, fertilizer, ethanol and steel - even passenger train operator Amtrak. Their complaints aren't focused solely on BNSF. CP and Union Pacific have been subject to criticism as well.But BNSF owns some key routes. On Amtrak's Empire Builder line from Chicago to Seattle, which traverses the Bakken region on BNSF track, on-time performance has dropped to 27 percent so far this year, down from 76 percent in 2009.""We've had very frank conversations with BNSF about their performance,"" said Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari. ""The've been candid there are issues out there, and they are hiring more crews and locomotives.""Power utility trade group, the Western Coal Traffic League, told the U.S. rail regulator last month that BNSF was offering ""declining service metrics,"" adding that ""members fear they will run out of coal, if not now, by summer."" Nucor Corp (NUE.N), the largest U.S. steel manufacturer, wrote that during the first quarter rail journeys that usually take two weeks required up to two months. The delays ""severely affected"" profits, it told the regulator.""We are not seeing improvement now that the weather has improved,"" the company wrote.WARNING ON INTERVENTION The STB has authority to make railroads prioritize shipping of certain goods during bottlenecks, and some customers are calling on the regulator to act. Last month it granted one such request, ordering BNSF and CP railroads to report their schedules for speedier delivery of fertilizer ahead of the spring planting season, which they did.STB spokesman Dennis Watson declined comment on whether further regulatory action is planned.BNSF has bristled at the possibility of further government intervention, telling the regulator in a letter last week that ""the extreme step of directing recovery measures to the benefit of a particular commodity group or geographic locale"" would hurt overall network speed and other customers.However, it has acknowledged customer concerns and pledged to address them promptly. ""The message that we have fallen short on executing from a service perspective was also very clear,"" BNSF executive vice president Stevan Bobb wrote in the letter.Again, shippers of staple commodities are concerned railroads are neglecting their cargoes in favor of $100 a barrel oil.""We're all paying the price for the railroads' infatuation with moving crude oil,"" said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association.

94,"   By James Saft  Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger might be the greatest investing team of all time but they are dead wrong about the merits of activist investing.""I don't think it's good for America,"" Munger said when asked about activist investing, the practice of building stakes in companies in order to try to pressure management to change course.The irony is that Berkshire's annual jamboree is sometimes called the 'Woodstock of capitalism'. Nothing could be more capitalist than the owners of companies influencing how they are run, and yet in the form of shareholder capitalism now practiced in the U.S., with its self-protecting circles of top management, boards and consultants, this sometimes feels like a principle more honored in the breach than in the observance.Buffett was a bit more nuanced than Munger, noting that activism ""won't go away and scares the hell out of all our managers.""Both statements are true, and here's hoping they stay that way.Buffett has attracted criticism from no less an activist than Carl Icahn, who penned a piece in Barron's taking exception to Buffett's decision to abstain from a vote on a widely panned executive compensation plan at Coca-Cola, of which he owns about 9 percent. Buffett instead is reported to have elected to work behind the scenes towards a revision.That unwillingness to publicly call out managers, often the result of a chummy familiarity, is typical of those who own large stakes in companies, many of whom, like Buffett, aren't just investors but agents acting on behalf of other investors.Buffett and Munger, of course, are much to be preferred to the usual run of mutual fund or pension manager, who often neglect corporate governance, thereby abetting the growth and growth of executive compensation. This 'beat the stock market' culture of investing has led many to see corporate governance as a sideshow, believing instead that their role is to pick market winners and avoid losers. That's a lot easier than getting your hands dirty with corporate governance, which is usually less immediately gratifying than watching prices go up and down on a trading screen.Unfortunately it has, along with inadequate shareholder protections in law, led to a situation in which top insiders are able to extract more than their fair share of the value companies create.VIVA ACTIVISM That's opened up the way for investors like Icahn, who swoop in and publicly pressure companies to change policies, often by returning more cash to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks. None of this is to say that Icahn and other activists are always, or even usually, right. Arguably their voices are louder than they ought to be because of the deafening silence from so many other share owners.But activists do play a generally useful role despite sometimes arbitraging a broken system to their own advantage. As it stands, company governance is a system of opposing forces which can't come into balance because insiders are too difficult to dislodge. That's why activists are so irritating to management, and also why they are so needed.Critics often says that activists act myopically, bringing on short-term spikes but hurting longer-term performance. The data tells a different story.A 2013 study of more than 2,000 hedge fund interventions by activists found improved operating performance in the five years after the fracas. That held true also for interventions using hostile techniques, according to the study by Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School, Alon Brav of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke and Wei Jiang of Columbia Business School. The study found ""no evidence that the initial positive stock price spike accompanying activist interventions fails to appreciate their long-term costs and therefore tends to be followed by negative long-term consequences; the data is consistent with the initial spike reflecting correctly the intervention's long-term consequences."" (here)There is a real possibility that the next 20 years of investing will be a lot less juicy for shareholders than the last 50. While the reasons why this may prove true are complex, demographics alone argue that far more investors will be in the stage of life in which they are selling their stakes to live on rather than building them up. It is also easy to observe that the equity risk premium, a simple measurement of what the stock market offers, has been in long-term decline.If a long period of low returns does come, one of the easiest ways for investors, otherwise known as owners, to make good will come through better corporate governance.That would be a Woodstock, in other words, with many more good seats.(James Saft is a Reuters columnist.

95,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) bought a new stake of 11 million shares in Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) in the first quarter and added to its holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.Shares of Verizon rose 1.6 percent to $48.75 in after-hours trading following the disclosure, in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, detailing Berkshire's U.S. common stock investments as of March 31.Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new stakes because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.Verizon ""has shown that with several changes in leadership, the company performs and is a premium provider, if not the premium provider in the market,"" said analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics in Boston.Buffett ""likes people who can execute,"" Entner added.Investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC also opened a new stake in Verizon, buying 3.5 million shares.Verizon declined to comment. Berkshire's regulatory filing did not say whether the Verizon investment was made by Buffett himself, or by one or both of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their investment strategies.Berkshire, a conglomerate with over 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance, added to stakes in other companies, as well, including DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc (DVA.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N), among others.

102,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A New York state judge has rejected a request by Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg, the former American International Group Inc chief executive officer, to dismiss a long-running civil  lawsuit by the state's attorney general.Greenberg, now 89, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith were accused in the 2005 case of engineering sham transactions, including with the General Re Corp reinsurance unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, to make AIG's financial health look better.This alleged accounting fraud led to a $3.9 billion restatement, which predated the insurer's $182.3 billion federal bailout stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.David Boies, a lawyer for Greenberg, said his client plans to appeal. Vincent Sama, a lawyer for Smith, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Justice Charles Ramos of the Manhattan state supreme court on Wednesday rejected the defendants' arguments that state law barred Attorney General Eric Schneiderman from seeking to recoup some of their pay, and ban them from the securities industry and from serving as officers or directors of public companies. The judge also said arguments that the defendants ""pose no threat to the New York public"" because they do not lead public companies or plan to publicly sell securities involve issues of fact to be resolved at a trial, which would not have a jury.""The issues remaining in this action must be tried,"" Ramos wrote.The lawsuit was first brought by Eliot Spitzer, then the state's attorney general, and has been continued by his successors, Andrew Cuomo and now Schneiderman. Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said: ""We look forward to moving toward a trial that will finally offer the opportunity to hold Mr. Greenberg accountable for his alleged role in a massive fraud.""Last June, New York's Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, also let the case go forward, even though Schneiderman had earlier in the year dropped damages claims worth a potential $6 billion. ""We have no difficulty in concluding that, in this civil case, there is evidence sufficient for trial that both Greenberg and Smith participated in a fraud,"" the appeals court wrote.Greenberg now runs privately held C.V. Starr & Co. Buffett was not implicated in wrongdoing.The case is People v Greenberg, et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 401720/2005.

103,"  Allergan Inc shareholders have told activist investor William Ackman, who along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals is trying to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc that they would support a deal at $180 per share, Ackman said Monday.Valeant and Ackman, who owns almost 10 percent of Allergan through Pershing Square Capital Management, are in the midst of a hostile takeover battle for Allergan that began with a joint bid on April 22.Allergan rejected that first offer and Valeant responded by raising its offer on May 28 to about $163 per share. Investors did not think that offer was high enough and shares in both companies fell over doubts about the deal. Ackman, speaking on CNBC in his first public appearance regarding the takeover attempt since it was announced, said that he met with Allergan shareholders on May 29 and was told they would support the deal at $180 per share.""We are going to take over Allergan,"" Ackman said. The days after Ackman met with investors, May 30, Valeant raised its offer to include $72 in cash for a per share value of about $177 and a total value of more than $53 billion. In that offer, Ackman agreed to take only Valeant stock, freeing up Valeant to offer more cash to other shareholders.Ackman filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold a special shareholder meeting to vote in new members of the Allergan board of directors. The current board has adopted a ""poison pill"" measure that will dilute shares if Ackman increases his Allergan stake. During the CNBC interview, Ackman defended Valeant's business model, which has been criticized for its serial acquisitions, and his own purchase of Allergan shares. Ackman's stake has increased by more than $1 billion since he purchased it before making the joint bid with Valeant, regulatory documents show.Allergan shares closed on Friday at $165 and Valeant shares closed at $127.46, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

The full appeals court has yet to decide whether to rehear Gupta's appeal of his conviction. He intends to ask the Supreme Court to review his case if the appeals court refuses.Ginsburg handles emergency applications from the 2nd Circuit. She may rule herself on Gupta's request or refer it to the full, nine-member Supreme Court. There is no deadline. Lawyers for Gupta include Seth Waxman, a former U.S. solicitor general. Gupta, also a former global managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey & Co, is the highest-ranking corporate official to be convicted in the government's multiyear probe into insider trading in the hedge fund industry.A federal jury in Manhattan in June 2012 convicted him of passing tips about Goldman to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm. Prosecutors said Gupta leaked inside information in 2008 about Goldman's results and an unexpected $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.In appealing his conviction, Gupta argued that wiretap evidence used against him should have been suppressed because the government failed to show probable cause and a necessity to obtain it.Gupta also argued that his trial judge, Jed Rakoff, should have told jurors that good character could raise a reasonable doubt of guilt and that federal appeals courts are divided about when to give such instructions.Rajaratnam is appealing his conviction to the Supreme Court. He is serving an 11-year prison term.

110,"  NEW YORK, July 22 A federal appeals court on Tuesday said Travelers Cos should pay more than $500 million to satisfy asbestos-related claims stemming from its coverage of policyholder Johns-Manville Corp, reversing a lower court ruling.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said U.S. District Judge John Koeltl erred in February 2012 when he concluded that the relevant conditions requiring payment had not been satisfied. Koeltl's ruling reversed an earlier judgment by a federal bankruptcy judge that directed Travelers to make the payment. The 2nd Circuit ordered the reinstatement of that judgment.

(BHFC), which are guaranteed by BRK. The 'A+' ratings are equivalent to  Fitch's ratings on both BRK and BHFC's outstanding senior unsecured notes.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings on BRK are supported by the extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.   Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy.   BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 24% as of June 30, 2014.   Consolidated interest coverage for the first half of 2014 was 8.2x excluding  realized investment gains.  Both financial leverage and interest coverage ratios  are not expected to change meaningfully given the issuances replaced debt that  matured in July and August 2014.   BRK's financial leverage ratio at the holding company level (including debt  issued by the company's finance company subsidiaries and guaranteed by BRK) was  14% at June 30, 2014. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance operations  at a low cost as an important competitive advantage and also notes that much of  the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating.  Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization,  a total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage  (excluding affiliated investments) over 3.5x, or a sharp and persistent  reduction in underwriting profits;   --A consolidated run-rate financial leverage ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate financial leverage ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%; --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio;    --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense. Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations.  Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

124,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel  Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) share price on Thursday surpassed and closed above $200,000 for the first time, the latest milestone for a company that Warren Buffett has built over nearly five decades into what some analysts view as a microcosm of the U.S. economy.Class A shares of Berkshire, which have never been split, closed up $3,500, or 1.8 percent, at $202,850, giving the Omaha, Nebraska-based company a market value of more than $333 billion. The share price had earlier rose as high as $203,025.Berkshire's share price has more than doubled since it first crossed the $100,000 barrier on Oct. 5, 2006. The Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX has climbed just 44 percent since that date.Buffett, who turns 84 on Aug. 30 and is the world's third-richest person, oversees a conglomerate with more than 80 businesses ranging from Geico car insurance to the BNSF railroad to Dairy Queen ice cream, and more than $119 billion of stocks such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). In the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway posted a record $6.4 billion profit, helped by a stock swap and growing earnings in many businesses, on revenue of $49.76 billion. By some measures, Berkshire remains moderately priced, trading at about 1.4 times its book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, in the most recent quarter. Buffett has said he will consider buybacks only at or below a 1.2 times multiple. Berkshire also has lower-cost Class B shares, which Buffett launched in 1996 to thwart unit investment trusts purporting to be ""clones"" of Berkshire but which carried high costs.Those shares now trade at about 1/1,500th of a Class A share and carry voting rights equal to 1/10,000th of a Class A share. They closed on Thursday up $2.22, or 1.7 percent. at $135.30. Since 2006, Buffett has been donating Berkshire shares to several charities. He still owns about one-fifth of Berkshire, which was a failing textile company before he took it over in 1965, and controls about one-third of its voting power.Buffett's net worth was about $66.3 billion after Thursday's market close, Forbes magazine said.

125,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter.Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30.Charter is ""the play of choice on cable consolidation,"" said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan. ""You've got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,"" he said.DirecTV DTV.O is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T (T.N) for $48.5 billion.    Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire's larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest.Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz (STRZA.O). The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire's cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion.That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion.In Thursday's filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc (DNOW.N), an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N), whose stock Berkshire also owns. Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp (GM.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips (COP.N), former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp (LMCA.O).U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks.Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges.

""In October, the Fed is going to get away from money printing, and since we haven't had a correction in a long time, it could undermine things very quickly once people realize growth isn't in line with their expectations,"" said Jeff Duncan, president of Duncan Financial Management in Sunset Hills, Missouri.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.78 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 16,713.58.

133,"  * Heinz says to tighten supplier controls after China food scare* Watchdog finds excess lead levels in some Heinz infant products* Firm says no other Heinz baby food products affected* Chinese parents sensitive over baby food products - analysts   (Adds further Heinz statement)By Adam Jourdan and Sui-Lee WeeSHANGHAI/BEIJING, Aug 19 U.S. foodmaker H.J. Heinz Co said on Tuesday it will tighten controls over ingredients suppliers in China after it was forced to recall some infant food products from Chinese store shelves due to excess levels of lead.The company, known globally for its ketchup and baked beans, made the annoucement as it sought to contain the potential damage to its reputation in a country where consumers are highly sensitive to food safety after a series of high-profile scares.Heinz told Reuters on Monday that it had recalled four batches of its AD Calcium Hi-Protein Cereal for infants after a food watchdog in eastern China found levels of the toxic heavy metal above regulation standards.Supply chains issues in China have come under increased scrutiny, with KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and McDonald's Corp all recently facing food safety issues with suppliers.Consumers in China are especially sensitive to baby products after powdered milk tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of at least six infants in 2008.""I would think that Heinz is in a lot of trouble right now because parents are unforgiving of any quality control problems in baby and infant food products,"" said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group. Heinz will draft stricter systems for regulating ingredient suppliers and improve traceability and food safety control measures along its supply chain, the U.S. company said in a post on its official Sina Weibo microblog on Tuesday.Affected products had been sealed and would would be destroyed under regulator guidance, it added.An official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Zhejiang province declined to give details on the levels of lead in the Heinz cereal, but said that it would release further information about the case in the coming days.Standard levels for infant products should be below 0.2 milligrams per kg, according to a 2010 government report.Heinz, which was bought out by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and private equity firm 3G Capital last year, said the recall was a precautionary measure. The company added that the high lead level was caused ""accidentally"" by a supplier who had provided a skimmed soybean powder ingredient used in the batch of cereal.""This relates to an isolated regional withdrawal in eastern China,"" company spokesman Michael Mullen said in emailed comments to Reuters. ""Extensive testing confirmed that no other Heinz baby food varieties are affected.""Heinz did not respond to phone and email requests for further comment on Tuesday.SOIL CONTAMINATION  The Zhejiang FDA has said the problem affected 1,472 boxes of cereal in the province and that Heinz had told the agency it would destroy another 153 boxes that are sealed in a warehouse in the southern city of Guangzhou.Heinz said in its Weibo statement that it would compensate any consumers who had bought the affected product. The cereal is aimed at infants aged between six months and three years, according to the packaging.It also apologised for inconvenience caused to consumers and moved to assure shoppers that the firm was committed to food quality and safety.Foreign brands do well in China's baby food market, because parents are willing to pay a premium to guarantee quality and safety. The market, excluding infant milk formula, is worth around 8 billion yuan ($1.3 billion), according to a May report from Huidian Research.However, food safety scares are relatively common in China with Yum, retailer Wal-Mart and French dairy Danone SA  all taking a hit in the last year over food safety concerns.Chinese parents are already highly sensitive to metal contamination in food, which is often linked to the country's high levels of soil and water pollution, one of the main ways metals gets into cereals and other crops.Analysts said the presence of lead - widely known by parents to be harmful for children - would create a ""scare factor"" even if no people suffered adverse effects from the products. China has previously had issues of cadmium and lead metals in food.Consumers took to China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo on Tuesday, questioning whether the recall was just the beginning of the issue, while others said they were concerned about long-term effects on their children.Experts say exposure to lead is particularly dangerous for children, inhibiting intellectual and physical development. It can cause poor concentration, disruptive behaviour and even death when subjected to high levels.A soil survey in April showed that nearly a fifth of China's farmland was contaminated by toxic heavy metals and chemicals, and that more than 33,000 sq km (12,740 sq miles) - an area the size of Belgium - were unfit for agricultural use.

134,"   By James Saft  Individual investors have been cutting back on cash in portfolios, the exact reverse of what Warren Buffett has been doing at Berkshire Hathaway. Who do you think has got it right?Cash at Berkshire Hathaway stood at just over $55 billion as of June 30, an all-time high and two and a half times the level he’s in the past said he likes to keep on tap to meet extraordinary claims at his insurance businesses. That’s also up more than 50 percent from a year ago.Buffett’s green pile is in sharp contrast to individual investors, who’ve cut cash in portfolios to 15.8 percent, a 14-year low, according to the July asset allocation survey from the American Association of Individual Investors.To be sure, businesses and individuals hold cash for different reasons, but Buffett has used Berkshire, in part, as an investment vehicle through which we can interpret his views on markets, or at least the prices of some assets in them.Berkshire, of course, has some difficulties in putting cash to work not faced by your average dentist or lawyer, in that it tends to make very large investments and as such may need to be more patient than smaller fry. So it is quite possible Berkshire Hathaway is waiting for the right acquisition to come along.It is also similarly possible that Buffett is not happy with the prices, and is biding his time against a day when prices have been marked down. One thing not influencing Berkshire is tax policy, as all of its cash is generated in the U.S., making it not one of the legion of corporations holding money offshore to avoid a repatriation tax.Bottom line though is that the best investor in the world is going in exactly the opposite direction to a class of people often reputed to be among the worst. THE DISCREET CHARM OF CASH Cash returns are, as we know, lousy; the little that one can get in liquid instruments inevitably being lower than the toll extracted by inflation. And indeed the long-term returns on cash are terrible, lagging behind every asset class and investment strategy this side of setting money on fire.Still, looking at the long-term returns on cash and concluding it is a tool to be shunned is a bit like saying a golfer ought not to have a back swing because only forward momentum drives the ball. Cash is the thing which puts you in a position to drive the ball, and gives your investment swing power. Its value lies not so much in itself but in the ease with which it can be turned into other things. Cash is worth holding because it is dry powder which gives the owner options. That optionality varies, of course, based on your view of how richly valued assets are, but it is always there. Cash also provides investors with what so many hedge funds and other expensive financial products claim to provide: protection against the downside. James Montier, of fund managers GMO, calls cash “perhaps the oldest, easiest and most underrated source of tail risk protection.” If you are worried, as small investors seem not to be, about the small possibility of large impact events, then cash has a value not expressed by its yield.Montier also argued, in a 2011 paper, that cash provides decent protection against both inflation and deflation, citing the experience of the U.S. inflation of the 1970s and Japan since 1990. During the 70s cash was a bit worse than equities as inflation soared, but a bit better than bonds. In Japan, in contrast, cash did much worse than bonds, but, as goods and services declined in price, did far, far better than stocks.But really if cash has something to recommend it in the current environment, it is its optionality in a time of uncertainty. The odd thing about the current market is how calm it is in the face of fairly unprecedented conditions. We’ve never before been through a lift-off from zero rates or a running down of a massive Federal Reserve balance sheet. Likewise, we’ve never run into a recession while also being at the zero lower bound for interest rates.Any of the above is possible in the next 12 to 24 months, and yet markets aren’t even close to pricing these risks.While it may never happen, and we might want to cheer up, Buffett is arguably better positioned with his cash roll if it does than the small investors who are nearly as heavily invested as they’ve been this millennium.

135,"  (Adds Buffett admitting mistake)By Jonathan StempelAug 20 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  agreed to pay an $896,000 fine to settle U.S. government accusations that it violated antitrust rules by failing to report a transaction that boosted its stake in building products company USG Corp.The civil penalty, which requires court approval, settles charges made on Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission that Berkshire violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law by not telling regulators about the Dec. 9, 2013 transaction in advance.That law requires regulatory approval for some transactions, and is designed to help protect competition. Berkshire corrected its error on Jan. 3, 2014.""We made a mistake when we overlooked the filing requirement,"" Buffett, who is chairman and chief executive of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, said in a statement. Berkshire had on Dec. 9, 2013, exchanged $243.8 million of USG convertible notes for 21.39 million common shares, giving it a roughly 28 percent stake in USG worth more than $950 million.Regulators said that Berkshire was required to report the exchange in advance because the new stake was more than three times the minimum required, but failed to do so. Buffett said ""we were late"" in realizing that a report was necessary. The transaction occurred four days after the FTC decided not to punish Berkshire for a similar ""inadvertent"" violation involving financial services company Symetra Financial Corp , relying on Berkshire's assurance that it would comply with Hart-Scott-Rodino.""Although we may not seek penalties for every inadvertent error, we will enforce the rules when the same party makes additional mistakes after promises of improved oversight,"" Deborah Weinstein, director of the FTC bureau of competition, said in a statement.Berkshire had been a large holder of USG stock when it bought the convertible notes in November 2008. The notes had a 10 percent interest rate, the same rate that Berkshire got when it invested a total of $8 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc and General Electric Co at around the same time.Those investments came in the wake of the financial crisis, and gave Berkshire a reputation as a lender of last resort when financial markets come under strain.Berkshire operates more than 80 businesses and holds more than $119 billion of equity investments. The $896,000 penalty represents about a half-hour of operating earnings, based on the company's reported $15.14 billion of operating profit for 2013.Buffett, 83, owns about one-fifth of Berkshire and according to Forbes magazine is the world's third-richest person.

140,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Aug 25 The entanglement of H.J. Heinz Co. in China's latest food scare highlights a key concern for international and local firms - how to keep track of ingredients from diverse sources in a country where food supply tracing technologies are far from the norm.The U.S. food maker apologised to Chinese consumers last week and said it would tighten controls over suppliers after it was forced to recall some infant cereal from store shelves due to excess levels of lead.Food safety scares erupt regularly in China - KFC parent Yum Brands Inc, McDonald's Corp, Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd have all suffered recently - and such incidents can seriously dent sales.But barcode tracking systems for produce, common in the United States and Europe, are largely absent.""Standardized traceability of food products does not currently exist in China. It's a long way from it,"" said David Mahon, Beijing-based managing director of an investment firm focusing on China's food and beverage sectors.China's food traceability systems and regulation were classified as ""poor"" in an August report from the Institute of Food Technologists. This was the lowest score of around 20 countries included.Food safety barcodes store details such as the farm of origin, dates of harvest, planting, storage and shipment, meaning clients down the line can trace a particular batch and find out how and why any issues occurred.Some firms have tried to bring the system into wider use in China - French grocer Carrefour SA launched a barcoding system last year for fruit and vegetables - but the technology has failed to catch on due to the high costs of implementation throughout scattered supply chains. SENSITIVE MARKET Heinz said it had identified the supplier and ingredient - a skimmed soybean powder - responsible for the recall of four batches of its AD Calcium Hi-Protein Cereal from stores in eastern China, but added the firm needed to do more to keep suppliers in check.""We will keep improving traceable food safety control systems from 'farm to factory',"" Heinz said in a statement posted on its Chinese website.Heinz, which was bought out by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and private equity firm 3G Capital last year, did not respond to requests for further comment. Consumers in China are highly sensitive to issues of food safety, especially with baby products, after powdered milk tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of at least six infants in 2008.Danone SA and Abbott Laboratories saw infant formula sales in China plunge last year after concerns over a potentially fatal bacteria in a supplier's product. Tests later showed the initial finding was incorrect.China has soaring levels of soil and water pollution, with seven out of the top 10 farming provinces amongst the areas most exposed to heavy metal pollution such as lead, according to a March report from HSBC.Major firms, including fast food chains McDonald's and Burger King Worldwide Inc, said they had put in place stringent testing and auditing procedures in China to avoid issues such as contamination from water and soil pollution.""We have rigorous and overlapping internal and external testing procedures and audits to ensure that our suppliers in China, and around the world, meet our strict specifications,"" said Vijay Guyah, a Singapore-based spokesman for Burger King. BROKEN CHAINS Agricultural supply chains in China tend to be highly fragmented with most farms still small-scale.Even with stringent auditing processes of suppliers - which multinational firms such as Heinz would carry out - it's difficult to keep track of all suppliers along the line, some of whom may be tempted to subcontract to cut costs.What's more, while China's regulators have tight food safety rules, industry insiders said the watchdogs simply did not have the manpower to properly enforce them.""It's not that the technology doesn't exist in China, it's just the chains are too fragmented,"" said an industry executive in China, who previously ran a food processing plant serving multinational firms in China and abroad.The former executive said that one batch of frozen vegetables that his firm shipped to the Japanese market had become contaminated by chemicals after an audited, long-term supplier topped up its harvest from a neighbouring farm.""When supply chains are so large, you can't always prevent a supplier buying from someone else if someone else has a cheaper price,"" the former executive said. ""It's a matter of one guy doing things wrong and the product is contaminated.""

161,"  (Corrects 21st paragraph to show it is referring to Studzinski and not Taubman, and adds a dropped word in 23rd paragraph)By Greg Roumeliotis and Paritosh BansalNEW YORK Oct 10 Blackstone Group LP said on Friday it would spin off its advisory units into a company headed by star Wall Street investment banker Paul Taubman, to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the sprawling private equity empire.The advisory business, which includes mergers and acquisitions, restructuring and private equity fundraising, will merge with a firm founded last year by Taubman, a former Morgan Stanley president who has been behind some of the biggest mergers in recent years.The new publicly traded company could be valued at $1 billion to $2 billion, a person close to Blackstone said. The tax-free spin-off is expected in 2015.The surprise move is a stark example of potential conflicts of interest that could arise in companies with unwieldy, sprawling interests and attract regulatory scrutiny.Blackstone started three decades ago as an advisory business, but has since grown into a diversified alternative asset manager with more than $300 billion under management in private equity, real estate, credit and other assets.There is no suggestion that any specific regulatory action led to Blackstone's decision. The firm said its primary business, which includes buying and selling companies and real estate assets, as well as lending to such companies and buying their debt, places restrictions on the use of its advisory arms, hindering their growth.The advisory business is a small part of the firm, accounting for about $185 million of Blackstone's total revenue of $3.7 billion in the first half of the year. Blackstone has a market value of $34 billion.Blackstone said the timing is right for the spinoff: M&A is picking up, restructuring remains an active business, private equity fundraising is on the rise, and Taubman is available.""This has the potential to unlock value for our shareholders,"" Blackstone co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman told analysts on a conference call. Blackstone's shares ended down 0.6 percent at $29.6 on Friday.The new company, whose name has yet to be decided, will advise companies on mergers and acquisitions as well as debt restructurings. It will also help private equity and other alternative investment funds with their fundraising efforts.Blackstone's current shareholders will own 65 percent of the new publicly listed company. Taubman, his firm's partners and Blackstone's advisory employees will own the rest.Taubman, who left Morgan Stanley in 2012 and founded his own firm last year, has been behind some of the biggest deals of the past few years. These include advising Verizon Communications Inc on its $130 billion takeover of its wireless joint venture with the UK's Vodafone Group Plc, and Comcast Corp on its $42 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc.Blackstone President Tony James approached Taubman with the idea of partnering in late spring, according to Taubman. A meeting between Schwarzman, James and Taubman soon followed. LIMITS ON GROWTH Blackstone started sensing limits to the advisory business' growth as part of the firm, as questions of potential conflicts of interest came into sharper focus after the financial crisis.During the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008, for example, Blackstone's real estate division was eyeing some of the bank's assets. As a result, Blackstone had to tell its advisory bankers not to pursue a role in what they saw as one of the most complex and interesting opportunities of the last decade.Investments of Blackstone's credit arm, GSO Capital Partners, have also curtailed its advisory arm, which ranks as the world's most active debt restructuring advisor according to Thomson Reuters data. Executives started talking about the idea over the last couple of years.Tim Coleman, who heads Blackstone's restructuring team, and Daniel Prendergast, CEO of Park Hill, will keep their roles and join the new company. Park Hill is a private equity fund placement agent that Blackstone acquired in 2005.John Studzinski, who heads the advisory business, will help with the transition, but remain at Blackstone. Studzinski joined Blackstone in 2006 and has been personally involved in many of the firm's largest advisory assignments.Studzinski, who boasts relationships with governments, corporations, pension funds and wealthy individuals across the globe, will remain on the executive committee of Blackstone and advise the firm.BORN AS AN ADVISORY SHOP Blackstone was founded by Schwarzman and the now-retired Peter Peterson in 1985 with $400,000 as an M&A advisory boutique. It was not until 1987 that the firm launched its first private equity fund, and then set up its debt restructuring business in 1991.Over the years, the advisory business has undertaken some of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banking mandates, including advising Bank of America Corp on the $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and American International Group Inc  on its government bailout.Yet, in recent years, the advisory business has not been a meaningful earnings contributor to Blackstone, with other assets such as real estate investments and leveraged buyouts bringing in the bulk of the firm's profits.It is not the first time Blackstone has let a business go. BlackRock Inc was spun out of Blackstone in 1992, subsequently growing into the world's largest money manager and leading Schwarzman to public acknowledge that decision as a mistake.Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is advising Blackstone and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is advising Taubman's firm, PJT Partners, on the transaction.

162,"   By Nick Carey and Diane Bartz | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 13 Shares of No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp rose nearly 10 percent on Monday following a report of a rebuffed takeover bid by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, but analysts said any such deal would face significant regulatory and other hurdles.According to the report in the Wall Street Journal late on Sunday, the No. 2 Canadian railroad made a bid last week for Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX, which rejected the offer. Both companies said they did not comment on market rumors.Shares in Canadian Pacific were not traded Monday as the markets in Canada were closed for a holiday.In a client note, Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl wrote that Canadian Pacific could in theory team up with hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and take a bid directly to CSX shareholders.Activist investor William Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, in 2012 had recruited Hunter Harrison, who had previously been chief executive officer of Canadian National Railway Co , for that post at Canadian Pacific.But Seidl said any deal was unlikely in the near term since shippers and regulators were ""disenchanted"" with the rail industry because of its service and capacity problems. Severe weather last winter wreaked havoc on the major railroads' networks, while the rise in oil-by-rail shipments has caused delays for grain shippers.Harrison has indicated that mergers could be a way to alleviate network congestion and improve service.Any merger would have to be approved by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Seth Bloom, president of Washington-based Bloom Strategic Counsel and former general counsel of the U.S. Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, said the STB was ""pretty tough,"" but might not find a deal anti-competitive since Canadian Pacific is not one of the four major U.S. railroads.However, the Association of American Railroads industry lobby group considers both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific ""Class I"" railroads because of their extensive U.S. holdings.In a note for clients, Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry wrote that STB rules for mergers between Class I railroads had ""an arguably impossible hurdle rate. ""Therefore, in our opinion, the deal is a non-starter.""Harrison was at Canadian National when it tried to merge with BNSF, which is now owned by investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, in 2000. The STB rejected that deal due to concerns over competition.Many companies have complained over the years about the prices railroads charge to haul freight. Analysts therefore expect shippers to oppose any merger on the grounds that it would drive up prices and reduce competition.The other major railroads are also seen as being generally against any Class I mergers.""We stand with the consensus here,"" independent analyst Anthony Hatch wrote in a note. ""The risks - economic, operational and, enormously, political (especially now) outweigh the benefits.""But Cowen & Co analyst Seidl said:  ""If a merger does occur, others will likely follow.""

166,"   By Luciana Lopez | NEW YORK  NEW YORK It's not been a good time for Warren Buffett wannabes.Sharp drops in many of the stocks owned by Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway in recent weeks hit the sprawling conglomerate's equity portfolio hard. The loss on seven of those holdings alone totals more than $5 billion provided Berkshire's stakes have remained the same since June 30, the last date for which they were disclosed.In particular, Berkshire's been stung by large holdings in IBM and long-time Buffett favorite Coca-Cola, both of which tumbled after disappointing third-quarter results. His penchant for energy stocks hasn't helped either, given the damage done to the prices of energy assets by the slumping global oil price.For the world's third richest man, unrealized losses of a few billion dollars aren't necessarily anything to cry about.Buffett's ability to sit tight and ride out short-term market gyrations has been one of the keys to his success as a long-term investor. And unlike, say, mutual fund managers, he doesn't have to worry about redemptions forcing him to sell stock.But for others - fund managers, smaller institutions, even retail investors - who often try to follow in Buffett's footsteps, the losses could be harder to get over.Berkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment.With 400 million shares of Coke on June 30, Berkshire is the company's largest shareholder - and Buffett is perhaps the world's most famous Cherry Coke fan.""I love Coke, I love the management,"" he said in a television interview in April, as the company faced a controversy over an executive compensation plan. Coke shares plunged 6 percent on Oct. 21 after it said that quarterly profit slumped. The shares are down 4.1 percent since June 30 for a possible paper loss to Berkshire of $696 million. Similarly, IBM - of which Berkshire held about 70 million shares on June 30 - is down about 11 percent since the end of the second quarter, with much of that decline occurring after it ditched its 2015 operating earnings target this week. Since June 30, IBM's slump may has cost Berkshire nearly $1.3 billion on paper. Short-seller Doug Kass has repeatedly pointed to both of those companies as weak spots in Berkshire's portfolio.Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, was named Buffett's ""credentialed bear"" for the 2013 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders' meeting. To spice up proceedings at the gathering, which is attended by thousands of Berkshire shareholders, Buffett got Kass to present the bear case against the conglomerate, which owns dozens of businesses selling everything from ice cream to insurance.""Very few people have the sort of pain threshold and long-term time frame and risk appetite that Warren Buffett has,"" Kass said. ""His risk profile is different than a mere mortal.""ACCOUNTING SCANDAL  Among the other stocks that were in Berkshire's portfolio at June 30 that have dropped significantly are banking group Wells Fargo, credit card group American Express, energy giant Exxon Mobil, Canadian oil producer Suncor Energy and automaker General Motors.Exxon often sees its fate tied to the price of oil. With crude down about 18 percent so far this year, Buffett's 41 million shares of Exxon at June 30 would be worth almost $311 million less now.Earlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway said that it had sold off some of its stake in troubled British grocer Tesco, taking it to below 3 percent from around 3.96 percent of Tesco's shares in May. Those shares are off 45 percent this year in the wake of its worsening performance, exacerbated by an accounting scandal. Buffett himself called that investment a ""huge mistake.""Because Berkshire Hathaway owns stock in dozens of companies, several of its holdings are performing better. Retail behemoth Wal-Mart, for example, is up 1.3 percent since the end of the second quarter. And consumer products maker Procter & Gamble is up 7.2 percent from June 30 to Oct. 22. For all its substantial portfolio holdings, the cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway's earnings comes from the dozens of businesses it controls, including insurance company Geico and railroad BNSF. Those companies and others helped bring Berkshire's profit last year to a record $19.48 billion. Nor have investors punished Berkshire Hathaway's own stock for the recent market gyrations. The class A shares of the conglomerate are up 16 percent this year, and up 8.75 percent since the second quarter.  That handily beats the S&P 500's tepid 4.3 percent gain so far this year.  Last year, for the first time since Buffett took control of Berkshire in 1965, the company's five-year gain in book value per share underperformed the S&P 500's five-year rise, including dividends but before tax.But Buffett has often said that Berkshire Hathaway will do best against the index in lackluster or even down markets. In recent years, stocks have been surging.And Buffett's preferred holding time of forever is well known, with the so-called Oracle of Omaha an advocate of buy-and-hold strategies for everyone from himself through Mom-and-Pop retail investors.Indeed, Buffett himself has often praised falling markets as buying opportunities.""Tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if he has cash available when prices get far out of line with values,"" he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders this year.

KEY RATING DRIVERS: Fitch's ratings are supported by BRK's extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines, and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.   Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk, and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy.   BRK's large market position, size and scale are consistent with Fitch's 'AA' IFS  rating category. The capitalization of BRK's insurance operations is considered 'Extremely  Strong' as measured by Fitch's Prism capital model and is heavily weighted in  the company's current rating. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 24% as of June 30, 2014.  BRK's  financial leverage ratio at the holding company level (including debt issued by  the company's finance company subsidiaries and guaranteed by BRK) was 14% at  June 30, 2014. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance operations at a  low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance operations and  also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. Fitch's expectation is that BRK's major non-insurance business units, including  the company's utilities and railroad business, will service their own debt. BRK reported net income of $11.1 billion for the first half of 2014 (1H'14), up  from $9.4 billion in the comparable period of 2013.  BRK's insurance group  reported $3.8 billion in earnings before tax in 1H'14, accounting for roughly  one-third of BRK's $11.8 billion in pre-tax earnings.  Investment gains were  primarily responsible for the period-to-period increase in earnings.   The Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad operation continues to make  significant contributions to earnings.  BNSF reported a pretax gain of $2.6  billion (22% of BRK's total pre-tax earnings) for the first six months of 2014,  relatively unchanged from the comparable period in 2013. BRK's 1H'14 annualized return on equity was 9.8%, excluding unrealized gains on  fixed income securities, level from the comparable period of 2013.   Consolidated GAAP interest coverage for the first six months of 2014 was 8.2x,  which is below Fitch's expectation of 12x for companies at BRK's rating level.   Somewhat offsetting this is approximately $27 billion of cash and equivalents at  the insurance operating companies at June 30, 2014, which would cover annual  interest expense by 8x.   BRK's GAAP-basis earnings will continue to be exposed to earnings volatility  given the large notional values and long duration of BRK's outstanding  derivative contracts. Additionally, Fitch believes that BRK's earnings will be  exposed to potential volatility from the company's reinsurance businesses and  its exposure to catastrophe-related losses as well as the company's large equity  investment portfolio. BRK has grown its asbestos & environmental insured liability exposure through  retroactive reinsurance contracts most notably with Equitas Limited, Swiss Re,  CNA Financial Corp, AIG and Liberty Mutual.  Fitch estimates BRK has  approximately $13 billion in A&E reserves at year-end 2013 and these reserves  covered average paid losses by greater than 14x. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating.  Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization,  a total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage  (excluding affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction  in underwriting profits.   --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio.    --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.      Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the holding  company, insurance and finance operations.  Fitch believes that this would  likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

Net income slipped to $4.62 billion, or $2,811 per Class A share in the third quarter, from $5.05 billion, or $3,074 per Class A share, a year earlier.Operating profit, however, rose 29 percent to $4.72 billion, or $2,876 per Class A share, from $3.66 billion, or $2,228 per Class A share.Analysts on average expected earnings of $2,593.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Much of the drop in earnings is attributable to Berkshire posting a $107 million loss on investments and derivatives, compared with a year-earlier $1.39 billion gain.During the quarter, Berkshire wrote off $678 million on its investment in Tesco Plc (TSCO.L), a British grocery chain being probed by regulators at home over accounting errors.   Buffett has been reducing Berkshire's Tesco stake.In contrast, year-earlier results included big gains on investments that Buffett made during the 2008 financial crisis, including in General Electric Co (GE.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), and bonds related to candy maker Mars Inc's purchase of rival Wrigley.Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, said the change took a backseat to the strength of operations at Berkshire's more than 80 companies.

178,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna Kumar  Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company's tax bill.Rather than pay cash, Berkshire (BRKa.N) will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. P&G (PG.N) will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.Buying Duracell is a ""brilliant move,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.""Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,"" Kass added. ""And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.""Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year.Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. NOT A GOOD SIGN Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.""I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,"" Buffett said in a statement. [ID:nBw5J6R8za]Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not.While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.""It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. ""I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G."" Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87.""WILLING AND EAGER""  Berkshire has owned P&G stock since P&G bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989. Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette's board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That's more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion.Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock.Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66 (PSX.N) for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets.Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30.P&G will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation.Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N), Duracell's main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent.UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved ""willing and eager"" to buy Duracell.Goldman Sachs, Jones Day, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft advised P&G.

179,"   By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Procter & Gamble Co., one of Warren Buffett's top portfolio holdings, is about to lose the billionaire's influential backing at a time when it appears the company's own fortunes have peaked.Thursday's agreement by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to turn over the $4.7 billion in shares it owns in the world's largest consumer products company in exchange for P&G's Duracell battery business comes one day after P&G shares hit a life-time high.""He is basically cashing in at a 52-week high,"" said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida.

182,"  * Buffett to return $4.7 billion worth of shares to P&G* Purchase is ""brilliant move"" for Buffett - money manager   (Adds link to Breakingviews column)By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna KumarNov 13 Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company's tax bill.Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. P&G will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.Buying Duracell is a ""brilliant move,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.""Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,"" Kass added. ""And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.""Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings.NOT A GOOD SIGN Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.""I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,"" Buffett said in a statement.Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.""It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. ""I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.""Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87. ""WILLING AND EAGER"" Berkshire has owned P&G stock since P&G bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989.Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette's board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That's more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion.Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock.Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66  for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co, which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets.Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30.P&G will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation.Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc, Duracell's main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent.UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved ""willing and eager"" to buy Duracell.Goldman Sachs, Jones Day, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft advised P&G.

190,"   By Howard Schneider and Krista Hughes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON (Refiles Nov. 13 story to fix spelling of Buffett throughout)WASHINGTON (Reuters): The U.S. Export-Import Bank has mischaracterized potentially hundreds of large companies and units of multinational conglomerates as small businesses, a flaw in its record keeping that could undermine the export lender's survival strategy. A Reuters analysis showed companies owned by billionaires like Warren Buffett and Mexico's Carlos Slim, as well by Japanese and European conglomerates, were listed as small businesses and Ex-Im acknowledged errors in its data in response to those findings.Bank officials and supporters have used Ex-Im's support for American small business as the first line of defense against conservatives' campaign to shut it down as an exponent of ""crony capitalism."" The bank just won a nine month extension of its mandate in September and faces a bruising battle over the next seven months to secure its future.  A comparison of some 6,000 businesses characterized by Ex-Im as ""small"" with information supplied by corporate data collector Dun & Bradstreet, which Ex-Im also uses to vet applicants, and other sources turns up some 200 companies that appear to be mislabeled and many more whose classification is uncertain.A division of Austria's Swarovski jewelers shows up, as does North Carolina's Global Nuclear Fuels owned by General Electric (GE.N) and Japan's Toshiba (6502.T) and Hitachi (6501.T). The extent of the errors, which also mean some genuine small business transactions are not labeled as such, is not clear. Separate Ex-Im databases don't even agree with each other. Responding to a list of 10 examples provided by Reuters, Ex-Im acknowledged errors in most of them, but argued their impact was small and that the mislabeling of small firms as large ones may have a greater bigger effect on the total tally of small business support. A spokesman said the bank aimed to be as transparent as possible.""When it comes to our data, we strive for 100 percent accuracy, and anything less is unacceptable, which is why we are constantly improving our systems,” he said, pointing to Ex-Im's recent hiring of a chief information officer, an overhaul of databases and a review of paper documents.In an emailed response to Reuters, the bank cited five examples in which small firms were labeled as large firms by mistake. The errors make it difficult to identify exactly how much Ex-Im support goes to big business like Caterpillar (CAT.N) and how much to small firms.  The problem is primarily political, as there are no legal implications of businesses being misclassified by Ex-Im, since it does not set money aside specifically for firms that meet industry-specific revenue and employee limits set by the Small Business Administration. The SBA guidelines exclude firms that may be small but are owned by deep-pocketed conglomerates. SLIM AND BUFFET  Reuters calculations show that as much as $3 billion in authorizations listed as those for small business may have been misclassified over eight years - roughly 8 percent of Ex-Im's $38 billion in small business support over that period. Total authorizations were worth $189 billion.   For example, among ""small business"" beneficiaries is Texas-based Condumex Inc. the U.S. sales operation for Mexico's Grupo Condumex, a subsidiary of Slim's Grupo Carso (GCARSOA1.MX). Or take Brock Grain Systems, a division of CTB International Corp., which has been owned by Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) since 2002. In its battle to survive, Ex-Im has presented its statistics with exacting precision.Ex-Im says that in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, it engaged in 3,347 transactions supporting small businesses, accounting for almost a quarter of financial authorizations and nearly 40 percent of the exports the agency supported. The lender authorized $20.5 billion during that fiscal year in low interest loans and other support for U.S. exporters and buyers of ""Made in America"" products.The mislabeling of transactions, however, makes it difficult to tell exactly how the pie is divided. It extends to a Web site that allows lawmakers and others to check how Ex-Im supports businesses in each Congressional district.The list of small businesses in Texas, for example, includes engineering giant Bechtel, which has 53,000 employees.

191,"  * Tired of risk, investors looking to steadier stocks* Renewed appeal of stable companies with solid profits* Buffett's Berkshire, Novartis, Givaudan doing well* $1 billion inflow last month to low volatility ETFsBy Francesco CanepaLONDON, Nov 21 The big story of recent stock market investment has been volatility, and the opportunities that sharp price swings can bring for those with strong nerves.But good news is emerging now for those who prefer safer strategies: some of the best returns this year have come from stable stocks like billionaire Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway or Swiss toilet maker Geberit . A basket of the two least volatile stocks in each STOXX Europe 600 sector index, as compiled by Thomson Reuters, up 8 percent year to date, or almost twice as much as the STOXX Europe 600 overall. (Here volatility is defined by the size of price moves in either direction.)Though that high performance might seem odd - particularly looking at double-digit returns yielded by other European stocks that see-sawed at the prospect of a U.S. interest rate hike recently - in fact it demonstrates that low-volatility stocks are often stronger companies with healthier earnings power.That distinction really matters when European companies' earnings recovery is still vulnerable - and it's one that more people are waking up to.""Investors are ready to invest on the equity market but under the condition that they are not too exposed to risk and that's one argument for investing in the least volatile stocks,"" said Laurent Lagarde, head of quant equity management at investment firm THEAM, a unit of BNP Paribas. The Reuters basket included traditionally defensive stocks like drugmaker Novartis, up 29 percent, but also benefited from similar gains by cyclical companies - those whose profits and share prices track the pace of the economy. Among those were Givaudan, the world's biggest maker of flavours and fragrances, or media group Reed Elsevier.Stocks from Switzerland - home to reliable earners such as Geberit - accounted for 13 out of 38 components.The strategy also worked globally: BNP Paribas' World Low volatility strategy returned 15 percent in the first 10 months of the year, helped by a rally of nearly 20 percent in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway, among others. A Lipper basket of 53 exchange traded funds which tracked stocks with low volatility returned 8 percent year to date. That compares to a 6 percent return for the MSCI World Index, Datastream data showed.And the trend continues to pick up steam. As last month's volatility gripped financial markets, assets under management at low volatility stock funds attracted net inflows of over $1 billion even as other stock funds lost money, Markit data shows.This reflects investors' weariness with jumpy markets. After a rollercoaster October more jitters are expected as the United States shuts off the flow of cheap money that has been buoying its banks and businesses, and economies from the euro zone to China struggle to grow.Fund manager Ossiam's head of business development Isabelle Bourcier said interest in its low volatility ETFs had grown.""Expectations from clients that there will be volatility is helping us,"" she said.Assets in low volatility ETFs have grown to $16 billion currently from $15 million when the financial crisis hit in 2008, Markit data showed.

192,"  (Adds analyst comment, details)Dec 1 Oilfield services provider Weatherford International Plc said Berkshire Hathaway Inc's  Lubrizol Corp would pay $750 million in cash for two businesses that provide chemicals and drilling fluids for oil and gas production.Weatherford said the sale of its engineered chemistry and integrity drilling fluids businesses also included a potential increase of $75 million tied to the performance of the units after the closure of the deal, expected by the end of this month. Engineered chemistry supplies additives and fluids for a range of oilfield activities, including cementing, drilling and fracking. The other unit makes drilling fluids and additives for enhanced performance of drilling operations.The sale is part of Weatherford's broader plan to divest non-core businesses and repay debt. The company has raised about $1.8 billion from divestitures this year. Weatherford said its net debt would be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion at year-end, lower than its earlier target of $7.0 billion-$7.5 billion.

200,"  (Adds background)Dec 16 Investment bank Jefferies Group LLC, owned by Leucadia National Corp, said it was in talks to sell its commodities and financial derivatives brokerage, which has been struggling with high costs and falling fees.Jefferies, which also reported a fourth-quarter loss, is the latest bank to retreat from the commodities futures market as stricter regulation increases costs and intense competition and a decline in fees squeeze profit margins.Brokers, which make money clearing and executing trades for clients ranging from commercial hedgers to hedge funds, have also been hit by the rise of electronic trading, which allows customers to execute trades on their own screens.Jefferies' move reverses a push into commodities that started with its $430 million purchase of the more than 130-year old business, formerly known as Prudential Bache, in 2011.""As a result of the growth and margin challenges we have recently faced in the Bache business ... we are pursuing strategic alternatives for this business,"" Jefferies Chief Executive Richard Handler said in a statement on Tuesday.Commodities trading has become tougher this year as the market has fallen out of favor with investors who have been betting on strong growth from China for raw materials such as copper and crude oil. Newedge, one of the world's top commodities brokerages, cut jobs in its London, New York and Chicago financial derivatives teams last week. ICAP, another commodities brokerage, is exiting base metals broking business at the end of the year.WEAK RESULTS  Jefferies' investment banking revenue fell 24 percent to $316 million the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 due to lackluster fixed income trading in a tepid trading environment.Revenue in its fixed income business dropped 73 percent to $61 million.Net loss attributable to the company was $92.4 million for the quarter, compared with a profit of $109.9 million a year earlier, the company said on Tuesday. Jefferies wrote down $52 million in goodwill and $8 million of the intangible assets that were allocated to the Bache business when the company was bought by Leucadia in 2013.Leucadia, which models itself on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, bought Jefferies for $2.76 billion in stock.Excluding Bache, Jefferies' would have posted an adjusted net profit of $19 million.Net revenue fell about 43 percent to $537.6 million.Jefferies, the first of the investment banks to report quarterly results, is often viewed as an indicator of the performance of other Wall Street banks.Leucadia's shares were down 0.8 percent at $21.40 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

BHFC's issuance consists of $400 million floating-rate (LIBOR plus 17 basis  points) senior unsecured notes maturing Jan. 13, 2017 and $600 million  floating-rate (LIBOR plus 30 basis points) senior unsecured notes maturing Jan.  12, 2018. Proceeds from the issuance will fund $1 billion of maturing notes, and  consequently, there will be no change in financial leverage. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 24% as of Sept. 30, 2014,  excluding after-tax unrealized bond gains from stockholders' equity.  Consolidated interest coverage for the first three quarters of 2014 was 8.6X  excluding realized investment gains.  BRK's financial leverage ratio at the holding company level (including debt  issued by the company's finance company subsidiaries and guaranteed by BRK) was  14% at Sept. 30, 2014. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance operations  at a low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance operations  and also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by BRK. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5X, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5X or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate financial leverage ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate financial leverage ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio.  --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5X consolidated interest expense. Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

202,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK NetJets Inc, the private jet-sharing company owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc , has defeated a U.S. Internal Revenue Service lawsuit attempting to recoup more than $500 million of unpaid taxes, penalties and interest.U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus in Columbus, Ohio, said on Monday that the IRS was bound by guidance it gave a NetJets predecessor in 1992 over when to collect federal transportation excise taxes, and could not impose more taxes retroactively.The judge's 37-page decision was not a complete victory for NetJets. Sargus rejected a claim by the company that it deserved a $219.5 million refund plus interest on taxes already paid because its services were not ""taxable transportation.""NetJets specializes in ""fractional"" aircraft ownership, which lets individuals and companies buy shares of private jets. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire bought the company in 1998. The dispute arose from a series of IRS and federal court decisions over nearly two decades, on when and how Columbus-based NetJets should pay federal excise taxes.NetJets had been collecting and remitting these taxes on ""occupied hourly"" fees it charges customers. These are per-hour flight fees plus aircraft operating costs, including fuel.But the IRS later said taxes should also have been collected on monthly management fees, which include aircraft ownership costs such as crew salaries and insurance, and ""variable"" surcharges imposed when fuel prices rise higher than expected. In his decision, Sargus said NetJets should not be penalized now for having relied ""in good faith"" on the IRS' 1992 guidance.""No doubt the IRS may retroactively change an earlier interpretation of law, even when a taxpayer relied on that earlier interpretation to his detriment,"" Sargus wrote. ""But courts repeatedly have held that the IRS must follow its own procedural rules in doing so. And, the IRS did not."" An IRS spokesman had no immediate comment on Tuesday.In a statement, NetJets said it was pleased with the decision on the $500 million IRS claim, and would review whether to appeal the portion concerning the tax refund.Buffett is the world's third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.

215,"  (Recasts, adds analyst comment, includes background, other portfolio changes)NEW YORK Feb 17 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Tuesday disclosed a 5 percent stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co and said it shed a $3.74 billion investment in oil company Exxon Mobil Corp  as oil prices plunged.The changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate's domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31.Berkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats.Deere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading.Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Deere declined to comment.Berkshire's decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013.Exxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half. It is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment.Buffett ""is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,"" said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview.Exxon Mobil declined to comment. Berkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch's media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc .It further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc , the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Berkshire helped finance Burger King's purchase of Tim Hortons last year and got Restaurant Brands shares through the merger.Berkshire also added to holdings in IBM Corp, General Motors Co, Phillips 66, Suncor Energy Inc  and DirecTV, among others, and shed stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips and pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts Holding Co.U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter.Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns more than 80 businesses ranging from Dairy Queen ice cream to Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad.

220,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders last year, called America ""the mother lode of opportunity."" This year, his 50th at Berkshire's helm, the world's third-richest person could write something quite different.When Buffett releases this year's letter on Saturday, he may point to opportunities outside of the United States, after he recently decided to buy a German motorcycle accessories retailer and said he may shop more in that country. That would mark a significant turn for Berkshire, a conglomerate with more than 80 businesses, giant stock investments and a $360 billion market value.Buffett did not return a request for comment.In his letter, eagerly awaited on Wall Street for Buffett's candid thoughts on investing, business and life, the 84-year-old Buffett may detail his vision for Berkshire in the decades to come, including after he is gone.His comparatively taciturn second-in-command, 91-year-old Charlie Munger, is also expected to express his thoughts.""Warren Buffett recognizes that global investing is going to be an important part of the future,"" said Michael Yoshikami,  chief executive of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. Buffett's strategy of buying solid companies at low prices has gotten more difficult in the United States. In the first quarter of 2009, when the S&P 500 index was barely one-third of what it is now, stocks on average cost 12.9 times projected full-year earnings. At the end of 2014, that multiple had reached 17.4, above the long-term average of 14.8 times earnings, meaning it costs more to get the same financial pop.By contrast, the rest of the world's growth has been sluggish. Germany is expected to grow just 1.3 percent this year, while the U.S. economy may expand 3.6 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.Though Buffett said this week the falling euro was not his primary driver for buying in Europe, it was a factor. The currency has slid about 20 percent against the U.S. dollar since May.  DOLLARS FOR DOUGHNUTS In the last year, Berkshire has announced several purchases worth or estimated at a couple of billion dollars each.These have included Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit, the Van Tuyl auto retailer, and SNC-Lavalin Group Inc's AltaLink energy transmission unit in Canada.Buffett also kicked in $3 billion toward Burger King's purchase of Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons, which created Restaurant Brands International Inc. Burger King is run by Brazil's 3G Capital, which shares ownership with Berkshire of ketchup maker HJ Heinz Co.Berkshire ended September with $62 billion in cash, well above the $20 billion cash cushion Buffett likes. That leaves more than $40 billion to go shopping.That means Buffett needs big purchases, which he calls ""elephants,"" to soak up significant amounts of money. He has said he would team up again with a partner such as 3G Capital.""There may be opportunities overseas that he would certainly consider,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst with S&P Capital IQ.But even if Berkshire spreads its wings geographically, Seifert said, it will not turn its back on a good U.S. purchase.""I definitely would not rule out the U.S.,"" she said.

221,"   By Luciana Lopez, Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In his 50 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Warren Buffett has transformed a failing textile company into a sprawling conglomerate that has vastly outperformed most of the rest of corporate America.    But he now says: Do not expect a repeat of that outperformance in the next 50.    In the 84-year-old's annual shareholder letter released on Saturday, Buffett said Berkshire has grown so large - 751,000 times its original net worth per share - that the future pace of gains ""will not come close"" to those of the past.""The numbers have become too big,"" Buffett wrote. ""I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won't be great.""    Within 10 to 20 years, Buffett said, Berkshire's girth could require whoever then runs the Omaha, Nebraska-based company to consider steps he has resisted, such as paying dividends or conducting ""massive"" share repurchases.Buffett, also addressing one of the more pressing topics at Berkshire, said he and his board of directors ""believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO,"" likely for a decade or more, and who in some respects ""will do a better job than I am doing.""While Buffett did not name that person, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 91, said Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, two top Buffett lieutenants, would be prime candidates.Abel, 52, runs Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Jain, 63, has been Buffett's top insurance executive for three decades.A successor could also be female: Buffett said ""gender should never decide who becomes CEO.""And Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who run some Berkshire investments, ""can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions,"" he added.""You've got such good candidates,"" said Thomas Russo, a principal at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests 12 percent of its $10 billion of assets in Berkshire.

222,"  (Recasts headline)By Luciana Lopez, Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer AblanNEW YORK Feb 28 In his 50 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Warren Buffett has transformed a failing textile company into a sprawling conglomerate that has vastly outperformed most of the rest of corporate America.But he now says: Do not expect a repeat of that outperformance in the next 50.In the 84-year-old's annual shareholder letter released on Saturday, Buffett said Berkshire has grown so large - 751,000 times its original net worth per share - that the future pace of gains ""will not come close"" to those of the past.""The numbers have become too big,"" Buffett wrote. ""I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won't be great.""Within 10 to 20 years, Buffett said, Berkshire's girth could require whoever then runs the Omaha, Nebraska-based company to consider steps he has resisted, such as paying dividends or conducting ""massive"" share repurchases.Buffett, also addressing one of the more pressing topics at Berkshire, said he and his board of directors ""believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO,"" likely for a decade or more, and who in some respects ""will do a better job than I am doing.""While Buffett did not name that person, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 91, said Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, two top Buffett lieutenants, would be prime candidates.Abel, 52, runs Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Jain, 63, has been Buffett's top insurance executive for three decades.A successor could also be female: Buffett said ""gender should never decide who becomes CEO.""And Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who run some Berkshire investments, ""can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions,"" he added. ""You've got such good candidates,"" said Thomas Russo, a principal at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests 12 percent of its $10 billion of assets in Berkshire. ""I think they'll adopt a different capital structure approach, which will include a healthy, healthy large dividend.""OPERATING RESULTS MISS ESTIMATES Buffett is preparing in May to celebrate 50 years of running Berkshire, whose market value is now $363 billion.On Saturday, Berkshire also reported a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit, to $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per Class A share, from $4.99 billion, or $3,035, a year ago, as investment gains and results from insurance underwriting declined.Operating profit rose 5 percent to $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share, from $3.78 billion, or $2,297.

225,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett released his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) shareholders on Saturday, written with his usual mix of business facts, common-sense advice and showmanship. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Buffett's time heading the sprawling conglomerate.On a potential successor:""Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.""On investing:""Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality – you can count on that. ...ever forget that 2+2 will always equal 4.

On lodging for the May 2 annual meeting in Omaha:""Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the period around meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb's services may be especially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year a few hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tight budget should check the Airbnb website."" On the meeting as spectacle:""Get up early on Saturday morning. At 6:20 a.m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighing about a ton, will proceed down 10th Street to the CenturyLink. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Boot executives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargo stagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to our portfolio should seal our reputation as America's all-purpose transportation company.""On the GEICO gecko:""The gecko, I should add, has one particularly endearing quality – he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from his fame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy."" On improving BNSF railroad service:""Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating problems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That can't be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disrupts operations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results. During the last three months, BNSF's performance metrics have materially improved from last year's figures.""On the future of Berkshire:""All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie (Munger) and I leave the scene. We have the right people in place – the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture, furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, both good and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners and operating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind and permanent home.""

226,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, told investors on Saturday that the company had found his successor, and the company's vice chairman, Charlie Munger, identified two Berkshire executives as candidates. In Berkshire's annual report to shareholders, Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire's energy companies, and Ajit Jain, a top insurance executive, were said by Munger to be ""proven performers who would probably be under-described as 'world-class.'""""'World-leading' would be the description I would choose,"" Munger said in a letter to Berkshire shareholders. ""In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.""Buffett's son, Howard, would become non-executive chairman after the departure of his father, who is also Berkshire's chairman. In his previous letters to shareholders, the 84-year-old Buffett has said Berkshire board had been fully aware of his chosen successor but that he was keeping his options open.Investors have long speculated about who would, or could, succeed Buffett, particularly after he was diagnosed with, and then beat, prostate cancer in 2012. Munger, whom Buffett describes as ""my partner,"" is 91.""Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down,"" Buffett said.""In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing,"" Buffett added.Berkshire on Saturday also reported a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter net income, but a 2 percent increase in full-year profit. Operating profit rose in both periods.Neither Buffett's nor Munger's letter on Saturday referred by name to Matthew Rose, executive chairman of the BNSF railroad unit, who has also been mentioned by investors as a possible successor. Buffett said BNSF is, by far, Berkshire's most important non-insurance unit but ""was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad disappointed many of its customers"" despite  capital outlays far exceeding those of Union Pacific Corp, its main rival.BUFFETT'S ABCs FOR NEW CEOBuffett strongly suggested in his letter that his potential successor already works within Berkshire and laid out the challenges facing his successor as Berkshire grows ever larger.He said Berkshire's earnings and capital resources will eventually reach a level where management will not be able to intelligently reinvest all of the company's earnings.""At that time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings is through dividends, share repurchases or both,"" Buffett said. Buffett said his successor will also need to avoid the ""debilitating forces"" that decades ago befell companies such as General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel. ""My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency,"" he said. ""When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter.""Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with a $363 billion market value and more than 80 operating businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food and apparel. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also has more than $117 billion of equity investments. ABEL, JAIN TOP CONTENDERS  Age will also be a factor, and Buffett said Berkshire may be best off if his successor stays on for at least a decade.""Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job,"" Buffett wrote. ""It's hard to teach a new dog old tricks. And they are not likely to retire at 65 either - or have you noticed?""Buffett also said Berkshire's directors believe future CEOs should be internal candidates they know well.Abel, 52, leads Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Jain, 63, has been Buffett's top insurance deputy for three decades.In Saturday's letter, Buffett said: ""Ajit's underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.""In last year's letter, Buffett called Abel an ""extraordinary manager."" Bill Smead, who oversees $1.3 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle and invests $55 million in Berkshire, called Jain a ""brilliant"" insurance executive but said Abel could be a better fit as CEO.""I think you want someone who is good at overseeing numerous stand-alone companies,"" he said. ""That would be advantage Abel.""Because Berkshire Hathaway Energy is a ""mini-conglomerate"" itself, ""you practice in the miniature and then ultimately that puts you in the position to be the one,"" Smead said.

228,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett wants to buy more businesses to add to Berkshire Hathaway Inc's ""sprawl,"" but cautioned it may not keep the company he has run for 50 years from evolving into something rarely used to describe it up until now: average.In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett on Saturday said Berkshire's huge balance sheet gives him the power to funnel capital to some of the more than 80 operating units that deserve it, while its decentralized structure makes it the ""home of choice"" for many businesses looking to sell.""Berkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further,"" Buffett wrote. ""In an operating sense, Berkshire is not a giant company, but rather a collection of large companies.""That sprawl, including 9-1/2 businesses that would on their own make the Fortune 500 - Berkshire owns half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for instance - may limit its power to outperform.Indeed, that power has been waning.Berkshire's book value per share, Buffett's favored growth measure, has after taxes risen less than the Standard & Poor's 500 index including dividends, pre-tax, in five of the last six calendar years, after dwarfing the index in the prior 44 years. Its stock price has also slightly lagged the index since the end of 2008, the company said.""The bad news is that Berkshire's long-term gains - measured by percentages, not by dollars - cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years,"" Buffett wrote. ""The numbers have become too big. I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won't be great."" MORE ACQUISITIONS  Buffett still wants Berkshire to make acquisitions in the $5 billion to $20 billion range. And purchases could be even bigger if he teams with partners, such as Brazil's 3G Capital.That firm bought the rest of Heinz and got $3 billion from Berkshire to help its Burger King unit buy Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc.  Buffett said he expects to work with 3G on more activities.He also questioned the wisdom of deferring too readily to investment bankers who advise what to buy and sell.""Investment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20 percent to 50 percent premiums over market price for publicly-held businesses,"" he wrote.""A few years later, bankers – bearing straight faces – again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the earlier acquisition in order to 'unlock shareholder value,'"" he added.     Still, Berkshire is sitting on $63.27 billion of cash and its most recent purchases have been comparatively small.They have included the AltaLink electric transmission unit in Canada, and Van Tuyl Automotive, the fifth-largest U.S. auto retailer. Berkshire also plans to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit later this year.Once in Berkshire's stable, those companies will likely stay.Though Buffett does shed or give up some businesses - the textile company that gave Berkshire its name was closed in 1985 - Buffett said spinoffs ""make no sense,"" citing tax reasons and a belief that businesses are worth more within Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire than on their own.Buffett said his eventual successor at Berkshire, whenever he or she takes the job - ""gender should never decide"" - will need to monitor those businesses closely, and as Berkshire grows larger fend off the ""arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency"" that can destroy seemingly indestructible companies.""For very good reasons, business owners and operating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind and permanent home,"" Buffett wrote, italicizing ""permanent"" for emphasis.

I love the little guy.""On improving BNSF railroad service:""Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating problems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takes to restore our service to industry-leading levels. That can't be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disrupts operations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results. During the last three months, BNSF's performance metrics have materially improved from last year's figures.""On the future of Berkshire:""All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie (Munger) and I leave the scene. We have the right people in place - the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture, furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, both good and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners and operating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind and permanent home.""

""It's just not the way to run a business,"" he added.In a statement to CNBC, Wilson said he is not a short-term strategist when it comes to General Motors, a company whose shares he has owned since 2011. Wilson said he agrees with Buffett in supporting Mary Barra as GM CEO.Wilson and a group of hedge funds that own almost 2 percent of GM stock are pressing the automaker to buy back $8 billion in stock over the 12 months following its June annual meeting, and agree to give Wilson a seat on its board.Buffett said he was concerned that Wilson's compensation from the hedge funds would be linked to the performance of GM over only two years. But Wilson, in his statement to CNBC, said he is “perfectly willing to take all of my compensation in stock and have it locked up for an extended period of time. This is not by any means a two-year deal.”Berkshire Hathaway owned 2.55 percent of GM's shares at the end of last year, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

239,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday that Berkshire executives Ajit Jain and Greg Abel were not angling for the top Berkshire job.   In Berkshire's annual report to shareholders on Saturday, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger hinted that Jain, a top insurance executive, and Abel, the head of Berkshire's energy companies, were top candidates to succeed Buffett.""There's no jockeying position at all"" between Jain and Abel, Buffett said on CNBC.Speculation has mounted among Berkshire investors over who will eventually succeed the 84-year-old Buffett. The field was narrowed in the annual Berkshire letter, when Buffett said he and the board had found his successor, and Munger wrote that Abel and Jain were ""proven performers who would probably be under-described as 'world-class.'""""'World-leading' would be the description I would choose,"" Munger said in a separate letter to shareholders, also on Saturday. ""In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett."" On Monday, Buffett said: ""When Charlie's letter came in and it referenced Greg and Ajit, it was news to me that he was writing that.""""He's right. They're very, very, very good, each one of them.""Munger, whom Buffett describes as ""my partner,"" is 91. Asked if Abel, 52, and Jain, 63, were aware of who the next successor would be, Buffett said: ""No.""""We have a precise plan in mind, very detailed, as to what happens later today if I pass out on this show or something of the sort,"" he said. ""It's all in place, and it wouldn't take 24 hours to implement."" Neither Buffett's nor Munger's letters referred by name to Matthew Rose, 55, executive chairman of the BNSF railroad unit, who has also been mentioned by investors as a possible successor. Buffett told CNBC that Rose was not out of the race for potential chief executive officer.In his letter on Saturday, Buffett said age would also be a factor and that Berkshire might be better off if his successor were to stay on for at least a decade.On investing, Buffett said Berkshire was continuing to stick with IBM shares, the Dow Jones industrial average's worst performer in 2014, ""because I like it."" As of Dec. 31, Berkshire held a 7.79 percent stake in IBM. ""There have been no surprises at IBM since we started buying it a few years ago,"" Buffett said. ""We expected revenue to come down.

244,"  (Adds context)By Laura BenitezLONDON, March 5 (IFR) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is planning to raise its first ever issue in the European market, a triple-tranche euro benchmark that will refinance some of its dollar debt.The Aa2/AA rated conglomerate is taking advantage of a strong backdrop and record low yields in the single currency, becoming the latest in a string of US names to cross the pond in recent months.Lead managers are marketing an eight-year tranche at 35bp area over mid-swaps, a 12-year at 50bp area and a 20-year at 65bp area, implying respective yields of around 0.9%, 1.34% and 1.75%. Those yields are much lower than the 3.2% coupon on a US$1.7bn bond that matured on February 11 2015 which Berkshire is refinancing with this new issue.The company reported earnings in February, posting a fourth-quarter profit decline of 17% as investment gains declined, but operating results improved. A hedge fund manager said he expected the deal to go well and replicate the success of a 8.5bn transaction priced for Coca-Cola last week.""Berkshire is a well respected name and well rated,"" he said. ""Providing they don't print too large a size it should have a good following. Saying that, many insurance companies perceive the issuer to be 'insurance', and may not participate as it would be effectively be financing a competitor."" The influx of US corporates into Europe is showing no sign of abating. More than 15bn priced last week alone, despite unfavourable moves in the cross-currency basis swap over the course of the year so far.Market players say US companies can still save up to 15bp by issuing in euros, particularly in the longer maturities.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo are lead managers.

246,"  (Refiles to correct date in dateline)* Berkshire Hathaway issues first ever euro bond* Investors scramble to buy 'rare' paper* More US companies could follow suit into euro marketBy Laura BenitezLONDON, March 6 (IFR) - Where Warren Buffett goes, others tend to follow, and bankers are predicting that Berkshire Hathaway's euro debut will open the US corporate issuance floodgates further. So far this year, US firms have already sold an impressive 30bn or so, according to Thomson Reuters data.The US conglomerate dominated the market on Thursday with its 3bn three-tranche offering. And the action continued on Friday, with it being the most traded deal of the day, according to MarketAxess data.Berkshire Hathaway's no-marketing policy outside of its shareholder meetings meant investors were given only a teaser announcement of its bond plans on Wednesday. But evidently that was all it needed: pre-reconciled orders amounted to EUR7.5bn, while all three bonds were the top traded at noon on Friday.Compare this to GDF's landmark multi-tranche bond - incorporating the first vanilla note with a zero coupon from a corporate - that priced earlier this week. Not one of its four bonds made the top 10 traded on MarketAxess the day after they priced.While this data is based purely on MarketAxess' post-trade service, Trax, and does not therefore capture all trading, the company does tend to process approximately 65% of fixed income transactions in Europe and its numbers therefore offer a relatively accurate reflection of volumes.According to one banker away from that deal, the allocation on GDF, mainly buy-and-hold real money, was a reason it did not feature. One of the leads also pointed out that none of the tranches was particularly large, so the bonds were perhaps less liquid. He added that since it priced investors have had a deluge of supply to focus upon, including that from Berkshire.LURING IN THE MASSES ""For European investors, it was the first opportunity for them to even look at Berkshire, so perhaps some needed the announcement to assess it. But with the market so hot and the company and its CEO being so high profile, we knew it was positioned well,"" a lead on the transaction said.Lead managers Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo started marketing an eight-year tranche at 35bp area over mid-swaps, a 12-year at 50bp area and a 20-year at 65bp area, implying respective yields of around 0.90%, 1.34% and 1.75% for the Aa2/AA rated company.Those yields were much lower than the 3.20% coupon on a US$1.7bn bond that matured on February 11 this year which Berkshire is refinancing. Leads set official guidance at plus 30bp area, 45bp area and 60bp area, all to price within a 3bp range. Final terms were announced for a 750m eight-year at 27bp over mid-swaps, a 1.25bn 12-year at 42bp over and a 1bn 20-year at 57bp over.STRIKING A BALANCE Berkshire's eight-year tranche priced at a premium to where its US dollar deals trade around the same tenor. Its 3.00% February 2023s were quoted on Eikon at 55bp over swaps, although factoring in a euro/dollar cross-currency swap that is negative by around 40bp, this made for a premium of some 12bp on the euro issue.""Companies are having to pay up on the shorter deals at the moment; and on Berkshire's shorter piece, leads should have left more on the table, as the shorter dated stuff is not well bid. Overall, the deal was well executed though and priced to perfection,"" said Louis Gargour, CIO and managing partner at asset manager LNG Capital.The longer two tranches, due in 12 and 20 years, could have priced at relatively tighter terms post-swap, although any savings are theoretical, due to Berkshire Hathaway's lack of outstanding longer dated dollar paper. ""If swapped back into dollars, the eight-year comes around 10bp-15bp back of where the dollar bond trades,"" a lead on the deal said. ""So, if the company was swapping back, it would maybe be wider, although on the longer pieces they could have theoretically saved 10bp-15bp, but it's tricky to assess as the curve is a weird shape,"" the lead said.He added that for some US corporates tapping the euro market it is a cost-saving exercise, but others may be doing it to keep some of the proceeds in euros.Berkshire Hathaway has said it will use cash raised from the EUR3bn deal to refinance some maturing dollar debt, although market players believe it also has a more local investment plan in mind.""For where the swap rate is, I'm not sure if the deal makes sense. Maybe it's a coincidence that the company is rumoured to be looking at investing in Germany, because raising euro funds for that reason would make more sense,"" a banker away from the deal said.Berkshire Hathaway purchased a German retailer at the end of February, and chief executive Warren Buffet has since said he is ready to pay cash for more good German companies.SETTING A BIGGER TREND The relentless surge of US corporates tapping the European bond market has continued unabated, partly due to the attractive basis swap levels between euros and dollars, despite this waning over the course of the year, especially for the shorter maturities.Last week saw more than 15bn of US corporate issuance, with the likes of Coca-Cola, AT&T and Mondelez offering multi-tranche deals designed to appeal to a wide range of investors, and Priceline, Tyco Electronics and Moody's adding single standalone maturities. Coca-Cola alone accounted for more than half the total - 8.5bn.Headline-grabbing, Berkshire Hathaway may encourage the theme to continue.""Since Berkshire priced, we've received at least three phone calls from US corporate treasurers enquiring about issuing in euros. I think Berkshire's deal is going to prompt much more supply,"" a syndicate official said.

247,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Stung by customer backlash over last winter's patchy service, Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railways invested billions in shoring up its operations.But in addition to hiring more than 7,000 new workers and spending $5.5 billion on improvements to its 32,500-mile (52,300 kilometer) network, the railway also has done something unexpected: it pulled thousands of rail cars off its lines.The strategy appears to have paid big dividends this winter, helping ease congestion on tracks and speed up traffic, according to a Reuters analysis of weekly data the industry supplies to the U.S. Department of Transportation.BNSF rail cars that were stuck at terminals for an average of 35 hours last winter are now back on the tracks in less than a day. The trains are also moving 15 percent faster than they did last year, reducing critical travel times, data shows.""BNSF disappointed many of its customers,"" Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said in a letter to shareholders last month about last year's performance of one of North America's top railroads.""However, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results."" The railway's metrics, which have not been previously reported, have improved markedly this winter, reflecting less congestion, increased investments and weaker demand from the oil and agricultural industries. Since October, BNSF has cut its number of cars by 9 percent to just under 237,000, whereas the rest of the industry grew by 0.4 percent.Anthony Hatch, owner of New York-based transportation consultancy ABH Consulting says all rail operators struggle to strike the balance between the number of cars on the tracks and freight volumes. BNSF is the only major U.S. rail operator, though, to cut the number of cars in the past two years.MORE WITH LESS  In its latest report, BNSF showed strong year-over-year increases in the number of carloads of grain and petroleum products hauled during the first two months of 2015 combined with double-digit declines in container and trailer volumes. BNSF spokesman Mike Trevino said that improvements, such as building extra tracks and sidings, essentially allowed fewer cars to move the same amounts of freight. “We did some things operationally that allowed us to take cars off the railroad while still being able to generate the same or better number of movements,"" Trevino said. Other major rail carriers also have spent billions on upgrades and bigger workforce, but none has reduced car counts or seen as dramatic improvements in travel speed and the time cars spent in terminals.CSX, which last year carried about a quarter of BNSF's crude load, reported relatively steady car dwell times. Canadian Pacific, which faced similar criticism as the much larger BNSF, saw small overall decreases in dwell times. CSX spokeswoman Melanie Cost said the company has hired 1,900 frontline employees in 2014, bought new locomotives and upgraded lines where crude oil traffic has soared to ease capacity constraints and improve performance. BNSF's geographical focus on the nation's Corn Belt states, along with North Dakota, a leading shale oil and grain producer, means it struggled more than its peers to keep up with demand generated by the oil boom and bumper crops.The stress, aggravated by a series of paralyzing winter storms, led to nagging delays that plagued major shippers and triggered scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators.One refiner, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, was hit so hard by the delays last year that it ordered a half-dozen extra tankers of crude before the start of this winter season.This year, however, the extra reserve proved unnecessary, leaving the laden tankers idling offshore for months, according to a trader with knowledge of the situation. The company would not comment on its supplies.  Other big customers are also taking note of the improvement in areas served by BNSF, which pledged further $6 billion for capital maintenance in 2015 touting it the biggest amount ever invested in a single year by a North American rail company.“Rail was a lot better this year. We didn’t see the delays,""  said Mark Formo, president of the North Dakota Grain Growers Association. ""In fact, we saw cars showing up for deliveries a day early.” In a February survey by the Soy Transportation Coalition all respondents said cycle times – how long it takes a train to pick up a shipment, deliver it and return – have improved from last year.To be sure, some customers primarily credit fewer weather-related disruptions and cooled demand for oil-by-rail and grain shipments for better service.""To me it's market driven,"" said Brian Hammerbeck, president of Dakota Mill & Grain.

251,"   By Nichola Groom | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Chinese automaker BYD (1211.HK) Co Ltd (002594.SZ), backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), aims to triple its production of batteries as it takes on Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) in the race to supply electric vehicles and boost energy storage.Shenzhen-based BYD plans to add 6 gigawatt hours of global production for batteries in each of the next three years, and hopes to keep adding at that pace afterwards if demand is solid, Matthew Jurjevich, a spokesman for the company, said on Friday.    That means BYD could ramp up from 10 GWh capacity at the end of this year to about 34 GWh of batteries by the beginning of 2020. This would put it about even with Tesla's planned $5 billion Nevada gigafactory.    The companies are fast emerging as two of the key players in the nascent electricity storage sector. Storage technology is considered critical to integrating large amounts of renewable energy because it can absorb excess power from wind farms or solar panels and keep that for use when conditions don't allow for power generation.""We have demonstrated that BYD is capable of adding 6 GWh every year with strong market demand,"" Jurjevich, who works for BYD's U.S. unit, said in an interview.        The sector has attracted Tesla, BYD and a range of startups as well as stalwart battery manufacturers and is expected to grow to $1.5 billion by 2019 from $128 million in 2014 in the United States alone, according to GTM Research. BYD, which declined to provide investment budgets, ended last year with 4 GWh of capacity and will be at 10 GWh later this year. The U.S. energy storage market is expected to triple this year to 220 MW, according to GTM.Most of BYD's production is in China, but the company is opening a major new factory in Brazil this year that will contribute meaningfully to output next year, Jurjevich said.

252,"   By Nichola Groom | LOS ANGELES, March 13  LOS ANGELES, March 13 Chinese automaker BYD  Co Ltd, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, aims to triple its production of batteries as it takes on Tesla Motors in the race to supply electric vehicles and boost energy storage.Shenzhen-based BYD plans to add 6 gigawatt hours of global production for batteries in each of the next three years, and hopes to keep adding at that pace afterwards if demand is solid, Matthew Jurjevich, a spokesman for the company, said on Friday.That means BYD could ramp up from 10 GWh capacity at the end of this year to about 34 GWh of batteries by the beginning of 2020. This would put it about even with Tesla's planned $5 billion Nevada gigafactory.The companies are fast emerging as two of the key players in the nascent electricity storage sector. Storage technology is considered critical to integrating large amounts of renewable energy because it can absorb excess power from wind farms or solar panels and keep that for use when conditions don't allow for power generation.""We have demonstrated that BYD is capable of adding 6 GWh every year with strong market demand,"" Jurjevich, who works for BYD's U.S. unit, said in an interview. The sector has attracted Tesla, BYD and a range of startups as well as stalwart battery manufacturers and is expected to grow to $1.5 billion by 2019 from $128 million in 2014 in the United States alone, according to GTM Research.BYD, which declined to provide investment budgets, ended last year with 4 GWh of capacity and will be at 10 GWh later this year. The U.S. energy storage market is expected to triple this year to 220 MW, according to GTM.Most of BYD's production is in China, but the company is opening a major new factory in Brazil this year that will contribute meaningfully to output next year, Jurjevich said. BYD, which started out making mobile phone batteries, will also scale up manufacturing in the United States as demand for its batteries increases, he added.According to data published last year by Lux Research, BYD is the sixth-biggest manufacturer of batteries for hybrid and plug-in vehicles.

258,"   By Olivia Oran  Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) and Centerview Partners LLC have only a fraction of the staff and resources of their larger investment banking brethren, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). Yet the independent investment banks used their sector expertise and personal relationships with company executives to win the biggest deal of the year so far, the merger of H.J. Heinz Co and Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O. Terms of the deal, announced on Wednesday, value the combined company at $106 billion including debt.Lazard shares rose as much as 2.8 percent on Wednesday. Lazard and Centerview were the only investment banks advising the two companies on the deal. Lazard could earn as much as $66 million in fees and Centerview could earn as much as $97 million, consulting firm Freeman & Co estimated.Lazard has a long-standing relationship with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Partners LP, co-owner of Heinz along with Warren Buffetts' Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Centerview had worked with both Kraft and Heinz. Large banks vie for big M&A assignments by touting their financing capabilities and prowess in areas ranging from currency hedging to treasury management. Independent investment banks say their model poses fewer conflicts of interest and that full-service banks often seek to cross-sell products to clients. The deal between Heinz and Kraft, which involves a stock exchange sweetened by a dividend financed by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G, required no bank financing and thus no need for involvement from large firms.Both 3G and Kraft sought to limit the number of advisers to avoid leaks of deal negotiations, according to people familiar with the deal.  Centerview, co-founded in 2006 by former UBS vice chairman Blair Efron and former Wasserstein Perella & Co president Robert Pruzan, has just 200 employees. Lazard employed more than 2,500 people as of Dec. 31. The deal will push Lazard from seventh place to fourth in the global M&A league tables so far this year and up from 12th a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. Centerview will jump from 14th place to sixth this year, up from eighth place this time last year.3G has worked with Lazard often, including during the Brazilian group's $3.3 billion acquisition of Burger King in 2010 and its acquisition of Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons last year.  Former Lazard banker Antonio Weiss has a longstanding relationship with 3G. In 2008, he helped advise brewer InBev (ABI.BR), backed in part by 3G founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, on its acquisition of Anheuser-Busch. Weiss later advised the combined company on its $20 billion buyout of Grupo Modelo in 2013. Lazard CEO Ken Jacobs helped lead the Heinz-Kraft deal for the firm after Weiss left this year for the U.S. Treasury Department. Centerview worked with Kraft during its 2010 acquisition of chocolate maker Cadbury. The firm also advised H.J. Heinz during the ketchup maker's takeover by 3G in 2013.

Heinz Co, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, will combine with Kraft Foods Group Inc in a $46 billion deal to create the third-largest North American food company, executives said on Wednesday.Shares of Kraft, known for its namesake macaroni and cheese in a box, as well as Velveeta, Maxwell House coffee and Oscar Mayer processed meats, closed up nearly 36 percent at $83.17.The deal gives Buffett more leading U.S. food brands, as well as that of 3G founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, Brazil's richest man. The two teamed up to buy control of Heinz in 2013 and collaborated on the 2014 merger of fast-food chain Burger King and Tim Hortons Inc, which runs coffee and doughnut shops.Food industry experts see Kraft benefiting from Heinz's international presence, which generates more than 60 percent of its sales. Kraft brands are in 98 percent of North American households, the companies said, but would have a greater opportunity to expand overseas.The combined company, which will be publicly traded under the name Kraft Heinz Co, expects to save about $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017. 3G has a reputation for introducing aggressive cost cuts and improving efficiencies at other companies it has invested in, including Heinz and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. ""Mature businesses look for cost cutting. 3G takes cost cutting to a different level,"" said Bob Goldin, executive vice president at food industry consultant Technomic. Goldin noted that neither Kraft nor Heinz are major players in the sector's growth segments, from organic to fresh foods.The deal calls for the exchange of each Kraft share for one share in the combined Kraft Heinz Co, plus a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share to existing Kraft shareholders. The $10 billion behind the special dividend will be funded by an equity investment by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G.Heinz shareholders will own 51 percent of the combined company and Kraft shareholders the rest. The transaction is worth about $46 billion for Kraft shareholders, based on Kraft's market capitalization of $36 billion on Tuesday before news of the deal emerged plus the special dividend.CONSUMER SHIFT Packaged-food makers from Kraft to General Mills and Kellogg are battling sluggish demand as consumers shift to brands that are perceived as healthier, including foods that are organic or less processed.Kraft's efforts to revamp its own products, such as combining its higher-protein snacks like meat and nuts into one container called the P3 pack, have not shifted the tide enough. In December, Kraft named John Cahill as chief executive, who acknowledged the company has not changed enough in the face of shifting consumer tastes. Cahill overhauled his leadership team last month, announcing the exit of three senior executives.Cahill said on a call with analysts that 3G Managing Director Alex Behring approached him at the end of January about a possible deal. The discussions picked up in the second half of February.While Kraft had been developing its own plan for change, the board saw the 3G opportunity as more compelling, said Cahill, who will be vice chairman of the combined company. Behring will serve as chairman of Kraft Heinz Co and Bernardo Hees, CEO of Heinz, will become CEO of the combined company.Kraft Heinz Co will retain headquarters both in the Chicago area and in Pittsburgh. It will have combined revenue of about $28 billion, about half that of market leader PepsiCo in 2014.Berkshire Hathaway will own more than 320 million of the approximately 1.22 billion Kraft Heinz shares outstanding, Buffett told CNBC, adding ""We will be in the stock forever.""""Heinz goes back to 1859,"" he said.

266,"   By Olivia Oran | March 25  March 25 Lazard Ltd and Centerview Partners LLC have only a fraction of the staff and resources of their larger investment banking brethren, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.Yet the independent investment banks won the biggest deal of the year so far, the merger of H.J. Heinz Co and Kraft Foods Group Inc, using their sector expertise and personal relationships with company executives.Lazard and Centerview were the only investment banks advising the two companies on the deal announced on Wednesday. Lazard could earn as much as $66 million in fees and Centerview could earn as much as $97 million, according to estimates from consulting firm Freeman & Co.Lazard has a long-standing relationship with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Partners LP, the co-owner of Heinz along with Warren Buffetts' Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Centerview has worked previously with both Kraft and Heinz. Large banks tout their financing capabilities as well as their prowess in areas ranging from currency hedging to treasury management in order to win big M&A assignments.Independent investment banks, however, argue that their model poses fewer conflicts of interest than that of full-service banks, which often seek to cross-sell products to clients.Centerview, co-founded in 2006 by former UBS vice chairman Blair Efron and former Wasserstein Perella & Co president Robert Pruzan, has just 200 employees. Lazard employed over 2,500 people as of Dec. 31.The deal between Heinz and Kraft, which involves a stock exchange sweetened by a dividend financed by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G, required no bank financing and thus no need for involvement from large firms. 3G has worked with Lazard many times in the past, including the Brazilian group's $3.3 billion acquisition of Burger King in 2010 and its acquisition of Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons last year.Former Lazard banker Antonio Weiss has a longstanding relationship with 3G, helping to advise brewer InBev, backed in part by 3G founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, on its acquisition of Anheuser-Busch in 2008. Weiss later advised the combined company on its $20 billion buyout of Grupo Modelo in 2013.Lazard CEO Ken Jacobs helped lead the deal for the firm after Weiss left Wall Street earlier this year to serve in the U.S. Treasury department.Centerview, meanwhile, worked with Kraft during its 2010 acquisition of chocolate maker Cadbury. The firm also advised H.J. Heinz during the ketchup maker's takeover by 3G in 2013.

268,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When Kraft Foods Group merges with H.J. Heinz Co, they will share a name, a central place in the American kitchen and two headquarters near Chicago and Pittsburgh.But that dual office structure may soon change, according to some industry watchers. If history is any guide, their new owners will wrest an expected $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2017 by removing duplicate operations, slashing perks such as the use of private jets, while scrutinizing even the most mundane expenses.""There is going to be a lot of headcount reduction,"" said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of food consultancy Technomic. “You will see some portfolio pruning. They aren't going to have two headquarters for long.”Heinz's backer, Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Partners, has made a name for itself by aggressively trimming the fat from food and beer companies struggling for growth. 3G is considered ""the most aggressive in the industry in terms of running businesses on a very lean basis and maximizing margins and cash flow,"" said Kevin Dreyer, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which owns roughly a million shares of Kraft. “It’s certainly a good thing for holders.”3G Managing Partner Alex Behring made clear on Wednesday, when the $46 billion deal was announced [ID: nL2N0WR2GF], that it would implement a strategy of zero-based budgeting at Kraft Heinz Co when it comes to the company’s cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. The concept requires management to start each new budget year by justifying all costs from scratch, rather than the  traditional method of basing their new budget on the previous year’s figures and then only having to justify any changes.Some analysts say it is likely that 3G will exceed its savings target. It represents 6 percent of the cost base of Heinz and Kraft combined, according to Dave Novosel, senior analyst who covers both Heinz and Kraft for Gimme Credit, which provides independent research on corporate bonds.   EXPENSES LARGE AND SMALL     When 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, the cuts quickly followed. They included cutting 7,000 jobs in an 18-month period, closing six factories and many smaller curbs on spending – including limiting employee use of company printers to 200 pages per month. At the time, Pittsburgh-based Heinz had separate offices to serve as its North American headquarters and its global headquarters. Those two operations were quickly consolidated into one, smaller office, according to a person close to Heinz. The copier restrictions extended to requiring printing on two sides of a page, and a reduction in the use of color printing, the person said. Investors and analysts have generally cheered the results. 3G says that Heinz is now the most profitable food company in the industry. The changes are typical of 3G's playbook. When 3G-backed Belgian brewer InBev NV acquired the largest U.S. beer producer, Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, to form Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) in 2008, aggressive cost cutting soon followed. And after it took control of Burger King in 2010, 3G slashed hundreds of jobs at the fast-food chain’s Miami headquarters, got rid of  swanky offices and sold the corporate jet. It also took labor and operational costs off its books by franchising more than 1,300 restaurants.      ""When they see something that isn't working, they eliminate it,"" said Gary Stibel, founder of the New England Consulting Group, whose clients have included both Kraft and Heinz. ""It's a very healthy diet for the company, whether it's in food, beverage or otherwise, and it does work.""He added, ""It's taken the food industry a long time to consolidate to this degree. It isn't over. Others will learn from what they're doing."" To be sure, 3G and Kraft highlighted on Wednesday the growth potential for the combined entity as well. Heinz gets access to Kraft's well-known brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, while the mac and cheese maker can use Heinz's distribution network to broaden its reach internationally. But in the United States, where packaged food makers have struggled to increase sales in the face of changing eating habits, boosting sales will be challenging. ""It's much more of a margin story than a top line story,"" Dreyer said.(Story corrects spelling of Warren Buffett) (Additional reporting by Olivia Oran and Lisa Baertlein)",2015-03-26,BRKB,"Thu Mar 26, 2015 | 5:14pm EDT",3G to use its cost-cutting playbook on Kraft after Heinz merger,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-kraft-deals-analysis-idUSKBN0MM06020150326?type=companyNews

271,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said he would not raise interest rates significantly if he ran the Federal Reserve.""I probably wouldn't do much,"" Buffett said when asked what he would do if he ran the Fed. ""Things are working pretty well, and I would be worried that if I raised rates significantly with negative interest rates in Europe, I would be very worried about what that would do to the flow of funds.""He also noted that the economy ""is improving month by month.""Buffett spoke at an automotive industry conference in New York, along with the chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway automotive dealer group, Larry Van Tuyl.Buffett and Van Tuyl said that Berkshire Hathaway Automotive is actively looking to purchase more dealerships to add to the 81 auto dealerships it now owns in 10 states. Van Tuyl said that the company will look to expand in the United States and not internationally, at least for now. Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway will price auto dealerships for possible acquisition by using a long-term outlook and not allow short-term swings of the U.S. auto market to affect purchase decisions.He also said those purchase decisions will not be related to changes in interest rates. ""If (Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen came up and whispered in my ear what she was going to do for the next two years, it wouldn't make any difference what we do. If we got a chance to buy a dealership at a sensible price with the right people, we'd buy it. We'd buy it in five minutes."" Buffett and Van Tuyl both said that while Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) has a model of selling cars directly to consumers, the volume is too low to affect the U.S. auto distribution system.""Usually when a distribution system becomes that firmly established, there is a reason for it. I just don't see that changing,"" said Buffett. He said that self-driving cars will ""be a reality"" but that he expects autonomous cars to be less than 10 percent of the auto market by 2030.Earlier Tuesday, at the same National Automobile Dealers Association-J.D.

281,"  (Adds comments from both sides, background)By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, April 16 A New York state appeals court rejected former American International Group Inc  Chairman Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg's bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of orchestrating an accounting fraud at the insurer he ran for nearly four decades.Thursday's unanimous decision by the state Appellate Division suggests a trial may finally take place soon, after a decade of sometimes-vitriolic legal wrangling between Greenberg, who turns 90 next month, and three New York attorneys general.The court said current Attorney General Eric Schneiderman can pursue his effort to ban Greenberg from the securities industry and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. It also called Schneiderman's bid to recoup millions of dollars of allegedly ill-gotten bonuses ""legally viable.""Greenberg and co-defendant Howard Smith, a former AIG chief financial officer, are accused of having tried to hide losses at AIG through fraudulent transactions, including with a reinsurance unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc . The court said the defendants failed to show no connection between the wrongdoing and the alleged bonuses, and did not show conclusively that an injunction was not warranted under the Martin Act, New York state's powerful securities fraud law.Greenberg may appeal, according to Stephen Aiello, a spokesman for insurance company C.V. Starr & Co Inc, where Greenberg is chairman and chief executive.""This lawsuit has absolutely no merit,"" Aiello said. ""This case is a waste of taxpayer money."" Vincent Sama, a lawyer for Smith, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Schneiderman inherited the lawsuit from predecessors Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo. He was forced to drop claims for as much as $6 billion in damages, in the wake of a class action settlement between AIG shareholders and the executives.Critics, including former New York Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki, have questioned the need to pursue the case once damages could not be collected. But Schneiderman has said executives who perpetrate fraud should be held publicly accountable.""We look forward to presenting the people's case at trial,"" Liz DeBold, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said on Thursday.The defendants were accused of orchestrating a $500 million transaction with Berkshire's General Re unit to boost loss reserves without transferring risk, and a transaction with Capco Reinsurance Co to hide a $210 million underwriting loss.Mario Cuomo, Andrew's father, died in January. Buffett and Berkshire were not accused of wrongdoing.The case is People v Greenberg, et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 401720/2005.

283,"  (Adds details on case, paragraphs 2, 5-10)By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON, April 20 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left intact the 2012 insider trading conviction of former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta.Gupta is the highest-ranking corporate official to be convicted in the U.S. government's multi-year probe of insider trading in the hedge fund industry. The high court rejected Gupta's appeal of a March 2014 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that had upheld his conviction.The government used wiretap evidence to show that Gupta leaked news about Goldman's finances, including a crucial investment by prominent investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, by phone to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. Gupta, 66, is serving a two-year prison sentence stemming from his conviction. He was also ordered to make $6 million in restitution to Goldman and pay a $5 million fine. Gupta is scheduled to be released from prison in March 2016.A jury convicted Gupta in June 2012 of passing to Rajaratnam confidential information he learned from Goldman board meetings, including a crucial investment by Buffett. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal in June 2014.In January, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's separate challenge to a permanent ban from acting as a public company officer. The court then left intact a June 2014 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling upholding the sanctions. In addition to the officer ban, Gupta was prohibited from further violating securities law and associating with brokers, dealers or investment advisors.While Gupta's appeals at the Supreme Court have failed, he launched a new challenge last month to his conviction at the lower court level before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, citing a recent federal appellate court ruling that has limited authorities' abilities to pursue insider trading cases.The case on which the court acted on Monday was Gupta v.

285,"   By David Gaffen and Jennifer Ablan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett has carved out a core stock-picking strategy of investing in companies with strong economic ""moats,"" businesses that have built, fortified and generated success from well-known brands that make it difficult for them to succumb to competitive forces. But for a number of holdings in his stock portfolio, the moats may be drying up and the walls could be breached. Stalwarts like International Business Machines (IBM.N), Coca-Cola Inc (KO.N), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) to name a few have showed declining revenue trends in recent years, and face competition that may make it more difficult for them to outperform the market in the way they did in the past. When Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the conglomerate Buffett has run since 1965, releases quarterly results on Friday - which will follow with his annual gathering in Omaha, Nebraska - it is likely to show that his largest equity-market positions trailed the broad-market Standard & Poor's 500 Index. On average, the 15 biggest positions he owned at the end of 2014 have gained 7.8 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 13.1 percent rise for the S&P. Buffett supporters - and there are many - would say that the 84-year-old investor is hardly looking at the short term, but what stands out about some of the larger holdings are weakening revenue trends that augur for concern about the long-term, not just the short term. ""The moats are not as deep and unimpenetrable as in the past,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Investment Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, and has questioned Buffett's investments in the past. He currently has no position in the stock.     That is not to say Buffett is any kind of a slouch. Those 15 holdings, over the last five years, on average, are ahead of the S&P, with an average gain of 85 percent, compared with the S&P's 78 percent rise.  And he can still be opportunistic, as in the aftermath of the financial crisis when he acquired a $750 million position in Goldman Sachs Group Inc that's now worth $2.5 billion, and an option to buy 700 million shares in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) for $5 billion - now worth $11.2 billion. What's less clear, however, is whether these previously unassailable franchises are facing competitive pressures that will continue to hurt sales growth. Buffett owns 76.9 million shares of IBM that as of last year had cost him $13.2 billion, and that position is underwater; IBM is trying to reverse 12 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines as it plays catch-up in the cloud computing space.Two other large positions, Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), are also struggling. Wells Fargo has had three straight quarters of year-over-year revenue growth, but that followed 18 quarters of decline. Revenue growth has fallen for Coke in 8 of the last 9 quarters as the company deals with changing consumer tastes.But of course, Buffett's total cost for his 400 million shares of Coke was $1.3 billion. As of Wednesday, it was worth $16.2 billion. “Since he bought it in the 1980s, his return from stock price appreciation and dividends received has been terrific, and will likely continue compounding for years to come,"" said Ken Shubin Stein, founder and portfolio manager at Spencer Capital Management.Berkshire did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.It remains to be seen whether Buffett's portfolio sees a greater shift with the increased influence of Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, the two men handling portfolio management for the last few years.Berkshire's annual letter lists only the 15 largest positions in the portfolio - many of which predate the two executives - so it is possible that there are other, smaller positions that are big winners. Weschler and Combs are credited with buying DirecTV for Berkshire, which has a 54 percent gain for them. On the other hand, last year Berkshire sold U.K. food retailer Tesco, which Berkshire took a $444 million loss. Kass even acknowledges that Buffett's ability to hunt for unknowns now would not be easy given the firm's size and stature, in the way he did early in his investing career. Other investors believe that for Buffett to change his approach would be foolish at this stage of the game. ""His shareholders, I think, would get unnerved if he woke up one day and said, 'Yeah, you know, I’m wrong, let’s buy Apple,'"" said Jeff Matthews, who runs Ram Partners, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund, owns Berkshire shares in his personal account, and has written several books about Buffett.""When you compound at 20 percent a year for 50 years and that’s better than anybody, how do you start picking that apart just because he didn’t own Apple?""(Edits paragraph 13 to provide complete name)  (Reporting By David Gaffen and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2015-04-30,BRKB,"Thu Apr 30, 2015 | 3:02pm EDT",Warren Buffett losing some mojo on his economic 'moats',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-berkshire-buffett-idUSKBN0NL1BJ20150430?type=companyNews

Investors will be interested in whether Charter, backed by activist investor John Malone, will make a second bid for Time Warner Cable.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc is expected to report first-quarter results. The company is expected to benefit from growth in the U.S. economy, given Berkshire's diversification with close to 90 operating businesses in areas such as insurance, energy, food, industrial products and a railroad. Berkshire also owns well over $100 billion in stock, with big stakes in American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. The company's results will come a day before its annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders will celebrate Buffett's imminent 50th anniversary at Berkshire's helm, and listen to him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answer questions from them, journalists and analysts.The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to report that construction spending rose 0.5 percent in March after slipping 0.1 percent in February.

The company is increasing reliance on natural gas and is retiring some coal plants to comply with U.S. environmental regulations. Lower income from the company's operations outside North America has also weighed on profits in recent quarters. Investors will want to know about Duke's expectations for its utilities holdings, demand and operations in markets other than North America. Drug chain CVS Health Corp will report first-quarter results before the markets open. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, the company will beat both profit and sales forecasts for the quarter.Credit rating agency Moody's Corp is expected to report a rise in first-quarter profit, helped by strong growth in its analytics business and higher debt issuance in the United States.

287,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Luciana Lopez | OMAHA, Neb.  OMAHA, Neb. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said first-quarter profit rose 10 percent, and operating results easily beat forecasts, boosted by its railroad and insurance businesses and gains from derivatives.Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment conglomerate rose to $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per share, from $4.71 billion, or $2,862, a year earlier.Quarterly operating profit increased 20 percent to $4.24 billion, or $2,583 per share, from $3.53 billion, or $2,149. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,373 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 7 percent to $48.64 billion. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 0.5 percent from year-end to $146,963.Cathy Seifert, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, called results ""really strong,"" in contrast to many companies in sectors where Berkshire competes that have posted ""middling"" performance.Results were released one day before Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders are expected to celebrate Buffett's 50th anniversary at Berkshire's helm.Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will field five hours of questions at the meeting, which is expected to draw more than 40,000 shareholders. It is part of a weekend of events throughout Omaha that Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""Once a struggling textile mill, Berkshire now has more than 80 operating companies in the energy, food, industrial products, insurance, railroad and other sectors, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks. RAILROAD REBOUNDS  Profit from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad totaled $1.05 billion, up 44 percent from a year earlier, when bad weather and congestion led to what Berkshire called ""substandard"" service that left many customers unhappy.Berkshire attributed the better performance this year to increased capacity, new equipment and other upgrades made as part of a $6 billion capital improvement program that will continue this year.""It's good to see the railroad recovering. That's the most important driver here,"" said Jeff Matthews, who runs the Ram Partners hedge fund in Naples, Florida, owns Berkshire shares in his own account, and has written several books about Buffett.Berkshire recorded $857 million of profit from derivatives, primarily from contracts that will benefit Berkshire if stock markets rise over the long-term. The stronger U.S. dollar added to these gains by reducing liabilities under contracts denominated in foreign currencies.Accounting rules require Berkshire to report derivatives gains with quarterly results. Buffett downplays their importance, saying they do not reflect business performance. Currency fluctuations also boosted results at a unit that insures against major catastrophes, contributing to a 15 percent overall profit jump in insurance to $1.36 billion.Not all insurance businesses fared well. Underwriting profit at the auto insurer Geico fell 55 percent as it paid out more to cover claims, causing it to increase premium rates.Jeff Hull, senior financial adviser at Manulife Securities Inc in Toronto, said Geico is facing pressures from rivals that are slashing prices. ""I would like to see it a bit stronger,"" said Hull, who owns Berkshire shares. ""Overall the company is still doing okay.""Meanwhile, the General Re reinsurer lost money from underwriting, as it struggled with price competition, higher claims and currency losses in its international operations. ENERGY RESULTS WEAKEN Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of, saw profit fall 7 percent to $421 million, reflecting lower revenues from natural gas operations.Berkshire also has dozens of smaller businesses that sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim's jewelry, Brooks athletic shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies.The company ended the quarter with $63.71 billion of cash, enough to fund one or more giant acquisitions.It will own a roughly 27 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co after H.J. Heinz Co, now owned by Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, buys Kraft Foods Group Inc, combining Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta and other brands under one roof.Major stock holdings, meanwhile, include American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $2,400 at $215,800, and its Class B shares rose $2.15 to $143.36.The shares are about 6 percent below their record highs set last Dec. 8. Berkshire's market value is roughly $355 billion, ranking fifth among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 0.5 percent from year-end to $146,963.Cathy Seifert, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, called results ""really strong,"" in contrast to many companies in sectors where Berkshire competes that have posted ""middling"" performance.Results were released one day before Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, where shareholders are expected to celebrate Buffett's 50th anniversary at Berkshire's helm.Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will field five hours of questions at the meeting, which is expected to draw more than 40,000 shareholders. It is part of a weekend of events throughout Omaha that Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""Once a struggling textile mill, Berkshire now has more than 80 operating companies in the energy, food, industrial products, insurance, railroad and other sectors, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks. RAILROAD REBOUNDS Profit from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad totaled $1.05 billion, up 44 percent from a year earlier, when bad weather and congestion led to what Berkshire called ""substandard"" service that left many customers unhappy.Berkshire attributed the better performance this year to increased capacity, new equipment and other upgrades made as part of a $6 billion capital improvement program that will continue this year.""It's good to see the railroad recovering. That's the most important driver here,"" said Jeff Matthews, who runs the Ram Partners hedge fund in Naples, Florida, owns Berkshire shares in his own account, and has written several books about Buffett. Berkshire recorded $857 million of profit from derivatives, primarily from contracts that will benefit Berkshire if stock markets rise over the long-term. The stronger U.S. dollar added to these gains by reducing liabilities under contracts denominated in foreign currencies.Accounting rules require Berkshire to report derivatives gains with quarterly results. Buffett downplays their importance, saying they do not reflect business performance.Currency fluctuations also boosted results at a unit that insures against major catastrophes, contributing to a 15 percent overall profit jump in insurance to $1.36 billion.Not all insurance businesses fared well. Underwriting profit at the auto insurer Geico fell 55 percent as it paid out more to cover claims, causing it to increase premium rates.Jeff Hull, senior financial adviser at Manulife Securities Inc in Toronto, said Geico is facing pressures from rivals that are slashing prices. ""I would like to see it a bit stronger,"" said Hull, who owns Berkshire shares. ""Overall the company is still doing okay."" Meanwhile, the General Re reinsurer lost money from underwriting, as it struggled with price competition, higher claims and currency losses in its international operations.ENERGY RESULTS WEAKEN Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit that Berkshire owns most of, saw profit fall 7 percent to $421 million, reflecting lower revenues from natural gas operations.Berkshire also has dozens of smaller businesses that sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim's jewelry, Brooks athletic shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies.The company ended the quarter with $63.71 billion of cash, enough to fund one or more giant acquisitions.It will own a roughly 27 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co after H.J. Heinz Co, now owned by Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, buys Kraft Foods Group Inc , combining Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Velveeta and other brands under one roof.Major stock holdings, meanwhile, include American Express Co , Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up $2,400 at $215,800, and its Class B shares rose $2.15 to $143.36.The shares are about 6 percent below their record highs set last Dec. 8. Berkshire's market value is roughly $355 billion, ranking fifth among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

Warren Buffett on Saturday denied that he had any anti-union agenda, as the NetJets luxury aviation unit of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc tries to end roughly two years of contentious contract talks with its pilots.Buffett spoke at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, as some NetJets pilots picketed outside.The NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots, which represents more than 2,700 of those pilots, is resisting what they call NetJets' efforts to cut its budget, reduce jobs, and obtain concessions on health care, job security and work rules.""We have no anti-union agenda whatsoever,"" said Buffett, who has flown on NetJets planes for 20 years. ""It's perfectly understandable that employers and employees have some differences from time to time. We'll get it worked out, but that doesn't necessarily comes in a day or a week or a month."" NetJets specializes in ""fractional"" aircraft ownership, which lets individuals and companies buy shares of private jets, enabling them to travel on short notice with greater privacy than on commercial aircraft.The pilots group in December sued NetJets, accusing it of baiting pilots through bogus postings on Twitter to conduct work slowdowns for which they could be fired, and publishing photos of pilots engaged in lawful picketing.NetJets has denied wrongdoing. While it has returned to profitability after a $711 million loss in 2009, it has said it must be better prepared for economic slowdowns. Buffett said he had recalled only three businesses in his 50 years at Berkshire where there were strikes, including at See's Candies.He also rejected the idea it was a mistake for Berkshire to buy NetJets, for which it paid $725 million in 1998. ""NetJets is a very decent business,"" he said. ""We have very professional pilots, and we have at the moment have a difference of opinion about the contract, and that will get settled.""The NetJets pilots' lawsuit is in Columbus, Ohio, where the company has operations.

""I do not think Berkshire comes within miles of qualifying as a SIFI.""The SIFI designation forces companies to submit to Federal Reserve oversight, and could make them adopt tighter capital and liquidity requirements that could impede growth and profitability.Buffett and his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, were fielding questions at the annual shareholder meeting. Buffett was responding to a question about how the SIFI designation would affect Berkshire. The focus on Berkshire's size has grown over the years as Berkshire has amassed more than 80 businesses, including capital-intensive businesses such as the Burlington Northern railroad, and units that insure against major catastrophes.Those catastrophes can be costly, and both the September 11  attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon as well as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost Berkshire billions of dollars. Buffett, however, has pledged to maintain a $20 billion cash cushion at Berkshire - it has $63.7 billion now - to protect against such problems.Moreover, Berkshire gained a reputation during the global financial crisis as a source of liquidity, investing in companies as diverse as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, General Electric Co and motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc. Other companies with big insurance operations that have the SIFI moniker include American International Group Inc, MetLife Inc and Prudential Financial Inc. MetLife is suing to reverse that designation.

Rose, considered by some a potential Berkshire CEO candidate, was not mentioned by Buffett in his annual letter, which led some to believe his standing had been lowered.Other potential CEO candidates include insurance executive Ajit Jain, whose decision to join Berkshire three decades ago was hailed by Buffett as one of the ""luckiest"" events he experienced, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy chief Gregory Abel, who talked at the meeting about renewable energy.

293,"   By Luciana Lopez | OMAHA, Neb.  OMAHA, Neb. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his Clayton Homes unit against accusations that the manufactured home seller had preyed on lower-income purchasers with its lending practices.""I make no apologies whatsoever about Clayton's lending terms,"" said Buffett, speaking at the annual meeting of his sprawling Berkshire Hathaway Inc conglomerate. The meeting was expected to draw upwards of 40,000 people.The Seattle Times and the Center for Public Integrity in April published a report suggesting that Clayton Homes traps buyers with high interest rates, leaving them with unaffordable loans on depreciating homes.But Buffett said that because many of Clayton's buyers posed higher risks, charging them higher interest rates was justified. ""It's true that manufactured housing hits the lower end of the market,"" he said. The main question is whether a company can make sensible loans to people so that they can continue making those payments and keep their houses, Buffett added. In that regard, Clayton has been ""exemplary,"" he said.It is equally important, said Buffett, that Clayton shared the risk with buyers because the manufactured home maker and finance company keeps ownership of the loans it originates. ""If we make a mistake, it hurts them and it hurts us, and that is a very unusual arrangement in the financial industry.""He listed the main causes of default as job loss, divorce and death. ""That happens with high-priced houses as well,"" he said. ""It happens more often with people who are living closer to the edge, but I don't think that's a reason to deny them a house.""Clayton is one of more than 80 companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which also counts Geico insurance [BRKGE.UL], Dairy Queen and the BNSF railroad [BNISF.UL] among its holdings.

Especially when he is the show.That show grew bigger as more than 40,000 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders poured into Omaha this weekend to celebrate his 50th anniversary running the company, at what the world's third-richest person calls Woodstock for Capitalists.Buffett and his chief lieutenant Charlie Munger answered their five hours of shareholder and investor questions at the annual meeting in the downtown CenturyLink arena, from a stage where they downed Coca-Cola and munched on peanut brittle from See's.But there's more to do than just attend the main meeting. Many get together with other shareholders. It's a time to shop, which Buffett would prefer be done with some of Berkshire's more than 80 businesses. It's a time to eat. And for some wanting good seats at the meeting, it's a time to be sleep-deprived. Really sleep-deprived.Kyle Cleeton, an investment research analyst, said he got to the arena at 10 p.m. Friday night, nine hours before doors opened. ""I wanted to be first in line,"" he said.Thousands more spent Friday night across town, where Berkshire commandeers a shopping center housing its Borsheim's jewelry store and pitches a big outdoor tent, band included. Shareholders ate meatballs, sausage, chicken teriyaki, carved roast beef, and cheese cubes - Buffett food, reflecting his taste for the uncomplicated. All free.Many shareholders took photos of management consultant Rick Murray of Birmingham, Michigan, his three chihuahuas in tow in a stomach pouch.""I've been a shareholder for 20 years, and this is my first trip,"" he said. ""I had met a client, and he said, 'You know, Omaha is not that far from Michigan.'""Saturday began with a mini-parade featuring two Texas longhorn steers, and a stagecoach from Wells Fargo. Inside the arena, Berkshire businesses hawked their wares. The blinding yellow men's ""Berky"" boxer shorts from Fruit of the Loom flew off the racks at $6 apiece. Kirby's pet stain and odor remover, priced at just $5, drew less interest.Meanwhile, Dairy Queen sold out its 26,500 ice cream bars, Mini Blizzards and cake slices. Buffett paid $1 for his 7:15 a.m. ice cream fix, just before joining Microsoft co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates in a newspaper tossing contest.That entails shareholders competing to see who can toss copies of Berkshire-owned newspapers closer to a target than Buffett.

It featured a spoof championship boxing match, directed by John Landis of ""Trading Places,"" between welterweight champ Floyd Mayweather Jr and ""Berkshire Bomber"" Buffett, who trained by running an adding machine and once in the ring stuffed his face with See's candies instead of a mouthpiece.

301,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | OMAHA, Neb.  OMAHA, Neb. Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday celebrated Warren Buffett's 50th anniversary running the conglomerate, as the billionaire expressed optimism the company would thrive over the long haul, even after he is gone.Buffett and his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, fielded five hours of questions from shareholders, analysts and journalists at Berkshire's annual meeting, including some that criticized the business practices of firms that Berkshire owns or works with, such as Brazil's 3G Capital.The meeting had a more festive air this year, with one of the more than 40,000 people who attended shouting out ""Warren and Charlie, we love you"" at the start of the main event of what Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""""It's not Disneyland, it's Warrenland,"" said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners Inc.Berkshire holds more than 80 companies including the Burlington Northern railroad, Geico car insurance, Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and See's candies, and owns more than $115 billion of stocks.Its breadth and depth, which includes $63.7 billion of cash, has given Berkshire a strong balance sheet that Buffett said will help it thrive should the economy, propped up by low interest rates that many expect to rise soon, heads south.""We will be very willing to act if economic turbulence of any kind occurs, and will be prepared, and most people won't be,"" he said. He denied that Berkshire needed special regulatory oversight by possibly having become too big to fail.SUCCESSION Buffett gave no hints about who would succeed him. He also alluded in one answer to his writing another of his popular letters to shareholders next February, suggesting no intention to leave soon.Yet he said he would not want someone whose sole background is in investments to become chief executive. ""I would not want to put someone in charge of Berkshire with only investing experience and not any operational experience."" Buffett also offered ringing praise for the turnaround at Burlington Northern, Berkshire's largest noninsurance unit, which was plagued last year by service delays.""The improvement has been huge, and I want to thank Matt Rose and Carl Ice for their really extraordinary performance,"" he said, referring to the railroad's executive chairman and chief executive. Rose, considered by some a potential Berkshire CEO candidate, was not mentioned by Buffett in his annual letter, which led some to believe his standing had been lowered.Other potential CEO candidates include insurance executive Ajit Jain, whose decision to join Berkshire three decades ago was hailed by Buffett as one of the ""luckiest"" events he experienced, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy chief Gregory Abel, who talked at the meeting about renewable energy. He was the only person other than Buffett and Munger to field a question.Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management LLC in New York, said having a CEO with an operational background ""makes sense since the CEO needs to work with the investment team and understand their use of capital for investments, versus using the capital for investing in acquisitions.""3G DEFENDED As is usually the case, no major controversy has been hanging over Berkshire. But Buffett did get two questions that led him to praise 3G Capital, which critics say ruthlessly cuts jobs at companies it acquires. In 2013, Berkshire and 3G bought H.J. Heinz Co, which is now buying Kraft Foods Group Inc.""The 3G people have been successful in building marvelous businesses,"" Buffett said. ""I don't know of any company that has a policy that says we're going to have a lot more people than they need.""Buffett also defended Berkshire's Clayton Homes manufactured homes unit, which was criticized in a recent Seattle Times article for predatory sales practices that can trap low-income borrowers in homes they cannot afford. ""I make no apologies whatsoever for Clayton's lending terms,"" he said, adding that Clayton itself faces losses when borrowers default.Buffett also said he expects a contentious contract dispute between Berkshire's luxury aircraft unit NetJets and its pilots to be resolved, and said he had ""no anti-union agenda whatsoever."" Some of the pilots picketed outside the meeting.Addressing a question about Berkshire's stakes in companies including Coca-Cola Co that sell highly sugared products, Buffett said companies can change as consumer tastes evolve.Alluding to his own well-publicized fondness for junk food, he said: ""If I had been eating broccoli and Brussels sprouts all my life, I don't think I would live as long."" Buffett also said the euro currency ""can and probably should survive,"" but that ""real changes"" would probably be required.Munger, for his part, said European leaders created a ""flawed system"" that was ""probably unwise"" by letting countries that were too weak adopt the currency.DEVOTEES LINED UP EARLY Berkshire's annual meeting is Omaha's top annual draw other than baseball's College World Series - reflected in hotel rooms that can fetch more than $400 a night and that often sell out nearly a year in advance.Devoted and sleep-deprived shareholders began lining up outside the venue hours before doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT.Kyle Cleeton, a research analyst for an investment firm, may have gotten there first, saying he showed up at 10 p.m. the night before.""I wanted to be first in line,"" he said. ""You're not sure how many more years you're going to have.""Bill Guenther, a state forester from Brattleboro, Vermont, said, ""I'm one who likes a good seat."" He arrived at 1:04 a.m. despite having last year suffered a major foot injury when he collided with another shareholder as he tried to get that good seat.""My girlfriend said, 'You're not going to do this again,' and I said, 'I have to, it's the 50th year.'""

305,"   By Jonathan Stempel  May 4 DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, one of the largest U.S. kidney dialysis providers, said it agreed to pay $450 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit accusing it of deliberately wasting medicines in order to receive higher Medicare payments.The lawsuit alleged that DaVita, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, used larger-than-necessary medicine vials or unnecessarily spread medicine dosages across multiple treatments, knowing that Medicare would pay for what it considered ""unavoidable"" waste.An agreement in principle to settle was disclosed in an April 16 filing with the U.S. federal court in Atlanta.DaVita made the terms public on Monday, when it reported a first-quarter loss that reflected a $298 million after-tax charge for the settlement. The Denver-based company set aside $495 million for the accord, including $45 million for legal fees and costs. ""Although we believe strongly in the merits of our case, we decided it was in our stakeholders' best interests to resolve it,"" DaVita Chief Legal Officer Kim Rivera said in a statement. ""The potential mandatory penalties for being found in the wrong in even a small percentage of instances were simply too large.""The named plaintiffs were Alon Vainer, a nephrologist who has worked in dialysis clinics in Georgia, and Daniel Barbir, a registered nurse from that state. Their lawsuit brought under the federal False Claims Act began in October 2007. It was unsealed in July 2011 after the U.S. Department of Justice decided not to join it, often a sign it believes the case is not strong enough.In separate emails, L. Lin Wood and Marlan Wilbanks, lawyers for the plaintiffs, said their clients were pleased, and that they believed the settlement is a record for a whistleblower case that lacked government support. ""Dr. Vainer and Nurse Barbir exhibited great courage and determination"" in pursuing the case, whose result ""primarily benefits the taxpayers of the United States,"" Wood said.DaVita posted a first-quarter loss of $110.6 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $183.3 million, or 85 cents. Excluding the settlement, profit was 86 cents per share, matching analyst forecasts according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

As in past years, this year's winner and up to seven friends will have a private lunch with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan.The auctions began in 2000 after Buffett was introduced to Glide by his first wife, Susan, who died in 2004. Glide was co-founded by the Rev. Cecil Williams, a community leader and longtime pastor at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco's Tenderloin district. ""Glide helped me understand just how much a life can be transformed by unconditional love and some real material help,"" Buffett said in a statement provided by Glide. Buffett is worth about $71.8 billion, ranking third worldwide, Forbes magazine said on Tuesday. He has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for 50 years.

310,"  (Adds details on PrecisionHawk)By David MorganWASHINGTON May 6 The Federal Aviation Administration said it would work with two private U.S. companies to test commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's line of sight, a precursor to sophisticated drone operations such as package delivery.The separate partnerships, with drone maker PrecisionHawk and BNSF Railway Co, a railroad operator owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, are a potential milestone in developing unmanned aircraft for a variety of business applications.The U.S. aviation regulator also announced on Wednesday a partnership with cable television news network CNN to test news gathering in urban areas that have been largely off limits for commercial drones.The FAA has been under intense pressure from industry and Congress to allow beyond-line-of-sight operations. It has heard from companies ranging from Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc, which are developing drones that can deliver packages, to energy and agriculture firms that want to use the devices for inspecting crops or pipelines. Reuters first reported last week that the FAA is in talks with drone manufacturers and operators about testing beyond-line-of-sight drone systems, and an announcement is expected as soon as this week.""We anticipate receiving valuable data from each of these trials that could result in FAA-approved operations in the next few years,"" said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, who announced the partnerships at a drone industry convention in Atlanta. ""Integrating unmanned aircraft into our airspace is a big job, and it's one the FAA is determined to get right,"" he said in comments released by the agency in Washington.The agency proposed rules in February that would lift a near-ban on companies using drones as part of their business operations. The FAA has also been granting permission for commercial drone use on a case-by-case basis since last September.In both cases, regulators have insisted that drones fly within an operator's line of sight for safety reasons - restrictions that would not allow for advanced operations such as package delivery services championed by Amazon. Beyond-line-of-sight operations use on-board cameras to enable an operator to change course to avoid aircraft and other obstacles.The partnerships with industry could raise the odds that beyond-line-of-sight technology will ultimately be accepted by new commercial drone regulations that the FAA is working to finalize within the next two years.Under its FAA partnership, Raleigh, North Carolina-based PrecisionHawk will test its low-altitude tracking and avoidance system for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) on farmlands.PrecisionHawk said it would provide the FAA with data to help the agency develop regulations around UAS. The company's UAS framework accommodates various fixed-wing and multi-rotor drones for agriculture, forestry and other rural industries.

314,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA-' Issuer Default  Rating of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) and the 'AA+' Insurer Financial  Strength Ratings on BRK's key insurance subsidiaries.  The Rating Outlook is  Stable.  A complete list of ratings and rating actions is shown at the end of  this release.    KEY RATING DRIVERS: Fitch's ratings for BRK are supported by extremely strong capitalization and  market position of its insurance subsidiaries, solid operating performance with  good diversification across business lines, and excellent financial flexibility  and liquidity.   Also considered in the ratings are material equity market risk, insured natural  catastrophe exposures, growing exposure to asbestos and environmental risk and  various issues associated with the company's acquisition strategy.   BRK's 'Large' market position in the property/casualty insurance sector, with  annual premiums in excess of $42 billion and combined statutory surplus of  approximately $130 billion are consistent with Fitch's 'AA' IFS rating category. The capitalization of BRK's insurance operations is considered 'Extremely  Strong' measured by Fitch's Prism capital model and is heavily weighted in the  company's current rating. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 25.6% as of March 31, 2015. This  ratio includes nearly $57 billion of debt attributable to BRK's Railroad,  Utilities and Energy business. Fitch expects these major non-insurance  businesses will service their own debt.  An alternate calculation of BRK's financial leverage ratio, using holding  company debt and debt issued by the finance operations and guaranteed by BRK,  was 14.9% at March 31, 2015. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance  operations at a low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance  operations and also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by  BRK. Consolidated interest coverage for the first quarter of 2015 (1Q15) was 8.1x  excluding realized investment gains, which is below Fitch's expectations of 12x  for companies at BRK's rating level. An alternate calculation of interest  coverage, excluding railroad, utilities and energy, was 17.2x during the first  three months of 2015 and is consistent with the current rating category.  BRK reported net income of $5.2 billion for the first three months of 2015, up  from $4.7 billion in the comparable period of 2014.  BRK's insurance group  reported $1.8 billion in earnings before tax in 1Q15, accounting for nearly 30%  of BRK's $6.3 billion in pre-tax earnings allocated to operating segments.   Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad operation continues to make  significant contributions to earnings.  BNSF reported a pretax gain of $1.7  billion for the first three months of 2015, up materially from $1.2 billion in  the comparable period in 2014. BNSF's profitability will likely be squeezed as  the company plans to spend $6 billion or more than one-quarter of estimated  revenues on plant and equipment during 2015.  BRK's annualized return on equity was 8.6% for 1Q15, excluding unrealized gains  on fixed income securities, which was level with the full-year 2014 results.   BRK's GAAP basis earnings will continue to be exposed to earnings volatility  given the large notional values and long duration of BRK's outstanding  derivative contracts. Additionally, Fitch believes that BRK's earnings will be  exposed to potential volatility from the company's reinsurance businesses and  its exposure to catastrophe-related losses as well as the company's large equity  investment portfolio. BRK has grown its asbestos & environmental insured liability exposure over the  past several years to $14.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.  Most of this  liability, $12.7 billion, was added through retroactive reinsurance contracts,  most notably with Equitas Limited, Swiss Re, CNA Financial Corp, AIG and Liberty  Mutual. In 2014, a reserve strengthening in retroactive reinsurance policies  generated an underwriting loss of $905 million, worsening from a $321 million  loss in 2013. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating.  Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization,  a total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage  (excluding affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction  in underwriting profits.   --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its in its  equity index put derivative portfolio.    --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.      Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the holding  company, insurance, and finance operations.  Fitch believes that this would  likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

315,"  (Adds quotes about brakes mandate affecting capacity)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON May 15 BNSF Railway Co this week told customers it had dropped a plan announced last year to buy 5,000 stronger crude oil tank cars after customers were concerned about the company moving into railcar ownership.The letter from the company, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, went out a week and a half after the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled new standards for rail cars that carry crude and ethanol, along with new operational rules.""We do have concerns that additional provisions of the DOT rule will remove capacity from our network, particularly the electronically controlled pneumatic brakes mandate,"" the company said. BNSF spokeswoman Roxanne Butler confirmed the information in the company letter to customers.Three BNSF crude trains that have crashed or derailed and caught fire since late 2013 - the latest just last week - are part of a spate of such fiery accidents that focused attention on safety. Under the new rules, all new cars built after Oct. 1 this year must have 9/16-inch hulls - thicker than the industry standard of 7/16-inches adopted in 2011 - and other reinforcements to protect against punctures and leaks in a derailment.The 7/16-inch cars can be retrofitted with protections for top and bottom fittings, steel shields on the front and back and ""jackets,"" or an extra layer of steel around the hull, on a staggered schedule depending on how strong they are now. The industry largely expected rules for thicker steel and other reinforcements, but the brake issue has prompted opposition. The American Petroleum Institute is challenging that provision. {ID:nL1N0Y403E]In its letter, BNSF advised customers who buy new rail cars to include structures that allow enhanced brakes to be added at a later date ""while the industry continues to work through these issues.""BNSF in February last year asked railcar manufacturers to submit proposals to build a stronger car than the 2011 standard, just three months after a BNSF crude train hit a derailed grain railcar in North Dakota, causing a fire that lasted several days. The move was unusual, as railroads generally own just the tracks and locomotives, while shippers or railcar leasing companies own the cars.But BNSF's letter said that in later conversations with shippers, ""BNSF owning or leasing tank cars was not viewed as useful,"" so the company scrapped the idea.

321,"   By Jonathan Stempel  NetJets Inc, the luxury aviation unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said on Monday Jordan Hansell is stepping down as chairman and chief executive, in the midst of a bitter two-year contract dispute with its pilots.Hansell, 44, had been chief executive since 2011, two years after joining Columbus, Ohio-based NetJets as general counsel.Adam Johnson, also 44, was promoted to chairman and chief executive, effective immediately, from the role of president.NetJets also said Bill Noe, 50, rejoined as president and chief operating officer, a position he held before leaving a few months ago for General Electric Co.It was not immediately clear why Hansell left. A NetJets spokeswoman declined to comment.

322,"   By Jonathan Stempel | June 1  June 1 An online auction for the right to dine with billionaire investor Warren Buffett and raise money for a San Francisco charity has started strongly, with the top bid surpassing $1 million in less than a day.Buffett has raised $17.8 million in 15 prior annual auctions for Glide, a charity in San Francisco's Tenderloin district that provides food, health care, rehabilitation and other services for the poor and homeless.As of 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) Monday, the top bid was $1,000,100 in the eBay auction, which ends at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday (0230 GMT Saturday).That bid matches the seventh-highest amount ever paid, which occurred in 2013, and may go higher because bids often soar in the last hour. The auction began Sunday night, with a $25,000 minimum bid.""We're very happy, very happy,"" the Rev. Cecil Williams, the co-founder of Glide, said in a phone interview. ""We expect the bidding to take off, but $1 million coming this early is somewhat surprising."" This year's winner can bring up to seven friends to dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan.Some past winners chose to dine at a steakhouse in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Last year's winner, Andy Chua of Singapore, bid $2,166,766. The record bid, in 2012, was $3,456,789, submitted anonymously. One winner, Ted Weschler, ended up working for Buffett as a Berkshire portfolio manager after paying a combined $5.25 million to win the 2010 and 2011 auctions.The auctions began in 2000 after Buffett was introduced to Glide by his first wife, Susan, who died in 2004. ""Nobody who's donated to Glide has ever felt short-changed,"" Buffett said in a statement last month.Williams, a community leader and pastor at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said he visited Buffett two weeks ago in Omaha to discuss Glide's work.""We want to empower our people and find resources to help us pull this off, and touch the lives of people who are hurting most,"" Williams said.Buffett's involvement helps, he added. ""When Buffett speaks, people listen,"" Williams said. ""He is a man of deep conviction.""Buffett is worth about $70.4 billion, making him the world's fourth richest person, Forbes magazine said on Monday.

329,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 18 (Fitch) In a new special report, Fitch Ratings reviews the  recent meaningful expansion by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (BRK) into the U.S.  commercial lines insurance market. BRK is well known as one of the largest  property/casualty insurers in the U.S. with operating franchises in reinsurance  written through National Indemnity Company and General Reinsurance Corporation,  and private passenger automobile insurance written through GEICO Corporation. BRK has also quietly expanded to become the 10th largest U.S. commercial lines  insurer based on 2014 direct premium volume. Fitch's report explores the source  of BRK's premium growth, recent underwriting experience of new business, and the  sustainability and credit implications of this growth. Business expansion over the past five years has been significant with commercial  lines direct premium expanding by 125% to $5.6 billion through organic growth  and targeted acquisitions. Workers compensation insurance has been a key driver  of this growth and BRK is now the seventh largest U.S. writer based on 2014  direct written premiums. BRK's commercial lines operations include several separate and distinct  underwriting platforms. The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies segment  experienced the most significant recent growth, evolving from a regional  organization that offers various coverages to smaller businesses into a  nationwide organization that wrote over $1 billion in direct premiums in 2014. Diverse commercial business segments and substantial capital resources position  BRK for further market share growth that could marginalize smaller commercial  lines underwriters that have less favorable market position. The 2013 formation  of Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (BHSI) created a vehicle for further  commercial lines expansion adding underwriting capability in a number of product  lines, including: excess and surplus (E&S) lines, commercial property and  professional liability insurance. BRK's commercial lines' underwriting results have consistently outperformed the  property/casualty industry and most peers and loss reserve experience is  historically favorable. Maintaining underwriting profitability with a greatly  expanded premium base in a competitive market environment may provide future  challenges. Contact: James B.

334,"   By Jonathan Stempel  News Corp (NWSA.O) has been ordered by a Manhattan federal judge to face a class action lawsuit accusing it of monopolizing the market for in-store promotions at some 52,500 retail stores across the United States.U.S. District Judge William Pauley said consumer packaged goods companies such as Dial Corp, H.J. Heinz Co [HJHC.UL] and Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] may pursue their antitrust claims as a group, potentially boosting overall damages.News Corp spokeswoman Laura Adams said the company, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is reviewing Thursday's decision.The litigation is part of a long-running battle over News Corp's marketing operations.In January 2010, the New York-based company agreed to pay $500 million to end rival Valassis Communications Inc's [VCII.UL] antitrust lawsuit over the newspaper coupon market.News Corp has an estimated 80 percent of the U.S. market for in-store promotion services, where it acts as a middleman to help companies promote goods through coupon dispensers, electronic signs, end-of-aisle displays and shopping cart ads. The plaintiffs said News Corp has monopolized this market since 2004 by locking up exclusive long-term contracts with retailers.They said this anticompetitive conduct has forced them to pay artificially high prices to promote such goods as Dial-brand soap, Heinz ketchup and Smithfield's Eckrich hot dogs.In certifying a class action from April 5, 2008, to the present, Pauley rejected News Corp's arguments that damages would be too hard to measure. He noted that the plaintiffs' damages expert estimated overcharges of 31 percent to 43 percent in the 2008-13 period.The judge also said ""central questions regarding liability"" for alleged supra-competitive prices were ""susceptible to common proof"" that could be addressed in a single trial.John Briody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment.

337,"  WASHINGTON DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc, the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, has agreed to pay $450 million to resolve claims that it violated the False Claims Act, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.It said the Denver-based company, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, knowingly created unnecessary waste in administering the drugs Zemplar and Venofer to dialysis patients, and then billed the federal government.

348,"  (Adds details about donations, Buffett stake)By Jonathan StempelJuly 6 Warren Buffett on Monday donated about $2.84 billion of Berkshire Hathaway Inc stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities, as part of the billionaire's plan to give away nearly all of his wealth.The 10th annual donation, Buffett's largest, comprised 20.64 million Class ""B"" shares of Berkshire, and increased Buffett's total contributions to the charities to more than $21.5 billion.The Gates Foundation, which focuses on improving education and health and reducing poverty, received about 15.76 million shares, or 76 percent of the total donated. Also receiving donations were the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett's late first wife, and the Howard G. Buffett, Sherwood and NoVo Foundations, respectively overseen by his children Howard, Susan and Peter.Buffett, 84, still owns 18.8 percent of Berkshire's stock. Forbes magazine on Monday estimated that would give him a net worth exceeding $64 billion, ranking fourth worldwide. Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp co-founder, ranked first, at $78.7 billion, Forbes said after U.S. markets closed. Gates is also a Berkshire director, and a close friend and bridge partner of Buffett's.Most of Buffett's holdings are in Class ""A"" stock, which gives him 32.9 percent of Berkshire's voting power. Buffett typically makes his donations in July, reducing the number of shares by 5 percent from the prior year.

349,"   By Jonathan Stempel | July 6  July 6 Warren Buffett on Monday donated about $2.84 billion of Berkshire Hathaway Inc stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities, as part of the billionaire's plan to give away nearly all of his wealth.The 10th annual donation, Buffett's largest, comprised 20.64 million Class ""B"" shares of Berkshire, and increased Buffett's total contributions to the charities to more than $21.5 billion.The Gates Foundation, which focuses on improving education and health and reducing poverty, receives the biggest share.Also receiving donations are the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for Buffett's late first wife, and the Howard G. Buffett, Sherwood and NoVo Foundations, respectively overseen by his children Howard, Susan and Peter. Buffett, 84, still owns nearly 19 percent of Berkshire's stock. Forbes magazine on Monday estimated that would give him a net worth exceeding $64 billion, ranking fourth worldwide.Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp co-founder and Berkshire director, ranked first, at $78.8 billion. Most of Buffett's holdings are in Class ""A"" stock, which gives him about one-third of Berkshire's voting power.Buffett typically makes his donations in July, reducing the number of shares by 5 percent from the prior year.

351,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A U.S. regulator on Thursday fined Forest River Inc, the recreational vehicle unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, $5 million for waiting too long to conduct two recalls of camper trailers whose safety defects left them at risk of fire.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Forest River admitted to violating federal vehicle safety laws by mishandling the recalls of 726 Rockwood and Flagstaff camper trailers and 200 Palomino camper trailers, all of which were made in 2014, and being slow to submit required reports.Forest River could owe $30 million of additional fines if safety problems persist, according to a consent order.The Rockwood and Flagstaff vehicles contained loose wiring that could spark fires upon contact with heating elements, while the Palomino vehicles lacked an exhaust and fresh air intake vent, raising the risk of fire or carbon monoxide exposure. Forest River had told owners about the problems in service bulletins, but did not recall the vehicles until ordered by the NHTSA, the regulator said.As part of its settlement, Forest River will hire an independent monitor to oversee its safety practices, hire an in-house consultant to oversee compliance with the consent order, and adopt a set of ""best practices"" for the RV industry.In a related announcement, the NHTSA fined Spartan Motors Inc, a maker of vehicle chassis and emergency response vehicles, $1 million for being too slow to announce recalls and failing to properly report service bulletins.

353,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The North Dakota crude on a Berkshire Hathaway Inc-owned (BRKa.N) BNSF Railway Co train that derailed this week in Montana was produced by Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) and complied with regulations that limit flammability, a Statoil spokesman said on Friday.The train was bound for BP Plc's (BP.L) refinery in Washington state, sources familiar with the shipment said.Twenty-two of 106 railcars loaded with crude derailed on the westbound train Thursday evening east of Culbertson, Montana.Statoil spokesman Peter Symons said the crude was ""fully compliant"" with North Dakota regulations imposed in April that limit vapor pressure in crude before it is loaded into railcars for transport to market.The state has used vapor pressure as a proxy for measuring the amount of flammable natural gas liquids that are present in crude that can ignite in a crash. BNSF spokesman Michael Trevino said late Friday that five railcars leaked 35,000 gallons of oil, or about 1,100 barrels. There was no fire.He said repairs to the track were under way and BNSF expected to re-open it to traffic late Friday or early Saturday.He also said the railcars were of the latest design adopted by the industry in October 2011, known as CPC-1232s, and not older, less fortified DOT-111s. The U.S. Department of Transportation said late Friday that the train was loaded with crude by Savage Services in Trenton, North Dakota, and that about 35,000 gallons, or 1,100 barrels, of oil leaked.Companies like Savage take samples of crude slated for rail transport and test it to ensure it meets North Dakota's limit of 13.7 psi. Symons said Statoil's shipment met that threshold. North Dakota imposed the vapor pressure rule to lessen likelihood of a fire or explosion in a derailment after a spate of fiery crashes.DOT in May issued new rules for more fortified railcars carrying crude and ethanol for the same reason.New railcars built from October this year on must have thicker hulls and more reinforcements than CPC-1232s, but thousands of CPC-1232 cars on the rails have several years to undergo retrofits to meet the new standards.

BHF Kleinwort Benson's shares were suspended earlier on Friday at 4.66 euros.Like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Fosun is seeking to buy insurance assets to help it finance future investments. It agreed to buy German bank Hauck & Aufhaeuser Privatbankiers earlier in July. It also owns French-based holiday company Club Mediterranee and has a stake in Britain's Thomas Cook. Fosun had said earlier that its investment in BHF Kleinwort Benson would ""strengthen its comprehensive financial capabilities and to better access other business opportunities in Europe.""BHF Kleinwort Benson, previously known as RHJ International, used to have large holdings in Japanese firms and also bid in 2009 to buy carmaker Opel.

Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of March to $149,735.Net investment and derivative gains plummeted 94 percent to $123 million from $2.06 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire shed its 40-year stake in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N).The most recent quarter included losses on contracts betting on long-term gains in major stock market indexes.Accounting rules require Berkshire to report investment and derivative gains and losses with earnings.

It also makes products such as pipes and fittings for power and industrial companies.The company reported a profit of $1.53 billion on net sales of $10 billion for its fiscal year ended March 29.

366,"   By Jonathan Stempel, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Sweta Singh  Warren Buffett is paying a hefty price for the biggest bet of his career as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has agreed to buy Precision Castparts Corp (PCP.N), valuing the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion.The purchase is Berkshire's largest, and accelerates its transformation from a company largely dependent on insurance businesses into one resembling the broader U.S. economy, including a railroad, several industrial companies, utilities, a car dealership and consumer goods businesses.It also joins several recent Buffett forays into unglamorous sectors, including a big stake Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and the pending takeover of the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N).Berkshire has said it owned 3 percent of Precision Castparts prior to Monday's takeover. Precision Castparts earned $1.53 billion in its latest fiscal year.""I'm not crazy about paying $30 billion for a $1.5 billion earnings stream of a cyclical company supplying airplane makers,"" said Jeff Matthews, a principal at hedge fund Ram Partners and author of a book about Buffett. ""I'd keep the $30 billion and wait for the next crisis.""Known for buying undervalued and often unloved companies, Buffett acknowledged paying a steep price for Precision Castparts, which has been hurt by falling oil and gas prices.""This is a very high multiple for us to pay,"" he told CNBC television.Berkshire is paying $235 per share for Precision Castparts, which represents a 21.2 percent premium over Friday's closing price, and 17.5 times projected 12-month profit. It valued Precision Castparts at $37.2 billion including debt.The merger eclipses Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's $26.5 billion purchase in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad that it did not already own.In afternoon trading, Precision Castparts shares rose $37.13, or 19.2 percent, to $231.01. Berkshire's Class A shares fell $522.76, or 0.2 percent, to $214,940.'CREDIT TO TODD COMBS'   The latest purchase shows how hard it is to move the needle at Berkshire, whose own stock has lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last five years and which on Friday posted quarterly operating profit well below analyst forecasts.Adding Precision Castparts would boost Berkshire's overall operating profit by less than 10 percent.It would also give Berkshire ownership of 10 companies that standing alone could be part of the Fortune 500, plus 26.9 percent of Kraft Heinz.Todd Combs, one of Buffett's investment managers, had begun buying Precision Castparts shares in 2012.""You've got to give credit to Todd Combs for this deal,"" said Buffett, who turns 85 on August 30. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965.Precision Castparts generates 70 percent of sales by making nuts, bolts and other fittings for the aerospace industry, where booming commercial aircraft demand has led Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) to boost production. But the Portland, Oregon-based company also makes parts for the energy industry, which has struggled as oil prices LCOc1 CLc1 have fallen by more than half over the last year.Prior to Monday, Precision Castparts' shares had fallen 20 percent in 2015, and the purchase price is below the shares' 52-week high of $249.05 set last September.Even so, analysts said Berkshire is paying more than 12 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That's above the 9 multiple for BNSF, which now generates more than one-fifth of Berkshire's operating profit.""At the time of his Burlington Northern deal, everyone criticized he paid too high a price,"" said Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management in New York.MORE DEALMAKING?  Precision Castparts would become a unit of Berkshire, keeping its name and management as well as its headquarters.""We see a unique alignment between Warren's management and investment philosophy and how we manage PCC for the long term,"" Chief Executive Mark Donegan said in a statement.Andrew Carolus, managing director at Mesirow Financial Investment Banking in Chicago, said Buffett is ""obviously a believer"" in Precision Castparts' prospects ""over the next five to six decades.""Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York, added that having access to Berkshire's balance sheet could help Precision Castparts do more dealmaking, ""which the management has proven they're good at.""Other industrial companies that Buffett has bought in the last decade include toolmaker Iscar, parts maker Marmon, and specialty chemicals company Lubrizol.Buffett said Berkshire would spend $23 billion of cash to finance the Precision Castparts purchase, and borrow the rest.While that would leave Berkshire with more than $40 billion of cash, twice the cushion Buffett wants, Buffett said it would be at least a year before he could pursue another ""elephant"" sized transaction.Kraft Heinz has proven among his most successful. Buffett has in two years transformed what he has called a $9.5 billion investment in the former H.J. Heinz Co into a Kraft Heinz stake worth roughly $25.5 billion.The Castparts merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Credit Suisse and the law firms Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Stoel Rives advised Precision Castparts. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

367,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Warren Buffett’s $32.3 billion deal for Precision Castparts Corp (PCP.N) shows his willingness to overlook repeated operational stumbles at the company to place a long-term bet on the growth of global air travel.Buffett usually seeks out companies with strong leadership and earnings metrics. But Precision, a maker of aerospace and other parts, has posted lackluster results for the past year, most recently in late July when it reported an 18 percent decline in net income for its fiscal first quarter. The company blamed higher-than-expected costs to ramp up to meet demand from aircraft makers.  Shares in the company were down nearly 20 percent this year until the Berkshire bid became public, and the company had a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.44, according to Thomson Reuters data, its lowest P/E ratio since July 2010. Precision's sales to the oil and power sector - while less than a fifth of overall revenues - have also suffered in the past year amid the more than 60 percent drop in oil prices CLc1. That has put pressure on Chief Executive Mark Donegan, who has held the role for 13 years, to improve results in the company's core aircraft segment.Buffett seemed unperturbed by that recent history when talking about the deal on cable news channel CNBC.""I was very impressed by Mark, and of course I was impressed by the company,” Buffett said of meeting Donegan at Berkshire about five weeks ago. Berkshire had held a 3 percent stake in Precision.  Soon after that meeting, Buffett asked one of his investment managers, Todd Combs, to contact Precision about a bid. ""They didn't indicate they were particularly receptive, but they also indicated that they would listen,"" Buffett said. [ID: nL3N10L3ST]Berkshire's acquisition price of $235 a share represents a 21.2 percent premium over Precision's closing price on Friday.Demand for new civilian aircraft is forecast to grow over the next several years. Boeing Co (BA.N) in June forecast that 160 million more people would travel by air this year, indicating a need for 900 new aircraft. Boeing (BA.N) and its main rival, Airbus (AIR.PA), say they expect to deliver more than 1,300 new aircraft this year. Both companies are pushing suppliers to support significant increases in the production rates for their most popular planes. Roughly 70 percent of Precision's revenues in its last fiscal year came from selling blades used inside aircraft engines, bolts and other fasteners that help bind fuselages, and dozens of other products crucial to an airplane's construction and maintenance. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner aircraft relies heavily on Precision's products and technology, as do jet engines built by General Electric Co (GE.N) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L).     Most of Precision's sales are to customers in the United States, continuing a theme Buffett has outlined in the past that American industry is still worth the investment.    ""There is no obvious synergy with the rest of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Miles Walton said. ""This looks like a deal driven by the firm's thinking that they are getting a large manufacturing firm in the aerospace industry well off its highs."" One of Precision’s top 10 investors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, shares the view that the company’s business is only “momentarily depressed” given the ramp-up of production in the global airline industry.“We think that in 18 months the company would have been worth $400 per share,” the investor said, citing a price 70 percent above Berkshire's acquisition cost.“It’s a classic example of Berkshire buying a depressed asset at a great price,"" the investor said. ""The shareholders get cashed out, so they don’t get to participate in the upside.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder in Houston; Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Sweta Singh and Sagarika Jaisinghani in Bangalore; Editing by Joe White and Leslie Adler)",2015-08-10,BRKB,"Mon Aug 10, 2015 | 7:41pm EDT",Buffett bets Precision can deliver long-term as aircraft sales grow,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-precision-cast-m-a-berkshire-hatha-ai-idUSKCN0QF2D620150810?type=companyNews

Disappointing economic data in China boosted hopes for additional stimulus from Beijing, lifting Chinese stocks. Adding to investor optimism, Greece and international creditors could wrap up a multibillion-euro bailout accord by Tuesday.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway  said it would buy Precision Castparts in a deal valuing the company at $32.3 billion.

Stock futures rose further following the news.During the regular session, Twitter shares jumped 9.1 percent to $29.50 after CEO Jack Dorsey joined other insiders in buying more shares, while the company also clinched a multiyear partnership with the National Football League.On Friday, the Dow closed lower for the seventh straight session after solid U.S. jobs data for July pried the door open a little wider for a Federal Reserve rate hike in September. With U.S. interest rates near zero for almost a decade, debt has been cheap. But with the Fed widely expected to hike rates later this year, merger and acquisition activity has accelerated.July was the seventh strongest month for global deal activity since 1980. Through July, cross-border M&A activity totaled $913.5 billion, up 23 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data.""We've had a whole lot of M&A throughout the year, and that's positive because it means businesses are upbeat on the prospects for the economy,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.In other deal news, ammonia maker CVR Partners' deal to buy Rentech Nitrogen Partners for about $533 million sent Rentech soaring 28.6 percent to close at $13.25 while CVR shares were down 2.9 percent at $10.38.On the NYSE, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 2,329 to 734 for a 3.17-to-1 ratio on the upside.

379,"   By Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Growing pension obligations at Precision Castparts Corp (PCP.N), which Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to buy for $32 billion, highlight an issue that large U.S. corporations still face, almost a decade into a low-interest rate environment. Berkshire's boss, Warren Buffett, has himself highlighted rising pension cost as an area of concern for the American economy. Back in 2007, Buffett said in a letter to shareholders that S&P 500 companies should not expect above-average returns on their pension investments, as many companies publicly assumed at the time. Obligations to retired workers pose an increasing risk to corporate bottom lines as investment returns in recent years have not consistently kept up with cost increases at most U.S. pension plans. The industrial company Berkshire bought on Monday has been no exception, but the pension issue is not enough to raise alarm for Berkshire investors.""It could raise its costs a bit, but for a company of this size, it's not significant,"" said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York. Precision Castparts' pension promises to pay $2.84 billion to its more than 10,300 participants, but was underfunded by $615 million of as of March 29, the end of its most recent fiscal year. That level of underfunding was up 61.8 percent from the prior year. PRECISION CASTPARTS' PENSION      If Precision Castparts' pension costs continue to rise quickly, they could limit the new business's ability to contribute to Berkshire's operating profit in coming years, but no one is predicting a major headwind. Still, its recent history shows how hard it can be for pension plans to meet their stated goals. Over the past five years, Precision Castparts' return on pensions came close to its projections but never quite met them, according to company filings. Its return on plan assets averaged 7.46 percent, but that performance has been uneven. It earned 10.2 percent for fiscal 2015, but just 4.5 percent the prior year.According to Precision's most recent 10K filing, it assumed a long-term return of 7.75 percent for its U.S. retirement plans and 7.25 percent for its non-U.S. plans in fiscal 2015. It expected to assume the same returns for fiscal 2016.Since Precision Castparts' fiscal 2015 returns were solid but did not keep up with obligations, its funding deficit jumped.  With stock markets flat and bond yields down so far in 2015, a 7.75 percent target could be out of reach. “We are fully compliant with PCBG funding requirements, ERISA guidelines and are mindful of our fiduciary responsibilities to the beneficiaries of the fund,” Precision said in a statement.Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ROCKY JULY FOR U.S. PENSIONS To be fair, many U.S. corporations, even Berkshire, saw the funding status of their pensions deteriorate last year due to a jump in obligations and historic low interest rates, according to a consulting firm Milliman. Companies can address underfunding by adding more cash, asking for deferrals, issuing bonds, or finding other ways to finance pensions - all of which add to risk and the cost of doing business.Pension funding deficits worsened in July among the 100 biggest U.S. corporate pensions Milliman tracks as bond yields fell on worries about Greece's debt and Chinese stock market turmoil. A sustained drop in bond yields raises the amount of cash a pension requires to ensure it meets future payouts. In its most recent regulatory filing, Precision Castparts said it plans to contribute $51 million in fiscal 2016, up from $34 million from fiscal 2015. That comes to 35 cents a share, or about a 3-percent drag on earnings-per-share for Precision Castparts, according to Thomson Reuters data.When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it would support higher bond yields, helping Precision's and other U.S. pensions to reduce their funding deficits, said Zorast Wadia, principal and consulting actuary at Milliman.

After buying Heinz in 2013 with Berkshire Hathaway, 3G cut 7,000 jobs over 18 months and closed six factories.

381,"  (James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)By James SaftAug 12 Deciding if you want to bet on Alphabet is essentially a choice on what you want to back: Sergey Brin and Larry Page or human nature.Brin and Page have changed the world and created a cash flow behemoth in Google. Human nature, on the other hand, has created every other conglomerate, which, with the possible exception of Berkshire Hathaway, have a general record of capital misallocation and underperformance.Alphabet, of course, is the new holding company Brin and Page have created, and will head, which will comprise both Google and their far-flung and growing list of other companies working on everything from longevity to contact lenses that can measure blood glucose in diabetics.This isn't so much Google, or Alphabet, becoming a conglomerate as codifying how its collection of companies and investments will be managed. The new structure offers certain advantages, freeing the co-founders to concentrate on 'moonshot' efforts while cleaning up lines should it want debt finance.None of this should be a surprise. Page and Brin have always been upfront about not managing for shareholder value maximization. And last year they created an additional class of shares, one which, as it has no voting rights, will allow them to raise capital and reward executives but lose control over the direction of the company at a slower pace.So, then, a conglomerate, with all that implies, and one with multiple share classes insulating the founders from the will of shareholders. What, as they say, could possibly go wrong? Investors in publicly traded companies have a hugely diverging set of options these days, few of them particularly satisfying from a shareholder's point of view. On the one hand you have far too many companies which are giving financial engineering, usually via share buybacks, precedence over investment in their core franchise. That's problematic because investors risk seeing that franchise hollowed out over time as manager prioritize making quarter-by-quarter increases in earnings, even illusory ones, over building.On the other hand you have the mad builders, of which Alphabet nee Google is a prime example. My reservation isn't whether the core cash flow machine Google, which produces some $20 billion annually in operating cash, is fairly priced.Instead it is who gets a shot at the fruits of those profits, and how. To want to buy Alphabet, and clearly many do, you have got to be willing to give up a lot of customary protection in exchange for access to their world-changing genius. TALE OF THE TAPE While quite a few technology companies such as Alibaba and Facebook have dual or multiple share structures, the man making the most convincing, at least to the market, argument for the conglomerate is Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is just that, and has a long record of success.Buffett stands in contrast to Brin and Page, offering discipline and patience as a capital allocator where they offer inspiration and 'moonshots'. Warren, after all, would never try to tell you that Dairy Queen will help you live to 150, only that it is a business which can be profitable over the long term if managed well.So both companies are votes on exceptionalism, Buffett's or Alphabet's. The rules which make the exceptions in conglomerates and multi-share class companies meaningful, however, are not encouraging.Conglomerates as a group trade at a structural discount to intrinsic value, a phenomenon which has gone on so long it even has a name, the 'conglomerate discount'. This discount in 2012 stood at about 10 percent, according to Boston Consulting, a bit less than the 14 percent or so average since 1990.That's because conglomerates have a poor track record of capital allocation, being prone to supporting executives' dreams of empire rather than taking a gimlet-eyed view of return on equity.A 2012 study by Institutional Shareholder Services, funded by the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, found that tightly controlled companies - especially those with multiple share classes - generally underperform over the longer term. (here)All of this is as unshocking as it gets. Human nature argues that Alphabet, and perhaps even Berkshire Hathaway, will be likely to fall prey to the same shareholder-damaging behavior that undermines the groups of which they are emblematic.Some might conceivably feel they just can't afford not to be exposed to Alphabet.I myself am glad they are doing this investing, some of which may lead to exciting or even world-changing businesses. I am gladder still they are doing it with someone else's money.  (At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

388,"  LONDON Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have climbed close to a record high this year, accelerated by a trio of multibillion-dollar deals in the U.S., Thomson Reuters data showed. The largest of these was Warren Buffet's $30 billion-plus purchase of Precision Castparts (PCP.N), announced on Monday. The takeover is the biggest by Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N).So far this year, $2.9 trillion in deals have been announced globally, only 3 percent below the $3 trillion record peak in 2007.Domestic M&A in the U.S. has reached a total of $1.4 trillion, a 62 percent increase on this time last year. Acquisitions of U.S. companies account for almost half of the total worldwide value of deals in dollars terms. In the Asia Pacific region, dealmaking is off to its best start for the year since records began, outpacing Europe for the first time and making up 23 percent of global dealmaking. But on Tuesday, the Chinese central bank devalued its currency, causing volatility across global financial markets.  It is unclear yet whether these measures, coupled with a slowdown in China, could diminish the appetite for takeovers in the region. (Reporting by Emiliano Mellino.

393,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Berkshire Hathaway Inc's $37 billion deal for aerospace supplier Precision Castparts Corp is encouraging investors to consolidate the fragmented aircraft components industry, even as Boeing Co uses its clout as the world's biggest plane maker to put a check on some deals.Berkshire chief Warren Buffett isn't alone in seeing potential for profits from rising demand for commercial aircraft. Private equity and strategic buyers have been pouring into the sector, and foreign companies such as China's AVIC and Senior PLC of the UK have recently been prowling for deals, bankers and company executives said.Potentially standing in their way, though, is Boeing, these people said. Boeing is the biggest customer of most aerospace suppliers, and is slowing some acquisitions by using its power to approve the transfer of its supply contracts from one owner to another.Boeing can act like as an unofficial regulator on aerospace mergers and acquisitions because of the ""assignability clause"" inserted in most of its contracts with suppliers. The clause allows Boeing to refuse to transfer the contracts to the new owners, giving it a de facto veto over deals.Boeing said it hasn't changed the process it uses to scrutinize mergers and acquisitions among suppliers, and that the time taken depends on the size and complexity of the deal. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who took over July 1, is continuing predecessor Jim McNerney's policy of ""de-risking.""""We have an ability to have our voice heard in the M&A process and we use that ability,"" said Kent Fisher, vice president and general manager of suppliers at Boeing Commercial Airplanes.But bankers and company owners said approvals from Boeing that used to take a couple of weeks now take much longer, putting deals at risk, with no explanation from Boeing for the delay.""Any time you have a pause in a transaction, it increases the risk that it won't get across the finish line,"" said Brian Murphy, a managing director at Meridian Capital, an investment bank based in Seattle.For example, Boeing took four months to approve the purchase of a small supplier by Liberty Hall Capital Partners, a New York private equity firm focused on aerospace and defense.LaCroix Industries, which has 45 employees and was founded in Kent, Washington, in 1977, has long supplied parts directly to Boeing for the 737, 777 and 787 jets. It earned awards from Boeing for near-perfect quality the last seven years, co-founder Philip LaCroix said.The company began talks with Liberty Hall last September, and sought Boeing's blessing in April, he said. Boeing took until July to consent, and the deal closed that month.     MAJOR SLOWDOWN ""The approvals from Boeing were the major slowdown"" and Boeing wouldn't say what was causing the delay, LaCroix said in an interview. ""That part of it was frustrating,"" he said. ""You could lose a deal over something like that, where the acquirer says, 'Hey, I'm out of this.'""Liberty Hall declined to comment. It plans to integrate LaCroix into its Irving, Texas-based Accurus Aerospace Corp subsidiary, which also supplies Boeing. LaCroix had already agreed to give Boeing 15 percent price cuts on existing contracts, starting in 2016. The alternative was slow death by losing the right to bid on future work, LaCroix said. ""Staying in business with Boeing was much preferable,"" he said, ""and still had plenty of profit for us."" Some bankers say they routinely exclude potential bidders for a company if they know those won't pass muster with Boeing, which looks at financial strength, track record and investment intentions of prospective buyers. Some also see the logic of talking with Boeing about meeting assignability requirements, and understand Boeing's need to minimize supply chain risk.""Reviewing the companies that would acquire their suppliers is part of that,"" said Jet Wales, a managing director at Moss Adams Capital in Seattle.MORE INVESTMENT, MORE RISK North American aerospace and defense deals shot up 17 percent last year and their value nearly doubled to about $12 billion, Thomson Reuters data show. Private equity buyers are involved in an increasing number of transactions, according to data from PitchBook, a Seattle firm that tracks transactions, fueling competition for choice targets.The big attraction: Boeing's eight-year backlog of commercial jet orders worth $431 billion. Investors see an assured revenue stream and have bid up the prices of supplier companies to lofty levels. Ownership changes can increase risk, however. A stumble by a key supplier can disrupt Boeing's carefully orchestrated factories and run up hefty costs.When Zodiac Aerospace of France failed to deliver premium seats earlier this year, it delayed delivery of 787s to American Airlines and hit Boeing with what analysts said were several hundred million dollars in added costs. Boeing said those estimates are overstated.Many experts expect Buffett's aerospace purchase will spur even more consolidation, and likely will prompt Boeing to look even more closely at deals that affect its suppliers.    Precision Castparts, a 60-year-old firm based in Portland, Oregon, locked up key aerospace products and production capabilities by doing its own strategic acquisitions. It is now an integral supplier of parts for commercial and military aircraft and engines.""Boeing woke up to the fact after the fact,"" said Christian Schiller, a managing director at Cascadia Capital investment bank in Seattle, referring to Precision's success in achieving vertical integration. ""They couldn't undo it, so they're making sure they can exert more control over the M&A process to make sure a PCC doesn't happen again.""He and other bankers said Boeing has a legitimate need to protect its interests and avoid the rise of another powerful supplier.""But Boeing should make it easier for the smaller deals to go forward,"" Schiller said.

394,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 30 Berkshire Hathaway Inc's  $37 billion deal for aerospace supplier Precision Castparts Corp is encouraging investors to consolidate the fragmented aircraft components industry, even as Boeing Co  uses its clout as the world's biggest plane maker to put a check on some deals.Berkshire chief Warren Buffett isn't alone in seeing potential for profits from rising demand for commercial aircraft. Private equity and strategic buyers have been pouring into the sector, and foreign companies such as China's AVIC and Senior PLC of the UK have recently been prowling for deals, bankers and company executives said.Potentially standing in their way, though, is Boeing, these people said. Boeing is the biggest customer of most aerospace suppliers, and is slowing some acquisitions by using its power to approve the transfer of its supply contracts from one owner to another.Boeing can act like as an unofficial regulator on aerospace mergers and acquisitions because of the ""assignability clause"" inserted in most of its contracts with suppliers. The clause allows Boeing to refuse to transfer the contracts to the new owners, giving it a de facto veto over deals.Boeing said it hasn't changed the process it uses to scrutinize mergers and acquisitions among suppliers, and that the time taken depends on the size and complexity of the deal. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who took over July 1, is continuing predecessor Jim McNerney's policy of ""de-risking.""""We have an ability to have our voice heard in the M&A process and we use that ability,"" said Kent Fisher, vice president and general manager of suppliers at Boeing Commercial Airplanes.But bankers and company owners said approvals from Boeing that used to take a couple of weeks now take much longer, putting deals at risk, with no explanation from Boeing for the delay.""Any time you have a pause in a transaction, it increases the risk that it won't get across the finish line,"" said Brian Murphy, a managing director at Meridian Capital, an investment bank based in Seattle.For example, Boeing took four months to approve the purchase of a small supplier by Liberty Hall Capital Partners, a New York private equity firm focused on aerospace and defense.LaCroix Industries, which has 45 employees and was founded in Kent, Washington, in 1977, has long supplied parts directly to Boeing for the 737, 777 and 787 jets. It earned awards from Boeing for near-perfect quality the last seven years, co-founder Philip LaCroix said.The company began talks with Liberty Hall last September, and sought Boeing's blessing in April, he said. Boeing took until July to consent, and the deal closed that month. MAJOR SLOWDOWN ""The approvals from Boeing were the major slowdown"" and Boeing wouldn't say what was causing the delay, LaCroix said in an interview.""That part of it was frustrating,"" he said. ""You could lose a deal over something like that, where the acquirer says, 'Hey, I'm out of this.'""Liberty Hall declined to comment. It plans to integrate LaCroix into its Irving, Texas-based Accurus Aerospace Corp subsidiary, which also supplies Boeing.LaCroix had already agreed to give Boeing 15 percent price cuts on existing contracts, starting in 2016. The alternative was slow death by losing the right to bid on future work, LaCroix said. ""Staying in business with Boeing was much preferable,"" he said, ""and still had plenty of profit for us.""Some bankers say they routinely exclude potential bidders for a company if they know those won't pass muster with Boeing, which looks at financial strength, track record and investment intentions of prospective buyers. Some also see the logic of talking with Boeing about meeting assignability requirements, and understand Boeing's need to minimize supply chain risk.""Reviewing the companies that would acquire their suppliers is part of that,"" said Jet Wales, a managing director at Moss Adams Capital in Seattle.MORE INVESTMENT, MORE RISK North American aerospace and defense deals shot up 17 percent last year and their value nearly doubled to about $12 billion, Thomson Reuters data show. Private equity buyers are involved in an increasing number of transactions, according to data from PitchBook, a Seattle firm that tracks transactions, fueling competition for choice targets. The big attraction: Boeing's eight-year backlog of commercial jet orders worth $431 billion. Investors see an assured revenue stream and have bid up the prices of supplier companies to lofty levels.Ownership changes can increase risk, however. A stumble by a key supplier can disrupt Boeing's carefully orchestrated factories and run up hefty costs.When Zodiac Aerospace of France failed to deliver premium seats earlier this year, it delayed delivery of 787s to American Airlines and hit Boeing with what analysts said were several hundred million dollars in added costs.  Boeing said those estimates are overstated.Many experts expect Buffett's aerospace purchase will spur even more consolidation, and likely will prompt Boeing to look even more closely at deals that affect its suppliers.Precision Castparts, a 60-year-old firm based in Portland, Oregon, locked up key aerospace products and production capabilities by doing its own strategic acquisitions. It is now an integral supplier of parts for commercial and military aircraft and engines.""Boeing woke up to the fact after the fact,"" said Christian Schiller, a managing director at Cascadia Capital investment bank in Seattle, referring to Precision's success in achieving vertical integration. ""They couldn't undo it, so they're making sure they can exert more control over the M&A process to make sure a PCC doesn't happen again.""He and other bankers said Boeing has a legitimate need to protect its interests and avoid the rise of another powerful supplier.""But Boeing should make it easier for the smaller deals to go forward,"" Schiller said. ""There's no need to take really hard looks at $10 million to $100 million deals.""Boeing subjects even small deals to detailed scrutiny, such as the 2013 purchase by Kidd & Co and Centerfield Capital Partners of Imaginetics Inc, then a 120-person precision machining shop in Auburn, Washington, a top supplier to Boeing.

397,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jessica DiNapoli | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Billionaire investing icon Warren Buffett said on Tuesday there are dozens of countries in which his sprawling Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) conglomerate would be interested in buying new businesses.Berkshire earlier this year agreed to acquire a German motorcycle apparel and accessories retailer - a purchase that Buffett described as an advertisement to markets that he is shopping abroad.""It was an ad. It was an ad that paid us,"" said Buffett, 85, who over the past five decades has built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the world's most valuable companies. Buffett - the world's third richest person, according to Forbes, with a fortune of $72.7 billion - is avidly followed by investors, and his opinions on companies and assets move markets globally.He spoke to Reuters in an interview while in New York for the Glide Foundation's 16th annual event charity lunch. Glide is a nonprofit in San Francisco's Tenderloin district that provides food, healthcare, rehabilitation and other services to the poor and homeless.Buffett said he is most likely to hunt for acquisition targets in big economies.""I like larger economies simply because we want to buy things of size, but there’s dozens of countries I would be delighted to buy in,"" he said. ""The price would have to be right too.""     Buffett is particularly known for acquisitions: Berkshire Hathaway now includes more than 80 companies, selling everything from ice cream to insurance.While the so-called Oracle of Omaha has consistently said he wants to keep a $20 billion cash cushion on hand, that still leaves him a significant bankroll for buying more companies.Berkshire Hathaway ended the second quarter with $66.59 billion of cash. Since then the company announced it had agreed to purchase Precision Castparts Corp (PCP.N) in a deal that values the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion.     Berkshire Hathaway also recently issued debt in euros, and Buffett said he would consider issuing more debt in the future denominated in foreign currencies. He said Berkshire Hathaway would need to have ample assets in the currency of any future bonds it issues.In politics, Buffett praised Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is vying for her party's nomination for the presidency, saying she would ""work like the dickens"" should she win the November 2016 election.Nevertheless, he did suggest that Clinton's proposal to offer tax cuts for profit-sharing firms might not be the best option.     ""To prescribe how much they (employers) pay, or how they pay it ... I don’t think that works well in the market economy,"" Buffett said.     Clinton has faced increased pressure on the left from Vermont's Bernie Sanders. While Buffett praised Sanders' campaigning skills, he has said previously that he is unlikely to vote for the progressive senator.While market economies do produce some inequality, Buffett said, he lamented that so many Americans now find themselves struggling in the world's biggest economy.To help combat poverty, Buffett called for a ""significantly"" larger earned income tax credit for lower income Americans.

398,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told CNBC on Tuesday that he added to his share stake in International Business Machines Corp in the third quarter. ""We bought it in the first quarter, and normally I wouldn't tell you this, but we bought some in the third quarter,"" Buffett told the cable television network. Buffett's Berkshire owned a more than 8 percent stake in IBM as of June 30. IBM shares, which have slumped nearly 12 percent so far in the third quarter through last Friday during broad stock market volatility, last traded up 1.9 percent at $146.42 in afternoon trading Tuesday. Buffett also said that the U.S. economy was not growing at a ""booming"" rate but remained on the path it has been on for six years of growing at a rate of 2 percent or a little better annually. He said he would ""be a little careful"" about getting too excited about quarterly statistics.Buffett made his comments after Commerce Department data in late August showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter instead of the 2.3 percent rate reported the previous month.  Buffett also said Berkshire still has ample cash after agreeing to buy Precision Castparts Corp for over $32 billion and would never hold less than $20 billion in cash.""I’ve still got money left to buy, I’ll never go below $20 billion of cash, in fact I won’t even really go very close to it,"" he said.  He said Berkshire ""might be a little less aggressive in the open market"" given the Precision Castparts deal, but added: ""I haven’t held back from doing anything because of that upcoming purchase.""Buffett, whose Berkshire owns warrants entitling it to buy 700 million Bank of America shares at $7.14 each between now and 2021, said that if he could vote on Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's title, he would vote to have him in both the CEO and chairman roles. Buffett also said Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ""has run a model campaign"" and said the 2016 Republican presidential race reminded him of ""being at an amusement park and watching all the kids in bumper cars.""""What you’re seeing is indicative of a lot of dissatisfaction in the country with Washington politicians and perhaps the media to some extent too.""

425,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The investment firm that runs the Sequoia Fund, long known for its ties to Warren Buffett, was sued by shareholders who claim it recklessly took a huge stake in embattled drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), causing more than $2 billion in losses.Investment firm Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb; portfolio managers Robert Goldfarb and David Poppe; and two directors were accused of gross negligence for letting Sequoia amass a Valeant stake that peaked at 32 percent of its portfolio in August.According to the complaint filed on Friday in a New York state court in Manhattan, this violated Sequoia's policy of not investing more than 25 percent of assets in one industry.The complaint also called it the ""antithesis"" of Sequoia's strategy of seeking investments such as Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), its second-largest holding, that represent ""value-oriented"" investing.Valeant shares have lost about two-thirds of their value since early August amid concerns about its drug pricing, merger appetite and since-severed ties to a mail-order pharmacy.Sequoia's investment ""is akin to a gambler at the race track betting more than one quarter of his net worth on a fast horse with a history of maladies and with improbably high odds,"" the complaint said. ""Just as it should come as no surprise to the gambler when the horse pulls up lame, the same holds equally true for the defendants,"" it added.Other defendants include the author Roger Lowenstein, who chairs Sequoia's board, and director Robert Swiggett.

The $6.3 billion Sequoia fund has returned an average 7.23 percent annually over 15 years, in the top percentile among peers, according to mutual fund information provider Morningstar Inc.But in 2015, the Valeant stake led to an overall 7.29 percent loss, trailing 97 percent of peers.In an Oct. 28 shareholder letter, Goldfarb and Poppe defended Valeant, saying the company ""is an aggressively-managed business that may push boundaries, but operates within the law.""The case is Epstein et al v.

427,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jan 13 Senior U.S. Democratic lawmakers asked federal regulators to investigate whether Clayton Homes, the mobile home unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc , targets minority borrowers with discriminatory lending and collection practices.A letter on Tuesday from Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, and fellow committee members Michael Capuano, Emanuel Cleaver and Keith Ellison called on the Justice Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ""pursue appropriate corrective action"" against Clayton.It followed a report last month by the Seattle Times newspaper and online BuzzFeed News accusing the largest U.S. mobile home builder of exploiting black, Latino and Native American borrowers by driving them into subprime loans they cannot afford, and harming communities by repossessing homes after borrowers default.That report also claimed that Clayton's corporate culture condones racism, including against its own workers.The representatives said the ""disturbing business model"" described in the report was ""highly problematic,"" in light of Clayton's ""uniquely broad control of the manufacture, sale and financing of manufactured homes."" Clayton did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment on the letter, which the Seattle Times reported earlier.Last month, the Maryville, Tennessee-based company ""categorically and adamantly"" denied discriminating against borrowers, and defended the practices of two lending arms, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance Inc and 21st Mortgage Corp. ""Race and ethnicity are never considered in pricing or structuring our loans,"" the company said. Clayton added that it does not tolerate discrimination against its workers.As of Sept. 30, Clayton borrowers were current on roughly 95 percent of their loans, Berkshire has said.Buffett did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a email request for comment sent to an assistant. At Berkshire's annual meeting last May, Buffett said he made ""no apologies whatsoever"" about Clayton's ""exemplary"" lending, in response to a question about an earlier Seattle Times story saying that Clayton trapped borrowers into unaffordable loans on depreciating homes.The Justice Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Berkshire bought Clayton for $1.7 billion in August 2003.The unit generates roughly 2 percent of overall pretax profit at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which owns close to 90 businesses, including the Geico auto insurer, BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream stores.

A potential merger of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd and Norfolk Southern would make it hard for No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp to survive alone and ratchet up pressure for more industry consolidation, the chairman of No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF said on Thursday.""CSX would be at an enormous (competitive) disadvantage and so there would be another step towards consolidation,"" Matt Rose told Reuters on the sidelines of the semiannual meeting of the Midwest Association of Rail Shippers.Rose reiterated that this is not the right time for mergers as ""our belief is that our customers do not want mergers to occur."" But he said if a merger of Canadian Pacific and Norfolk Southern appeared likely then BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, would bid for another railroad. Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern.Norfolk Southern has spurned the Canadian railroad's interest, setting the scene for a proxy battle. Some customers and legislators have written to the Surface Transportation Board, the regulator that would review any merger proposal, opposing the proposed deal. Rose said BNSF would not likely make a competitive bid for Norfolk Southern. Canadian Pacific has said operating synergies from a merger with Norfolk Southern would lead to savings of more than $1.8 billion. Rose said that figure is very high compared with prior rail mergers. ""I don’t know if we would ever do a competitive bid for Norfolk Southern because we don’t see $1.8 billion in natural synergies. We may (do a bid), but we think the synergy numbers are enormous."" Any deal would likely face a review from the Surface Transportation Board, which tightened guidelines for mergers following a slew of deals in the 1990s.

""The chairs get taken away pretty quick."" Rose said he has discussed the merger issue with Buffett and has his support for whatever is in the long-term interests of BNSF.""He expects me to run this company.

434,"  Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, has resumed its purchases of Phillips 66 (PSX.N) stock, and spent roughly $832 million in January to boost its stake even as the oil refiner's profit margins narrowed.According to a regulatory filing on Friday night, Berkshire paid about $198 million this week for 2.54 million Phillips 66 shares, its first purchases of the stock since Jan. 14.For all of January, Berkshire bought 10.81 million shares, giving it 72.29 million overall, or a roughly 13.7 percent stake in Houston-based Phillips 66. Those shares were worth $5.79 billion as of Friday's market close at $80.15.Phillips 66 is Berkshire's sixth-largest stock holding, regulatory filings show.On Friday, Phillips 66 said quarterly net income fell 43 percent from a year earlier to $650 million, or $1.20 per share. The decline resulted in part from lower crack spreads, or the difference between the cost of oil and the price of refined products, and asset writedowns resulting from low commodity prices.Excluding items, Phillips 66 reported profit of $1.31 per share, topping analyst forecasts. Berkshire previously invested in ConocoPhillips (COP.N), which spun off Phillips 66 in 2012.In February 2014, Berkshire swapped much of its Phillips 66 stock back to the company for a chemicals business. It began rebuilding the stake early last year. Berkshire announced the new Phillips 66 purchases a few hours after the Omaha, Nebraska-based company completed its largest acquisition, a roughly $31.7 billion purchase of industrial components maker Precision Castparts Corp.Buffett has said Berkshire would spend about $23 billion of cash on that acquisition, and finance the rest.

437,"  Nevada's utility regulator voted unanimously on Friday to require households with solar panels to move to a new, less generous rate structure, angering supporters who said existing solar owners should be able to preserve their previous rates.The new rates will be phased in over 12 years for all customers with solar panels on their rooftops. The solar industry had lobbied to have existing solar customers ""grandfathered"" under the current rates for at least 20 years. The Nevada Public Utilities Commission's move came in the wake of its decision in December to reduce the compensation solar panel owners receive when they export power they do not use back to their local utility, a policy known as net metering. The December decision sparked intense criticism by solar supporters.Opponents of net metering, which include many utilities, argue that it shifts the costs of maintaining the grid onto customers who do not have solar panels, even though solar owners also use it.NV Energy [VNEN.UL], a Nevada utility owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, proposed a variety of options for existing solar customers in its public filings, ranging from gradual changes over four years to no changes for 20 years. The commission ""gave the monopoly utility more than it asked for,"" said Lauren Randall, public policy manager for solar panel installer SunRun Inc. ""This decision is clearly unjust and unacceptable for Nevadans. We will sue to overturn the anti-solar rules, and we will win.""NV Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In documents filed earlier this week, the commission's staff said ""the subsidy has become unreasonable,"" adding that the 12-year approach would give solar owners ample time to adjust to the new rates.The December changes to net metering, the solar industry's most important support policy, prompted SunRun, SolarCity Corp and other installers to abandon operations in the state, saying the new rates meant solar would no longer be affordable to most Nevadans. Earlier this week, SolarCity blamed the Nevada decision for a weaker-than-expected first-quarter forecast.

They had closed up 66 cents at $15.62 in regular trading.It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in Kinder Morgan, though investments of this size are often not Buffett's.Nonetheless, investors often view such disclosures as a signal of where Buffett and his deputies see value.Berkshire has also been boosting its stake in Phillips 66 (PSX.N), and as of Friday had spent $1.08 billion this year on the oil refiner's stock.

439,"  (Adds details on Kinder Morgan, Phillips 66)By Jonathan StempelFeb 16 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  on Tuesday disclosed a new investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, boosting its bet on the oil industry as crude prices hover near 12-year lows.Berkshire owned about 26.53 million Kinder Morgan shares worth roughly $395.9 million at year end, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock investments.Shares of Kinder Morgan rallied in after-hours trading, rising $1.08, or 6.9 percent, to $16.70. They had closed up 66 cents at $15.62 in regular trading.It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in Kinder Morgan, though investments of this size are often not Buffett's. Nonetheless, investors often view such disclosures as a signal of where Buffett and his deputies see value.Berkshire has also been boosting its stake in Phillips 66 , and as of Friday had spent $1.08 billion this year on the oil refiner's stock.

Berkshire ended September with $66.26 billion of cash. Buffett has said he would spend $23 billion on Precision Castparts and finance the rest. He prefers keeping a large cushion for big insurance claims.Berkshire held ""triple-A"" grades from all three major U.S. credit rating agencies as recently as 2009.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up $820, or 0.4 percent, at $196,845.

449,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett will release his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders after a year when its stock price lagged the broader market by the most since 2009, adding to years of underperformance.The letter, due Saturday, is a must-read on Wall Street, filled with his thoughts on investing, life and the Omaha, Nebraska company he has run for five decades.For some, navigating the present is of primary concern, as his shares have lagged the S&P 500 for the last several years.""His underperformance is getting conspicuous. He must address it,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Investment Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, and is selling Berkshire shares short.The price of a Berkshire Class A share fell 12.5 percent in 2015, compared with a 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends, Reuters data show. That was the worst underperformance since 2009, and between 2009 and 2015, the S&P gained about 163 percent; Berkshire, just 105 percent. Berkshire looks better when measured by book value, which looks to have gained 7.2 percent in 2015, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields. But since the financial crisis, it, too, has lagged the S&P 500, based on Shields' book value estimate.     Investors will look to see if there is any change in how Buffett views partnerships with investors such as Brazil's 3G Capital, a cost-cutting specialist he teamed with on mergers creating Kraft Heinz Co and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. Buffett faced questions at 2015's meeting about 3G's tendency to cut jobs aggressively. Berkshire now owns some 90 businesses, employing roughly 360,000 employees, including the Geico auto insurer, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, and soon, Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business.Berkshire also owns dozens of stocks. But there, two big Buffett holdings, American Express Co and International Business Machines Corp have recently been dogs.Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle, said Berkshire's stock price looks ""incredibly attractive"" at close to 1.2 times book value. Buffett has said Berkshire would buy back stock at that level.    One lingering question: Who will take over in coming years, given Buffett is 85, and second-in-command Charlie Munger is 92.   Analysts expect full-year operating profit of $17.3 billion, including profit of $2,814 per share in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

450,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives.Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier.Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share.Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion.Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire's intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501.For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.Buffett's largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash.Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G shares that Berkshire now owns.Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market.Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell. Buffett said BNSF's profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire's insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments.The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments.Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31.In Friday trading, Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.

Manufactured homes are often bought by people with low credit scores and incomes.Last year, the Seattle Times published reports, prepared with the Center for Public Integrity and BuzzFeed News, that said Clayton drove black, Latino and Native American borrowers into subprime loans they could not afford, and promoted a racist corporate culture, even against its own workers.The Maryville, Tennessee-based company has ""categorically and adamantly"" denied discriminating, and said it neither uses race and ethnicity in its lending, nor tolerates discrimination against its workers.

456,"  NEW YORK Feb 27 The following are excerpts from Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc  shareholders, which was released early Saturday:ON BERKSHIRE'S YEAR ""The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to better earnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service to customers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capital expenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annual depreciation charge. It was money well spent.""ON WALL STREET AND 'PHONY' EARNINGS Buffett took corporate America chief executives to task for telling their shareholders to ignore certain expense items when calculating earnings such as stock-based compensation. ""The very name says it all: 'compensation.' If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don't belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?"" Buffett also said Wall Street has been enabling the practice. ""Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring 'earnings' figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don't know any better. Or maybe they fear losing 'access' to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is playing the game, why shouldn't they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of propagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.""ON CLIMATE CHANGE  ""It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say 'highly likely' rather than 'certain' because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most 'experts' about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100 percent proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger.""ON OIL PRICES  ""With oil at low prices, we expect that volumes in 2016 will weaken compared to 2015. Freight revenues from agricultural products in 2015 increased 2 percent to approximately $4.2 billion as compared to revenues in 2014. The increase in 2015 was attributable to higher domestic grain shipments and milo exports.""ON WEBCASTING ITS ANNUAL MEETING ""Charlie (Munger) is 92, and I am 85. If we were partners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look in occasionally to make sure we hadn't drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come to Omaha to monitor how we look and sound.""Viewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consume enough Coke, See's fudge and See's peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long ago we discovered a fundamental truth: There's nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you're really hungry - and want to stay that way.""

457,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives.Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier.Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share.Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion.Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire's intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501.For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.Buffett's largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash.Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G shares that Berkshire now owns.Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market.Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell. Buffett said BNSF's profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire's insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments.The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments.Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31.In Friday trading, Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.

458,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan  Feb 27 Warren Buffett on Saturday launched vigorous defenses of a private equity firm and a mobile home unit that critics say employ controversial business practices antithetical to Buffett's own at Berkshire Hathaway Inc .In his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he would do more deals with 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm with which Berkshire owns a majority of Kraft Heinz Co , but which, unlike Berkshire, is known as a ruthless cost-cutter.Buffett also devoted more than 1,200 words in his roughly 18,000-word letter to defending Berkshire's Clayton Homes unit,  after articles in the Seattle Times accused the nation's largest mobile home builder of predatory lending and exploiting black and Latino borrowers.Berkshire reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent from a year earlier, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion.In the fourth quarter, profit rose 32 percent to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share. Operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, topping the average analyst forecast of $2,814 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett, 85, has in nearly 51 years running Berkshire transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.His work has also made him an investing legend and the world's third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.But his tie-up with 3G, led by the Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, has attracted criticism. Last year, at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, many shareholders wanted to know if Berkshire's business principles were compatible with 3G, which has made its name as an aggressive cost-cutter that appoints its own executives and eliminates thousands of jobs at the companies it acquires.Berkshire and 3G in 2013 bought the former H.J. Heinz, and two years later merged it with the former Kraft Foods. Buffett has also helped finance 3G's merger of Burger King with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons.In his letter, Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G ""follow different paths"" toward buying and running businesses, 3G's method has been ""extraordinarily successful"", and that more deals are possible. ""Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,"" Buffett wrote. ""We share with them a passion to buy, build and hold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires.""Buffett also praised Clayton, saying that it made home ownership possible for many even during the financial crisis, and that it has to be a careful lender because it keeps the mortgage loans it makes on its books.Yet he said that in the last two years, regulators from the federal government and 25 U.S. states examined Clayton and its mortgages a total of 65 times, yet this scrutiny has led to just $38,200 of fines and $704,678 of refunds to customers.Clayton's management still delivers ""industry-leading performance,"" Buffett said.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2016-02-27,BRKB,"Sat Feb 27, 2016 | 10:56am EST","Warren Buffett defends 3G, Clayton Homes as Berkshire profit grows",http://www.reuters.com//article/berkshire-buffett-idUSL2N1660D9?type=companyNews

460,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday the firm's ownership of IBM (IBM.N) shares could prove a mistake and that he was buying more U.S. stocks overall since the end of last year.""We've owned stocks that we've lost money in,"" said Buffett, the world's third-richest person. ""If I'm wrong, you sell them out and take a big loss. We've done that on a few occasions with stocks and bonds over the years.""Berkshire, which held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of Dec. 31, 2015, said in an annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it planned to keep that stake despite a $2.6-billion paper loss at the end of last year.Buffett told the cable television network he did not think he was wrong for owning IBM shares so far, but said it ""could be"" a mistake. He said he has been wrong before, noting Berkshire's investment in troubled British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L), which he characterized as a ""huge mistake"" in 2014. ""I bought Tesco, it went down, and it kept going down, and I was wrong about the company,"" Buffett said on Monday. Berkshire no longer has a stake in the supermarket chain.Business was a bit ""softer in many places"" than he had anticipated four or five months ago, Buffett said, adding that in general, stocks would advance over time. ""We have bought more stocks since the end of the year,"" he said. He did not know what the consequences of sustained low interest rates globally would be, but they made all assets more valuable, Buffett said. Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had been surprised by the election season and ""amazed"" by Republican party developments, stating: ""This takes the cake."" Buffett criticized Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying he has ""a tendency to demonize institutions.""He weighed in on a privacy fight between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the U.S. government, saying privacy should trump security in smaller cases, but security should trump privacy in major cases.""If there is something major, something that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI would be willing to sign and go to a judge on and say, 'we need this information and we need it now,' I would be willing to trust that official,"" he said.

461,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The energy unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Monday said Gregory Abel, its chairman and chief executive, saw his compensation jump 48 percent last year to $40.77 million, reflecting a large incentive award.Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co said Abel, 53, whom many investors view as a potential successor to Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive, was awarded $28 million under a profit-sharing plan tied to the unit's earnings.Abel also received a $1 million salary and an $11.5 million bonus. His pay package was disclosed in Berkshire Hathaway Energy's annual report. Abel's compensation in 2014 was $27.58 million, including a $12 million incentive award.The 2015 package makes Abel one of the best paid among U.S. energy executives and Berkshire's 361,270 employees.It could also be a factor in his staying with Berkshire. In a letter to shareholders that fueled speculation about Abel's future, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger called Abel a ""world-leading"" performer who, in some ways, was a better businessman than Buffett.""If he's that talented, he could have a host of other, extremely lucrative opportunities outside the company,"" said Minor Myers, a Brooklyn Law School professor specializing in executive pay.""One goal of executive compensation is to retain people who have attractive alternative opportunities,"" Myers said. ""You want to keep the best people at the firm, and this may be Berkshire's way of doing it.""  Abel has been Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chief executive since 2008, and its chairman since 2011. He also sits on the board of the food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), in which Berkshire owns a 26.8 percent stake.Berkshire Hathaway Energy's profit rose 13 percent last year to $2.37 billion, helped by higher electric and natural gas revenue and the 2014 purchase of Canada's AltaLink electricity transmission business. The unit operates utilities in several U.S. states, natural gas pipelines, and Britain's Northern Powergrid. Berkshire owns 89.9 percent of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and the unit accounts for 9 percent of the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent's profit.In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday, Buffett said the unit's ""outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a utility in their jurisdiction.""Buffett's compensation is expected to be disclosed in March. His 2014 compensation totaled $464,011, including his usual $100,000 salary. Buffett is the world's third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.

462,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday the firm's ownership of IBM (IBM.N) shares could prove a mistake and that he was buying more U.S. stocks overall since the end of last year.""We've owned stocks that we've lost money in,"" said Buffett, the world's third-richest person. ""If I'm wrong, you sell them out and take a big loss. We've done that on a few occasions with stocks and bonds over the years.""Berkshire, which held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of Dec. 31, 2015, said in an annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it planned to keep that stake despite a $2.6-billion paper loss at the end of last year.Buffett told the cable television network he did not think he was wrong for owning IBM shares so far, but said it ""could be"" a mistake. He said he has been wrong before, noting Berkshire's investment in troubled British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L), which he characterized as a ""huge mistake"" in 2014. ""I bought Tesco, it went down, and it kept going down, and I was wrong about the company,"" Buffett said on Monday. Berkshire no longer has a stake in the supermarket chain.Business was a bit ""softer in many places"" than he had anticipated four or five months ago, Buffett said, adding that in general, stocks would advance over time. ""We have bought more stocks since the end of the year,"" he said. He did not know what the consequences of sustained low interest rates globally would be, but they made all assets more valuable, Buffett said. Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had been surprised by the election season and ""amazed"" by Republican party developments, stating: ""This takes the cake."" Buffett criticized Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying he has ""a tendency to demonize institutions.""He weighed in on a privacy fight between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the U.S. government, saying privacy should trump security in smaller cases, but security should trump privacy in major cases.""If there is something major, something that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI would be willing to sign and go to a judge on and say, 'we need this information and we need it now,' I would be willing to trust that official,"" he said.

479,"   By Sudarshan Varadhan  Business Wire, the press release distribution company owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, resumed services after it suffered a four-hour outage on Monday, delaying the release of many company statements including Alcoa Inc's earnings report.The disruption was due to a power outage at a third party co-location facility, Chief Operating Officer Richard Deleo said in an emailed statement.The outage was not related to a cyber attack, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Business Wire's feed went down just before the U.S. stock market closed, with the last release reaching Reuters at 3:44 p.m. ET. The feed at Reuters resumed at 07:15 p.m. ET. Business Wire's system is fully operational again, Richard Deleo, Chief Operating Officer of the company said in a statement.For most of that time, Business Wire's website carried a message that read, ""The Business Wire site is currently unavailable, but will be back shortly."" It asked users to access news releases via Yahoo Finance and other websites. Business Wire handles the press release dissemination for thousands of companies, including more than half the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Alcoa Chief Executive Klaus-Christian Kleinfeld told CNBC on Monday that the glitch at Business Wire had delayed the release of the metal company's quarterly earnings report, which marks the unofficial beginning of earnings season. Many companies such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Twitter Inc have moved away from using the services of companies such as Business Wire and its peer PR Newswire Association LLC, choosing instead to release their statements on their websites or through social media.

482,"  BEIJING, April 28 Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd  , backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, forecast on Thursday a five-fold jump in first-half net profit, citing strong demand for its electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.The Shenzhen-based company forecast a 382 percent to 425 percent rise in net profit for the first half to 2.25 billion to 2.45 billion yuan ($347.29 million-$378.16 million), according to stock exchange filings.For the first quarter, BYD reported 851 million yuan  ($131.35 million) in profit, a seven-fold increase year-on-year and in line with its forecast last month of a 495 percent to 644 percent rise. The automaker reported a similarly large rise for 2015 full-year net profit last month as overall new-energy vehicle sales in China more than quadrupled thanks to aggressive government policies including subsidies, tax incentives and more leeway in awarding license plates for green cars.That surge has carried through to this year with sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles doubling in the first quarter. The auto division of BYD, which is also a major producer of batteries for personal electronics, focuses on making electric and hybrid vehicles such as its best-selling Qin plug-in hybrid sedan. The government sees such vehicles as the domestic auto industry's best shot at closing a competitive gap with more experienced global rivals and as a method to curb pollution.Buffett's company owns 9.1 percent of BYD.

Sequoia, which at one point had more than 30 percent of its assets in Valeant, had 19 percent of its money in the drug stock as of Dec. 31.Buffett noted the money manager responsible for Sequoia's investment in Valeant, then-chief executive Robert Goldfarb, has left the fund.

489,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Trevor Hunnicutt | OMAHA, Neb.  OMAHA, Neb. Warren Buffett said on Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway Inc is poised to do well no matter who wins the White House in November, and the billionaire investor defended the performance and tactics of the conglomerate's several large investments.Buffett presided over his 51st Berkshire annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger fielded five hours of questions on such matters as Coca-Cola's sugary drinks, lower shipping volumes on the BNSF railroad, risks from derivatives, and who might succeed Buffett as chief executive.Buffett, a staunch supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, was asked about the regulatory impact on Berkshire if Republican front-runner Donald Trump wins the 2016 U.S. presidential election.""That won't be the main problem,"" he said to audience laughter. ""If either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton becomes president, and one of them is very likely to be, I think Berkshire will continue to do fine.""Because the meeting fell early this year, Berkshire also released only preliminary first-quarter results rather than full results, which will come out on May 6.Berkshire said net income probably rose 8 percent, helped by a gain from the swap of Procter & Gamble Co stock for the Duracell battery business.Operating profit probably fell 12 percent, however. Buffett said BNSF was hurt by declining oil prices and coal shipments, while hailstorms caused losses in Berkshire insurance units.""Railroad carloading throughout the industry - all of the major railroads - were down significantly in the first quarter, and probably almost certainly will continue to be down for the balance of the year,"" Buffett said.Berkshire owns close to 90 businesses in energy, insurance, manufacturing, railroad, retail and other sectors, and invests well over $100 billion in stocks. COKE IS STILL IT  The meeting filled a downtown arena and overflow rooms, and shareholders could buy products made by Berkshire units at deep discounts in an exhibit hall.Buffett suggested that 40,000 people may have shown up for his ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" close to last year's record, though the meeting was streamed online for the first time.At the meeting, Buffett and Munger fielded dozens of questions from shareholders, analysts and journalists. A shareholder proposal for more disclosures on the risks to Berkshire on climate change was overwhelmingly rejected.Buffett parried concerns raised by a shareholder, and previously by hedge fund manager William Ackman, that Berkshire promotes bad health through its roughly 9-percent stake in Coca-Cola Co.Buffett, who consumes 700 calories of Coke a day, said it seemed wrong to blame calories alone for rising obesity levels.""I elect to get my 2,600 or 2,700 calories a day from thingsthat me feel good when I eat them,"" he said, including the Cherry Coke and See's peanut brittle he consumed during the meeting. ""That's my sole test."" Buffett also renewed his defense of Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, which with Berkshire has a controlling stake in  food company Kraft Heinz Co, where it has built on its reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter.Berkshire is seen as a friendlier owner, but Buffett said 3G's cuts have been ""extremely intelligent,"" and did not appear a threat to Kraft Heinz's ability to produce packaged goods.Buffett also defended efforts of Berkshire's NV Energy unit to persuade Nevada regulators to reduce subsidies for homeowners there who use solar power, prompting Elon Musk's SolarCity Corp to say it would cease activity there.""Ninety-nine percent of our consumers were being asked to subsidize the one percent that had solar units,"" Buffett said. ""I personally think that if society is the one that's benefiting from the reduction of greenhouse gasses, that society should pick up the tab.""Buffett also emphasized his worry that derivatives could cause major risks for most of the world's largest banks if markets were disrupted.""It is still a potential time bomb,"" he said, but added that he was ""not in the least troubled"" by Berkshire's big stakes in Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp. Buffett also said Geico has been hurt because falling oil prices led to more driving, more accidents and more loss claims, but said he did not ""necessarily see the same trends this year.""He also said there are no ""tea leaves"" in the recent announcement that the next chief of the General Re reinsurance unit will report to Buffett's insurance lieutenant Ajit Jain, not to Buffett. Some investors believe Jain is a top candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive.EARLY WAKE-UP Buffett also said Mark Donegan, chief executive of Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought in January for $32 billion, may now fare even better now that his company has the support from Berkshire's deep well of capital.""I would almost rank Mark as one of a kind,"" Buffett said, before joking: ""If he needs capital, he's got my 800 number.""Shareholders at the meeting included hundreds who waited hours in a rainstorm before doors opened at 6:20 a.m., 40 minutes early.""I wanted to make sure I got a good seat,"" said Kim Baumler, an office manager for a wealth management company from Fargo, North Dakota, who said she was at the head of the line at 10:30 p.m. Friday night. ""My boss is a huge Warren Buffett follower, and I got hooked. I wanted to see what it was all about.""Mark Hughes, a money manager from Ashton, Maryland attending his 25th meeting, said he sees no sign Buffett and Munger are winding down.""They're 85 and 92, and look as good as they ever did,"" he said.

490,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday he would be more likely to buy than sell IBM shares over the next two years, and that he did not seek to profit from global central bank actions. Buffett, who presided over Berkshire's 51st annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska over the weekend, told cable television network CNBC: ""We would be much more likely to buy more in the next 12 or 24 months than we would be to sell shares, but we will make that call as time goes along.""Buffett, whose Berkshire held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of the end of last year and who has caught some flak for his stake, said his cost basis in IBM was around $170 a share and that he had still never sold a share. IBM shares fell 0.4 percent to $145.34 late Monday afternoon. Buffett also said he did not seek to profit from global central bank monetary policies, but that low and negative interest rates could produce an unanticipated reaction. ""It's a fascinating movie to watch. I don't try to make money off the movie,"" Buffett said. ""If currency in a bank is worth less than currency in your hands or in a mattress, that could produce something in the way of behavior that nobody has ever anticipated."" Buffett, whose Berkshire is an American Express shareholder, said the company's loss of its contract with retailer Costco Wholesale Corp was ""significant"" but he agreed with American Express Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault's decision to split from Costco. He said American Express would remain ""under attack"" from alternative payment methods, but he was confident in his stake. ""Costco was a very, very, very valuable co brand to have for American Express, but that value wasn’t limitless,"" he said.  Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told CNBC, however, that he would have made the opposite decision with regard to American Express's contract with Costco. Buffett also criticized companies that repurchase their own shares at too high a price: ""They have in mind a limit as to what they pay for any business they buy except their own, and it has become fashionable to repurchase shares.""Buffett, who has ordered that most of the money he is not giving away at his death should be placed in an index fund, also said active investing as a whole was ""certain"" to produce worse-than-average results.  Buffett and Munger added to previous criticisms they have made of embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's drug-price hikes. Buffett said there ""really wasn't any defense"" for Valeant's price hikes, while Munger said Valeant was ""leading the pack"" of certain industry players who were raising prices dramatically.""I don't think you'd want your son to grow up and run a company in the manner that Valeant was run,"" Buffett said. Munger said he suspected it was ""massively stupid"" for the U.S. government to rely heavily on printing money and lightly on fiscal stimulus for infrastructure, and that the United States would have been better off with more fiscal stimulus.

Dairy Queen events manager Dean Peters said those shareholders needing an ice cream fix consumed about 28,000 of its Dilly, Vanilla Orange and Fudge bars and its Mini Oreo Blizzards.Those with more to spend could buy a $9,277 pair of white gold diamond stud earrings from Borsheim's jewelry.Some vendors said numbers seemed down on in 2015, when Buffett celebrated his 50th anniversary running Berkshire.     Official attendance was not immediately known, but this year's meeting was the first to be streamed online.     This was widely cited as a reason Omaha may have attracted fewer people to the weekend of events that Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists."" Buffett said on CNBC on Monday that he thought attendance was down by 10 percent.    Among the other Berkshire businesses on show were Kirby vacuum cleaners sold through in-home demonstrations and Fruit of the Loom clothing brand, which was among the more popular items. Fruit of the Loom had to put up a barrier at one stage to stop shareholders from overwhelming staff selling its $8 neon green ""Berky Boxer"" shorts, or the bright yellow 2015 edition for just $3.    ""It's packed, incredibly packed,"" first-time attendee Steve Peters, from nearby Papillion, Nebraska, said. He and his wife Marlene had just bought a bed from Nebraska Furniture Mart and jackets from Fechheimer Brothers.    ""There are good deals,"" Marlene Peters said. Just what Buffett would want his shareholders to say.   (Reporting By Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska.

492,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday confirmed that its first-quarter profit rose 8 percent, while operating results fell short of analyst forecasts as falling oil prices and coal demand hurt its BNSF railroad unit.The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, which has close to 90 operating units, also said its book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities and Buffett's preferred gauge of growth, rose 1.2 percent from year end.Net income rose to $5.59 billion, or $3,401 per Class A share, from $5.16 billion, or $3,143 per share, a year earlier.Operating profit fell 12 percent to $3.74 billion, or $2,274 per Class A share, from $4.24 billion, or $2,583 per share.Analysts on average had expected operating profit of about $2,759 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, before Berkshire released preliminary results at its annual meeting in Omaha on April 30.Results suffered as falling oil prices and lower demand for coal contributed to a 25 percent drop in profit at BNSF to $784 million, as overall volume fell 5.5 percent.Freight revenue from industrial products such as petroleum fell 18 percent, and from coal tumbled 39 percent. Railroad carloadings industrywide fell ""significantly"" in the first quarter, and ""almost certainly will continue to be down the balance of the year,"" Buffett said at the meeting.Buffett also said insurance results suffered from payouts related to Texas hailstorms. Insurance underwriting profit fell 56 percent to $213 million despite improvement at the Geico auto insurer, which raised premiums to offset rising accident claims.""Float,"" which is the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and helps fund Berkshire's expansion, grew to about $89 billion from $87.7 billion in the quarter.Book value per share rose to $157,369 per Class A share as of March 31 from $155,501 three months earlier, while revenue rose 8 percent from a year earlier to $52.4 billion. Berkshire made two big acquisitions in the quarter.It acquired airplane parts maker Precision Castparts for about $32.1 billion, and acquired battery maker Duracell from Procter & Gamble Co in exchange for that company's stock. The swap resulted in a $1.9 billion after-tax gain.Among other businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, posted a 5 percent increase in profit to $441 million, as lower energy costs helped boost margins at its Western U.S. electric utility PacifiCorp.Berkshire also has dozens of smaller units that sell such things as Benjamin Moore paint, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See's candies. The company ended the quarter with $58.34 billion of cash, down from $71.73 billion at year end, largely because of Precision Castparts.It also owns $106.4 billion of stocks such as International Business Machines Corp, which it plans to keep despite sitting on a $1.5 billion unrealized loss as of March 31.Berkshire owns 26.8 percent of Kraft Heinz Co, and with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital has a controlling stake in the food company.Kraft Heinz on Wednesday posted a larger-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost cuts as some shoppers seek out fresher alternatives to its packaged, processed foods.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares closed up 0.5 percent at $216,999.99, and its Class B shares closed up 0.5 percent at $144.62, according to Reuters data.

Last year's winner paid $2,345,678.Auction proceeds go to Glide, a charity in San Francisco's Tenderloin district that provides food, health care and other services to people who are homeless, poor or struggling with substance abuse. Buffett has raised about $20.2 million in 16 auctions for Glide.""Mr. Buffett has been just one of the most important people in our work,"" Rev.

He is donating virtually all of his wealth to charity.The auction was created by Buffett's first wife, Susan, and continued after her 2004 death. It began on Sunday night, and will end at 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday.The winner and up to seven friends can dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan.Past winners have included David Einhorn, the Greenlight Capital hedge fund manager, and Ted Weschler, now a portfolio manager at Berkshire.Bids for the private lunch have stayed high even as Buffett's visibility has grown over the years, including the first-ever webcast of Berkshire's annual meeting in April.With a $17 million budget, Glide provides an estimated 750,000 free meals, 815,000 syringes, emergency shelter for 8,700 people, and day care and afterschool programs for 450 children each year.

508,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge in Chicago on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which wheat futures and options traders accused Kraft Heinz Co and Mondelez International Inc of illegally manipulating the grain's price at their expense.U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said traders may pursue claims that a large and, in their view, unnecessary late 2011 purchase by Kraft Foods Inc of wheat futures contracts violated the Sherman antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act.In a 66-page decision, Chang also dismissed claims that the defendants conducted offsetting ""wash trades"" over roughly a decade to create an illusion of greater market activity. He said the traders can try to bring those claims again.Kraft and Mondelez were named as defendants because most of the alleged suspicious activity occurred before Kraft Foods Inc split in two in 2012. Mondelez brands now include snack foods such as Oreos, Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins.Many of the allegations were similar to those raised by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in an April 2015 lawsuit against Kraft and Mondelez. A Kraft Heinz spokesman and a Mondelez spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision.Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the traders, said he was pleased the court found ""multiple viable claims.""The CFTC said Kraft Foods bought $90 million of December 2011 wheat futures, giving it a dominant position in that market, despite never intending to take possession of the grain.

509,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge in Chicago on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which wheat futures and options traders accused Kraft Heinz Co and Mondelez International Inc of illegally manipulating the grain's price at their expense.U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said traders may pursue claims that a large and, in their view, unnecessary late 2011 purchase by Kraft Foods Inc of wheat futures contracts violated the Sherman antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act.In a 66-page decision, Chang also dismissed claims that the defendants conducted offsetting ""wash trades"" over roughly a decade to create an illusion of greater market activity. He said the traders can try to bring those claims again.Kraft and Mondelez were named as defendants because most of the alleged suspicious activity occurred before Kraft Foods Inc split in two in 2012. Mondelez brands now include snack foods such as Oreos, Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins.Many of the allegations were similar to those raised by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in an April 2015 lawsuit against Kraft and Mondelez. A Kraft Heinz spokesman and a Mondelez spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision.Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the traders, said he was pleased the court found ""multiple viable claims.""The CFTC said Kraft Foods bought $90 million of December 2011 wheat futures, giving it a dominant position in that market, despite never intending to take possession of the grain. It said Kraft Foods did so to depress prices in the cash wheat market, because sellers might believe the company needed less wheat, and inflate futures prices. It said the strategy led to more than $5.4 million of illegal profit.Last December, another judge rejected a defense motion to  dismiss the CFTC lawsuit.Both companies have said Mondelez expects to bear most costs from that case.

519,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s  (NYSE: BRK) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-' and senior unsecured debt at  'A+'. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the 'AA+' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS)  ratings on BRK's key insurance subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A  complete list of ratings and rating actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS   Fitch's ratings on BRK continue to be supported by its diverse sources of  earnings with a history of solid profitability. Financial flexibility and  liquidity are key rating attributes and Fitch maintains a favorable view of  BRK's access to capital markets and large holdings of cash and equivalents.  BRK's insurance operations continue to be a key area of earnings and expertise  within BRK and are typified by a large market position, size and scale,  consistent underwriting profits and extremely strong capitalization. Balanced against these strengths are increasing debt levels, declining interest  coverage and general earnings volatility risk given BRK's material exposures to  equity markets, insured natural catastrophes and asbestos and environmental  retroactive reinsurance. BRK's acquisition strategy brings additional risks  including potential earnings volatility and increased financial leverage.  BRK reported net income of $5.6 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or an 8.7%  annualized return on equity, up modestly from $5.2 billion and 8.6% in the  comparable period of 2015.  The bottom line result masked weakness in earnings  from both insurance operations and Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF). The insurance operations accounted for a little more than one-quarter of BRK's  $5.7 billion in pre-tax earnings allocated to operating segments, which was the  largest contributor along with manufacturing through the first quarter of 2016.  Growth in earnings from the manufacturing segment reflects the acquisition of  Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC).   BRK's insurance group reported $1.5 billion in earnings before tax in the first  quarter of 2016, down from $1.8 billion in the comparable period in 2015.   Worsening trends in BRK's property/casualty reinsurance business were primarily  responsible for deteriorating profitability in BRK's insurance segment.  Pre-tax earnings from BNSF railroad operations deteriorated during the first  quarter of 2016 to $1.3 billion, down from $1.7 billion in the comparable  quarter of 2015 due to declines in unit volume.  Fitch expects BNSF's  profitability for the remainder of 2015 to be squeezed by lower freight volumes  attributable to a softening demand for energy related products such as oil and  coal that will be partially offset by reduced plans for capital expenditures.  BRK's GAAP basis earnings will continue to be exposed to accounting earnings  volatility given the large notional values and long duration of BRK's  outstanding derivative contracts. Additionally, Fitch believes that BRK's  earnings will be exposed to potential volatility from the company's reinsurance  businesses and its exposure to catastrophe-related losses as well as the  company's large equity investment portfolio. BRK maintained excellent financial flexibility despite a decline in cash and  equivalents to $58 billion at March 31, 2016 from $71 billion at year-end 2015  following the acquisition of PCC and additional investments in various common  stocks. At March 31, 2016, BRK's subsidiaries in aggregate had approximately  $9.2 billion in available capacity under lines of credit and commercial paper  with $4.4 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio (FLR) was 28.0% as of March 31,  2016, up from 24.6% at year-end 2015 following the PCC acquisition. The  consolidated FLR includes $58 billion of debt attributable to BRK's Railroad,  Utilities and Energy business. Fitch expects these major non-insurance  businesses will service their own debt.  An alternate calculation of BRK's financial leverage ratio, using holding  company debt and debt issued by the finance operations and guaranteed by BRK,  was 20.5% at March 31, 2016. The agency views BRK's ability to fund finance  operations at a low cost as an important competitive advantage for the finance  operations and also notes that much of the finance company debt is guaranteed by  BRK. Consolidated interest coverage for the first three months of 2016 was 5.6x,  excluding the impact from realized investment gains and derivative gains, which  is down from 8.0x for the full year 2015 and below Fitch's expectations of 12x  for companies at BRK's rating level. An alternate calculation of interest  coverage, excluding railroad, utilities and energy, was 8.3x during the first  three months of 2016. The deterioration in the interest coverage ratio is  attributable to additional debt from the PCC acquisition. Following the acquisition of PCC, BRK is approaching Fitch's tolerances on  financial leverage and interest coverage. Consequently, another material  acquisition similarly or more aggressively financed than the PCC acquisition  would place downward pressure on BRK's ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio.   --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.    Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations.

526,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), has become the world's third-richest person as of the market close for the first time, Forbes magazine said, passing Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).Bezos' fortune was $65.3 billion as of 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Thursday, compared with Buffett's $64.9 billion.Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates remained the world's richest person, at $77.7 billion, while Spain's Amancio Ortega, who founded the Zara clothing chain's owner Inditex SA (ITX.MC), was second at $72.7 billion. Facebook Inc (FB.O) co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was fifth, at $54 billion. Bezos, 52, owns close to 18 percent of Amazon. Its stock has risen by roughly 50 percent since early February, as the world's largest online retailer continued to upend retailing as more people took to the Web rather than the mall to shop.Amazon's share price rose further in after-hours trading, after the Seattle-based company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Buffett, 85, owns close to 18 percent of Berkshire, but his donation this month of $2.86 billion of Berkshire stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities led to his drop to fourth place. He has donated more than $24.3 billion to the Gates Foundation and family charities since 2006.Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has roughly 90 business units including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream. In June, Buffett called Bezos a ""classic example"" of how a business owner could thrive, by having focused at Amazon on how to ""delight"" customers, and keep them coming back, rather than simply process their orders.

536,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A+(EXP)' ratings to four  new senior notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) and its wholly  owned finance subsidiary Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC) totalling  $2 billion. The offerings include $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued  by BRK and $1.25 billion of senior notes issued by (BHFC) which are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by the parent. The proceeds of the note issuances from BRK will be used to refinance $750  million of 2.2% senior notes maturing this month. The proceeds from the BHFC  notes will be used to refinance $1 billion of 0.95% senior notes that matured  this month as well as provide funds for general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS     BRK's consolidated financial leverage ratio was 28% as of June 30, 2016 and this  ratio is not expected to change since the issuance is essentially refinancing  maturing debt.  Further, this level of financial leverage would not trigger any  rating sensitivities, however, BRK is approaching Fitch's limits on financial  leverage and interest coverage. Consequently, a material acquisition funded with  significant amounts of debt would place downward pressure on BRK's ratings. Consolidated interest coverage in the first half of 2016 was 7.4x excluding  realized investment gains and losses on derivatives, which is below Fitch's  expectations of 12x for companies at BRK's rating level. An alternate  calculation of interest coverage, excluding railroad, utilities and energy, was  14.5x in the first half of 2016 and is consistent with the current rating  category. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a future downgrade include: --Deterioration in the credit quality of key insurance subsidiaries (National  Indemnity, GenRe, and GEICO) that is no longer consistent with the current 'AA+'  rating. Measures of credit quality include Fitch's judgment of capitalization, a  total financing and commitments ratio greater than 1.5x, net leverage (excluding  affiliated investments) over 3.5x or a sharp and persistent reduction in  underwriting profits.  --A consolidated run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio that exceeds 30% or a  run-rate debt-to-total capital ratio from the holding company, insurance and  finance operations (including debt issued or guaranteed by the holding company)  that exceeds 25%. --Material increases in leveraged equity market exposure such as its equity  index put derivative portfolio. --Acquisitions or other actions that reduce outstanding cash below $10 billion  or approximately 5x consolidated interest expense.   Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --A commitment to lower debt-to-tangible capital ratios attributed to the  holding company, insurance and finance operations. Fitch believes that this  would likely require the scaling back of the finance operations. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings:  Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. --$500 million 1.15% senior notes due August 2018 'A+(EXP)'; --$200 million floating rate senior notes due August 2018 'A+(EXP). Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (BHFC)  --$1 billion 1.3% senior notes due August 2019 'A+(EXP)'; --$250 million floating rate senior notes due August 2019 'A+(EXP)'.

537,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Monday said it has increased its stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone and iPod maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs.Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world's largest retailer, by 27 percent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade.It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple.Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. ""They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,"" Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. ""If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.""Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase.Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 percent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes.Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China's policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed.Monday's Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), and a higher stake in John Malone's telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA.O). It also reflected Berkshire's more than 14 percent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N).Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66.

553,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for American Express Co (AXP.N) to block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers toward lower-cost cards from other issuers.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge in Brooklyn erred in February 2015 in finding that American Express' ""anti-steering"" rules violated federal antitrust law.Underlying the case were the fees that merchants pay to process transactions, which the U.S. government estimated at more than $50 billion a year, and which can be passed along to cardholders in the form of higher prices.The lower court judge, Nicholas Garaufis, had found that non-discrimination provisions (NDPs) in American Express' merchant agreements, meant to dissuade customers from using cards from Visa and MasterCard, unreasonably restrained competition.But the appeals court said Garaufis erred by focusing entirely on the interests of merchants rather than cardholders who might benefit from American Express rewards programs and perceived prestige.""Though merchants may desire lower fees, those fees are necessary to maintaining cardholder satisfaction,"" Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote for a three-judge panel.""So long as AmEx's market share is derived from cardholder satisfaction, there is no reason to intervene and disturb the present functioning of the payment-card industry,"" he added.Shares of American Express, whose largest shareholder is billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), closed down 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $63.42. The shares had been down about 1.4 percent when the decision was issued. FREEDOM TO CHOOSE The decision may help American Express compete for space in customer wallets with Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), whose cards are more plentiful but whose customers spend less.It may also help American Express boost revenue as it cuts costs to help offset the loss of lucrative co-branding relationships such as with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O).Monday's decision is also a defeat for the U.S. government and 17 states, led by Ohio, that challenged American Express' anti-steering rules.Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. Mark Abueg, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. Kate Hanson, a spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said that they are reviewing the decision.American Express welcomed the decision. ""Consumers will be able to choose how they pay and our card members will not be discriminated against at the point of sale,"" spokeswoman Marina Norville said.Lawyers for dozens of retailers, such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), had argued that voiding American Express' anti-steering rules would encourage competition and drive prices they pay to card networks lower. INJUNCTION In his ruling, Garaufis had said the NDPs enabled American Express to wrongfully exploit its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market.The judge later imposed an injunction that also allowed merchants to offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees.But in December, after American Express said the injunction would cause irreparable harm, the appeals court temporarily lifted that injunction, enabling the company to enforce its rules during the appeal.Monday's decision means it can continue doing so.Visa and MasterCard together recently had close to 1.2 billion cards in the United States. American Express had 47 million as of June 30, down about 15 percent from 55.3 million a year earlier.The case is U.S. et al v.

INJUNCTION In his ruling, Garaufis had said the NDPs enabled American Express to wrongfully exploit its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market.The judge later imposed an injunction that also allowed merchants to offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees.But in December, after American Express said the injunction would cause irreparable harm, the appeals court temporarily lifted that injunction, enabling the company to enforce its rules during the appeal.Monday's decision means it can continue doing so.Visa and MasterCard together recently had close to 1.2 billion cards in the United States. American Express had 47 million as of June 30, down about 15 percent from 55.3 million a year earlier.The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

555,"   By Patrick Rucker and Dan Freed | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Wells Fargo & Co chief John Stumpf to resign and a top House Democrat demanded the bank be broken up because it is too big to manage.Stumpf's second trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday went no better than his first as lawmakers from both parties rebuked his handling of sales abuses and said the bank had damaged customer trust as well as the broader banking system.Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer say-so for years to satisfy managers' demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with regulators reached early this month.U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, the committee's senior Democrat, faulted the bank for identity theft in the fraud and called for Wells Fargo to be dismantled because it was too big to manage. She called the sales abuses ""some of the most egregious fraud we have seen since the foreclosure crisis."" After the hearing, the California lawmaker told reporters she would introduce legislation to break up Wells Fargo.The bank has said as many as 2 million accounts may have been wrongly opened and Stumpf promised to undo any harm to customers.The chief executive said, however, that Wells Fargo did not expect to see disgruntled bank customers in court.Wells Fargo is offering arbitration for its unhappy clients, Stumpf said. Pushed about whether he would waive that mandatory arbitration rule and allow customers to sue, Stumpf said: ""No."" Members of the House Financial Services Committee blasted Stumpf over the bank's culture, his compensation and whether the right people were being punished for opening fee-generating, phantom accounts.The episode has been a stunning reversal for Stumpf, long regarded as a safe pair of hands in the industry for navigating Wells Fargo successfully through the financial crisis. Stumpf again heard lawmakers calling for him to step aside. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in his opening statement he had lost faith in Wells Fargo, which does some of his banking.  ""Mr. Stumpf, I have a mortgage with your bank,"" Hensarling said. ""I wish I didn’t. I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions.""Wells Fargo shares fell 2.07 percent to $44.37. Since Sept. 7, the last trading day before the scandal broke, its stock has lost 11 percent, or about $27 billion in market value, based on Reuters data. The stock is trading at its lowest since early 2014.BROKEN TRUST  Republicans on the committee have often advocated easing Wall Street regulations, but they were among Stumpf's strongest critics at Thursday's hearing.Asked by Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, about whether Wells Fargo employees 'stole,' Stumpf said: ""In some cases, they did.""""I am deeply sorry that we didn't do the right thing,"" Stumpf said in response to a lawmaker who said the scandal had eroded the bank's market value.Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican from New Mexico, faulted Stumpf for saying the company's board could eventually be relied on to sanction the executives responsible.""I, sir, think you ought to submit a resignation and your board cannot hold off action on that,"" he said.  Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, asked the committee to summon other Wall Street chiefs, including from Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, to determine if they had imposed sales demands and quotas on their employees.""I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience,"" Sherman said.Stumpf said the bank was strengthening oversight of sales tactics, changing procedures for issuing credit cards and had paid back past and current customers for any fees incurrent on the ghost accounts.Earlier this week, the bank took back $41 million in stock awarded to Stumpf, an unprecedented rebuke to a major U.S. bank chief executive officer.Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York raised questions about $13 million in stock sales by the CEO in 2013 after he learned about the abuses. Stumpf said he sold stock with proper approvals and added the sales were made ""with no view about what was going on."" The affair has triggered lawsuits, more investigations and wiped more than $20 billion from the bank's market value.While Wells Fargo may be shielded from some customer actions, the bank may just be starting to face heightened regulatory scrutiny.On Thursday, the bank agreed to pay the Justice Department $4.1 million to resolve allegations it illegally repossessed cars owned by U.S. service members. In a separate settlement of similar allegations, the bank will pay a $20 million settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

565,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday said third-quarter profit dropped 24 percent from a year earlier, when it recorded a large one-time gain, but acquisitions helped boost operating profit at the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett.The company also reported a $22.1 billion stake in Wells Fargo & Co as of Sept. 30, suggesting it kept its 10 percent ownership position even as the bank became embroiled in a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder.Quarterly net income for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire fell to $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per share, a year earlier.Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 7 percent to $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share, from $4.55 billion, or $2,769 per share.That missed the average $3,058.10 per share forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, in part reflecting weaker results at the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, and falling demand from customers in industrial sectors.Results included a $1.6 billion gain when Mars Inc bought Berkshire's preferred stock investment in its Wrigley chewing gum business. Last year's results included a $4.4 billion gain related to the food company Kraft Heinz Co.Revenue was nearly unchanged at $59.1 billion. Book value per share, Buffett's preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of June to $163,783.Berkshire also ended September with $84.8 billion of cash, despite having completed a $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp in January that was a key factor behind the boost in operating profit.In a change, Buffett highlighted the cash hoard in Berkshire's press release accompanying results.""He has $85 billion of cash earning nothing,"" said Steven Check, who invests $1.1 billion, of which 30 percent is in Berkshire, at Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California. ""It gives Berkshire a lot of pent-up firepower for more acquisitions."" WELLS FARGO Since taking over Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has built a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses including Brooks running shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear.Berkshire also owns dozens of companies' stocks, including Apple Inc, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp.Though the value of the Wells Fargo investment fell from $23.7 billion at the end of June, the decline can be explained by the more than 6 percent drop in the bank's share price. That suggests that Berkshire has kept its roughly 500 million shares in the third-largest U.S. bank.Buffett has over the years repeatedly praised Wells Fargo, whose stock Berkshire has owned since 1989, and this year asked the U.S. Federal Reserve for permission to buy more.But he also warned that companies guard against the kind of reputational damage that Wells Fargo has suffered over the sham accounts, estimated to number up to 2 million, which have prompted a variety of potentially costly regulatory probes. Buffett has said he would talk this month about the scandal, which emerged on Sept. 8 when Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in fines to settle charges by U.S. regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor.BNSF STRUGGLES  Berkshire's operating businesses posted mixed results.Overall insurance profit fell 11 percent to $1.12 billion, and included a 34 percent drop from underwriting.Geico saw pre-tax underwriting gains slide by 47 percent in the quarter, as higher losses from storms and accidents offset increases in premium rates.But float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire's growth, rose to $91 billion from $90 billion at the end of June.Profit from manufacturing, service and retailing companies rose 45 percent to $1.7 billion, as the addition of Precision helped offset ""sluggish demand"" for industrial products from the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries.BNSF saw profit fall 12 percent to $1.02 billion, hurt by a decline in coal and petroleum shipments that has dampened results this year and which Berkshire expects to persist.The Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit saw profit rise 19 percent to $932 million, helped by higher electricity margins at its MidAmerican Energy unit.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares fell $456, or 0.2 percent, to $214,545 and Class B shares fell 69 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $142.95.

Buffett has said he would talk this month about the scandal, which emerged on Sept. 8 when Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in fines to settle charges by U.S. regulators and a Los Angeles prosecutor.BNSF STRUGGLES  Berkshire's operating businesses posted mixed results.Overall insurance profit fell 11 percent to $1.12 billion, and included a 34 percent drop from underwriting.Geico saw pre-tax underwriting gains slide by 47 percent in the quarter, as higher losses from storms and accidents offset increases in premium rates.But float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire's growth, rose to $91 billion from $90 billion at the end of June.Profit from manufacturing, service and retailing companies rose 45 percent to $1.7 billion, as the addition of Precision helped offset ""sluggish demand"" for industrial products from the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries.BNSF saw profit fall 12 percent to $1.02 billion, hurt by a decline in coal and petroleum shipments that has dampened results this year and which Berkshire expects to persist.The Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit saw profit rise 19 percent to $932 million, helped by higher electricity margins at its MidAmerican Energy unit.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares fell $456, or 0.2 percent, to $214,545 and Class B shares fell 69 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $142.95.

But that industry could be buoyed if Trump fulfills his promise to invigorate mining, and perhaps ease limits on carbon emissions. Meanwhile, shares of Wells Fargo, in which Berkshire owns a 10 percent stake, rose 16 percent this week despite being enmeshed in a scandal over employees who set up accounts without customers' permission, in a drive to meet sales goals.In an interview broadcast on Friday, Buffett told CNN that Wells Fargo had a ""dumb incentive system,"" and that its former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who left his post in October, was a decent man who nonetheless made a ""hell of a mistake"" and failed to correct it.Still, Buffett said he had not sold Wells Fargo shares.

578,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A Nebraska nonprofit on Friday said it will propose that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) sell its investments in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and other companies involved in fossil fuels over 12 years.The Nebraska Peace Foundation, which focuses on anti-war, civil rights and environmental issues, said it submitted a formal proposal for Berkshire shareholders to consider at the Omaha-based conglomerate's annual meeting next May 6.Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the proposal, which was reported earlier by the Associated Press.The nonprofit would face an uphill battle absent support from Buffett, who commands nearly one-third of Berkshire's voting power.In April, shareholders including Buffett defeated its proposal that Berkshire report on the risks that climate change posed for its insurance businesses. Buffett called that proposal unnecessary, and only 11 percent of the votes cast favored it.The nonprofit said its fossil fuels proposal reflects the need to reduce greenhouse gases and shift toward renewable energy, without endangering Berkshire's near-term profitability.It said the proposal would not cover businesses that Berkshire owns outright, including several utilities and the chemical company Lubrizol. Instead, it would cover investments such as Berkshire's nearly $7 billion stake in Phillips 66, and its recently sold stake in Canada's Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO).Buffett owns about 18 percent of Berkshire. Forbes magazine on Friday estimated his net worth at $71.7 billion. The Suncor sale ""reinforces our faith about what Warren Buffett can do about this,"" Tim Rinne, state coordinator for Nebraskans for Peace, with which the foundation is affiliated, said in an interview.""He's a huge philanthropist, he's an international icon and he's extraordinarily smart,"" Rinne said. ""That puts him in an ideal position to make a statement for the entire world about addressing the perils of climate change.""Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses including Geico auto insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear.
