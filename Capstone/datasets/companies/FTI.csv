0,"   By Casey Sullivan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 13    After Patton Boggs merged with Squire Sanders, the new law firm, Squire Patton Boggs, dropped Patton Boggs' client, Tate & Lyle, because it represents a group of U.S. sugar companies that are suing Tate and others for falsely billing its high-fructose corn syrup as ""just like sugar.""Now Tate and another ingredient maker asked a federal judge in Los Angeles to disqualify Squire Patton Boggs from working for the sugar companies, which include American Sugar Refining, Inc., Western Sugar Cooperative and C&H Sugar Co.  If the judge agrees, the companies could lose lawyers who have put in 20,000 hours on the case and racked up $12 million in legal fees, according to court filings. At a hearing on Thursday in the case, U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall said she'd take the matter under advisement.Squire Patton Boggs said in court papers that Tate waived future conflicts when it retained the firm. Tate said in court filings that the waiver it signed with Patton Boggs covered only unrelated matters, but that the firm had advised it on issues related to high fructose corn syrup. Tate said Squire Patton Boggs dropped it as a client because ""sugar company plaintiffs were more valuable clients.""Squire Patton Boggs declined to comment. Tate also declined to comment, as did the sugar companies through their lawyers.The case shows how the conflicts created by law firm mergers and by lawyers moving from firm to firm create a host of complications for client companies, including the risk of losing their outside lawyers. A number of companies have sought to disqualify lawyers based on their mixed allegiances.Law firm mergers and acquisitions hit a record last year, with 88 deals completed in 2013, 47 percent more than the previous year, according to consultancy Altman Weil. And the practice of recruiting lawyers from competitors ramped up, too. There was 25 percent more partner moves among big law firms between 2012 and 2013 than three years prior, according to the American Lawyer, a trade magazine. Ethics rules prohibit lawyers from representing clients on opposite sides of a legal dispute. While lawyers try to comply by running thorough conflicts checks before hiring new lawyers or merging with other firms, those checks don't always resolve the conflicts.When a conflict is found, lawyers often ask clients to waive it. If they don't, law firms sometimes resolve the problem by dropping certain clients or laying off lawyers.BOOTING LAWYERS  In several recent cases, judges have booted lawyers when conflicts emerged, resulting in a burden on clients to find new counsel. That process can cost millions of dollars as lawyers ramp up their billable hours to get familiar with a new case.For example, a San Francisco federal judge in 2012 disqualified law firm McDermott Will & Emery from advising web translation firm MotionPoint Corp. in a patent dispute with a rival company because McDermott had hired partners from a firm that had represented the rival.MotionPoint lost the patent case and turned around and sued McDermott for the $10 million it claims to have incurred as a result of bringing new lawyers up to speed to try and salvage the case, among other damages. A trial is scheduled for February 2016 in state court in San Mateo, California. McDermott declined to comment.Last year, a judge in federal bankruptcy court in Riverside, California, ruled that law firm Winston & Strawn couldn't represent bond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. in the bankruptcy of San Bernardino County because Winston had hired lawyers from another firm that had worked on the same matter for a state pension fund that had opposed National. Winston declined to comment, as did National.To avoid the increasing conflicts created by all this activity, some law firms have asked their clients to waive conflicts in advance. That hasn't helped in the Squire Patton Boggs case.In addition to Tate, another former Patton Boggs client, Ingredion Inc., is also asking the judge to disqualify the merged firm. Squire Patton Boggs says Ingredion was not a current client when the firm's merger occurred. Ingredion supplies ingredients used in making foods and beverages, cosmetics, baby powder and other products.The practice of asking for advance waivers has gotten under the skin of more than a few company lawyers.Jeff Carr, who recently retired as general counsel of energy equipment provider FMC Technologies, called advance waivers unreasonable. ""Large firm views on conflicts drive me crazy,"" said Carr, who has been outspoken on issues related to lawyer-client relations. ""I have this bizarre concept that I'm the customer, so it should be about me and my company, not them - go figure.""

4,"   By Mike Stone  French oilfield services company Technip (TECF.PA) is exploring a sale and has held talks with U.S. peer FMC Technologies Inc (FTI.N) about a potential combination, according to people familiar with the matter on Wednesday.A deal would illustrate how lower energy prices are driving consolidation in the oil services sector, as companies seek savings and synergies to boost profits amid a supply glut that is weighing on exploration and production. Technip and FMC Technologies, which have market capitalizations of 5.3 billion euros ($5.8 billion) and $6.8 billion respectively, have not yet agreed on terms and there is no certainty they will do so, the people said. Technip has also held talks with other potential buyers, one of the people added. Shares of Technip rose as much as 10 percent in late afternoon trading in New York after Reuters reported on talks. Technip shares had already closed up 3.6 percent in Paris. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. FMC Technologies and Technip did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Earlier this year, FMC Technologies and Technip formed a joint venture, Forsys Subsea, aimed at reducing the cost of subsea oilfield exploration, a sector that has been badly hurt by the drop in the price of oil. Technip tried to do a deal with CGG SA (GEPH.PA) last year, but talks fell apart when CGG rebuffed Technip's 1.47 billion euro preliminary takeover approach.  Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world's No. 2 oilfield services provider, is currently in the midst of securing regulatory approvals for its acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) in a stock-and-cash $34.6 billion deal.

22,"   By Suzanne Barlyn | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Energy technology company FMC Technologies Inc will pay a $2.5 million penalty to settle charges that it overstated profits in one of its business segments, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday.Two now former executives made the improper adjustments after being pressured to improve the financial performance of the Houston-based company's energy infrastructure department, the SEC said.FMC Technologies and the two executives consented to the SEC's order without admitting or denying the findings, the agency said. A spokesman for FMC and lawyers for the executives could not immediately be reached for comment.The former controller of the department, Jeffrey Favret, and another controller, Steven Croft, improperly reduced the value of the company's liability for employee paid time off. That, in turn, led to overstating the department's pre-tax operating profits by $800,000, allowing it to meet an internal target for the first quarter of 2013, the SEC said. Favret and Croft also corrected a $730,000 error recorded in 2012 that increased their department's operating results for first quarter 2013, but never notified the company's top controller, the SEC said. The two later signed letters to the company in which they represented that they did not make adjustments larger than $250,000 outside of the accounting period at the time, the SEC said.Favret agreed to pay a $30,000 penalty and Croft agreed to pay a $10,000 penalty. The two also agreed to suspensions from working on SEC-related accounting matters. They can apply for reinstatement after two years, the SEC said.Another FMC Technologies department also failed to properly account for employee paid time off in 2012, the SEC said. The company also improperly accounted for interest income associated with certain large loans made within the company that year, resulting in an $8 million out-of-period adjustment in 2014.
