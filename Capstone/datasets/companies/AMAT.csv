0,"  Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O), the biggest maker of equipment used to make semiconductors, reported a 39 percent jump in first-quarter revenue as higher demand from manufacturers of flash memory chips helped to offset weak sales to makers of logic chips.Applied Materials, which also provides equipment to make flat panel displays and solar cells, said it expected adjusted earnings of 25-29 cents per share in the current quarter.Analysts were expecting a profit of 27 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it expected revenue to increase 3-10 percent sequentially in the current quarter, implying revenue of $2.25 billion-$2.40 billion. Analysts expected $2.32 billion.Orders in the company's silicon systems segment, which brings in about two-thirds of total sales, rose 13 percent to $1.57 billion, buoyed by demand from contract chip manufacturers and makers of flash memory chips.Demand has been strong for flash memory, which is used in everything from memory cards to digital cameras and portable devices such as smartphones and tablets.But spending by logic chipmakers such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) has been hit by lackluster demand for PCs. ""The foundries remain the biggest component of wafer fabrication equipment as they ramp new factories to fulfill demand for advanced mobile chips,"" Chief Executive Gary Dickerson said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday.""We expect foundry investment to grow 10 percent to 20 percent this year,"" Dickerson said.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, said it expects double-digit percentage growth in sales and profit in 2014 based on a protracted boom in the mobile device sector.TSMC, one of Applied Materials' biggest customers, also said it was investing billions of dollars to pack more processing power into chips.

7,"  (Adds details from analyst call, comment; updates stock move)By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO May 15 Top chip gear-maker Applied Materials on Thursday posted higher fiscal second-quarter revenue as investments to make more smartphones and memory chips helped offset a slow personal computer market.Shares of the company rose after its report reassured investors who were cautious following recent disappointing quarterly forecasts from other companies.""We've had a lot of mixed commentary through earnings season and some pretty concerning outlooks,"" said Pacific Crest analyst Weston Twigg. ""That's particularly true for (semiconductor capital) names where there's been concern about demand dropping off.""Leading contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and its rivals are working on new cutting-edge manufacturing technology that will allow them to make more advanced chips for mobile gadgets. But due to the complexity of the new technology, the timing of each company's investments and eventual launch of new production lines has remained unclear to investors.On a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said he expects contract chip manufacturers to increase their investments by up to 20 percent this year, driven by smartphones and other connected mobile devices. While a slow PC market is muting demand for Intel Corp's  processors, the growth of mobile devices is driving more investment in NAND and DRAM memory chips.Applied Materials agreed in September to buy No. 3 chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron Ltd in an all-stock deal worth more than $10 billion as the number of major customers making advanced chips declines. Dickerson said he continues to expect regulatory approval in the second half of 2014.Applied Materials said its revenue for the quarter ended in April was $2.35 billion, up from $1.97 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts expected second-quarter revenue of $2.349 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company had a net profit for the quarter of $262 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $129 million, or 11 cents, in the same quarter last year.Excluding items, the company earned 28 cents per share, in line with expectations.The company said it expected revenue in the current quarter to be flat or down 5 percent from the previous quarter, implying revenue of $2.23 billion to $2.35 billion.

Tokyo Electron Ltd jumped 6.3 percent after shares in chip gear maker Applied Materials - which agreed in September to buy the Japanese firm - soared Friday on strong earnings results.      The Nikkei was flat at 14,096.88 in midmorning trade after opening a tad higher. On Friday, it dropped 1.4 percent.     Analysts said investors were staying on the sidelines as they awaited events this week including the BOJ meeting, U.S. economic data and a Chinese PMI report.     ""Since the majority of companies' earnings are over, investors are trying to find cues from these events,"" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.     Maruetsu Inc soared as much as 14 percent to 382 yen, its highest level since March 2013. The Nikkei newspaper said Aeon will consolidate its supermarket operations in greater Tokyo by bringing three grocery store chains, including Maruetsu, under a joint venture with trading house Marubeni Corp.

The market continued to take its cue from news overseas. Ukrainian border guards crossed the frontier to inspect a huge Russian aid convoy, which some had speculated could be a cover for a military invasion. The inspection comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a softer tone in comments regarding Ukraine.In Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for a new coalition that world and regional powers hope will be able to quash a Sunni Islamist insurgency that threatens Baghdad.""While no one is discounting the possibility that these issues could get worse next week, there hasn't been anything untoward yet with the inspections or in Iraq, and that's a positive,"" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York. In the latest economic data, the New York Federal Reserve's report on manufacturers showed business conditions improved in August, though at a slower rate than expected.  Separately, U.S. consumer sentiment fell in August to its lowest since last November, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.""These are disappointing, but there's a growing feeling that the U.S. is going to be the best market to be in for the rest of the year,"" Colas said. ""U.S. equities look like a better value than U.S. Treasuries, or certainly European equities.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.05 points or 0.31 percent, to 16,764.63, the S&P 500 gained 7.92 points or 0.41 percent, to 1,963.1 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 28.24 points or 0.63 percent, to 4,481.24. For the week, the Dow is up 1.3 percent, the S&P is up 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq is up 2.5 percent. It is the biggest weekly gain for the S&P since April, and the biggest for the Nasdaq since February.The S&P is 1.2 percent off a closing record hit late July. In a sign of the market's long-term strength, the index has marked more than 1,000 days since its last correction, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 10 percent from the most recent high.Monster Beverage Corp jumped 28 percent to $92 after Coca-Cola Co said it was buying a 16.7 percent stake in the company for $2.15 billion.The stock was the S&P's biggest gainer, followed by Applied Materials Inc, up 5.6 percent to $22.34 a day after it reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations.On the downside, Nordstrom Inc fell 3.8 percent to $66.09 a day after its results, the latest disappointing read for the retail sector after both Macy's Inc and Wal-Mart  cut their outlooks earlier this week.

44,"   By Emi Emoto and Junko Fujita | TOKYO  TOKYO U.S.-based Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) on Monday scrapped its $10 billion planned takeover of chip-making gear rival Tokyo Electron Ltd (8035.T) after the deal, a rare foreign bid for a Japanese firm, fell foul of U.S. anti-trust regulators.   The all-share purchase would have combined the No.1 and No. 3 makers of the equipment that makes semiconductor chips into a group with a stock market value of more than $38.5 billion.Tokyo Electron said both companies gave up on the deal after more than 18 months of talks after it became clear that differences with the U.S. Justice Department could not be bridged.The reasons for the regulator's decision were not immediately clear, but California-based Applied Materials said the U.S. authorities had deemed insufficient a proposal to address antitrust concerns.""We must take with humility the result that we could not convince the regulators,"" Tokyo Electron Chief Executive Tetsuro Higashi told reporters. ""The termination of the merger is a very regrettable outcome, but it does no good to mourn."" Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron and No. 2 maker, ASML Holding NV (ASML.AS), hold 49 percent of the global market, according to market research firm Gartner, in an industry where the rising cost of developing chips, coupled with slowing semiconductor demand, are forcing alliances and acquisitions.The pan-Pacific deal, announced in September 2013, would have been a rarity because the combined entity would have been listed in New York and Tokyo but incorporated in the Netherlands, home of ASML.  Analysts had initially expected the takeover, aimed at spurring profit growth in both companies, to stand up to regulatory scrutiny.The unraveling of the deal is worse for Tokyo Electron, said a Tokyo-based mergers and acquisitions lawyer, as takeover targets often lose management focus, and customers, during the negotiation period. CEO Higashi said Tokyo Electron would be ""flexible in considering alliances with others in the future"".To appease shareholders, both companies announced share buybacks. Applied Materials said it would buy up to $3 billion worth of shares over three years and Tokyo Electron said it plans to buy as much as 120 billion yen ($1 billion) worth of shares, or 8.59 percent of its outstanding stock. No termination fee would be payable by either party, Applied Materials said.Many U.S. chipmakers have sold or mothballed capacity and outsourced manufacturing to Asian foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), further eroding Applied Material's customer base.

The all-share purchase would have combined the No.1 and No. 3 makers of the equipment that makes semiconductor chips into a group with a stock market value of more than $38.5 billion.Tokyo Electron said both companies gave up on the deal after more than 18 months of talks after it became clear that differences with the U.S. Justice Department could not be bridged.The reasons for the regulator's decision were not immediately clear, but California-based Applied Materials said the U.S. authorities had deemed insufficient a proposal to address antitrust concerns. ""We must take with humility the result that we could not convince the regulators,"" Tokyo Electron Chief Executive Tetsuro Higashi told reporters. ""The termination of the merger is a very regrettable outcome, but it does no good to mourn.""Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron and No. 2 maker, ASML Holding NV, hold 49 percent of the global market, according to market research firm Gartner, in an industry where the rising cost of developing chips, coupled with slowing semiconductor demand, are forcing alliances and acquisitions.The pan-Pacific deal, announced in September 2013, would have been a rarity because the combined entity would have been listed in New York and Tokyo but incorporated in the Netherlands, home of ASML. Analysts had initially expected the takeover, aimed at spurring profit growth in both companies, to stand up to regulatory scrutiny.The unravelling of the deal is worse for Tokyo Electron, said a Tokyo-based mergers and acquisitions lawyer, as takeover targets often lose management focus, and customers, during the negotiation period. CEO Higashi said Tokyo Electron would be ""flexible in considering alliances with others in the future"".To appease shareholders, both companies announced share buybacks. Applied Materials said it would buy up to $3 billion worth of shares over three years and Tokyo Electron said it plans to buy as much as 120 billion yen ($1 billion) worth of shares, or 8.59 percent of its outstanding stock.No termination fee would be payable by either party, Applied Materials said.Many U.S. chipmakers have sold or mothballed capacity and outsourced manufacturing to Asian foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, further eroding Applied Material's customer base.

52,"   By Lehar Maan and Abhirup Roy | April 30  April 30 Recuperating demand from chipmakers will soften the blow for chip-equipment maker Applied Materials Inc after antitrust concerns scuttled its bid for Tokyo Electron Ltd.Though not its desired outcome after more than 18 months of talks, Applied Materials as a standalone company will be better positioned to focus on its core businesses without the integration costs and distractions of a merger, analysts said.Tokyo Electron, on the other hand, now faces rising research and development costs and even possible market share losses to its former suitor.Santa Clara, California-based Applied Materials and Japan's Tokyo Electron announced on Monday that they had abandoned merger talks after it became clear that differences with the U.S. Justice Department could not be bridged. The plan to merge came together in September 2013, when the rising cost of developing cutting-edge chips and a slowdown in semiconductor demand was forging alliances across the industry.That picture has changed. Chip-equipment capital spending, down 11.6 percent in 2013, rose 16.4 percent last year, according to market research firm Gartner. Spending is expected to increase by 5.6 percent this year. (gtnr.it/1DWPlqo)""We have high confidence in Applied Materials' standalone model given opportunities for market expansion, improved margin performance, cash generation and share buybacks, and a top-tier management team,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Weston Twigg said in a client note. Still, the company will need to slash costs and may have to sell its low-margin solar business to boost its bottom line in the near term, analysts said.The company's operating margin spiked to 17 percent in the fiscal year ended Oct. 26. But its business that makes equipment for fabricating solar wafers and cells managed an operating margin of just 5.4 percent. Applied Materials declined to comment for this story.Joseph Eshoo, vice-president at SIT Investment Associates, owner of about 2.1 million Applied Materials shares, noted that the company had managed to grow organically under CEO Gary Dickerson. ""Even with the distraction of the merger still out there, they were still able to execute,"" Eshoo said.Applied Materials' revenue rose 21 percent last fiscal year, reversing two years of decline. Analysts expect revenue to rise 8.5 percent this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to last Friday's close, Applied Materials shares had risen 45 percent since Dickerson took over on Sept. 1, 2013. The stock has fallen 8 percent since the deal was scrapped.

""Corporate America announced $2.8 trillion in stock buybacks in the past five years, and these buybacks have provided a key source of fuel for the bull market,"" said David Santschi, chief executive officer of TrimTabs.   ""Corporate actions this year suggest this support is going to diminish.""Britain's vote to leave the European Union that has rattled global markets stands to further diminish buybacks, Santschi said. ""Companies tend to buy back more when they’re feeling confident and they tend to buy back less when they’re feeling less confident,"" he said.Buybacks also can prop up company earnings, as lowered share counts boost earnings per share, a closely followed metric. A fall in repurchases could increase price-to-earnings ratios, making the stocks look more expensive.
