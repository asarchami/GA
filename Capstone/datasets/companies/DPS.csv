0,"  * SodaStream shares up on takeover speculation* Experts say Coke could take larger stake in Green Mountain* Make-at-home soda market still small* Green Mountain deal marks Coke's return to in-home soda making   (Adds comment by industry expert, comment by SodaStream, industry background, closing share prices)By Lisa BaertleinFeb 6 Coca-Cola Co's $1.3 billion investment in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc puts pressure on at-home soda leader SodaStream International Ltd  to bolster its position through a partnership or merger with the likes of a PepsiCo Inc or Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.Coke's move on Wednesday to buy 10 percent of the maker of the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer and exclusively sell Coke products on its upcoming cold drink machine  is fueling speculation that the world's largest soda company could eventually buy the rest of Green Mountain, which would spur other deals in the sector, analysts said.The Coke deal eliminates SodaStream's ""best potential partner and creates a new level of competition,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Van Winkle said in a note.Shares of SodaStream rose 7.2 percent to close at $38.35 on the Nasdaq on Thursday, buoyed by takeover speculation.Soft drink makers - who have seen U.S. soda sales decline since 2005 - are warily watching trends such as at-home soda making and so-called water enhancers, such as Kraft Foods Group's Mio brand. They are unlikely to let a rival  get too far out in front, analysts said.""It's tit-for-tat"" with Coke and Pepsi, said Bevmark Consulting Chief Executive Officer Tom Pirko. Pepsi last year shot down rumors that it had approached Israel-based SodaStream with a $2 billion buyout offer.Pepsi declined to comment for this story and Dr Pepper Snapple did not respond to requests for comment.SodaStream said in an email that it viewed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as ""further recognition that custom carbonation is the future of the ... at-home carbonated beverage industry.""While some industry experts hailed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as historic or groundbreaking, Pirko called it a tentative step for Coke, which in the late 1980s launched a home and office soda machine called BreakMate.BreakMate fizzled after the machines were plagued by problems and consumers realized it cost less to buy two-liter bottles of soda at the store.""People shouldn't misjudge this as a revolution in the soft drink business,"" Pirko said of the Coke-Green Mountain deal.     Coke is ""testing the temperature of the water to see if they want to dive in."" Coke has made a handful of bite-by-bite acquisitions - including Honest Tea - to expand the types of drinks it offers.ONE-WAY EXCLUSIVITY While companies such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc have deals to provide coffee pods for the Keurig coffee machine, Coke took the extra step of investing in Green Mountain as it prepares to launch its single-serving cold drink machine as soon as October. Coke drink pods will be exclusive on Green Mountain's new machine, but Green Mountain's machine will use products from other drink makers.The investment decision from Coke ""causes us to wonder if this could be the first step in ultimately acquiring a larger stake in (Green Mountain),"" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a client note. Shares of Green Mountain closed 26.2 percent higher at $102.10 on Thursday. They jumped more than 50 percent in extended trade on Wednesday after the Coke deal was announced.The gains prompted some short sellers to make fresh bets that Green Mountain's stock price would drop. Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, shorted Green Mountain at $128 a share on Wednesday evening.""It is uncertain that the home soda market is all that large and whether it is taking market share,"" said Kass.""The heaviest users of SodaStream use it for sparkling water, as the flavor market and usage has been slow to develop,"" Kass said in a note to clients.John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, called the Coke-Green Mountain deal a win-win, saying it gives the soda company a new avenue for growth with new technology that is cutting-edge and cool.UNPROVEN MACHINE But skeptics point out that Green Mountain's cold drink machine is still unproven, that the price consumers will pay for pods has not been announced, and that Coke's main challenge is to tempt consumers with new, premium drinks.""In our opinion, one of Coke's problems ... is not routes-to-market but innovation in the bottle,"" Stifel analyst Mark Swartzberg said in a client note.Another Stifel analyst, Jim Duffy, estimated SodaStream's global retail sales at about $100 million annually. That suggests Coke's potential retail sales on Green Mountain's new cold beverage machine would make just a small contribution to its net revenue, which was $12 billion in the third quarter.

9,"   By Lauren Hirsch  PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) is nearing a deal to acquire sparkling probiotic U.S. drinks company KeVita Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, in the latest push by the carbonated beverage giant to diversify its soft drinks business.The deal would be PepsiCo's first outright acquisition through its venture arm dubbed Naked Emerging Brands, whose mission is to expand the company's portfolio of sugary drinks by developing brands that appeal to health-conscious consumers.PepsiCo already owns a minority stake in KeVita, and has a distribution agreement with the Oxnard, California-based company, the people said. The acquisition of KeVita could be finalized as early as this month, and will likely value the privately held company at less than $500 million, the people said. There is always a possibility that the negotiations end unsuccessfully, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. A spokesperson for Pepsi said that the company does not comment on ""rumor or speculation."" KeVita could not be immediately reached for comment.  Carbonated beverages sales have softened in recent years, as consumers seek calorie-free alternatives to sugary drinks. Several U.S. cities have introduced a so-called 'soda tax' on sugary drinks, or are seeking to do so.KeVita sells drinks that include sparkling probiotics, master brew kombucha tea, and vinegar tonics. Probiotics, proponents say, help aid digestive and immune health.KeVita was founded in 2010 by Chakra Earthsong, a nutritional consultant, and her friend, entrepreneur Bill Moses. They combined Earthsong's at-home water kefir ferment with Moses's winemaking fermentation knowledge.  The company has also received investments from private equity firms KarpReilly LLC and SPK Capital LLC. Early minority investments in companies such as KeVita allow PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to familiarize themselves with a startup before buying it outright, as only a small percentage of new drink concepts take off. These investments also usually come with distribution agreements, which allow the bulging brands to grow. When these startups find their footing and prove their business plan, they will often consider selling outright.Earlier this month, Reuters reported that antioxidant beverage company Bai Brands LLC, in which Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) owns a minority stake, is exploring a sale that it hopes will value it at more than $2 billion.PepsiCo's existing healthier offerings include Naked Juice and O.N.E Coconut Waters.

11,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) is in talks to acquire Bai Brands LLC, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, a move that would break its track record of only investing small stakes in growth drinks brands. The talks come after Reuters reported on Oct. 3 that Bai was exploring a sale, sending Dr Pepper Snapple shares lower on concerns that its distribution of Bai would be jeopardized if sold to a rival such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N).Dr Pepper Snapple is just one of the companies that the antioxidant drink brand is talking to ahead of bids being submitted in an auction for the company, and there is no certainty it will prevail with its bid, the people said. Dr Pepper Snapple may be willing to value Bai at more than $1.5 billion, one of the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Dr Pepper Snapple declined to comment. Bai did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bai, which means ""pure"" in Mandarin Chinese, sweetens its drinks with plant-based ingredients and infuses them with antioxidants from coffee fruit and white tea. It was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who still owns a majority of the company. Dr Pepper Snapple has not made a major acquisition since being spun out of Britain's confectionary company Cadbury Schweppes in 2008, but is now reconsidering its stance as the soft drinks industry grapples with increasingly health-conscious consumers. Dr Pepper Snapple has owned a minority stake in Princeton, New Jersey-based Bai since last year. It is one of Dr Pepper Snapple's ""Allied Brands,"" which are healthy drink companies that it distributes through its network.  The young companies benefit from Dr Pepper Snapple's reach, while the Plano, Texas based-soda company benefits from a boost to its distribution network. Other Allied Brands of Dr Pepper Snapple include Fiji Water and Vita Coco. Unlike some of its big soda competitors, Dr Pepper Snapple has traditionally not viewed its small equity investments as a path to an outright acquisition.  In 2007, one of Dr Pepper Snapple's minority investments, Vitaminwater-maker Glaceau, was sold to Coca-Cola for $4.1 billion. Dr. Pepper Snapple, however, has expressed concerns over how expensive such deals can be.""Some of these (valuation) multiples out there are ridiculous. I love these young entrepreneurs, but they all want to have the next Glaceau deal,"" Dr. Pepper Snapple CEO Larry Young said in 2014.

14,"  Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) and PepsiCo (PEP.N) on Tuesday both announced plans to buy alternative drinks makers, the latest examples of beverage companies branching into products perceived as healthier as soda sales decline. Dr Pepper Snapple, which makes flavored tea, juice drinks, 7UP and Schweppes sodas, will buy antioxidant beverages maker Bai Brands LLC for $1.7 billion in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. Dr Pepper Snapple, which is based in Plano, Texas, already has a roughly 3 percent stake in Bai and a distribution deal with the Hamilton, New Jersey-based company. Pepsi, based in Purchase, New York, said it will buy probiotic drinks maker KeVita Inc for an undisclosed amount. Reuters reported last month the soda maker was nearing a deal for Oxnard, California-based KeVita, estimated under $500 million.The moves signify a further push by beverage companies into more premium products amid a challenging business environment. Carbonated beverage demand hit a 30-year low in the United States last year, according to Beverage Digest. Officials globally are considering sugary drinks taxes to try to stem obesity and diabetes epidemics. This month alone, five U.S. regions approved such levies. ""This is a continued play on health and wellness. The noncarbonated beverage space continues to grow at the expense of the carbonated sodas that Pepsi and Dr Pepper are known for,"" said Adam Fleck of Morningstar in Chicago. Dr Pepper Snapple shares jumped 2.6 percent, and Pepsi shares were up 0.6 percent.Bai, which means ""pure"" in Mandarin Chinese, makes carbonated flavored water, coconut water and premium ready-to-drink teas. KeVita makes kombucha, which is fermented tea, and other drinks that are certified organic, gluten-free and vegan. Soda giants have built stakes and bought beverage companies to cater to changing tastes. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) bought organic bottled-tea maker Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water and invested in organic juice maker Suja.The Bai deal is Dr Pepper Snapple's first major acquisition since it was spun out of Cadbury Schweppes in 2008. It is a ""defensive"" move by Dr Pepper Snapple to keep a strategic relationship with Bai, said Morningstar's Fleck. The company has lost key distribution deals with companies in the past including Vitaminwater, which was sold to Coca-Cola in 2007.Dr Pepper Snapple, which Reuters reported in October was in talks to buy Bai, said Bai would add $132 million to net sales in 2017. The company said the acquisition is expected to hurt earnings by 3 cents per share in 2017, but will add to profits in 2018.

15,"  Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) and PepsiCo (PEP.N) on Tuesday both announced plans to buy alternative drinks makers, the latest examples of beverage companies branching into products perceived as healthier as soda sales decline. Dr Pepper Snapple, which makes flavored tea, juice drinks, 7UP and Schweppes sodas, will buy antioxidant beverages maker Bai Brands LLC for $1.7 billion in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. Dr Pepper Snapple, which is based in Plano, Texas, already has a roughly 3 percent stake in Bai and a distribution deal with the Hamilton, New Jersey-based company. Pepsi, based in Purchase, New York, said it will buy probiotic drinks maker KeVita Inc for an undisclosed amount. Reuters reported last month the soda maker was nearing a deal for Oxnard, California-based KeVita, estimated under $500 million.The moves signify a further push by beverage companies into more premium products amid a challenging business environment. Carbonated beverage demand hit a 30-year low in the United States last year, according to Beverage Digest. Officials globally are considering sugary drinks taxes to try to stem obesity and diabetes epidemics. This month alone, five U.S. regions approved such levies. ""This is a continued play on health and wellness. The noncarbonated beverage space continues to grow at the expense of the carbonated sodas that Pepsi and Dr Pepper are known for,"" said Adam Fleck of Morningstar in Chicago. Dr Pepper Snapple shares jumped 2.6 percent, and Pepsi shares were up 0.6 percent.Bai, which means ""pure"" in Mandarin Chinese, makes carbonated flavored water, coconut water and premium ready-to-drink teas. KeVita makes kombucha, which is fermented tea, and other drinks that are certified organic, gluten-free and vegan. Soda giants have built stakes and bought beverage companies to cater to changing tastes. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) bought organic bottled-tea maker Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water and invested in organic juice maker Suja.The Bai deal is Dr Pepper Snapple's first major acquisition since it was spun out of Cadbury Schweppes in 2008. It is a ""defensive"" move by Dr Pepper Snapple to keep a strategic relationship with Bai, said Morningstar's Fleck. The company has lost key distribution deals with companies in the past including Vitaminwater, which was sold to Coca-Cola in 2007.Dr Pepper Snapple, which Reuters reported in October was in talks to buy Bai, said Bai would add $132 million to net sales in 2017. The company said the acquisition is expected to hurt earnings by 3 cents per share in 2017, but will add to profits in 2018. The purchase price includes a tax benefit of about $400 million on a net present value basis.
