Biogen said underlying patient demand for the drug represented about $348 million of the U.S. sales, still ahead of analysts' consensus expectations of about $335 million.Biogen provided forecasts for 2014 that were likely to be viewed as a mixed bag, with revenue growth projections ahead of Wall Street expectations but an earnings outlook that fell short of the current analysts' view.The company forecast revenue growth of about 22 percent to 25 percent and earnings of $11 to $11.20 per share, excluding items.

23,"   By Bill Berkrot  Biogen Idec Inc is pricing its newly approved long-acting hemophilia drug, Alprolix, to cost U.S. patients, and insurers, about the same per year as older, less convenient therapies whose price can reach about $300,000 annually.The move could pressure rivals such as Pfizer Inc to lower prices for existing hemophilia treatments, which provide patients with life-saving infusions of a blood clotting agent, according to doctors and industry analysts.Biogen last month won U.S. and Canadian approval for Alprolix to treat hemophilia B, the more rare form of the condition that affects about 4,000 people in the United States and about 25,000 worldwide.""We think we have priced (Alprolix) to create parity with existing therapies on an annual cost of therapy basis,"" Tony Kingsley, Biogen's head of global commercial operations, told Reuters in a telephone interview.Drug pricing in the U.S. market has come under new scrutiny as state governments and health insurers balk over the $84,000 cost of Sovaldi, a new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. It is the first of several new drugs expected on the market over the next two years that are seen as a major breakthrough in treatment of the liver-destroying disease.Treating two-thirds of the estimated 3.2 million U.S. hepatitis C patients with the drug could top $200 billion, according to some analysts.The Biogen hemophilia drug targets a relatively minuscule patient population. But the U.S. biotechnology company, and its peers including Gilead, have seen their shares drop sharply in recent weeks as investors question how much they will be able to charge for novel medicines in the future. Unlike in Europe and elsewhere, where price controls help keep healthcare costs down and drugs may be rejected outright if they are viewed as too expensive for the benefit they provide, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not allowed to take cost into consideration in approving new medicines, and no such price controls on what drugmakers may charge for their products exist.Extremely high prices for lifesaving drugs for rare diseases and genetic disorders have come under less payer pressure because they treat so few patients, even though they must be taken for a lifetime. In addition, the premium pricing had long been perceived as necessary to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop treatments for extremely rare diseases in order to make the payoff worth their while.The recent pricing pressure has evolved as insurance companies and government health plans, such as Medicare and Medicaid, grapple with the skyrocketing expense of innovative new medicines that could be used by tens of thousands, or millions, of patients. They include therapies combining new cancer drugs that could cost $90,000 or more each for a course of treatment, and the hepatitis C drugs that promise a cure with few side effects.FACTORS IN PRICING BIOGEN  Kingsley said Biogen had been discussing the pricing for its new hemophilia drug prior to the furor over Sovaldi. But it would appear that the company has taken public perception of the new medicine's cost into consideration. Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos had signaled earlier this year that if he believed Alprolix was likely to be perceived as more of an advance in convenience than efficacy, it would probably be priced on a par with existing treatments.Biogen, which in the next few months expects a U.S. approval decision for another drug to treat the more common hemophilia A, set a price for Alprolix of $2.85 per international unit. That is more than double the price of about $1.19 per unit for Pfizer's Benefix, one of the most widely used treatments for the disorder. Other approved, older hemophilia B products include Rixubis from Baxter International Inc and Mononine from CSL Behring.But while current drugs are typically needed about two to three times a week, Alprolix is taken once a week or every 10 days, Biogen said. The total annual cost can vary widely based on a patient's weight, the severity of their clotting deficiency and other factors. Deutsche Bank estimates that Biogen's hemophilia products can reach annual sales of $1.2 billion by 2017.""We think it's a meaningful advance in a market that hasn't seen a significant advance in a decade and a half,"" said Kingsley, adding that Alprolix should be available to patients early next month.Hemophilia is a hereditary disorder that prevents blood from clotting properly due to lack of a clotting factor protein in the blood. Patients with more severe hemophilia require larger and more frequent doses of blood clotting factors. Worldwide, about one in 5,000 men are born with hemophilia A and one in 25,000 men are born with hemophilia B each year.Denmark's Novo Nordisk is also developing a long-acting treatment for hemophilia B, and expects to file next year for regulatory approval.Alprolix is a bioengineered version of the blood coagulation protein known as factor IX, which is needed for normal blood clotting. If not properly treated, hemophilia can lead to bleeding into joints and muscles that can cause stiffness, pain, severe joint damage, disability, and death.Biogen developed the drug in partnership with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum ABN.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-18,BIIB,"Fri Apr 18, 2014 | 3:05pm EDT",Exclusive: Biogen prices hemophilia drug on par with older therapies,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-biogen-hemophilia-idUSBREA3H0KL20140418?type=companyNews
24,"   By Bill Berkrot  Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) on Wednesday raised its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts as first-quarter sales of its new Tecfidera multiple sclerosis drug extended a run of eclipsing Wall Street sales expectations.Tecfidera racked up sales of $506 million for the quarter, easily topping analysts' expectations of about $440 million and the previous quarter's sales of $398 million.The oral medicine, which was approved in the United States in March 2013, had been on track to become the drug to reach $1 billion in sales in the shortest time.

30,"   By Bill Berkrot  Biogen Idec Inc and partner Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB on Monday said they will donate hemophilia drugs for use in developing nations in quantities large enough to treat tens of thousands of patients over the next decade.The potentially life-saving clotting factor medicines would be intended for use in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, where three quarters of the world's 400,000 hemophilia sufferers have limited or no access to such drugs, and where most fail to live into adulthood as a result.Biogen and Sobi announced their intention to donate one billion international units of clotting factor drugs over 10 years at the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) meeting in Melbourne, Australia.""WFH do their work in countries that consume less than 1 iu per capita. That's a level below which people are dying, where they don't even have enough to treat the life-threatening bleeds,"" Paula Cobb, Biogen's head of hematology, said in a telephone interview. Hemophilia, an inherited disorder in which the blood does not clot properly, is a new therapeutic area for Biogen. The companies last month received U.S. approval for Alprolix, which treats the more rare hemophilia B. The success of the humanitarian effort will hinge on Food and Drug Administration approval of Eloctate for hemophilia A, which would account for at least 85 percent of the donated product. That approval is expected later this year.Biogen, based in Weston, Massachusetts and Stockholm-based Sobi initially committed to donate up to 500 million units to WFH over five years. The remaining 500 million units will be made available for future distribution.The drugs would primarily be used for emergency treatments rather than preventive care as is common in the developed world, where a year of treatment can cost upwards of $300,000. The quantity of donated product would enable doctors to treat more than 75,000 joint bleeding episodes, more than 2,000 life-threatening bleeds and to perform thousands of surgical procedures that would not be possible without access to clotting drugs, the companies said.""We wanted to do something significant that would change and really shift the way donation programs in that field will work,"" said John Cox, Biogen's head of manufacturing and supply. He added that he hopes other companies would be prompted follow suit. It was not possible to put a commercial value on the donation as Biogen has yet to set a price for Eloctate. Alprolix was priced at $2.85 per unit. ""It is tens of millions of dollars in terms of internal manufacturing supply and cost,"" Cox said.Drugmakers, under pressure from the international community over the high prices of their medicines, have sought to burnish their images by offering HIV drugs and other medicines at drastically reduced cost in Africa and poor nations in other regions. Biogen officials said they were responding to a plea for help from the WFH.""Trying to price this for the developing world was not part of the conversation.

35,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it approved Biogen Idec Inc's long-lasting hemophilia A drug, Eloctate, adding another product to the company's nascent portfolio of drugs for non-malignant blood disorders.Hemophilia A is a rare, inherited blood-clotting disorder that can lead to prolonged bleeding, bruising and joint and tissue damage. It is caused by deficient levels in the body of factor VIII, a protein needed to clot the blood.The FDA's ruling followed its approval in March of Biogen's hemophilia B treatment, Alprolix. Biogen developed both drugs with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi, and expects the products to form the basis of a new non-malignant blood disorder portfolio.""We see Alprolix and Eloctate as the anchor tenants in a growing franchise,"" said Douglas Williams, Biogen's head of research and development. ""We're in this space to stay.""   Biogen's biggest products are currently the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex, Tecfidera and Tysabri.     Eloctate is expected to generate annual sales of $1.5 billion by 2019, according to the average estimate of six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Sales of Alprolix are expected to generate annual sales of $286 million over the same time period.    Current treatments for hemophilia B generate about $1 billion a year, according to Biogen, while the market for hemophilia A therapies is worth about $6 billion.    Hemophilia A is the more common form of the disease, affecting about 16,000 people in the United States, Biogen said. Hemophilia B affected about 4,000 people.     Hemophilia drugs must be infused two to three times a week to prevent bleeding episodes. Eloctate cuts the number of doses needed per week to between three and five days.Biogen has not set a price for the drug, but Tony Kingsley, head of commercial operations, said the cost for patients who switch from a short-acting product to Biogen's longer-acting product should be roughly the same, even though they will be dosing themselves less frequently.     Last month, Weston, Massachusetts-based Biogen and Stockholm-based Sobi said they would donate hemophilia drugs for use in developing nations in quantities large enough to treat tens of thousands of patients over the next decade.

It is caused by deficient levels in the body of factor VIII, a protein needed to clot the blood.  The FDA's ruling follows its approval in March of Biogen's hemophilia B treatment, Alprolix. Biogen developed both drugs with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB and expects the products to form the basis of a new non-malignant blood disorder portfolio.

38,"   By Ransdell Pierson  A drug approved to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys significantly reduced relapses of multiple sclerosis in a late stage-trial sponsored by Biogen Idec and AbbVie Inc, but serious infections and potential liver toxicity continued to cloud the drug's future.The Phase III international study of the medicine, called daclizumab, involved more than 1,800 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the most common form of MS, which can lead to disability and paralysis. The companies disclosed partial results from the new trial on Monday. The study, called DECIDE, tested monthly injections of daclizumab against weekly injections of Biogen's blockbuster Avonex (interferon beta-1a) treatment for MS. Patients taking daclizumab, which is meant to tame the immune system by blocking a protein called the CD25 receptor, had 45 percent fewer annual relapses than those receiving Avonex. In addition, patients taking daclizumab had 54 percent  fewer new or enlarging brain and spinal lesions at week 96 of the study, compared to those taking Avonex; those results met a secondary goal of the study. The overall incidence of side effects was similar in both patient groups. But there was a two-fold higher incidence of serious infections among those taking daclizumab, at 4 percent, as well as a two-fold higher incidence of elevated liver enzymes - a potential marker for liver toxicity.Daclizumab would be a new approach to treating MS, if it is approved for the condition.Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the decline in annual relapses seen with daclizumab was a bit less impressive than the reductions of 52 percent, versus Avonex, achieved in earlier trials by the oral medication Gilenya, which is made by Novartis AG. Gilenya had sales of $1.9 billion last year. ""Our first impression is that these results are good enough for (daclizumab) to be competitive"" with Gilenya and other oral treatments, Arfaei said in a research note.He predicted the Biogen/AbbVie drug could be introduced in 2016 and conservatively generate U.S. sales of $256 million by 2018.Biogen and AbbVie said they would discuss with health regulators the timing for potential marketing applications for daclizumab.  Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG introduced daclizumab in 1997 to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys, under the brand name Zenapax. It stopped selling the drug in 2009 due to poor sales and the availability of newer treatments.Multiple sclerosis is believed to be caused by overactive immune system cells, called t-cells, that attack and destroy the protective covering of nerves.Biogen shares were up 0.8 percent in morning trading on the Nasdaq.

41,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Biogen Idec Inc reported blowout quarterly results and raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday on surging sales of its new Tecfidera oral treatment for multiple sclerosis, boosting shares 11 percent.""These are spectacular results, and this is one of the biggest profit beats for Biogen I've seen in years,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.Tecfidera, which was approved in March 2013, posted sales of $700 million in the second quarter, making it one of the fastest-growing prescription medicines in history. U.S. sales of $585 million far exceeded Wall Street forecasts in the $485 million range.  The drug is taking flight as patients with the progressive neurological disease move from injectable treatments to more convenient pills, including Novartis AG's Gilenya and Sanofi SA's Aubagio.Gilenya, with annual sales of more than $2 billion, in 2010 became the first pill approved for MS, followed by Aubagio, which has annual sales of about $400 million.But Gilenya has been associated with cardiovascular risks, and reports of sudden death, while Aubagio is deemed to be somewhat lacking in potency and raises the risk of liver problems. ""Tecfidera has the best balance of efficacy and safety"" among the three oral agents, said Robert Baird and Co analyst Chris Raymond.He said Tecfidera, which costs about $48,000 a year in the United States and about $30,000 in Europe, could eventually reap annual sales of up to $6 billion.  ""Clearly, if you have to take a chronic therapy, you'd rather take a pill than an injection,"" he said.  Multiple sclerosis affects an estimated 2.3 million people worldwide. The condition, often leading to paralysis, is caused by damage to the protective myelin sheath of nerves and is believed to be the result of attacks by an overactive immune system.Biogen's revenue jumped 40 percent to $2.42 billion, about $250 million above Wall Street expectations. Earnings of $3.49 per share, excluding special items, blew past the $2.83 average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The results prompted Biogen to raise its 2014 earnings outlook to between $12.90 and $13.10 per share. In April, it had forecast $11.35 to $11.45.RBC Capital Markets' Yee said he believed Biogen would likely beat analysts' estimates in coming quarters and keep raising its forecasts.Avonex, an injectable interferon treatment for MS that is still Biogen's biggest product, posted slightly lower sales of $774 million.    Sales of Tysabri, a high-potency infused MS treatment, leaped 38 percent to $533 million. That included $54 million of previously deferred revenue from Italy.The company on Wednesday received European approval for a longer-lasting interferon treatment for MS called Plegridy that is awaiting U.S. approval. Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said he expects Plegridy sales of close to $300 million next year, as some patients switch from Avonex.Leading rival MS brands include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd's Copaxone and its newer version, which is taken less frequently.Others include Bayer AG's Betaseron and Rebif from Pfizer Inc.Biogen is conducting mid-stage trials of an MS drug meant to restore myelin and thereby improve physical and cognitive function. But data from the trial is not expected until 2016, and Schmidt cautioned that it was a high-risk ""speculative"" effort.Biogen said it earned $723.1 million, or $3.01 per share, in the quarter, versus $491 million, or $2.06 per share, a year earlier.Shares of Biogen closed up $33.93, or 11.2 percent, to $337.60 on the Nasdaq.

It is designed to be injected every two weeks compared with weekly injections for Avonex. It is also injected subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly, meaning it requires a smaller needle.Some other MS treatments from the interferon class of medicines, such as Pfizer Inc's Rebif, are dosed more frequently than Avonex. Biogen said it will continue to support Avonex, which has compiled global sales of more than $1.5 billion in the first half of this year, for patients who are comfortable with the treatment and not looking to switch. Avonex has U.S. patent protection until 2026, Biogen said.The company expects Plegridy to diminish Avonex sales and take market share from other rivals even as overall sales from the class decline with the increasing popularity of oral treatments, such as Biogen's Tecfidera, which was approved in 2013. ""We believe Plegridy has the potential to be the leading interferon on the market,"" Tony Kingsley, Biogen's head of global commercial operations, said in a telephone interview.""As the class shrinks, we will be in a position gain share within that class,"" Kingsley said.

48,"  * Indexes turn lower in afternoon trading* Fall in crude oil weighs on energy shares* Investors unnerved by shooting in Ottawa* Indexes down: Dow 0.92 pct, S&P 500 0.73 pct, Nasdaq 0.83 pctBy Yasmeen AbutalebNEW YORK, Oct 22 U.S. stocks erased earlier gains to close lower on Wednesday as a shooting at the Canadian parliament unnerved investors, Boeing and Biogen sold off following results, and energy stocks fell along with oil prices.Indexes had traded in positive territory for much of the session, putting the S&P 500 on track for a fifth straight day of gains. Earnings initially drove the move higher, with technology and material shares up on the back of strong results.Market benchmarks began drifting lower after the government reported a surprise increase in crude oil inventories. Energy shares were off 1.7 percent as crude oil fell, settling near $80 per barrel. Canada's capital was jolted by the fatal shooting of a soldier and an attack on the parliament building in which gunshots were fired outside a room where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking. Toronto stocks fell 1.6 percent, also affected by oil's slide.""The situation out of Ottawa hastened the decline a bit, but I think it started with oil because people are very concerned about global growth,"" said John Canally, chief economic and investment strategist for LPL Financial.If the Ottawa shooting is related to domestic terrorism, Canally added, ""it'll put weight on the markets along with global growth."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell 153.49 points, or 0.92 percent, to 16,461.32, the S&P 500 lost 14.17 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,927.11 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 36.63 points, or 0.83 percent, to 4,382.85.Weaker oil and the Canada violence offset some encouraging economic news. U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in September as energy costs fell broadly, painting a weak inflation picture that could give the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates low.Among the day's earnings movers, Biogen Idec fell 5.4 percent to $309.07 after sales of its multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, fell short of lofty expectations.Boeing Co lost 4.5 percent to $121.91, giving back most of the gains from the four prior sessions. Boeing reported higher-than-expected earnings and lifted its outlook, but analysts raised concern about the costs of the 787 Dreamliner. On the upside, Yahoo Inc and Broadcom  rallied a day after both tech companies reported better-than-expected revenue.Broadcom shares climbed 5.5 percent to $39.37 while Yahoo was up 4.5 percent at $41.99.

69,"  Biogen Idec Inc said an experimental drug showed evidence of biological repair of the optic nerve in patients with acute inflammation of the optic nerve, but shares fell as analysts wondered how promising the mid-stage study results were.The drug is also being tested in patients with multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease that attacks the protective covers of nerve cells, and investors have been watching for the results of the acute optic neuritis study for an indication of how the treatment might fare in that study.The trial on the drug, called Anti-LINGO-1, demonstrated an improvement in recovery of optic nerve latency, or the time it takes for a signal to travel from the retina to the visual cortex, Biogen said. The company said it showed a 34 percent improvement versus a placebo treatment.

The drug failed to meet the trial's secondary endpoint, including change in thickness of the retinal layers and visual function, Biogen said.

74,"   By Bill Berkrot  Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter profit and issued a 2015 earnings forecast that both sailed past Wall Street estimates, driven by strong sales of its oral multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, sending shares more than 7 percent higher. For 2015, Biogen sees adjusted earnings of $16.60 to $17 per share, compared with analysts' estimates for $16.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The U.S. biotechnology company forecast 2015 revenue growing 14 percent to 16 percent over 2014 revenue of $9.7 billion.After a quarter in which Tecfidera sales fell short of analysts' estimates for the first time, the drug topped expectations in the fourth quarter. The company reported  Tecfidera sales of $916 million, while Wall Street was looking for about $880 million.Biogen Chief Executive Officer George Scangos, on a call with analysts, said Tecfidera is now the most prescribed multiple sclerosis (MS) drug in Germany and most prescribed oral MS treatment in the United States. ""We believe Tecfidera will continue to grow in the U.S. and  grow substantially in Europe,"" Scangos said. The company said it has secured reimbursement for Tecfidera in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. It expects to gain full reimbursement across other major European markets this year.The biotechnology company posted a net profit of $883 million, or $3.74 per share, compared with a profit of $457.3 million, or $1.92 per share, a year ago.Excluding items, Biogen earned $4.09 per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 31 cents. Revenue rose 34 percent to $2.64 billion, matching Wall Street expectations.Sales of the injectable MS drug Tysabri of $484 million fell short of Wall Street estimates of $509 million. But sales of interferon-based MS drugs Avonex and the new longer-lasting Plegridy came in at $777 million, topping estimates of about $757 million.The company said about half of Plegridy patients were switching from Avonex with the rest new patients. The company's new hemophilia drugs, Alprolix and Eloctate, posted sales of $40 million and $37 million.Biogen shares rose to $379 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $353.25.

76,"  * Innovative method for financing dementia research* Backers include British govt, GSK, J&J, Pfizer, Lilly, Biogen* J.P. Morgan acted as financial adviser   (Adds plan for additional investment, J.P. Morgan role)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, March 17 The world's first venture capital fund dedicated to finding new ways to prevent and treat dementia has raised more than $100 million with the backing of the British government and several of the world's leading drugmakers.The global Dementia Discovery Fund is unique in focusing on a single difficult to treat disorder and in bringing together industry and government. Drug companies involved include GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Biogen Idec.The initiative, announced by Britain's health minister Jeremy Hunt at a meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, follows a Group of Eight (G8) nations conference in London in December 2013 that set a goal of finding a cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia by 2025.GSK's head of research and development Patrick Vallance told Reuters the 2025 goal was ""hugely ambitious"" but that pooling resources through the new fund to back promising ideas from academic groups and small biotech firms would help to accelerate research. ""It's tough to crack but the science is moving,"" Vallance said. ""People are now beginning to look at subsets of dementia and the genetics of neurodegeneration, so there are real opportunities.""Venture capital funds are a common source of finance for high-risk, early-stage life science research, but the new fund is the first to focus solely on dementia.The British government, which has worked with J.P. Morgan  as financial adviser in setting up the fund, said that additional interested investors would have an opportunity to participate at a later stage. As well as providing financial support, research projects that secure the fund's backing will gain expert advice during the critical early stages of research, with charity Alzheimer's Research UK also involved alongside industry.Individual pharmaceutical companies wanting to go on to  develop particular projects commercially will be able to bid for rights to do so, with money raised from the bidding process to be reinvested in the fund.The British government, as project leader, is contributing $22 million, while GSK is putting in $25 million and J&J $10 million, with further money coming from other companies.Dementia, of which Alzheimer's is the most common form, affects close to 50 million people worldwide and is set to reach 135 million by 2050, according to non-profit campaign group Alzheimer's Disease International.There is still no treatment that can slow the progression of Alzheimer's. Current drugs can do no more than ease some of the symptoms.

77,"   By Bill Berkrot  An experimental drug from Biogen Idec Inc became the  first Alzheimer's treatment to significantly slow cognitive decline and reduce what is believed to be brain-destroying plaque in patients with early and mild forms of the disease, according to a small study likely to reignite hopes of a treatment.Alzheimer's affects 15 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to grow to 75 million by 2030 without effective treatments, likely costing billions of dollars year.Any effective treatment is likely to become one of the world's most lucrative drugs, but the Biogen drug faces years of testing and would not reach the market much before 2020, even if all goes well, analysts said.Biogen shares were up 6.5 percent, or $27.97, at $461.92 in morning trading, after rising as high as $480.18.Biogen is entering a field littered with expensive failures from such drug makers as Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co. Lilly and Roche Holding AG are both conducting trials on drugs that work the same way as Biogen's, by blocking beta amyloid, a protein that forms toxic brain plaques that are theoretically an underlying cause of the degenerative brain disease.  It marks the first time an experimental drug demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in amyloid plaque as well as  a slowing of clinical impairment in patients with mild disease, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen's chief medical officer.""It's a bigger treatment effect than we had hoped for,"" Sandrock said.The trial of the Biogen drug, aducanumab, tested 166 people divided into five groups, four of which each received a different dose, and a fifth that received a placebo.  The Biogen treatment led to reductions in brain amyloid, according to interim data presented at a medical meeting in Nice, France, on Friday. The plaque reduction was more pronounced as the dose of the drug increased and over time.Biogen will begin enrolling patients later this year for a large Phase III trial, whose results could be used to seek approval of its drug. Lilly's solanezumab, a drug for patients with mild Alzheimer's, has been in late-stage trials since 2013, with results expected late in 2016, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. He said the Biogen late-stage trial would not wrap up until 2019. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said by email, ""The magnitude of the efficacy improvements is really striking."" The trial had safety issues and drop outs, particularly by those on high doses, he said, and he wondered if some comparative success to Lilly may be related to trial design.Biogen said it increased its chances of success by carefully screening patients to exclude those with other forms of dementia misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's, and by testing only those early in the disease.  ""We imaged every patient coming into study, so we knew that every patient had Alzheimer's disease and plaque,"" Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos said in an interview. ""It's hard to think of a reason why these data are not representative of the actual activity of the drug.""HIGHER DOSES, GREATER EFFECT Safety and tolerability were considered acceptable, the company said. There was a big jump in the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E), or water surrounding brain tissue, at the two higher doses among patients with a gene associated with the highest risk for developing Alzheimer's. These highest-risk patients also dropped out of the trial at a higher rate. Most of the ARIA-E was asymptomatic or mild and resolved over time, Sandrock said.   Using imaging to measure amyloid in six regions of the brain, researchers found plaque levels were virtually unchanged at 26 and 54 weeks into the study for the placebo group. Patients who received either 3 milligrams per kilogram of weight, 6 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of aducanumab showed a significant and dose-dependent increase in plaque reduction at 26 weeks. There was an even greater reduction in plaque for patients at the 3 mg and 10 mg doses when they were tested at 54 weeks. Data for those in the 6 mg arm was not available at 54 weeks because that group started later. A fourth group of patients who received a 1 mg dose were not helped by the drug.    The trial also used two measures to test cognition: a questionnaire with a 30-point scale to test mental acuity and an 18-point Clinical Dementia Rating scale that also tests for loss of ability to function.On the first test, placebo patients worsened by 3.14 points after one year versus significantly smaller declines for patients receiving aducanumab 3 mg and 10 mg, of 0.75 and 0.58 points, respectively. On the second scale, the placebo group worsened by 2.04 points at one year. While the scores were better for all the drug groups, only the 10 mg dose reached statistical significance, with a decline of 0.59 points. The 6 mg dose could still show a significant slowing on both scales when more data becomes available.

80,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Biogen Idec Inc has seen its market value quadruple in three years to more than $100 billion on the back of its successful multiple sclerosis drugs. Now it has new ambitions in its sights.The Massachusetts-based company, which made headlines last week when it announced better-than-expected clinical trial results for its experimental Alzheimer's drug, aducanumab, said that it will drop Idec from its name as of Monday and adopt a new logo. The company merged with Idec Pharmaceuticals more than a decade ago.Chief Executive George Scangos says that going forward he will keep Biogen focused on developing drugs for some of the hardest-to-treat diseases.               ""Five years down the road, with some luck, we'll have an Alzheimer's drug that's getting approved,” Scangos told Reuters. ""I hope we can transform the treatment of MS. By that time, we will have made substantial progress on ALS and other nerve degenerative diseases, spinal muscular atrophy in kids. All that stuff is on our plate,"" he said.""I am sure of two things,"" he added. ""Not all of it is going to work, and some of it will.""Investors, excited by the aducanumab news, sent Biogen shares up 9.7 percent on Friday, and the company's stock touched an all-time high of $480.18 during the session.The small trial showed the treatment significantly slowed cognitive impairment in patients with mild symptoms, a rare bit of good news in a field littered with high profile failures from the likes of Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and CoBut some patients, especially those with a gene predisposing them to Alzheimer's, developed localized brain swelling. The symptom was most common among patients with the gene who were receiving the highest doses of aducanumab, leading about 1/3 of the participants in that category to discontinue the treatment. The company said the swelling was generally ""asymptomatic or with mild, transient symptoms."" Biogen plans to begin a larger trial later this year. ""If they can replicate the Alzheimer's data in Phase III, they could conceivably have the biggest drug on the planet,"" JMP Securities analyst Michael King said. As many as 75 million people are expected to develop the disease by 2030.For Biogen, which is also working on Alzheimer's drugs that use other mechanisms of action, research on dementia drugs represents an expansion of the company's potential reach. ""If the Alzheimer's thing works, then we're not just an MS company. We are broadly focused on neuro-degenerative diseases,"" Scangos said.The company is also developing a drug it hopes will address not just symptoms but the cause of MS, potentially changing the way the disease is treated. ""The future looks pretty exciting for us,"" said Scangos, who became Biogen CEO in July 2010 following a period of upheaval in which activist investor Carl Icahn pushed for management changes and the sale of the company. Scangos, who previously led the tiny biotech firm Exelixis Inc, was recommended for the CEO post by Icahn lieutenants on the Biogen board.BIGGER MOVE INTO BIOSIMILARS As it works on new medicines for unmet needs, Biogen is also planning a bigger move into the fledgling field of biosimilars, manufacturing cheaper versions of older biotech drugs as they lose patent protection. Health regulators this month approved the first such drug for the U.S. market, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc's white blood cell booster Neupogen. Biogen previously disclosed plans to develop six biosimilar drugs in collaboration with Samsung. ""We will expand that to include more,"" Scangos said.It has filed for European approval of biosimilars of two  blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drugs, Amgen's Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade.Scangos shrugged off the potential impact to Biogen of biosimilars that replicate its own products, even though such competition could result in far cheaper alternatives to its drugs.""I view biosimilars as a good thing,"" he said. ""When they come for our drugs, they come.""  Biogen's ambitions are not without risk. The company saw a ""spectacular failure,"" as Scangos put it, with a large trial of an ALS drug a few years ago, highlighting the challenge ahead.""There was no effect at all,"" Scangos said. ""We've gone back to the drawing board.""

Despite sales of the blockbuster treatment falling about 10 percent from the prior quarter, Clancy said Tecfidera would still be the largest contributor to the company's overall revenue growth.Biogen's market value has more than tripled in the last three years to more than $100 billion due to its lucrative roster of MS drugs.The company's attempts to diversify its pipeline received a boost last month when better-than-expected early-stage results for its drug to treat Alzheimer's sent its stock to an all-time high.

88,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot  Disappointing data for Biogen Inc's experimental Alzheimer's drug dragged shares of the company lower on Wednesday, while investors took a slightly more positive view of new findings for a treatment from Eli Lilly and Co.Shares of Biogen traded 3.9 percent lower in midafternoon after falling as much as 4.9 percent, while Lilly was up slightly, recovering from a decline of 4.7 percent after the two companies released study data at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington. Wall Street analysts said the initial Lilly drop may have been influenced by the negative take on Biogen, since both of their drugs work by blocking formation of the protein beta amyloid, which is believed to cause brain plaques that are the hallmark of Alzheimer's.Alzheimer's experts said there were signs for hope for both treatments, but they will wait for results of much larger confirmatory trials before getting excited.""Developments are moving in the right direction, but are not of the magnitude that will change the world tomorrow,"" said Dr. David Knopman, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and deputy editor of the journal Neurology. ""There are hints of genuine benefits.""  Biogen's drug aducanumab had been hailed as a potential breakthrough in March, when a small study showed that 3 milligram and 10 mg doses slowed cognitive decline and reduced brain plaques.Investors had hoped that a 6 mg dose could be a safer and effective alternative to the 10 mg dose, which had also produced high rates of a type of brain swelling. On Wednesday, researchers said the 6 mg dose failed to significantly slow mental decline even though it clearly demonstrated an amyloid reduction.    ""If they're getting brain swelling at 10 mgs and their 6 mg dose is showing limited efficacy, it draws into question Biogen's program,"" said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, who is attending the Alzheimer's meeting. Lilly researchers said on Wednesday that patients with mild Alzheimer's disease who took the company's solanezumab early in the course of their disease preserved more of their cognitive and functional ability than patients who received the treatment at a later stage.Boris said Lilly's solanezumab, if successful in a new large-scale study, is likely to be approved by 2017. That would bring it to the market at least two years before aducanumab, and represent the first medicine to slow progression of the disease affecting 5 million Americans. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the Lilly data was only ""slightly encouraging"" because it did not compare solanezumab with a placebo.Other analysts said Biogen's aducanumab could still prove a potent treatment when tested in a larger population.""The benefit still looks robust to us and better than Lilly's solanezumab,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum.

93,"   By Natalie Grover  Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) more than halved its sales growth forecast for 2015, saying it expects demand for its flagship multiple sclerosis (MS) drug, Tecfidera, to continue slowing this year in the United States.Tecfidera has been Biogen's main growth driver since its launch in 2013, but a saturated U.S. market and reports linking the drug to brain infections meant that sales rose less than analysts expectations for the second straight quarter.Biogen's stock fell as much as 18.8 percent to a seven-month low, wiping out about $17 billion of its value, after the company's weak forecast and lackluster second-quarter results on Friday.The company also reported disappointing sales for its other MS drugs. Sales of injectable MS drug Tysabri and interferon-based MS drug Avonex fell more than analysts expected, while sales of the longer-lasting Plegridy also missed estimates.Biogen needs ""fixing"", and it does not have the luxury of time to build out its pipeline gradually like Celgene Corp (CELG.O) does, Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer said. Biogen plans to continue investing in its pipeline, while controlling costs, the biotech company's executives said on a conference call.""I don't think we're in any panic situation but as we see good opportunities we will be aggressive about bringing them in,"" CEO George Scangos said after analysts on the call suggested Biogen consider acquisitions to rejuvenate growth.Biogen said it now assumes ""extremely limited"" U.S. patient growth for Tecfidera sequentially for the rest of 2015, and also highlighted lower-than-anticipated reimbursements in Europe. With Tecfidera's sales slowing, Biogen chopped its full-year sales growth forecast to 6-8 percent from 14-16 percent. The company's sales had risen 40 percent in 2014 and 25.7 percent in 2013.Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen's second-quarter sales rose 7 percent to $2.6 billion, but missed analysts' average estimate of $2.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Biogen's stock hit a record high in March when tests showed the company's experimental Alzheimer's drug significantly slowed mental decline – a potential breakthrough in treating the incurable disease.

Tecfidera has been Biogen's main growth driver since its launch in 2013, but a saturated U.S. market and reports linking the drug to brain infections meant that sales rose less than analysts expectations for the second straight quarter.Biogen's stock fell as much as 18.8 percent to a seven-month low, wiping out about $17 billion of its value, after the company's weak forecast and lackluster second-quarter results on Friday.The company also reported disappointing sales for its other MS drugs. Sales of injectable MS drug Tysabri and interferon-based MS drug Avonex fell more than analysts expected, while sales of the longer-lasting Plegridy also missed estimates.Biogen needs ""fixing"", and it does not have the luxury of time to build out its pipeline gradually like Celgene Corp  does, Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer said. Biogen plans to continue investing in its pipeline, while controlling costs, the biotech company's executives said on a conference call.""I don't think we're in any panic situation but as we see good opportunities we will be aggressive about bringing them in,"" CEO George Scangos said after analysts on the call suggested Biogen consider acquisitions to rejuvenate growth.Biogen said it now assumes ""extremely limited"" U.S. patient growth for Tecfidera sequentially for the rest of 2015, and also highlighted lower-than-anticipated reimbursements in Europe. With Tecfidera's sales slowing, Biogen chopped its full-year sales growth forecast to 6-8 percent from 14-16 percent. The company's sales had risen 40 percent in 2014 and 25.7 percent in 2013.Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen's second-quarter sales rose 7 percent to $2.6 billion, but missed analysts' average estimate of $2.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Biogen's stock hit a record high in March when tests showed the company's experimental Alzheimer's drug significantly slowed mental decline - a potential breakthrough in treating the incurable disease.But that enthusiasm was tempered on Wednesday, after longer term data showed that a particular dose of the drug failed to significantly slow mental decline.Relying on the Alzheimer's program is too risky, said Schimmer, who hacked his price target on the stock by $49 to $361.Biogen's stock was down 18.5 percent at $315, easing slightly from its session low of $312.50.

Vivus officials could not immediately be reached for comment.Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and also run large mail-order pharmacies, have been challenging the rising cost of new medications. When drugs are knocked off their formularies, patients may have to pay full price for them. PBMs often keep or dump a product depending on whether they can obtain favorable pricing.Viagra, the world's first approved pill for erectile dysfunction, has annual sales of $1.8 billion, including $1.3 billion in the United States.

Worldwide sales of Amgen's Enbrel, which is marketed outside North America by Pfizer, totalled $9 billion last year, with Europe accounting for about $2.5 billion.Samsung Bioepis, a joint venture between Samsung Biologics and Biogen, is taking aim at that business with its version of etanercept, as Enbrel is known scientifically.A marketing application for biosimilar etanercept is being assessed by experts at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) this week, according to an EMA agenda. There is currently only one such application pending at the EMA and a Biogen spokeswoman confirmed the assessment referred to its product.Because biosimilars are made inside living cells they can never be exact duplicates of the original medicine, so manufacturers need to conduct clinical trials to show their products work as intended.That makes them more difficult to produce than conventional generic medicines but potentially more profitable. Biosimilar etanercept, which was recently approved in South Korea, would be the second such antibody product to reach the market in Europe and its arrival is likely to intensify competition. European doctors are already able to prescribe biosimilar infliximab, a copy of Merck's Remicade.The infliximab biosimilar is gaining ground in certain European countries after some surprisingly steep price discounts. In some cases these have reached nearly 70 percent, though overall the discounts have been nearer 45 percent.Assuming biosimilar etanercept is given a green light from the EMA this week, its approval will still have to be formally ratified by the European Commission, a process that normally takes a couple of months.Biogen will market the drug in Europe and manufacture it at a factory in Denmark.In a further boost for biosimilars, Novartis's  Sandoz unit said on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had accepted its submission for approval of a biosimilar version of Amgen's Neulasta, which fights infections in cancer patients.(Editing by David Goodman)",2015-11-18,BIIB,"Wed Nov 18, 2015 | 7:11am EST",UPDATE 1-Europe could recommend second biosimilar arthritis drug this week,http://www.reuters.com//article/biotech-europe-biosimilars-idUSL8N13D2E820151118?type=companyNews

120,"  Biogen Inc plans to spin off its hemophilia drug business as a publicly traded company, leaving the drugmaker to focus on developing drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, the company said on Tuesday.Biogen said it considered a number of alternatives including a sale before deciding to split the business in a tax-free transaction, which it said would deliver the most value to     its shareholders.The new company will include treatments Eloctate and Alprolix for hemophilia A and B, which had total sales of $554.2 million in 2015, about 5 percent of Biogen's revenue. Hemophilia is a group of hereditary genetic disorders that impairs the body's ability to control blood clotting. Biogen began a sweeping restructuring program in October to cut costs and focus on core areas such as neurology and autoimmune diseases. In April, Reuters reported that it was looking at selling the hemophilia assets.After that report, Citi analyst Robyn Karnauskas said the business could be worth $4.8 billion to $6.4 billion. Biogen expects the transaction to occur by the end of this year or early next year.Biogen will focus on developing drugs for neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and neuropathic pain. It will keep its bestselling MS drug, Tecfidera. The company's promising Alzheimer's drug candidate generated excitement last year after early data showed a reduction in amyloid plaque in the brain and some cognitive improvement.Biogen's collaboration on Eloctate and Alproprix with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB will continue, CEO George Scangos said during a conference call with analysts. The move to spin off the hemophilia drugs would have been premature 6 or 12 months ago, he said.    ""It's not really a shift in strategy. It is the fact that the business has matured. It is doing very well. It is profitable. It can stand on its own,"" Scangos said. The area of the company focused on hemophilia also has a pipeline of experimental products that need to be ""aggressively"" developed, he said. Biogen's executive vice president, pharmaceutical operations and technology, John Cox, will be the chief executive officer of the new company, which will be based in the Boston area, Biogen said.Biogen shares were largely unchanged in early trading at $274.52, versus their Monday close of $273.67.

126,"  Biogen Inc's keenly watched experimental drug for treating multiple sclerosis failed to meet the main goal of improving some symptoms in a mid-stage study, sending the company's shares down as much as 9 percent in premarket trading.The drug, opicinumab, did not improve overall physical and cognitive function and the progression of disability in patients, the company said on Tuesday.However, Biogen said the drug showed evidence of a clinical effect in patients, and that it would continue to analyze the data to decide on the next steps for the program.Though Biogen clearly has not ruled out further exploration, moving into a late-stage study at this point seems highly unlikely, Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note.""We see increased risk to the program overall from the mixed results,"" he added.Analysts have previously said the drug represents a multi-billion opportunity for Biogen given its potential to repair nerve damage caused by multiple sclerosis, a nervous system disease affecting the brain and the spinal cord. Biogen is targeting high-priority medicines in its pipeline after concerns over stalling demand for its key MS drug, Tecfidera, in recent quarters.The company has embarked on a restructuring program, shifted focus to its much-anticipated Alzheimer's disease drug and announced plans to spin off its hemophilia drug business as a publicly traded entity.Biogen must do more to extend its core competencies beyond MS, given that the disease has faced a pause in medical advances, Piper Jaffray analyst Joshua Schimmer said on Tuesday. ""A new approach to R&D and asset allocation in our view would be prudent,"" he said.The study, which enrolled 418 patients, was the second mid-stage trial testing opicinumab.

130,"  Biogen Inc's keenly watched experimental drug for treating multiple sclerosis failed to meet the main goal of improving some symptoms in a mid-stage study, sending the company's shares down as much as 9 percent in premarket trading.The drug, opicinumab, did not improve overall physical and cognitive function and the progression of disability in patients, the company said on Tuesday.However, Biogen said the drug showed evidence of a clinical effect in patients, and that it would continue to analyze the data to decide on the next steps for the program.Though Biogen clearly has not ruled out further exploration, moving into a late-stage study at this point seems highly unlikely, Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note.""We see increased risk to the program overall from the mixed results,"" he added.Analysts have previously said the drug represents a multi-billion opportunity for Biogen given its potential to repair nerve damage caused by multiple sclerosis, a nervous system disease affecting the brain and the spinal cord. Biogen is targeting high-priority medicines in its pipeline after concerns over stalling demand for its key MS drug, Tecfidera, in recent quarters.The company has embarked on a restructuring program, shifted focus to its much-anticipated Alzheimer's disease drug and announced plans to spin off its hemophilia drug business as a publicly traded entity.Biogen must do more to extend its core competencies beyond MS, given that the disease has faced a pause in medical advances, Piper Jaffray analyst Joshua Schimmer said on Tuesday. ""A new approach to R&D and asset allocation in our view would be prudent,"" he said.The study, which enrolled 418 patients, was the second mid-stage trial testing opicinumab.

If approved, analysts expect the drug to generate between $1 billion to $2 billion in peak sales.Ionis is eligible to receive tiered royalties on any potential sales of nusinersen up to a certain percentage, and up to $150 million in milestone payments.Carlsbad, California-based Ionis' shares jumped about 33.4 percent to $38.95.

159,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Allergan Plc (AGN.N) CEO Brent Saunders calls them ""stepping stones"" - small, bolt-on acquisitions, as opposed to the mega-deals common in the drug industry. And they're expected to boost dealmaking in sectors ranging from neurology to skin care.Allergan's agreement on Tuesday to acquire liver drug developer Tobira Therapeutics Inc (TBRA.O) for $1.7 billion may seem trivial compared to the proposed $160 billion deal Allergan crafted last year to sell itself to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).But that deal was torpedoed in April by the U.S. Treasury's latest curbs on tax inversions. Now the company, domiciled in Ireland, is taking a new tack, preparing to spend a war chest of more than $20 billion on stepping-stone deals. The small deals are aimed at filling gaps in its core therapeutic areas, which range from the central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases, to dermatology and eye care.Allergan has added four other small companies to its portfolio this year, three of which sold for less than $100 million upfront, plus performance payments. Two, ForSight Vision and Retrosense Therapeutics, treat eye disorders. The others, Topokine Therapeutics and Vitae Pharmaceuticals Inc. VTAE.O, focus on dermatology. Allergan agreed to acquire Vitae last week for $639 million.The fact that Allergan is paying top dollar for some of these companies - including a nearly 600 percent premium for Tobira, excluding performance payments - has investors and dealmakers speculating about the company's next stepping stone.Logical acquisition targets for Allergan would include Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (ACAD.O), a maker of treatments for Parkinson’s disease; Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc (ITCI.O), a developer of psychiatric medications; Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O), which focuses on neurology and women’s health; and Dermira Inc (DERM.O), a dermatology company, according to investment bankers and industry investors. In an interview with Reuters, Saunders declined to comment on any specific companies that Allergan may want to acquire next. But he said that stepping stones will play a key role in helping the company continue to meet its ambitious annual revenue growth target of 10 percent for years to come. ""I needed to do big deals to get where we are, but the strategic vision was always to get to a point where we could use stepping stones,"" Saunders said. 	 Allergan has relied heavily on M&A because it views inventing its own drugs in-house as too risky. Saunders, 46, has attempted or executed mergers and acquisitions totaling more than $300 billion in the last three years. Allergan now has the money to embark on a major acquisition spree thanks to the sale of its generic drug portfolio to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). Allergan received $33.4 billion in cash and $5.1 billion in Teva stock last month as a result of that deal. While Allergan has pledged to spend some of those dollars on share buybacks, it will still have cash reserves of more than $20 billion it can spend on deals.	Allergan wants to build out its central nervous system franchise, which is one of the largest in the industry and treats diseases including Alzheimer's, depression, migraines and schizophrenia, Saunders said.     He added that he would like to branch out into other types of neurological treatments, including multiple sclerosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson's disease.     One of Allergan's successful endeavors in the central nervous system space, its Namenda Alzheimer's franchise, took a hit over the past year after one of its key drugs, Namenda IR, lost patent protection. Namenda IR generated more than $500 million in 2015.   Allergan is hoping that a ramp-up of its newly commercialized anti-psychotic drug, Vraylar, can help offset that decline.BOTOX AS A GATEWAY DRUG Saunders said he also is optimistic about opportunities in dermatology and eye care, adding that he would be open to a medium-sized deal to build out its opthalmic products.      In dermatology, Allergan has the world's biggest franchise by sales, largely due to its flagship drug, Botox, for wrinkle-smoothing.Last year, in a stepping-stone acquisition, Allergan bought a publicly traded dermatology company called Kythera for $2.1 billion, and it has been ramping up sales of its key drug, Kybella, which treats double chins.""There's definitely potential for more deals like that in dermatology,"" said Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""Botox is a gateway product into the entire world of aesthetics.""In the interview, Saunders left open the possibility of a transformative acquisition or merger for Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $95 billion.He said a company with a cutting-edge treatment that reversed Alzheimer's was an example of the type of big deal Allergan would consider making.    Biogen Inc BIIB.N and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) both have late stage drugs that promise to reverse the effects of the degenerative neurological disease. Biogen and Eli Lilly have market capitalizations of $65 billion and $86 billion, respectively.Reuters reported in August that Allergan had held informal conversations with some members of Biogen's board before deciding against any acquisition offer.

162,"   By Bill Berkrot  Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) on Wednesday reported better-than-expected third quarter profit, driven by higher sales of its lead multiple sclerosis drug and lower costs, and its shares rose more than 4 percent.However, investor focus is likely to turn to promising new drugs in late-stage development, including a potential blockbuster Alzheimer's treatment, and the company's search for a successor to Chief Executive George Scangos, who in July said he would step down once his replacement is found.Scangos, on a conference call with analysts, said the CEO search was progressing and that ""very high quality"" candidates were being interviewed, but he declined to provide a timeline.""The sooner we have a new CEO come in, the better it is for all of us,"" Scangos said.The company expressed encouragement over early data it has seen for the Alzheimer's drug aducanumab, currently in Phase III testing, and said more data would be presented at a medical meeting in December. ""What was most important was comments around Alzheimer's, noting again their view of consistent efficacy and safety from the prior data, referring to cognitive endpoints as well as biomarker data,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, calling aducanumab ""potentially the most exciting Alzheimer's drug in late stage development.""Any successful Alzheimer's treatment is virtually assured of becoming a multibillion-dollar product, given the huge need.Biogen also said it filed its application with U.S.  regulators seeking priority review for nusinersen, which would be the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants. Priority review for the drug, being developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS.O), would bring an approval decision within six months. ""Many investors are debating whether or not this could get a very, very fast approval given the unmet medical need. There's a lot of enthusiasm over that,"" Yee said. ""The are filing for a broad label, which could be significant upside if that occurs."" Biogen also sees biosimilars as an important growth opportunity. It has begun selling cheaper versions of Amgen's (AMGN.O) Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) Remicade rheumatoid arthritis drugs in Europe.Excluding items, Biogen earned $5.19 per share in the quarter, topping analysts' expectations by 22 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.       Sales of the biotechnology company's market-leading oral MS drug Tecfidera of $1.03 billion, edged past analysts' estimates of $1 billion.     Total revenue rose 6 percent to $2.96 billion, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $2.91 billion.Biogen shares were up $13 at $299.22 on Nasdaq.

An interim analysis found that patients with a less-severe form of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who received the drug, Spinraza (nusinersen), experienced significant improvement in motor function compared with those who didn't.A separate late-stage study in August evaluating the drug in patients with the most-severe form of SMA was stopped early after the drug was found effective.SMA disrupts the part of the nervous system that controls voluntary muscle movement, eventually taking away an individual's ability to walk, eat or breathe. Currently, there is no approved treatment for the condition and it affects about 1 in 10,000 babies, and some 1 in 50 Americans is a genetic carrier, according to Illinois-based Cure SMA.Monday's announcement increases the probability of Spinraza obtaining a broad initial label, analysts said. Biogen, which agreed to pay Ionis a $75 million license fee to take responsibility for the drug's development, regulatory and commercialization activities in August, is preparing for a potential U.S. launch of Spinraza, possibly by the end of the year or the first quarter of 2017.This timeline is shorter than what most analysts had forecast, and Ionis is eligible to receive royalties on potential sales of the drug and up to $150 million in milestone payments.Spinraza could provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen, which hasn't seen big organic growth since the launch of multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera and has faced several late-stage setbacks over the past year.This data gives Biogen and Ionis a head start over rival gene therapy developer Avexis Inc, which is also working on an SMA treatment.""Even with gene therapy competition we still think Spinraza can achieve more than $1 billion-$2 billion in peak annual revenue,"" Piper Jaffray & Co analysts said.

170,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Eli Lilly & Co's massive setback for its experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment on Wednesday sent investors scrambling to re-evaluate shares of the U.S. drugmaker and those of companies making competing therapies, including biotech stalwart Biogen Inc.Lilly shares tumbled 10.5 percent, and fell to their lowest point in two years during the session, after the company said its drug failed to slow loss of cognitive ability in patients with mild symptoms. The shares were on pace for their biggest one-day percentage decline since the 2008 financial crisis, shaving about $9 billion of market value.Biogen shares were down 4 percent, but had reduced their initial losses by more than half from premarket trading as investors assessed the damage to the prospects of the company's drug that works in a similar way to Lilly's.The results for Lilly's solanezumab were a highly anticipated event on Wall Street, with some analysts saying the company's shares could have leapt 20 percent or more had the clinical trial succeeded.Although Alzheimer's disease has been a notoriously difficult area for drug development, some investors were clearly optimistic that the drug would meet the study goals. A buy-side investor survey by Evercore ISI at the end of September found that 56 percent had expected the study to meet its main goal.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover had been factoring in a 50-percent chance of solanezumab approval, with peak probability sales of nearly $4 billion a year.  ""Therefore, the negative trial results have a large impact on our fair value estimate.""Lilly's shares had traded at just over 19 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months ahead of the study results, making their shares more expensive than other large U.S. and European drugmakers.

According to Starmine data, Lilly's average annual earnings per share growth is expected to be 7.8 percent over the next five years, nearly double that of peers.Lilly executives themselves have told analysts on recent quarterly conference calls they project average annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent a year through 2020, even without solanezumab.

172,"  (Corrects name of Dr. Gandy in paragraphs 16 and 18)By Ransdell PiersonNov 23 Eli Lilly and Co said its experimental Alzheimer's treatment failed to slow the loss of mental functioning in patients with mild symptoms, a major setback for the company and millions of people at risk of developing the memory-robbing disease.Many investors and families had been counting on solanezumab to become the first approved medicine to slow progression of the disease, which the Alzheimer's Association estimates will strike as many as 28 million Americans by midcentury.Lilly shares were down 11.7 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. drugmaker announced the long-awaited results of its large Expedition 3 study, which showed patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a significantly greater slowing in cognitive decline than those given placebos.The news also caused a 4.3 percent drop in shares of Biogen Inc, which is testing a drug that, like solanezumab, targets the beta amyloid protein believed to cause toxic brain plaques that are considered a hallmark of Alzheimer's.Given the trial's results, Lilly said it would not seek U.S. approval of its drug for mild dementia.Incoming Chief Executive Officer David Ricks called the news ""heart-breaking.""Lilly spent more than $3 billion on Alzheimer's research over the past 27 years and will keep pushing for effective treatments, he said. He noted solanezumab was being studied in a separate trial called ""A4"" among people with no Alzheimer's symptoms but who have the brain plaques. The company said it would take a $150 million charge in the fourth quarter for the failed trial and provide an updated 2016 financial outlook, as well as 2017 forecasts, on Dec. 15.Ricks affirmed Lilly's forecast for annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent between 2015 and 2020. The company has strong growth prospects without solanezumab because of recently approved treatments for diabetes, cancer and other conditions, he said.Some analysts had said solanezumab, if approved, could generate up to $10 billion in annual sales and boost Lilly's earnings for years to come.The infused drug works by binding in the bloodstream to beta amyloid.Biogen is racing to complete Phase III trials of aducanumab, which is designed to clear beta amyloid that has already formed plaques. However, the solanezumab data raises questions about whether beta amyloid is a valid target for Alzheimer's drugs. Biogen officials did not respond to requests for comment.STILL HOPE FOR TREATMENTS As with cancer, many experts believe combinations of medicines, each having different mechanisms, will be needed to greatly slow Alzheimer's progress or stop it in its tracks. One of the biggest hopes is a class of experimental drugs called BACE inhibitors, which work by blocking production of beta amyloid. Lilly and others, including Biogen and Merck & Co , are conducting late-stage trials of such drugs.Dr. Sam Gandy, director of Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Center for Cognitive Health, was not ready to abandon drugs that reduce amyloid.""My guess is that they would be part of a cocktail with something else, that they won't in and of themselves be enough,"" he said.Amyloid drugs may work best in patients who have yet to develop plaques readable on scans, Gandy added.In two original 18-month studies completed in 2012, solanezumab failed to slow cognitive decline or loss of physical functioning for the 1,000 patients with mild to moderate disease in each trial.But the combined data for just mildly affected patients suggested solanezumab caused significant slowdowns of 34 percent in mental decline and 18 percent in loss of functional abilities, compared with those taking a placebo, researchers said.For Expedition 3, Lilly extended the pair of large trials by another two years and enrolled only mildly impaired patients. Researchers continued to provide solanezumab to patients who had taken it during the initial studies and also allowed the placebo groups to switch to solanezumab.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2016-11-23,BIIB,"Wed Nov 23, 2016 | 1:49pm EST",CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Lilly's drug for Alzheimer's fails big trial; shares drop,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-alzheimers-lilly-idUSL1N1DO0HR?type=companyNews
