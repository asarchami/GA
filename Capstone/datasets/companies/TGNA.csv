0,"  NEW YORK Shares of Tegna, the broadcasting and digital company being carved out of USA Today owner Gannett Co Inc, could rise 20 percent in the coming year after the two companies split on Monday, according to the June 29 edition of Barron's.Tegna will own 46 broadcast stations, along with the Cars.com and CareerBuilder websites. Gannett will continue to own USA Today, along with 92 local U.S. newspapers, and a number of British papers. Existing shareholders will get one share of the new Gannett for every two shares they already own in the parent company, now called Tegna.  Tegna's revenue is expected to jump 20 percent, to $3.1 billion, this year, with broadcast revenue alone slated to jump 18 percent, to $1.96 billion, the financial newspaper said. If Tegna were to fetch a similar multiple to its peer Nexstar Broadcasting Group, the stock would be worth $37, Barron's said. Tegna's shares are scheduled to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, and its shares will probably open at about $30, it added.    Gannett's ""when issued"" shares were trading last week at $14.90. Its shares will be lucky to tread water as the company seeks a whole new shareholder base, Barron's said.

10,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Tegna Inc, the broadcast and digital company that split from Gannett Co Inc earlier this year, has assembled a group of employees to make local broadcast television, including news, more interesting to a younger audience.The McLean, Virginia-based company is also trying to create more original programming and discussing ways to better integrate its lineup with social media, Chief Executive Officer Gracia Martore told Reuters earlier this month. ""We need to change and transform so we can continue to reach folks not just in the boomer generation, but younger,"" she said.Local broadcasters, like cable networks, are trying to appeal to a younger generation of viewers who are increasingly ""cutting the cord,"" or dropping cable bundles in favor of watching their favorite shows online. Martore compared the state of local news to how late-night talk shows used to be viewed as dinosaurs.  ""Everyone would talk about how no one watches late-night shows anymore,"" she said, ""but then in comes Jimmy Fallon, and he doubles the audience because he is doing it in a new and different way and he uses social media and has a YouTube channel.""Over the past few months, Tegna has assembled a group of about 50 employees throughout the company to come up with various ways to pique the interest of younger viewers, whether through social media or other means.Martore recalled how after the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012, one of its local news anchors started answering viewers' questions he received through Twitter while on the air. ""There is more like that we can do to engage our viewers,"" she said.The company plans to test different ideas in various of its 46 stations throughout the coming months. One such idea is having viewers call in through video chat, as opposed to traditional phone calls, during shows.Tegna has tested the format in some of its Denver programming with Video Call Center, a technology company that it invested in earlier this year, and is discussing other ways it can use it.Martore did not rule out acquisitions as a way to reach younger viewers but said it was unlikely to make any big ones.

Tribune said on Monday that it would respond as quickly as possible after Gannett said that its target has refused ""to engage in a dialogue.""The proposed deal comes at a difficult time for newspaper publishers, which are grappling with high costs, shrinking advertising dollars and a broad move toward digital content. Gannett has been on a mission to buy up rivals to create a larger, more efficient company by expanding its footprint into more cities and expanding its scale.It is fresh off buying Journal Media Group and is now looking to enter more cities, Dickey said. Tribune owns the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune newspapers, as well as metro dailies like the Orlando Sentinel.Gannett first notified Tribune of its interest in a letter on April 12. Six days later, it sent a new letter to Tribune asking for a response. On April 22, Tribune responded that it had hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Lazard Ltd to review the proposal. Gannett is being advised by former Lazard banker John Chachas' firm, Methuselah Advisors.Peter Lewis of Towle & Co, the seventh-largest shareholder in Tribune, said Gannett's offer price was well below the investment firm's sell target, which was in the ""high teens.""

21,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis  Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK.N), the second largest shareholder in Tribune Publishing Co TPUB.N, wants the U.S. newspaper company to explore a sale, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Oaktree's support for a sale of Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times and Orlando Sentinel, could help Gannett Co Inc's (GCI.N) campaign to buy the company. Last month, Gannett made an unsolicited takeover offer for Tribune at $12.25 per share in cash, in a deal worth roughly $815 million.The proposed deal came at a challenging time for the newspaper industry, which is grappling with high costs, shrinking advertising dollars and a broad move toward digital content.While Oaktree is not in favor of selling Tribune for $815 million, the Los Angeles-based investment firm wants the company to actively engage with Gannett and other potential buyers to seek a higher price, the people said.  The sources asked not to be identified because Oaktree has not made its views public. Oaktree, Tribune and Gannett declined to comment.Oaktree, which owns 14.82 percent of Tribune, is the largest shareholder besides Merrick Media LLC, the investment firm that controls the company and is led by Tribune chairman Michael Ferro. Merrick owns roughly 16 percent of the company.   Gannett has been frustrated with Tribune's lack of engagement and urgency to pursue a deal. Tribune has hired advisers and said it is responding as quickly as it can to Gannett's overtures. On Monday, Gannett urged Tribune shareholders to withhold their votes for board nominees during Tribune's annual meeting June 2.Gannett Chief Executive Robert Dickey said in a statement on Monday that Tribune stockholders, by withholding their votes, would send a ""clear message"" to Tribune's board that it should engage in talks with the company.  Tribune responded with a statement that said Gannett has no path to control the company, and that ""their tactics clearly demonstrate a desperate and opportunistic attempt to steal the company."" Tribune Publishing shares fell 1 percent Monday to $11.21 per share while Gannett shares were trading down 0.2 percent at $16.80 per share. Tribune's quarterly earnings call is scheduled for Wednesday. (Reporting by Liana B.

U.S. stocks fell on Friday as gloomy quarterly reports from retailers overshadowed upbeat April retail sales data, leaving the Dow and the S&P 500 lower for the third straight week.""The market has been shaken by the depth and breadth of the negativity coming out of the retailing stocks,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.""The market is going to have to make an evaluation if this is going to be a one-time blip or is this something that continues to bear down.""S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.5 points, or 0.02 percent, with 154,927 contracts traded at 8:34 a.m. ET (1234 GMT). Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7 points, or 0.16 percent, on volume of 25,082 contracts. Dow e-minis were down 4 points, or 0.02 percent, with 24,924 contracts changing hands. Data from China over the weekend also raised doubts about whether the world's second-largest economy was stabilizing. Retail sales, factory output and fixed-asset investment all grew more slowly than expected in April.Investors will also be keeping a watch on data scheduled to be released today. U.S. homebuilder sentiment likely rose a bit in May. NAHB Housing Market index is expected to have increased to 59 from 58 in April. The data is expected at 10 a.m. ET.Manufacturing activity in New York State fell to its lowest level since February. The New York Fed's Empire State general business conditions index tumbled to -9.02 in May from 9.56 in April, and well below the estimated 6.50. Investors have been keeping a sharp eye on data for clues regarding the path of interest rate increases. Some Federal Reserve officials have hinted at two rate hikes this year, but traders are pricing in only one.While the S&P 500 has risen about 15 percent since February lows, that rally fizzled out in the last few weeks due to disappointing corporate earnings and mixed economic data.For every company that has given an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, more than two have warned of disappointing earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Apple shares were up 1.6 percent at $91.87 in premarket trading after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway  reported a stake in the firm.Tribune Publishing was up 22.9 percent at $14.10 after Gannett raised its buyout offer to $15 per share. Gannett was little changed at $15.63.Anacor Pharmaceuticals jumped 53.9 percent to $98.60 after Pfizer said it would buy the drugmaker in a deal valued at $5.2 billion.

46,"   By Liana B. Baker  Shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co said in a report that Tribune Publishing Co TPUB.N shareholders should not heed Gannett Co Inc's (GCI.N) call to withhold votes for Tribune's board nominees at its upcoming annual meeting on June 2.""We believe Gannett has offered insufficient cause for investors to support its current campaign,"" Glass Lewis said in the report, which was published on Tuesday and seen by Reuters Wednesday. Gannett missed the nomination deadline for offering its own slate of directors.Glass Lewis said in its report that withholding votes is an imprecise way of gauging investor sentiment regarding a deal with Gannett, and that Tribune shareholders have been given very little time to assess the Tribune management turnaround plan announced three months ago.In response to the Glass Lewis report, Gannett reiterated that shareholders withhold their votes and said it will review whether to proceed with its offer for Tribune after seeing results of the upcoming vote.  Last month, Gannett made an unsolicited takeover offer for Tribune at $12.25 per share in cash, in a deal worth roughly $815 million. It followed up this month with a $15 per share offer for Tribune, worth roughly $864 million.Glass Lewis said Tribune has made what appears to be a ""reasonable engagement effort"" with Gannett over its recent takeover offers. It said Tribune's board is well equipped to evaluate or reject bids that seem opportunistic by Gannett or other parties. Larger proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc said during the weekend that it recommends that Tribune shareholders vote for the nominated directors. In a reminder that not all Tribune Publishing shareholders are happy with the company's decisions, investment manager Towle & Co, which owns a 3.9 percent stake in the company, wrote to its board this week to call on it to engage in talks with Gannett.""From our view as an unaffiliated shareholder, the Tribune board of directors has abandoned its fiduciary responsibility of maximizing shareholder value,"" Towle & Co wrote in the letter.Tribune's second-largest shareholder, Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK.N), has also said it also is in favor of Tribune Publishing putting itself up for sale and engaging with Gannett.  Earlier this week, Tribune received a $70.5 million investment from Los Angeles billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, who became the company's second largest shareholder, paying $15 per share, the same price that Tribune last offered for the entire company.Glass Lewis said this investment is likely to attract scrutiny because of its timing and size but said the company is in the early stages of its turnaround and shareholders should give the company time to evaluate the new management and board structure. Tribune adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, earlier this month. Glass Lewis said that, while the firm is usually not in favor of poison pills, Tribune's move does not warrant withholding votes from board nominees. (Reporting by Liana B.

Unable to press on with its $864 million bid for Tribune Publishing, and having missed a deadline to put forward its own board nominees, Gannett had sought to turn the vote into a referendum on the Tribune board's handling of its takeover approach, which was first made on April 12.The election of Tribune Publishing's eight board director candidates was not in doubt at Thursday's annual meeting because they were the only ones being nominated. All of them were selected to the board, according to the preliminary tally.Gannett said that, based on the advice of its proxy solicitor, about 49 percent of the votes cast by shareholders who are not affiliated with Tribune Publishing's management withheld their support for the entire slate of Tribune's director nominees.""Gannett continues to have faith in the value of all of Tribune’s assets as part of Gannett,"" it said in a statement on Thursday.

Tribune Publishing said in a statement late on Thursday: ""While precise results of the vote count are not available at this time (and Gannett had no reliable basis for the speculative results it published earlier today), it is clear that all Tribune directors were elected by a majority of the votes cast.""Some experts suggested that the extent to which Tribune Publishing shareholders withheld support for the company's board director nominees, even though not overwhelming, could embolden Gannett.

Five of eight director nominees received less than 50 percent support, and four of Tribune’s largest independent stockholders withheld support from Tribune’s director nominees, Gannett said in a statement.NEXT MOVE  Gannett is now waiting for further reaction from Tribune Publishing and its shareholders before deciding on its next move, according to people familiar with the matter. The publisher of USA Today has threatened to walk away if the outcome of the vote does not sway Tribune Publishing to engage.Last week, Tribune Publishing offered to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Gannett that would allow the two sides to share confidential information that could lead to a deal. However, the two sides have yet to agree on terms of that NDA, according to the sources.Gannett last month raised its unsolicited offer for Tribune Publishing to $15 per share from $12.25. Tribune Publishing shares declined 1.8 percent to close at $11.38 on Thursday. Last week, Tribune Publishing accepted a $70.5 million investment from Los Angeles billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong at $15 per share, making him its second-largest shareholder and giving him a seat on its board.

58,"  (Adds comments by Cooperman, remarks by academic)By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Suzanne BarlynNEW YORK, Sept 21 The top U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday charged billionaire investor Leon Cooperman with insider trading, making him the highest-profile target in years in Washington's ongoing crackdown on illegal trading at hedge funds.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Cooperman's trades earned roughly $4 million when his fund Omega Advisors invested in Atlas Pipeline Partners six years ago, before it sold a gas processing facility. Cooperman was a big shareholder in the company and used his position to obtain confidential information about the sale that other investors did not know about, the agency said in its civil case.Cooperman, 73, denied any wrongdoing. ""We have done nothing improper and categorically deny the Commission's allegations,"" he said in a five-page letter sent to investors, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.He later told investors, in a 10-minute conference call, that he refused to settle with the government in order to protect his legacy. Cooperman, who grew up as the son of a plumber in the Bronx, has been trading for about five decades.The charges are likely to put more pressure on Cooperman, one of the hedge fund industry's best-known stock pickers, and his $5.4 billion fund where assets have been halved in the last two years. A number of investors, including Deutsche Bank, have dropped Omega recently, according to documents seen by Reuters.The billionaire first informed investors in March that he might face charges, after he received a notice from the government.On Wednesday he also cautioned that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, which has been investigating the matter, has not completed its probe but is not pursuing charges at the moment. In its case, the SEC said ""Omega Advisors allegedly accumulated APL securities despite explicitly agreeing not to use the material nonpublic information for trading purposes."" APL was bought by a unit of Targa Resources Corp in early 2015.Cooperman said he invested in the company for years, first in 2007 and selling out last year, long after the alleged insider trading occurred in July 2010. The government said Cooperman had trimmed his bet in APL in the first half of 2010 and called it a ""shitty business"" on July 7, 2010. Later that day, however, after a telephone call with an APL executive, Cooperman began buying more shares, the government said.""By doing so, he allegedly undermined the public confidence in the securities markets and took advantage of other investors who did not have this information,"" Andrew Ceresney, the SEC's director of enforcement, said in a statement.The SEC said an APL executive believed Cooperman was trying to fabricate a coverup in case Cooperman and the executives were questioned about the matter. Cooperman denied this on his call with clients. The SEC also said Cooperman violated federal securities laws more than 40 times by failing to report the stocks he owned in a timely manner.'FAMILIAR STORY' Cooperman is the government's most prominent target since it began cracking down on insider trading among hedge fund managers about seven years ago, when it arrested billionaire Raj Rajaratnam. The Galleon Group founder is now serving an 11-year prison sentence. Three years ago, Steven A. Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to insider trading but Cohen was personally never charged.""The Cooperman story of insider trading is a familiar one,"" said Tamar Frankel, an expert in securities law and a professor at Boston University School of Law. ""There is temptation to use such information and gain more money. The threat of punishment does not loom very large.""Cooperman, who worked his way to the Ivy League's Columbia Business School from the Bronx, has ranked among America's most highly respected investors for decades. He founded Omega in 1991 after spending years at Goldman Sachs. As a prominent hedge fund manager, he has often appeared on television talking about his stock picks and at industry conferences where attendees paid thousands to dollars to hear his advice.Some of his biggest winners included bets on publisher Gannett Co Inc and Brazilian healthcare provider Qualicorp SA.While Omega lost 35.2 percent in 2008 during the financial crisis, the fund came rocketing back with a 52.6 percent gain in 2009.Cooperman said on Wednesday's call that he likes what he owns at present and that he will continue to manage money for his clients. ""There is no need for forced selling,"" he said, adding that his portfolios are all making money this year.(Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan, Lawrence Delevingne and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis)",2016-09-21,TGNA,"Wed Sep 21, 2016 | 6:48pm EDT",UPDATE 3-U.S. SEC charges fund manager Cooperman with insider trading,http://www.reuters.com//article/sec-hedgefunds-omega-idUSL2N1BX0YP?type=companyNews
59,"   By Sinead Carew and Jessica Toonkel  U.S. broadcasters that typically can count on a big revenue bounce from political advertising in presidential election years are still waiting for that to happen.Heading into the first presidential debate on Monday night, Republican nominee Donald Trump has been relying far more on free media than past candidates, and some broadcasters already say they have taken a hit.Last week, Sinclair Broadcast Group, with a presence in 81 markets, said its political ad revenue could be about a third lower than its forecast. Gray Television, with stations in 50 markets, rescinded its third-quarter estimate of $40 million to $46 million in political ad revenue, citing limited visibility in the ""very unusual"" election.In August, E.W. Scripps Co. warned that its political ad revenue could fall more than 10 percent short of its original $150 million estimate.Investors and analysts are bracing for more disappointment.""It's not going to be peaches and cream,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Seattle-based Smead Capital Management, whose Smead Value fund owns shares in broadcaster Tegna Inc.Broadcasters' fortunes still have time to improve. Over the past two election cycles, about 40 percent of the year's political ad spending took place in October, said Steve Passwaiter, vice president and general manager of Kantar Media's CMAG unit.But the patterns of the 2016 election cycle suggest that political ad spending could trail prior years. Through August, Trump spent just $28 million on TV ads, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton spent $133 million. Overall, the candidates and political action committees spent $1.1 billion on local TV ads through August, compared with $2.9 billion for all of 2012, according to Kantar CMAG. Trump's campaign in recent days has indicated it would spend another $100 million on TV ads, including $60 million on regional ad spots, ahead of the Nov. 8 election, according to an Associated Press report. Campaign representatives did not  respond to a request for comment. ""It's not a great number,"" said Benchmark Co. media analyst Daniel Kurnos, referring to Trump's plans.  HIGH MARGINS  Presidential races typically account for about 30 percent of  political ad revenue, according to E.W. Scripps spokeswoman Carolyn Micheli. At Scripps, she said, political ads carry the highest profit margins, up to 80 percent, compared to overall industry margins of 30 percent to 40 percent. TV companies' share of political ad revenue depends largely on whether their stations are located in battleground states.Sinclair, whose market valuation has declined 16 percent this year, and Gray Television, whose stock has fallen 38 percent, both have stations in Virginia, for example, which is typically a swing state. But this year, with Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia the vice presidential running mate of Clinton, the state has attracted far fewer ad dollars than expected, according to Sinclair.Some broadcasters are sending more positive signals. CBS Corp Chief Executive Les Moonves said last week that the network's political ad revenue was on track, though he cited strong spending on senatorial and congressional races while admitting that Trump's spending has been low. Tribune Media Co has not changed its $200 million target for the year, though at a Sept. 15 investor conference, Chief Executive Peter Liguori talked about uncertainty around the ""Trump factor."" Nexstar Broadcasting Group Inc, whose stock has fallen 8 percent this year, said it already has bookings for two thirds of its 2016 $100 million target, and it reaffirmed that target. ""Presidential's not going to drive our political spend. It's going to be Senate races and gubernatorial races,"" said Nexstar's chief executive, Perry Sook. The group has stations in 18 states with Senate elections.Local broadcasters' shares fell as much as 9 percent on Sept. 19, when Sinclair issued its warning, and they have yet to recover fully. For the year, broadcaster stocks are down 8 percent to 38 percent.
