10,"  HOUSTON Oct 3 Anadarko Petroleum Corp  and EOG Resources Inc have agreed to provide their investors with more information on the potential financial risks the companies face from fracking, New York's attorney general said on Friday.The agreement is part of a growing trend of energy companies saying they will provide investors with more details about the risks to their assets posed by climate change, or the legal, regulatory and environmental risks of fracking. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has been around for years and producers say it is safe, though some environmental groups and communities oppose the process because it uses a mix of water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure to extract oil and gas from rock formations. ""Investors and the public have a right to know all relevant information about the environmental, financial, and regulatory risks associated with the companies they are considering investing in,"" Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.

15,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON, N.D.  WILLISTON, N.D. Dec 31 A nasty profit warning and deep job cuts. A gutted capital budget, a suspended dividend and shares tumbling by more than half on a single day.The retrenchment at Civeo Corp, which provides temporary housing for oilfield workers and miners, is the most-severe symptom of pain inflicted on the oil service industry by the slide in crude prices, and may presage similar steps by peers.It also exposes the transient nature of the ""man camp"" business of dormitory-style temporary housing the company helped pioneer.Drilling, a barometer of oilfield activity, has been slowing for weeks as producers slashed spending plans by 20 to 40 percent. Baker Hughes reported last week the U.S. land rig count fell by 35 to 1,770 and hundreds more rigs will be idled, hitting scores of services companies from ones renting trailers to those repairing pumps.The pain will spread unevenly. Companies with weaker finances or older equipment are set to be hit sooner and harder by the more-than 50 percent drop in crude prices since June.Analysts and investors say Civeo's problem is that it has spread itself geographically too thin, with not enough cash to quickly respond to customers' needs.The company, spun off in May from equipment maker Oil States International Inc, has seen demand drop in Canada's oil sands regions and in Australia, where it houses coal miners, leaving it with little cash to expand in North Dakota's oil counties, where it has only two facilities.Civeo shares are down over 80 percent this year after tumbling 53 percent on Tuesday, compared with Oil States's 15 percent slide and a roughly 13 percent gain in the S&P 500  index. Several firms serving Australia's mining sector, Civeo's key market, have also been hit hard by the retreat in commodity and energy prices.For example, Alliance Aviation Services  Ltd  <AQZ.AX, which flies miners to and from remote camp sites, this month cut its earnings forecast, dropped an interim dividend and reduced its aircraft fleet.Businesses providing services to the camps are smarting too. ""I took a massive plunge right along with the drop in coal prices,"" said Fiona Berridge, who runs Scrubz Pro Clean, a linen and cleaning service for miners in the coal town of Moranbah in Australia's Bowen Basin.""I used to have 35 people working here, now I have eight.""Stronger companies have proven more resilient, at least for now.Target Logistics, the top temporary housing operator in North Dakota and one of the largest in the world, says it is finishing 2014 with ""high utilization"" at its facilities. The privately-held company declined to be more specific, but said it did not expect a decline in 2015 occupancy. Analysts say the company has been able to land long-term contracts with companies like Halliburton Co and EOG Resources Inc, by offering them the size and scale Civeo cannot match. In North Dakota alone, Target Logistics has 10 camps and touts its ability to quickly add housing wherever needed.To save cash, oil producers have already started to ask drilling and well completion services firms to cut their prices by 10 to 30 percent, said PacWest, an energy consultancy in Houston.That is hurting the most so-called pressure pumpers, often small privately-held firms, that run fleets of diesel engines used to generate power for hydraulic fracturing jobs.""We expect cash flow and solvency challenges and more consolidation in the industry,"" PacWest said earlier this month.Kirby Corp, which moves crude and other fuels by barge, issued a profit warning in December as its business overhauling diesel engines in onshore fields was hit harder by the oil slide than earlier anticipated.The largest services companies, Halliburton and Schlumberger , have said they will reduce headcount, while BP Plc  announced a $1 billion restructuring.In the offshore drilling market, Hercules Offshore  has cut 15 percent of its staff, while Transocean Ltd  has said it will scrap seven older offshore rigs as softer demand means only the newest rigs can win contracts.

Feb 18 Oil and natural gas producer EOG Resources Inc posted a quarterly profit far below Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday and slashed its 2015 budget, marking the latest energy giant to fall victim to plunging crude prices.Shares in the company, the largest oil producer in the contiguous United States, fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trading.EOG reported net income of $444.6 million, or 81 cents per share, compared with $580.2 million, or $1.06 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding hedging gains, tax losses on repatriation of foreign earnings and other one-time items, the company earned 79 cents per share.By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amidst cheap crude, EOG slashed its 2015 capital budget by 40 percent, planning to spend $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion primarily in North Dakota and Texas.It was a remarkable about-face for the company, which said last fall it had no plans to curtail operations even with cheap crude oil. Trying to calm frayed nerves, EOG Chief Executive Bill Thomas said his goal now is for the company to ""exit this downturn in better shape than we entered it.""EOG won't add any more drilling rigs to its fleet this year, and will hydraulically fracture 45 percent fewer wells.Given that, the company expects 2015 production to be flat with 2014 levels, an average of roughly 288,900 barrels per day.EOG's crude production rose 26 percent during the quarter to 307,700 barrels per day.

23,"  (Adds North Dakota rig count paragraph 5)By Ernest ScheyderWILLISTON, N.D. Feb 19 One of the strongest leaders of the U.S. shale revolution has  been humbled by plunging oil prices.EOG Resources Inc slashed its 2015 budget on Wednesday amid cheap crude prices and said its output will not grow this year, mere months after confidently saying it was strong enough to weather the downturn without cutbacks. Its shares tumbled more than 7 percent late Wednesday.The move offers the clearest example to date of how the roughly 50 percent drop in oil prices  since last June is roiling the U.S. energy industry, forcing once-confident players to make choices unimaginable just 12 months ago.EOG's scaled-back outlook would mark the first time in years its crude and natural gas output does not jump more than 10 percent.EOG is not alone. Last week Apache Corp posted a multibillion-dollar net loss and slashed its 2015 budget while saying its output would be flat from last year. On Thursday, the number of rigs drilling in North Dakota fell below 130 for the first time in years, a level the state's top official said is necessary to prevent output from falling.ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp , among many others, have taken similar steps.Many oil industry and market analysts have been waiting anxiously for the update from EOG, regarded as a bellwether for the shale patch. The company's stock, for instance, is down only 10 percent the past six months, versus a 33 percent drop for Apache and 19 percent for Occidental. If even EOG - a firm renowned for its strong balance sheet, prime holdings in the sweetest shale spots, efficient drilling and good hedges - is brought low, output across the sector could stall more quickly than expected.Houston-based EOG stressed its primary goal is to survive the price doldrums and that it has no interest in boosting production while oil is relatively cheap.It was a remarkable about-face for EOG, which last November said there were no plans to curtail operations, even with cheap crude.Chief Executive Bill Thomas on Wednesday said the goal is now to ""exit this downturn in better shape than we entered it."" The company has long been favored by Wall Street - only one of the 39 analysts covering the stock recommends selling with 32 encouraging buying. But even the most conservative estimates for fourth-quarter profit and the 2015 budget were off.EOG slashed its 2015 capital budget by 40 percent, planning to spend $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion.RBC Capital Markets had expected spending of at least $6.1 billion, betting the spending would fuel at least double-digit production growth for the foreseeable future.Yet with plans to not add drilling rigs this year and hydraulically fracture 45 percent fewer wells, the company expects 2015 production to be flat with 2014, an average of roughly 288,900 barrels per day. EAGLE FORD REMAINS FOCUS For now, EOG said its core focus will remain its Eagle Ford acreage in eastern Texas, where executives estimate more than 3 billion barrels of oil could be locked inside.The area has so far been prolific. EOG said in November that output of new fracked wells in the Eagle Ford rose 39 percent compared with wells sunk at the start of 2014. It plans to bring 345 wells online there this year, down from 534 in 2014.The Permian shale in western Texas, an area dominated by Chevron Corp, is where EOG plans its one area of increase, planning to bring 95 wells this year, up 53 percent from last year.For the company's holdings in North Dakota and Wyoming, most of which are far from traditional transportation like pipelines, EOG plans sharp reductions, partially an acknowledgment that cheap oil makes the remote plays far less economical.For its largest projects, EOG would make a 100 percent rate of return with crude prices of at least $80 per barrel, Thomas said last fall. Even if prices fall to $40, EOG would at least have a 10 percent rate of return, or a profit on its investment, on wells in Texas and North Dakota.

Oil and natural gas producer EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) plans to begin fracking hundreds of wells in North Dakota and Texas later this year if oil prices CLc1 stabilize around $65 per barrel, executives said on Monday after reporting a better-than-expected adjusted profit.EOG was the latest major U.S. shale oil producer to peg increased operations to a specific dollar amount, a positive sign for an industry worried that last year's price drop would permanently cripple growth. Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N) said last week it would add drilling rigs to its portfolio if crude prices rise to $70 per barrel, and Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N) told Reuters last month it was considering adding new rigs this year as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices rebound.   EOG, considered a leader in the U.S. shale oil industry, has for months drilled new wells only to keep them idle by delaying fracking, part of a strategy to hold back pumping some crude after a roughly 40 percent drop in prices since last summer.Crude prices have inched up in the past month. EOG executives said Wall Street should expect the company's 2015 production to resemble the letter ""U"" - falling in the first half of the year, then rebounding in the second half and hitting double-digits by next year. RESULTS BEAT  EOG posted a first-quarter net loss of $169.7 million, or 31 cents per share, in the first quarter compared with net income of $660.9 million, or $1.21 per share, in the year-ago period.

31,"   By James Saft  Investors wanting to dodge the next Enron, or just outperform the market, might want to pay particular attention to the first digits, and only the first digits, in numbers in company accounts.Called Benford’s Law, after the physicist who discovered it in 1938, it describes a well observed fact: in naturally occurring sets of numbers of sufficient size the first digits are not evenly distributed. Lower numbers predominate: 1 is the first digit in a number almost 30 percent of the time while 9 begins less than 5 percent of numbers.No one knows exactly why this happens, but in data sets from rainfall amounts to town population the numbers follow a Benford’s Law distribution.As the U.S. Internal Revenue Service uses Benford’s Law to sniff out tax cheats, or at least to narrow the field to better channel resources, why not do something similar with the data produced by companies to represent their performance?Deutsche Bank has done just that, applying Benford’s Law to company financial statements and coming up with results which are, at least in the aggregate, compelling.A data set which does not conform to Benford’s Law may well indicate that something is not right. This may be fraud, or may be mistakes or misstatements. In any event all of these leave investors operating at a disadvantage when compared to investing in a company with accurate reports.Deutsche crunched the numbers on Russell 3000 companies and found that a Benford distribution applies to almost every balance sheet and income statement item, from annual sales to accounts receivables to net income. Similar data was found for global firms.But those companies which don’t show conformity to natural number distribution also show a marked divergence in how they perform for their investors. “Stocks with potential accounting irregularities underperform the market significantly,” quantitative strategists at Deutsche Bank led by Yin Luo wrote in a March report.“More importantly, companies with accounting irregularities exhibit more severe drawdowns, higher volatility, and lower risk-adjusted returns compared to the market portfolio.”Whereas the Russell 3000 has increased 16-fold since 1990, a market cap-weighted basket of those companies whose reports don’t conform to Benford’s Law is only up a bit less than six-fold.Interestingly the two groups performed about the same from 1990 through 2000, at which point a sharp divergence began. The non-conformers (and remember non-conformity is not proof of fraud) began to sink then, only recently regaining their previous millennium's peak. The Deutsche study can’t account for this change over time, though it occurs to an outside observer that the past 15 years, with the dotcom bubble followed by the sub-prime and financial stock fiasco, was a period in which fraud and poor accounting often found its comeuppance. FEW ENRONS The vast majority of companies’ data adheres to Benford’s Law, with about 5 percent of Russell 3000 companies not conforming based on Deutsche’s calculations. Fewer global large-cap companies throw up suspicious numbers, though it is impossible to say if this indicates that the U.S. suffers from more fraud and sloppy accounting.To come back to Enron, Deutsche looked at 40 accounting items, captured monthly, over about 20 years. Whereas for Walmart, the gap between what Benford’s Law would predict and what was reported was minimal, for Enron there was a bigger variance, with the numbers 5, 6 and 7 appearing more often than is natural. In the case of Enron, which went bankrupt in 2001, smoke indicated fire.The question is then what practically an investor can do with this data. At any given time there are usually only very few companies with accounting irregularities. One possibility suggested by Deutsche is a long/short strategy which bets on the overall index with a smaller short bet against those companies whose numbers look doubtful. Because it can be hard to short smaller stocks, this may work better if done with larger-cap issues.One obvious problem with this whole approach is that fraudsters too will have heard of Benford’s Law, and can easily do their own analysis to make sure their cooked books conform to a 'natural' distribution of numbers. Perhaps the Enrons of tomorrow, or today, will prove to have tightly conforming accounts.What a Benford’s analysis may do then is to help weed out the incompetent, who misstate accounts based on bad data, or simply get the math wrong.This group might well be larger than the fraudsters and similarly worth avoiding as investment candidates.

32,"   By Ernest Scheyder  EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit on Thursday as the oil producer successfully slashed well and transportation costs to offset plunging crude prices CLc1.The price drop has hamstrung nearly all of the energy industry this past year, forcing many companies to lay off staff and curb spending. While EOG is trimming its capital budget for the year by $200 million, Chief Executive Bill Thomas said he is ""excited about the company's continued improvement"" in both technology and cost control. ""The company is generating good returns in all our key assets with $50 oil,"" Thomas said in a press release. ""EOG is uniquely positioned for high-return growth in a low oil price environment.""

Houlihan Lokey's shares rose to a high of $23.10 on Thursday, compared with the initial public offering price of $21 per Class A share, valuing the firm at about $1.5 billion.The IPO raised $220.5 million for Houlihan Lokey's two biggest shareholders: ORIX USA, an arm of Japanese financial services company ORIX Corp, and HL Holders, which comprises Houlihan Lokey's employees and management.The size of the IPO was reduced to 10.5 million shares from 13.1 million, according to an underwriter. Houlihan Lokey is the first independent investment bank to go public since Moelis & Co's debut last year, joining a growing club of boutique firms such as Lazard Ltd, Evercore Partners Inc, Piper Jaffray Co and Greenhill & Co.Moelis' shares have risen 19.4 percent since its public offering last year.Corporate finance, including M&A and capital markets advisory, is Houlihan Lokey's biggest division accounting for more than half of its revenue.

36,"  (Adds details of oil price forecast, stock)Sept 8 EOG Resources Inc Chief Executive Bill Thomas expects oil prices to rise next year, telling a group of analysts on Tuesday that he is ""excited about 2016.""A jump in prices would only help EOG, one of the largest shale oil producers in the United States, as it looks to weather a more-than 50 percent drop in oil since last summer - a drop that has led to a rash of layoffs and budget cuts around the industry.Indeed, EOG itself has slashed spending, curbing the number of drilling rigs it has used this year from 50 in January to 15. ""We think the market is rebalancing as we speak,"" Thomas said at the Barclay's Energy-Power Conference. ""We think prices could be a little better next year than they are now.""Thomas has repeatedly sought to assuage Wall Street's worries about the health of the oil industry amidst low prices. Last month he bragged to analysts that he was ""excited about the company's continued improvement."" The breakeven price for oil producers varies by geography, but EOG said it has lowered its own breakeven by becoming more efficient and using new technology. In 2012, the company generated a 35 percent rate of return with oil prices at $95 per barrel. Today, it generated a 50 percent rate of return with oil prices at $55 per barrel, Thomas said.The Houston-based company, which has seen its stock price drop about 16 percent so far this year - less than peers - is considering ""tactical acquisitions"" in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Thomas said.EOG shares rose 0.6 percent to $77.55 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday.

43,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Silver Run Acquisition Corp SRAQU.O, a new U.S. investment vehicle, raised a greater-than-expected $450 million in an initial public offering on Tuesday aimed at funding the acquisition of energy companies, indicating investors see bargains amid the oil price rout.The shares of many energy companies have been battered in the last 18 months as an oil supply glut has weighed on their prospects. Silver Run's IPO shows that some investors believe the sector's corporate valuations have reached bottom. In the largest IPO so far this year in the United States, Silver Run said it had priced 45 million shares at $10 each, selling 5 million more shares than it originally planned.Silver Run is a blank-check acquisition company sponsored by energy-focused private equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC. Such so-called special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) fund the equity portion of their acquisitions through stock issuance.  Silver Run will look for companies that are ""fundamentally sound"" but underperforming due to current commodity prices, according to its IPO prospectus. So-called secondary market investors are already placing bets that mergers and acquisitions will pick up in the oil patch by snapping up shares sold by publicly listed energy companies that could use the money to acquire assets at a discount. Silver Run's offering illustrates that SPACs can successfully make a similar pitch to IPO investors. ""(Secondary market) investors are participating in follow-on financings that make already strong companies stronger, enabling them to withstand even lower commodity prices or potentially even allowing them to play offense,"" said Americas equity capital markets head at Bank of Montreal Michael Cippoletti.Silver Run's chief executive officer, Mark Papa, is an oil and gas veteran and Riverstone partner. He has worked for 45 years in the space, 15 of which were as CEO of EOG Resources Inc, once a division of Enron. Papa shifted EOG's focus from gas to oil, and is credited with transforming EOG into one of America's biggest oil companies. Shares in Silver Run are expected to start trading on Wednesday and list on NASDAQ under the symbol ""SRAQU"". Deutsche Bank Securities, Citigroup and Goldman, Sachs & Co were underwriters on the offering.

50,"  HOUSTON EOG Resources Inc has the ability to post strong returns with oil prices around $40 a barrel, and would post triple-digit returns should prices spike to $60, Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Thomas told investors on Friday.Houston-based EOG, considered one of the most efficient U.S. drillers, has a $15-$20 per barrel cost advantage over the rest of the industry, which needs a ""sustained $60-$65 oil price and 12 months of lead time"" to deliver modest growth, Thomas said on a call to discuss first quarter results. Thomas said the company was focusing on ""premium drilling,"" which he defined as wells that can generate a return of at least 30 percent after taxes at $40 oil. The company also said its efforts at ""enhanced oil recovery,"" or getting more output from existing wells with relatively low investments, had been successful, particularly in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas. ""It will get more efficient as we move forward, and lower-cost,"" Thomas said.  After falling 70 percent between mid-2014 and early 2016 amid a global glut, U.S. oil prices have recovered to trade above $45 per barrel on Friday, as a huge wildfire in Canada prompted substantial production cuts.[O/R]The rout had prompted sharp declines in drilling and output in the United States, as prices fell below heavily indebted shale drillers' breakeven costs.  Prices will likely continue their rebound, Thomas said, as those declines in U.S. production along with strong gasoline demand help the market rebalance. But continuing cost reductions by U.S. horizontal drillers like EOG have fueled speculation that substantial U.S. production could come back online even without a sharp uptick in prices.

53,"   By Terry Wade | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Shale oil bellwether EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) on Thursday boosted this year's fracking plans by 30 percent, saying it expected big returns on new wells even as oil dipped back to $40 a barrel.The plans are the boldest yet among U.S. shale oil companies, many of which have raised their production forecasts in recent days after posting second-quarter results.The upward revisions highlight how the fittest shale companies, mainly those with the oiliest land, are surviving at a time when dozens of others are filing for creditor protection in the biggest wave of bankruptcies since the telecom meltdown in the early 2000s. Houston-based EOG raised the number of wells it plans to bring online this year to 350 from 270, and lifted by 50 to 250 the number of wells it would drill, while keeping its budget stable around $2.5 billion.Since the start of the worst price crash in a generation in mid-2014, when oil was still above $100 a barrel, many shale producers have cut costs and lifted well productivity by 50 percent or more. Wall Street has also demanded they focus more on capital efficiency rather than just raising output. ""The benefits of EOG's premium drilling strategy are beginning to show in our operating performance,"" CEO Bill Thomas said in a statement.  ""We are committed to focusing capital on our premium assets.""EOG, best known for its South Texas operations, said that greater efficiencies have allowed it to do more for less and earn an after-tax rate of return of more than 30 percent on what it called premium wells, assuming oil prices stay at multi-year lows.It increased its backlog of premium drilling locations to 4,300 from 3,200. The length of horizontal wells have grown to 10,000 feet or more, and producers are using ever increasing amounts of sand in their high-pressure frack jobs to coax oil from cracks in rocks.            Second-quarter crude and condensate production fell 4 percent to 267,700 barrels per day from 277,500 in the year-ago period, as drilling activity slowed and output from existing shale wells declined. That decline is a sign of the industry's growing focus on capital discipline, unlike in years past when executives raced to lift production at all costs.Still, EOG said production could grow significantly with balanced cash flow from 2017 through 2020. Output could rise 10 percent a year through 2020 with $50 oil and 20 percent a year with $60 oil, it said.The company swung to a second quarter net loss of $292.6 million, or 53 cents per share from a profit of $5.3 million, or 1 cent per share a year ago, as tumbling oil prices overshadowed cost cuts and productivity gains.

57,"   By Ernest Scheyder  EOG Resources Inc said on Tuesday it would buy privately held Yates Petroleum Corp for $2.5 billion in stock and cash, in the latest move by a U.S. energy company to acquire acreage in the Permian Basin, one of the country's most cost-effective oil fields.EOG's shares rose more than 6 percent to $94.94 at mid-afternoon as analysts said the deal was inexpensive for the company.The buyout, which had been under negotiations for months, follows a string of Permian land purchases in the past year by companies that include Pioneer Natural Resources Co and WPX Energy Inc.The Permian is the largest U.S. oil field, with 189 of the country's 481 total active rigs in early August, according to the latest data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc.With the acquisition, EOG would shift its focus away from the Eagle Ford shale, a more expensive Texas field that had helped the company grow into the largest onshore oil producer in the contiguous United States during the past decade. Much of the Permian acreage is near EOG's existing well locations and pipeline infrastructure. ""This deal really isn't about getting bigger. It's about getting better,"" EOG Chief Executive Bill Thomas told investors on a Tuesday conference call after announcing the acquisition.""We'll be able to grow oil (production) with less capital and more efficiently than we do now."" The company plans to start drilling on the new acreage as soon as the deal closes in October and boost capital spending in the Permian in 2017, he said. EOG will issue 26.06 million shares valued at $2.3 billion and pay $37 million in cash in exchange for Yates, which was founded by Martin Yates, Jr. in New Mexico in 1907 and is run by his descendents.The deal would raise EOG's position in the Permian and adjacent plays by more than 200,000 acres, to 574,000 acres, and double its position in the Delaware Basin in southern New Mexico and West Texas.Yates, which holds 1.6 million net acres across the western United States, mainly operates in the Permian Basin and the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming and produces 29,600 barrels of crude oil equivalent per day.
