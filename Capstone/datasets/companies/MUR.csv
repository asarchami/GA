0,"  LONDON Jan 10 Current high levels of investment in Britain's North Sea are unlikely to continue after 2015, according to a forecast from energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie that could feed concerns about the longer-term future of the country's oil industry.Britain's oil and gas output has fallen by about two thirds since 2000, posting particularly steep falls of 14.5 percent last year and 18 percent in 2011, but big new investments have fuelled hopes that some of the declines can be reversed.In 2013, capital investment in the UK part of the North Sea hit its highest level in real terms since the mid-1970s, Wood Mackenzie said in an annual report published on Friday, but cautioned that higher spend was also a result of rising costs and that it was not likely to continue. ""Due to poor exploration performance in recent years, capital investment is unlikely to be sustained at the current high levels beyond 2015,"" Wood Mackenzie's head of UK upstream research Lindsay Wexelstein said.Britain's government is battling to revive the North Sea, whose plunging output has acted as a drag on economic growth, and has commissioned a review to help it do so, but the rising cost of projects and a dearth of new discoveries in the mature area, in its fifth decade of pumping oil, means reversing the decline is challenging. In November, for example, U.S. oil company Chevron  threw doubt on its North Sea Rosebank project, a big development thought to cost around $8 billion, saying it was not currently economically attractive. On the exploration front, the last two years have been light on success, Wexelstein said, blaming lower drilling rates as some smaller companies struggled to raise funds for exploration.Combined investment in the North Sea over last year and this year will reach 21.3 billion pounds ($35.1 billion), Wood Mackenzie forecast, in line with guidance provided by industry body Oil & Gas UK which said in August it expected 2013 capital investment to total 13.5 billion.",2014-01-10,MUR,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 7:41am EST",High investment in UK N.Sea unlikely to continue past 2015-report,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-north-sea-idUSL6N0KK1H520140110?type=companyNews

3,"   By Denny Thomas | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Murphy Oil Corp (MUR.N) is considering selling some of its Asian oil and gas assets in a deal that could fetch up to $3 billion, sources said, as it looks to scale down in the region like some other U.S. energy companies.Energy majors from BP (BP.L) to Shell (RDSa.L) have faced pressure from shareholders to control spending and return spare cash amid concerns over the impact of rising costs and the returns available if oil prices drop.Murphy's planned sale comes after Newfield Exploration Co (NFX.N) and Hess Corp (HES.N) sold their Southeast Asia operations, partly to address share price underperformance. The move has been prompted in part by the strong demand generated for the Newfield and Hess auctions last year, the sources, who had knowledge of the plan, said.The advent of ""fracking"" shale formations is leading to a boom in U.S. crude production which is expected to approach historic highs by the turn of the decade to levels that would have been unforeseen just a few years ago.""There is a possibility that these smaller producers are looking at their U.S. home market and see good prospects with the development we are seeing of tight oil,"" said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight, referring to the shale boom.""That could be one factor driving them out of the Asian market, back to their home market. We are not seeing that as a trend as yet, but this could be the beginning as companies always evaluate their business options and portfolios,"" Shum added.EARLY STAGES  Murphy's potential sale process, however, was still in the early stages and it could, in the end, decide not to sell, the sources said.The Arkansas-based company has interests in oil and gas fields in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brunei and Australia. Malaysia is the biggest of Murphy's Asian portfolios, and accounted for more than 45 percent of its total 2012 net production, according to the company's website (www.murphyoilcorp.com).As on December 31, 2012, the company had majority interests in six separate production contracts in Malaysia, covering approximately 2.79 million gross acres, and held interests in four exploration licenses in Indonesia over a total of 3.381 million gross acres, according to the website. The planned sale is driven less by share price underperformance and more by the desire to monetize part of the business at the valuation secured by Newfield, the sources said.In October, Newfield sold its Malaysian assets for $898 million, which translates into $59.87/barrell for 15 million barrels of proved reserves.One of the deal structures being discussed was to sell just 30 percent of the Malaysian operations, one of the sources said.A Murphy spokesman did not immediately reply to an email and return a call to his office seeking comment.

9,"  * Greybull Capital tipped to buy the struggling refinery* Plant and retail petrol stations would continue operatingBy Ron Bousso and Simon FalushLONDON, March 18 Murphy Oil is in advanced talks to sell its Milford Haven refinery in Wales to a low-profile private equity fund that will continue operating the struggling plant, sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.Arkansas-based Murphy Oil has been trying to sell the 135,000 barrels-per-day plant and its Murco petrol stations for around four years. But buyers who were willing to keep it running have proved elusive as European refineries fight for survival due to failing demand.A deal is now moving closer with London-based Greybull Capital after it had agreed to fund a major planned maintenance at the plant within the next 18 months, sources said.""There is a form of agreement pending finance,"" said a source close to the negotiations.The maintenance turnaround at Milford Haven was expected to cost less than $75 million, the source said. The full cost of the deal was unclear. The source said that a commitment to fund the turnaround was vital to prevent any buyer from running the plant for a short time before closing it down to sell assets, or demand a government bailout.Greybull has in the past focused on financing deals to buy struggling British high street chains such as the ultimately doomed electrical goods outlet Comet. It declined to comment on the Milford Haven discussions.Greybull would probably need to partner with either a commodity trading house or a bank with trading capabilities in order to secure the funding for the deal to keep the 450 employees in place.""They are trying to raise the money in order to keep the work force in place,"" an industry source said. A spokeswoman for Murco, the Murphy Oil subsidiary that operates the refinery, confirmed talks for the sale of the refinery were coming closer to a conclusion.""Discussions with regard to the sale of the Murco UK business by its U.S. parent, Murphy Oil Corporation, are ongoing and are at an advanced stage,"" Emma Murphy said in an email.RETAIL OUTLETS  Murco's 400 petrol stations across the country would also be part of the deal.""The buyers will purchase the Murco name and the supply system which will continue to supply the Murco petrol stations,"" the industry source said.Murco also operates three storage and distribution terminals in Britain which are supplied by rail from the refinery and handle around 2 million tonnes of oil product a year, according to the company's website.The Welsh plant, like other British and European refineries, has struggled in recent years due to weak demand in the region and in its U.S East Coast export market, as well as growing competition from U.S., Russian and Asian plants -  factors which have hammered margins.India's Essar Energy said last month it will shutter one third of its production capacity at Britain's second-largest oil refinery Stanlow.Last year the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland was brought to the brink of closure following a bitter industrial dispute, after owner Ineos said it needed to slash costs to keep it viable.This followed the closure of the Coryton plant owned by bankrupt Petroplus which closed in 2012.",2014-03-18,MUR,"Tue Mar 18, 2014 | 11:54am EDT",Murphy Oil nears sale of UK refinery to fund,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-refinery-idUSL6N0MF2BR20140318?type=companyNews
10,"   By Ron Bousso and Simon Falush | LONDON  LONDON Murphy Oil (MUR.N) is ready to exit British refining next month with the sale of its Milford Haven plant and retail assets to private equity fund Greybull Capital for over $500 million, sources close to the talks told Reuters.Murco, a Murphy Oil subsidiary, is expected to sell its 135,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Wales, oil inventories, storage facilities and hundreds of petrol stations across Britain, the sources said.European refiners have struggled in recent years with shrinking domestic demand and increased overseas competition, which have forced a number of painful closures.The deal, which is expected to be signed in mid-April, could ensure Milford Haven's short-term survival despite its recent low profit margins.Also Arkansas-based Murphy Oil, which bought its initial stake in Milford Haven in 1981, would be exiting British refining after a four-year search for a buyer.Crude oil and oil product inventories held by Murco were expected to account for more than half of the $500 million price tag, while the 400 service stations would account for most of the remainder, a source familiar with the deal said.The price put on the plant would represent a small fraction of the cost of the deal.One of the sources said Greybull planned to keep the refinery in operation despite weak and often negative profit margins. Last year, its refining margin averaged 75 cents per barrel of crude processed, according to Murphy Oil's annual presentation. London-based Greybull Capital has mostly avoided the limelight since the family capital investment fund was created in 2008 by brothers Nathaniel and Marc Meyohas and Richard Perlhagen.It specializes in long-term investments in companies and has invested in the retail, biotech, energy and manufacturing sectors in Europe, Israel and the United States.The fund has agreed to back the refinery's existing management and committed to maintaining the refinery's current work force of around 450 people, the sources said.Greybull, identified as a potential buyer earlier this month, intends to carry out routine maintenance that was already planned for Milford Haven in 2015 on schedule at an estimated cost of less than $75 million, sources have said.A spokesman for Greybull Capital declined to comment. Greybull is expected to partner with a trading house to raise capital for the transaction and to sell the refined products.Murco spokeswoman Emma Murphy confirmed that talks for the sale of the company's assets ""are ongoing and are at an advanced stage"", but would not comment on the price or expected completion day.REFINING CRISIS A deal that keeps Milford Haven operating would be welcomed by workers, who have worried about their jobs since the closure of Coryton in the east of England in 2012. Last year, PetroIneos was at the brink of closing its Grangemouth plant in Scotland after a bitter industrial dispute. It survived after workers agreed to cuts in terms and conditions, the British government made a pledge to provide a loan guarantee, and the Scottish government promised a grant.The deal comes at the height of one of the biggest crises faced by Europe's refining industry.Another 2 million bpd of capacity, more than 10 percent of Europe's total, is expected to shut over the next five years, analysts at Vienna-based JBC Energy said.Milford Haven was the smallest and among the least complex of Britain's seven refineries in 2012, according to a report produced by Purvin & Gertz for the UK Petroleum Industry Association.The refinery has undergone upgrades in recent years to increase its high-value diesel yield. The site also has deep water births that allow large tankers to be loaded and discharged.""Like all refineries, Murco has its advantages and disadvantages, but it is a well invested refinery and comprises irreplaceable assets for the location,"" an industry source said.""The sector is challenged, but if you can finance, trade and manage it properly, these are viable assets,"" the source added.(Additional reporting by Claire Milhench Editing by Veronica Brown and Jane Baird)",2014-03-27,MUR,"Thu Mar 27, 2014 | 8:05am EDT",Exclusive: Murphy Oil nears $500 million sale of UK refining assets,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-uk-refineries-idUSBREA2Q0VZ20140327?type=companyNews

The deal was expected to be completed by mid-April. ""The deal we were trying to conclude didn't happen during the exclusivity period that we had extended to March 31,"" Tom McKinlay, Managing Director of Murco told Reuters.""As a consequence, having missed several deadlines up to that point, we decided to allow that exclusivity to expire which allows us to talk to other people.""The plant employs 370 staff and between 100 and 150 contractors, McKinlay said, and Murphy Oil's UK subsidiary Murco  also operates hundreds of filling stations around the country.""For over three years, we have left no stone unturned in trying to find a buyer for the plant,"" Tom McKinlay, Managing Director of Murco, said. He added that a possible outcome would be to turn the plant into a storage terminal should no viable buyer emerge.European refiners have struggled with shrinking domestic demand and increased overseas competition which has crushed margins and led to periods of loss-making.In the UK, the Coryton plant in the east of England closed down in 2012 after the collapse of owner Petroplus, while the PetroIneos owned Grangemouth in Scotland was brought to the brink of closure during a bitter industrial dispute last year. Consultations will last 45 days, after which either a deal will be reached or Murphy will begin implementing a wind down of the plant, a source close to the talks said.""Talks have been going on for three years and this has been a loss making business for a long time, multiple bids have failed,"" he said.The possible closure of the Milford Haven refinery comes at the height of one of the biggest crises faced by Europe's refining industry.Another 2 million bpd of capacity, more than 10 percent of Europe's total, is expected to shut over the next five years, analysts at Vienna-based JBC Energy said.Milford Haven was the smallest and among the least complex of Britain's seven refineries in 2012, according to a report produced by Purvin & Gertz for the UK Petroleum Industry Association.The refinery has undergone upgrades in recent years to increase its high-value diesel yield.

Production at Snorre B was first shut on Saturday after a subsea robot detected a pit under the drilling template, which helps to connect the underwater site to the semi-submersible platform at the water's surface. ""Production was shut again on Monday after detecting an oil leak, and as a precautionary measure the platform's manager has ordered to evacuate some of the people from the platform,"" a spokeswoman for the company told Reuters.She said 33 out of 136 people had been evacuated from Snorre B to a nearby floating accommodation facility.

A Murphy spokesman declined to comment.If a deal is not done, it is expected that Murphy will move to close the plant, putting most of its some 500 employees out of work.The plant is currently not buying crude oil, but recycling oil products to keep it operational. Murphy started a 45-day consultation period in April with staff and unions, which it has left open since it elapsed in May.One source familiar with the negotiations said that there was roughly a 50 percent likelihood of a deal to keep the plant open being done.He said that any deal would likely value the plant at close to zero, but any sum paid for the plant would include oil inventories. Tom McKinlay, head of Murphy's Oil UK operations, stepped aside to pursue the acquisition of the company's ailing Milford Haven refinery and retail business, it emerged May.One of the sources said that it was likely that McKinlay would still be involved in the plant should the deal go through, though it was unclear if there would be any element of management ownership under the new structure. Refineries in Europe are being squeezed by high crude prices and low refining margins due to weak demand for fuel.India's Essar Group plans to sell the Stanlow refinery in Britain, three sources familiar with the matter said, although the UK subsidiary of the company has since denied that the plant is up for sale.Last year, PetroIneos was on the brink of closing its Grangemouth plant in Scotland after a bitter industrial dispute.It survived after workers agreed to cuts in terms and conditions, the British government made a pledge to provide a loan guarantee, and the Scottish government promised a grant.

20,"  * Pipelines, processing plants, terminals sought* Pension funds interested in non-operating stakes* Oil majors need to unbundle assets for quick saleBy Claire MilhenchLONDON, July 1 The ageing oil and gas network of the UK North Sea is seeing a welcome rise in interest from infrastructure specialists and pension funds, giving oil majors a chance to offload unwanted assets and ultimately improve recovery from mature fields.Britain's North Sea infrastructure has developed in an ad hoc fashion over the years, and still tends to be owned and operated by the original producers.Now, with their own output on the decline, oil and gas majors are unwillingly turning into service providers for smaller producers who need access to these pipelines and platforms to get their output to shore.But oil majors want to reduce their stakes in these non-core assets to free up capital for use elsewhere. This provides an opportunity for independent midstream owner-operators, pension funds and infrastructure funds to step in.To date, there have been just a handful of transactions in the UK midstream sector - most recently June's sale by BG Group  of its majority stake in the CATS gas pipeline to France's Antin Infrastructure Partners.This follows the 2012 sale of the Teesside Gas Processing Plant (TGPP) to North Sea Midstream Partners (NSMP), which is backed by ArcLight Capital Partners, a private equity firm focused on energy infrastructure.Such transactions have been more common in the Norwegian and Dutch sectors, but industry experts say there is no structural reason why more deals cannot occur in the UK basin. Andy Heppel, chief executive of NSMP, said the firm is keen to grow by targeting acquisitions across the infrastructure spectrum, including oil and gas pipelines, onshore processing/stabilisation plants and terminals.""We are also thinking about new gathering platforms we could invest in on behalf of a number of smaller fields, which on their own couldn't fund and invest in the required infrastructure,"" he said.Attracting midstream players to Britain's North Sea was one of the tasks Sir Ian Wood set for the new industry regulator in his strategic review of the offshore oil and gas sector.Wood pointed out that existing hub owners typically view the provision of processing and transportation services to third parties as a low value activity. There is little incentive for them to take on business which could ask risks to their own operations and use up capacity in their facilities, he said.By contrast, independent midstream specialists don't have distractions or alternative uses for their capital or people. As a result, they can focus on investing in the infrastructure and enhancing the services provided, Heppel said. ""Consistent with the Wood Review, we believe we can encourage the development of the substantial remaining reserves in the UK basin in a quicker, more transparent and customer-focused fashion, without the distraction of an upstream position,"" he said.""An open network can create massive value because ownership of the network is no longer a blocker,"" agreed Philip Whittaker at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). ""An oil company really competes on reservoir drilling and geoscience. Midstream is often an inconvenience.""NEED TO UNBUNDLE Pension funds and infrastructure funds are also taking an interest in non-operating stakes. Antin's purchase follows investments by Dutch pension fund PGGM and Pension Danmark in Dutch gas pipeline networks Nogat and NGT in 2013. Infrastructure appeals to pension funds because of the stable, inflation-linked returns. At the time of its purchase, Pension Danmark said it expected to invest a further 1.21 billion euros in infrastructure over the next four years, the majority of which would be in the energy sector.However, if this ownership model is to gain traction, sellers will have to unbundle infrastructure stakes from reserves, allowing buyers to target the assets they want.Talisman, Shell and Marathon all have North Sea assets on the block, but buyers are getting picky. In June, Marathon failed to sell its Brae facilities, saying it had received no ""acceptable offer"".""They didn't budge on the price as they are not a distressed seller and they didn't desperately need the cash,"" said Sam Wahab, an oil and gas analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe. ""We believe they probably need to split the assets up and then sell to various independent companies.""Traditionally, producers have packaged sale assets together, so buyers wanting access to reserves might also have to take on platforms, pipelines and a share in a processing terminal, whether they want them or not.And whilst there is likely to be plenty of interest in pipeline stakes, the more dilapidated platforms in the North Sea present bigger challenges. There is already a restricted pool of buyers for these assets and industry experts say asking prices must fall if oil majors expect to offload older rigs.""The seller has to have realistic expectations about the price that can be achieved,"" said Erin Moffat, an analyst in the UK upstream research team at Wood Mackenzie.Neil McCulloch, president of the North Sea business at EnQuest, which specialises in extracting value from mature assets, added that some ageing assets don't offer sufficient value for a buyer.""There has to be a sensible attitude by the seller as to what they expect ... they have to be realistic about the depreciation.

The well has been operating since June 13. The other well, in Block 48 of the same field, is producing around 60 million cubic feet of gas per day, a net 15.6 million cubic feet of which belong to Ecopetrol. Ecopetrol's net production in crude equivalent from both wells is 5,041 barrels, the company said in a statement. Ecopetrol, which produces more than half of Colombia's roughly 1 million barrels of oil a day, will release its second-quarter earnings on Thursday evening after markets close.

26,"  * Klesch buys Milford Haven refinery from Murphy Oil* Refinery will restart after deal completed in autumn* Deal safeguards around 450 jobs* Investor eyes more refinery acquisitions in Europe   (Adds comments from Klesch)By Ron BoussoLONDON, July 31 U.S. entrepreneur Gary Klesch is buying the Milford Haven oil refinery on the coast of Wales, safeguarding around 450 jobs and betting an ailing European refining industry can only move up.Klesch agreed on Thursday to buy the 135,000 barrels per day refinery from Murphy Oil for an undisclosed sum, and vowed to restart operations at the struggling plant.The announcement followed more than two years of failed attempts by Murphy to sell its British refining and retail business and as many other European refiners face huge losses amid increasing overseas competition. But Klesch, a seasoned investor credited with bringing distressed debt investing - or ""vulture capitalism"" as it is described by some of its critics - across the Atlantic, is confident now is the time to invest.""Could it go lower? Yeah, probably. But the potential for upside versus downside is probably in your favour given where we're at,"" Klesch said.The size of the refinery, the location on the Atlantic coast and its ""passionate employees"" all work in favour of the investment, he said.""By taking a long-term investment view we aim to secure the future of this refinery for its employees and the broader community,"" Klesch said in a statement announcing the deal. He would not comment on the value of the deal, but said that the Welsh and British governments acted as ""honest brokers"" in the deal that ended months of speculation.Klesch, 67, whose company already owns the Heide refinery in Germany, is planning on buying more European refineries.""In the commodities cycle, we are probably in a trough ... so you will see us buying more refineries in the space of three to six months,"" he said. ""You will see us add more to our metals side and buy some more steel mills. We are very active at the moment,"" he said, adding most of that activity related to Europe.Murphy halted production at the plant in May after failing to strike a deal with London-based private equity fund Grey Bull.The plant will return to production once the acquisition is completed and cleared by the various authorities in the autumn, Klesch, 67, said.""My guess is we will close it (the acquisition) in the end of October and re-start it (the refinery) very, very shortly thereafter,"" he said.Murphy said it was negotiating a separate deal for the sale of its UK retail business operated by subsidiary Murco.The Klesch Group is a global industrial commodities business, with three divisions specialising in the production and trading of chemicals, metals and oil.Around 2 million barrels per day of Europe's oil refining capacity, or roughly 15 percent, must close by 2018 to balance the market, oil consultancy JBC Energy says.

30,"  * A successful bid would make it Vietnam's biggest corporate deal* Kuwait Petroleum Corp unit has bid close to $2 bln for the stake* Murphy leaning to sell the stake to passive investors   (Adds comments details of Petrovietnam's previous acquisitions and other bidders)By Denny ThomasHONG KONG, Aug 14 Petrovietnam has bid for a stake in Murphy Oil Corp's Malaysian oil and gas assets, challenging other suitors including Mitsubishi Corp and Indian state oil companies, a person with direct knowledge of the plan said.The state oil company's bid comes as Vietnam, the third largest holder of crude oil reserves in Asia, seeks to reverse a steady decline in its oil output over the past decade. Murphy Oil and other U.S. oil companies are reducing overseas holdings as oil and gas exploration prospects improve at home.Petrovietnam's offer is more than the $1.5 billion bid placed by the Indian consortium of Oil & Natural Gas Corp  and Oil India Ltd, said the person, who declined to be identified as the sale process is confidential.Arkansas-based Murphy Oil - which has interests in oil and gas fields in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brunei and Australia - is seeking buyers for a 30 percent interest in its Malaysian assets, Reuters previously reported. Petrovietnam's ""thinking is that we will be importing more oil and therefore as a state company we must be involved in oil production overseas,"" said Philip Andrews-Speed, an energy security specialist at Singapore's Energy Studies Institute.The strategy is similar to that used by other state oil companies in the region facing declining domestic production, such as Thailand's PTT Pcl and Malaysia's Petronas , Andrews-Speed said.Vietnam's previous overseas exploration forays have usually been in ex-communist countries like Russia and Venezuela, although Petrovietnam has existing joint ventures with Petronas in the Bunga Orkid and Kekwa oilfields. Vietnam's domestic oil output has peaked as most of its new discoveries have been gas instead of oil. Vietnam is also facing trouble in some offshore exploration areas because of competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.Last month, China moved an oil rig from disputed areas where it had been drilling for oil, diffusing some tension between the two neighbours after one of the worst breakdown in ties since they fought a brief war in 1979.If successful, a Petrovietnam purchase of a stake in the Murphy assets in Malaysia would be Vietnam's biggest ever corporate acquisition, ahead of French firm Perenco SA's $1.29 billion purchase of ConocoPhillips' Vietnam operations in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters data.""They are waking up to the fact other state companies in the region have left them behind,"" said the person with knowledge of Petrovietnam's plan. Murphy Oil's auction of a portion of its Malaysian assets has generated interest from other bidders, including from Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co (KUFPEC), which has offered about $2 billion for the stake, a separate source said.Murphy is leaning towards selling the stake to passive investors - or parties who are not rival oil and gas producers -  which could give Japan's Mitsubishi an edge in the sale process, said other sources with knowledge of the sale process.Murphy Oil did not respond to an email seeking a response, sent outside of U.S. business hours.Petrovietnam chief executive referred Reuters to its overseas development unit, whose chairman could not be reached for comment.Petrovietnam also did not respond to an official letter seeking information on its bid for the holding in Murphy's Malaysian assets.KUFPEC, a unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp, did not respond to emails and phone call seeking comments.

But this has had disappointing results as high-cost investments did not lead to large discoveries.""We have more than 15 major projects to fuel the future growth ... Two thirds of those projects are operated by us so that gives us confidence we will achieve the targets,"" chief financial officer Patrick de La Chevardiere said at Total's  investor day in London on Monday.De La Chevardiere also said Total believed its Yamal joint-venture project in the Arctic could go ahead on time despite international sanctions against Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis. ""We had meetings with EU authorities and they confirmed that onshore Arctic gas projects are not under sanctions."" He said the $27 billion Yamal liquefied natural gas project could no longer raise dollar financing but could still get funding in euros, renminbi and roubles.Total, like other big oil companies, has been under pressure from shareholders to cut costs and raise dividends as rising costs in the oil industry and weaker oil prices squeeze profitability.It has been selling off businesses, such as its adhesives division Bostik, which French chemicals group Arkema  has offered to buy for 1.74 billion euros (2.24 billion US dollar).The company plans to sell $10 billion of assets in 2015-17, having hit a target of $15-20 billion of sales in 2012-2014.Since 2010, Total has generated a total of $30 billion from assets sales, according to De La Chevardiere. That makes it one of the most ambitious sell-off programmes in the industry alongside BP's $50 billion sell-off plan. De La Chevardiere declined to comment on what assets the company could sell, adding that under the previous asset sale plan it had sold both upstream and downstream businesses.The company's investments would fall to $25 billion in 2017 from a peak of $28 billion in 2013 while operating expenses would fall by $2 billion per year by 2017.The group stuck by an earlier target to generate cash of $15 billion in 2017 but cut the target for next year to $7 billion from a previous $10 billion. It had free cash flow of $2.6 billion in 2013.Total's share price was up 0.10 percent at 1505 GMT, after rising as much as 1.4 percent earlier. The stock outperformed its peers BP, ENI and Royal Dutch Shell on Monday and has also outperformed them since the beginning of the year with gains of 13 percent.""The maintenance of the 2017 cash flow target was somewhat of a surprise, although given that further asset sales are included, it was not sufficient to boost sentiment significantly,"" analysts at BMO Capital Markets said in a note. DISCOVERY DISAPPOINTMENT The company also said it had hired Kevin McLachlan as senior vice president for exploration. He was formerly with U.S. energy company Murphy Oil, where he held the same position.Asked about Total's exploration track record, De La Chevardiere said: ""When you follow the fact that we hire somebody from outside, you have the answer. The new head of exploration is coming from another company. The issue we had was to make discoveries.""Total is part of a consortium developing the giant Kashagan oil project in Kazakhstan, which has been held up by gas leaks in the field's pipeline network. The country has said it expects the field, one of the world's biggest oil finds of recent times, to come onstream in 2016.""We are discussing repairing the pipelines. It will be done by 2016 ... It is a last chance for us,"" De La Chevardiere said.Total also did not forecast any output contributions in 2015 from its Angola liquefied natural gas project, where a string of missteps has led to multiple delays. The Chevron-led venture expects the shutdown to last until mid 2015.The CFO said he expected Europe's refining capacity to continue to shrink because of falling demand and poor refining margins. ""We will adapt our production to the market,"" he said adding that the firm could cut capacity or sell refineries.Chief Executive Christophe De Margerie told a conference call with investors on Monday that he was optimistic despite production target cuts.""Total is still well positioned as one of the fastest growing global major companies between now and 2017,"" he said.

Murco Petroleum, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Murphy Oil Corp, announced late on Tuesday that the sale of the 135,000 barrels per day refinery, Britain's smallest, and related terminal assets has been cancelled.Brian Kelly, vice president for UK operations at Murphy Oil, said on Wednesday that the refinery is shut down and that the firm will start removing several units to clean the site and turn it into a storage terminal, which Murphy will put up for sale.Murphy has been trying for more than two years to sell the plant, which had been singled out as a candidate for closure as its location on the far west of the British Isles places it far from large demand centres. ""Some conditions that both Murphy and Klesch agreed must be completed unfortunately were not satisfied,"" Kelly said.Europe's ageing refining industry has been caught between declining demand and increased competition from state-of-the-art overseas operations and U.S. plants fed with cheap shale oil, forcing a wave of closures.""With the excess refining capacity in the UK and EU, we are victims of forces larger than ourselves.

42,"  * Europe's refiners face stiff competition from Asia, U.S.* Did not have political role of Scotland's GrangemouthBy Simon FalushLONDON, Nov 10 U.S. company Murphy Oil  tried for more than four years to sell its Milford Haven refinery in Wales. The plant was finally doomed last week when a deal with entrepreneur Gary Klesch fell through because he could not secure financing.Banks were not convinced Klesch's plans to buy Britain's smallest and least sophisticated plant were viable, sources familiar with the transaction said.The 135,000 barrel-per-day plant has already been shut and will be dismantled in coming months, putting most of its 450 staff out of work.""It was at a smaller scale than other UK refineries, in a relatively remote location, and with a product slate skewed to gasoline at a time when Northwest Europe is surplus gasoline,"" said Stephen George, chief economist at KBC Advanced Technology.The frail state of the European refining industry also means that all but the strongest plants are vulnerable.Competition is increasing from the Middle East and United States, and industry executives say around 1 million bpd of capacity needs to close in the next few years to bring the market into balance. ""There's not a lot of reason for hope (of improvement),"" said Bryan Kelly, vice president for UK operations at Murphy Oil.""Everybody thought 2009 was the worst year for refining until 2011. Then for 2013, cash margins were negative for the whole year.""Klesch declined to comment on the closure. GRANGEMOUTH RESURRECTION The resurrection of the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland the previous year helped foster a view that ailing British plants could be saved.Scotland's only refinery, owned jointly by Ineos  and PetroChina, received a 285 million euro ($357 million) loan guarantee from the British Treasury and a 9 million pound ($14.3 million) grant from the Scottish government.The threat to Grangemouth came just months before a referendum on Scottish independence, and both governments were keen to be seen as protecting Scottish jobs and supporting a vital industry. Grangemouth also has strategic importance because it powers the Kinneil terminal, which processes North Sea crude coming ashore via the Forties Pipeline System, a grade that helps set the Brent benchmark for global oil prices.By comparison, Milford Haven's significance to British politics was much less.Its closure creates a headache for the Conservative-led coalition government in the run-up to elections next May. The Welsh government pledged a loan guarantee of 100 million pounds to keep it afloat.But Milford Haven is the smaller of two refineries in Wales and the smallest of the seven plants in the United Kingdom.""Grangemouth has a crude cost advantage and is better located from a market perspective,"" said Colin Birch, a vice president at IHS Global.(1 US dollar = 0.8004 euro)(1 US dollar = 0.6301 British pound)   (Additional reporting by Claire Milhench and Ron Bousso; editing by Jane Baird)",2014-11-10,MUR,"Mon Nov 10, 2014 | 10:39am EST","Wrong place, small size, ailing industry kill Welsh refinery",http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSL6N0SW5X520141110?type=companyNews
43,"  * December daily output to average 2.03 mln bpd* Volumes seen as hefty without pick up in Asia shipments* Better European refining margins may boost local buying* TABLE-Of 12 North Sea crude streams:By Claire MilhenchLONDON, Nov 13 North Sea daily oil output tracked by Reuters is set to jump by 11.5 percent in December from November, which traders said the market would struggle to absorb unless there is a pick-up in the number of shipments heading to Asia.""With just one VLCC a month going to Asia, North Sea differentials have been fairly stable, but this increase in volume is likely to weigh on differentials,"" a trader said. November's cargoes have been slow to clear, and physical crude prices have slipped over the week. The rise in North Sea output could add pressure to the main global crude benchmark - the Brent futures contract - which has already fallen to a four-year low below $79 a barrel.Output from 12 of the main British and Norwegian crude streams is set to average 2.028 million barrels per day (bpd) in December, up from a revised 1.819 million bpd in November.November's volumes have been revised downwards because the loading dates of three Ekofisk cargoes, two Forties, one Oseberg and one Brent cargo were pushed back into December. As a result, the Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk streams, which underpin dated Brent, will load 1.007 million bpd in December, up 19.9 percent on November's daily loadings.To date, only one VLCC has been fixed to Asia for November, and an early fixture for December failed. Traders noted that freight rates had increased, limiting arbitrage opportunities, especially as Middle Eastern and local Asian crudes are currently cheap.""Without the Asian option to relieve the pressure of growing supplies, the overhang in the Atlantic Basin will grow longer,"" analysts at JBC Energy said. On the flip side, if freight rates keep rising, it could restrict the amount of West African crude moving to Europe, and force European refiners to buy North Sea crudes.Refinery margins are currently fairly robust because of tightness in both the European gasoline and diesel markets.A Rotterdam refinery cracking Brent was making $8.39 a barrel on Nov. 13, according to Reuters' models, up from an average of $5.80 a barrel in October.""Cracks are extraordinarily strong and product stocks are low,"" a trader said.End-user demand is also quite healthy due to lower outright prices, which have encouraged consumers to stock up on heating oil and drive their cars more.""This will certainly entice European refiners to lift runs,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas, told Reuters Global Oil Forum.

""Targeted efforts have been made to reduce costs and ensure a cost-efficient delivery and execution,"" Statoil said. ""We are therefore pleased to see that Norwegian suppliers have regained their competitiveness.""Nordic oil companies have made securing Sverdrup contracts a top priority as oil prices tumble and oil investments elsewhere are cut back. Norway's Kvaerner and Aker Solutions  have already won Sverdrup contracts, helping offset some of the industry's spending cuts.But Kvaerner said it would have to cut costs in its platform deck business after losing out on the Statoil contract to Aibel. With up to 3 billion barrels of oil equivalents and peak production seen at up to 650,000 barrels per day, Sverdrup is one of the biggest North Sea finds in decades, giving Norway's oil sector a big boost after production has been on a steady decline since 2000.The field, in relatively shallow waters in a mature area, is also among the cheapest to produce, breaking even at an oil price under $40 per barrel, ensuring profitability even after oil prices have halved and now trade under $60 per barrel.Aibel will build the platform in separate modules in Norway and Thailand, before assembling it at its Norwegian yard.Rivals Odfjell and National Oilwell will receive substantial subcontracting work, Aibel said.

50,"  * Ministry to revoke licences unless ownership changes* LetterOne given six months to sell assets   (Adds LetterOne reaction, background)By Karolin SchapsLONDON, April 20 Britain ordered Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman to sell his North Sea gas fields within six months, an intervention that ratchets up the pressure on one of Russia's most influential tycoons two weeks before a UK election.Upping the ante in a standoff that some Russian businessmen say shows their capital is no longer welcome in the West, Britain's energy minister told Fridman's investment vehicle that its North Sea licences would be revoked unless they were sold.Britain's first such order in the sector follows LetterOne's acquisition of the fields last month as part of a 5.1 billion euro takeover of RWE's DEA oil unit. Prime Minister David Cameron opposed the purchase of the British fields.Energy Minister Ed Davey ""proposes to revoke DEA UK's North Sea petroleum licences unless LetterOne arranges for a further change of control of the DEA UK gas fields in the North Sea"", the ministry said in a statement.The ministry, which said the decision was made after assessing cross-government views, said Davey had given LetterOne six months to sell the assets. LetterOne declined to comment.After a showdown with President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine, the prospect of a Russian tycoon buying British energy assets is politically unpalatable, especially so close to the election.Britain, which styles itself as a champion of free markets with one of the world's most open economies, rarely intervenes in such cases but in a sign of the gravity of the British concerns, the deal was discussed by Cameron.A source close to the situation told Reuters last month that Cameron had opposed the purchase of the British fields. RUSSIAN MONEY The British stance reflects deep unease in London about Putin's actions in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have been killed in fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. Moscow denies backing the rebels.Government sources previously told Reuters Britain's decision had been influenced by a case in 2010, when it had to shut down the North Sea Rhum gas field because of sanctions imposed on its Iranian co-owner. A British source close to the situation said the government had no reason to doubt LetterOne would find a suitable buyer within the given timeframe.""The government will have a role to play (in finding a buyer),"" said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity.""The entire thing has been about protecting assets of national significance,"" the source said.The fields Fridman has purchased produce 3 to 5 percent of Britain's gas output.Britain's North Sea is in dire need of fresh investment as traditional large oil companies such as BP and Shell have started withdrawing from the mature basin that is getting more and more costly to find new oil and gas in.Ukrainian-born Fridman, who made a fortune in Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, has tried to allay British worries by grouping the assets at the centre of the dispute in a Dutch foundation, a step he says would insulate them from any possible sanctions.Fridman, 50, is ranked by Forbes as the world's 68th richest person with a fortune of $14.6 billion, while his business partner German Khan, 53, is ranked 133rd with $9.5 billion.

51,"  * Private equity funds in talks to buy North Sea assets* Recent rebound in oil prices accelerated process* Sharp rise in number of assets for sale in 2015By Ron BoussoLONDON, May 15 High-profile oil and gas executives are teaming up with private equity funds seeking to invest billions in British North Sea assets and maximize profits by cutting costs, offering the ageing basin a badly needed lifeline.With an estimated $10 billion in their war chests, large funds including Riverstone Energy, Carlyle Group  and Blackstone are in talks to buy producing assets or invest in struggling exploration and production (E&P) companies, several bankers and industry sources said.The funds are hiring high-profile executive teams who will use their experience to drive costs lower by introducing efficiencies and slash contractor costs at new assets.Fresh investment in the North Sea has stalled in recent years due to a relatively unfavourable tax regime. Output from many fields has steadily declined since the basin's peak production in the 1990s.Despite that, some assets remain highly attractive. These  include the Laggan Tormore field, where France's Total  is selling, and gas fields being put on the block by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's LetterOne fund.""Private equity and other funds are beginning to make more concrete steps towards completing investments in the North Sea,"" one source involved in such talks said. In some cases, funds and executives are opting to create new vehicles to manage oil and gas fields such as Siccar Point, created late last year and headed by Jonathan Roger, a former executive at Conoco and British energy supplier Centrica, and backed by Blackstone and BlueWaterEnergy.Another such fund is Aberdeen, Scotland-based Verus Petroleum, backed by Norwegian private equity fund Hitech Vision and headed by Alan Curran, a North Sea veteran with Wood Group and Lundin Petroleum.Some of the funds are also pursuing a more traditional path by investing in struggling producing companies, introducing new changed to their boards in order to lead a restructure and increase profits using the experience of their management teams.""As a result of recent M&A activity and corporate restructuring, there are a number of C-level executives currently considering their options,"" said Emma Wild, UK Head of Upstream Advisory at KPMG.""With some Private Equity firms making little secret of their desire to invest in the European upstream sector, Siccar Point backed by Blackstone and BlueWater as an example, marrying this capital to management with a strong track record offers an opportunity for private equity firms to invest in what some are calling the 'bottom of the cycle'."" Caryle, Riverstone, BlackRoch, Siccar Point and Verus Petroleum declined to comment.STILL CHALLENGED Investment in the North Sea remains challenged. ""The lay of the land is still difficult. It is a high-cost basin,"" Amjad Bseisu, Chief Executive Officer of North Sea producer Enquest told Reuters.""You will see incremental activities with fields that are near the major hubs, but I do think we will see a continued decline in investments in the United Kingdom and earlier decommissioning of fields,"" he said.Many oil companies, small and large, have put assets on the block in recent months as part of a sector-wide cost cutting drive in the wake of the halving of crude price between last July to early 2015.Deal making nevertheless dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2015 as the gap between buyers' and sellers' price expectations widened following the rapid decline in prices.The near 40 percent price recovery since January is now narrowing the gap, paving the way for new deals, according to the sources.Royal's Dutch Shell $70 billion bid for its smaller British rival BG Group announced last month was also seen as a catalyst for new deals, they said.A total of 46 asset packages, which include dozens of oil and gas production fields and exploration blocks, are currently up for sale in the UK North Sea at an estimated total value of $5.9 billion, said Mangesh Hirve, managing director at 1Derrick consultancy.The number of assets offered has increased over the past year by more than 50 percent, Hirve said.(Editing by William Hardy)",2015-05-15,MUR,"Fri May 15, 2015 | 6:31am EDT","Top oil execs, cash-rich funds team up to buy UK North Sea assets",http://www.reuters.com//article/oil-ma-britain-idUSL5N0Y454920150515?type=companyNews

60,"   By Nia Williams | CALGARY, Alberta  CALGARY, Alberta Suncor Energy, Canada's largest oil and gas producer, said on Thursday it will focus on improving efficiency but not seek operatorship at Syncrude oil sands project in northern Alberta, in which it is acquiring a majority stake.Calgary-based Suncor said on Wednesday it has struck a deal to buy Murphy Oil Corp's 5 percent stake in Syncrude for C$937 million ($747.33 million).The deal follows Suncor's acquisition of Canadian Oil Sands Ltd and its 37 percent stake in February, making Suncor the majority shareholder in the mining and upgrading project, Canada's largest single source of crude production, with 53.74 percent.The Syncrude project, operated by joint venture partner Imperial Oil Ltd, has capacity to produce around 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) of light synthetic crude, but has been dogged for years by operating issues and frequently undershot production targets.In the first quarter, however, Syncrude had its best production rates for five years with 91 percent utilization for the upgrader and Suncor chief executive Steve Williams said he was aiming to replicate that performance more frequently. ""We expect it will take both time and effort to reach a point where the operations can be sustained at this level of performance, but have no doubt we are definitely up for the challenge,"" he said on a first quarter earnings call.Williams said having a majority stake would give Suncor some governance benefits but the company had no plans to seek operatorship of the Syncrude project. ""Our primary objective is to get the reliability of that asset up by working with Imperial and Syncrude and I'm greatly encouraged by the progress that has been made,"" he said.Suncor reported a C$500 million operating loss after the market close on Wednesday as weak global crude prices outweighed record production.TD Securities analyst Menno Hulshof said Suncor had a very good quarter operationally despite low oil prices, with reduced operating costs and improved upgrader reliability. ""Suncor is clearly making a relatively big bet on both Syncrude, and the mining business more generally,"" Hulshof said in a note, adding that the company's Fort Hills project, currently under construction, will add another 91,000 bpd of mining capacity in late 2017.Suncor shares were last up 2.3 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$37.07.
