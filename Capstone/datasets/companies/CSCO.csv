5,"  By Martinne Geller and Dmitry ZhdannikovDAVOS, Switzerland Jan 24 Pepsico, Nestle and Cisco on Friday announced major investments that together totaled more than $7 billion in Mexico, where the government has pushed through a series of economic reforms that aim to boost foreign investment and growth.Mexico has embraced free trade policies in recent decades, and has drawn growing investment interest after President Enrique Pena Nieto made a landmark reform drive in his first year in office, pushing major telecommunications, energy, banking and tax legislation through a divided Congress.""It is very encouraging to see the enthusiasm that has been awoken by our country due to the structural changes that are happening,"" Pena Nieto said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.Pepsico said it would spend $5 billion in Mexico over five years to strengthen its food and beverage business, adding it planned to expand its production capacity by adding new manufacturing lines and expand delivery routes.The company said the investment was expected to create 4,000 new jobs.The Pepsico investment comes despite a new levy on soft drinks and junk foods included in Pena Nieto's tax overhaul.Nestle said it planned to invest $1 billion in Mexico over five years, building two new factories and expanding a third in its sixth-biggest market. The world's No. 1 food maker said it would build an infant nutrition factory in Jalisco and a pet-food factory in Guanajuato, as well as expanding an existing cereal factory.The investment would create 700 direct jobs, Nestle said.The Mexican factories will produce goods for the wider region. For example, about 40 percent of the output from the baby food factory will be exported to Latin America and the Caribbean.In the third major investment announcement at Davos, Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said it would direct $1.35 billion into Mexican manufacturing operations and a support center this year. Pena Nieto has said that foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico totaled $28 billion during the first 9 months of 2013.FDI was boosted last year by the Belgian-based beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev's acquisition of Grupo Modelo , which went through at the end of May and brought in about $13 billion.OIL PROSPECTS  Separately, Mexican state-run company Pemex will sign a cooperation memorandum with Russia's No.2 oil producer Lukoil  on Friday, Pemex chief executive Emilio Lozoya told Reuters, as the country is opening up its energy sector in a move to boost production.Lozoya said that Pemex and Lukoil would share information on the deep water and shale deposits that Mexico currently lacks the expertise to tap.The planned cooperation between Lukoil and Pemex comes after Pena Nieto last month signed a bill into law that ended the country's 75-year-old oil and gas monopoly.Under the legislation, which is still being mapped out, foreign companies will be able to enter the sector as Pemex is seeking to bring in expertise and boost efficiency.""There are dozens of new players who now come and look at the opportunities that are opening up in Mexico,"" Pemex CEO Lozoya said.Lozoya said he met with various companies in Davos that expressed interest in exploration and production projects in Mexico as well as refining, petrochemicals and transportation businesses that are now open to private investment.As a private company, Lukoil is struggling to get large new deposits in Russia, including offshore, and is actively pursuing a foreign expansion to maintain its production levels.",2014-01-24,CSCO,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 1:27pm EST",UPDATE 1-Mexico draws over $7 bln in foreign investment at Davos,http://www.reuters.com//article/davos-mexico-idUSL2N0KY0YX20140124?type=companyNews
6,"  WASHINGTON Jan 28 President Barack Obama called for Congress to pass legislation aimed at reining in what many companies complain are proliferating and frivolous patent infringement lawsuits.Tech companies have long complained about the lawsuits, often filed by companies derisively called ""patent trolls,"" but retailers, coffee shops, banks and others have since been accused of infringement and joined the ranks of those lobbying lawmakers for protection.The president announced a blueprint for reducing the number of lawsuits in June and reiterated support for the effort on Tuesday night.""And let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation,"" said Obama in his State of the Union address. There are a range of bills before Congress on the matter but two are seen as having the best chance of becoming law.The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Dec. 5 to approve a bill sponsored by Robert Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, that encourages judges hearing patent cases to award fees to the winner of an infringement lawsuit. The bill also requires companies filing infringement lawsuits to detail which patent is infringed - something that does not now reliably happen.Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has sponsored similar legislation. Differences between the House and Senate bills would need to be ironed out before patent legislation could become law. Technology companies largely support the proposed measures, including Cisco Systems Inc, Apple Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Google Inc  and other powerhouses.The Association for Competitive Technology, which represents small tech companies, also backs the legislation.But others worry that the proposed legislation could hurt small companies whose patents are genuinely infringed. They fear the measure would tip the judicial balance in favor of defendants in patent infringement lawsuits.",2014-01-29,CSCO,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 9:48pm EST",Obama urges Congress to pass anti-patent troll bill,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-obama-patent-idUSL2N0L225Z20140129?type=companyNews

Americans will continue to lead the world as earlier and faster converts to new smart devices and networks, the Cisco report said.""It's more people, more connections, faster speeds on the networks and then more rich content, which in this case is video, video, video,"" Robert Pepper, Cisco's vice president for global technology policy, told Reuters.Cisco, one of the leading makers of networking equipment, studies the use and speed of devices, connections and data for an annual forecast of mobile data traffic trends.U.S. wireless networks will continue to experience a steep increase in so-called machine-to-machine communications, as Americans seek the convenience of devices that talk to each other and the Internet, like remotely operated thermostats or smart anti-theft sensors, according to Cisco's forecast. Internet-linked devices will keep spreading at a fast clip, with some 271 million connections between gadgets and the Internet forecast for 2018 - an eight-fold jump from 35 million in 2013 that is driven by the predicted boom in wearable devices like activity-tracking wristband Fitbit, Pepper said.By 2018, Cisco predicts that U.S. mobile data traffic will reach 2.7 exabytes a month - equal to the amount of data stored on some 675 million DVDs. In 2013, less than half an exabyte of data crossed U.S. networks on average per month.The findings contribute to the growing concerns in the telecommunications industry that demand for data will soon far exceed the networks' capacity, and connection speeds will slow. Though some have argued that technological advancements may prevent the crisis, wireless companies say they need more airwaves to evade the spectrum crunch.""If we don't add more spectrum in the long term, what it means for cellular networks is congestion, particularly in the peak hours and particularly in urban areas,"" said Mary Brown, Cisco's director of government affairs. The Federal Communications Commission is stepping up its work to reshuffle ownership of airwaves, including efforts to clear large slices of frequencies controlled by government agencies for use by private companies and consumers.Cisco also forecast that U.S. carriers will increasingly rely on WiFi connections to automatically divert data traffic, nearly two-thirds of it by 2018.""Even as networks get more and more powerful, they're certainly continuing to add to the amount of traffic that's traveling over both cellular and WiFi networks,"" Brown said.""We're going to need more than just technological improvements to satisfy those demand curves.

Internet-linked devices will keep spreading at a fast clip, with some 271 million connections between gadgets and the Internet forecast for 2018 - an eight-fold jump from 35 million in 2013 that is driven by the predicted boom in wearable devices like activity-tracking wristband Fitbit, Pepper said.By 2018, Cisco predicts that U.S. mobile data traffic will reach 2.7 exabytes a month - equal to the amount of data stored on some 675 million DVDs. In 2013, less than half an exabyte of data crossed U.S. networks on average per month. The findings contribute to the growing concerns in the telecommunications industry that demand for data will soon far exceed the networks' capacity, and connection speeds will slow.Though some have argued that technological advancements may prevent the crisis, wireless companies say they need more airwaves to evade the spectrum crunch.""If we don't add more spectrum in the long term, what it means for cellular networks is congestion, particularly in the peak hours and particularly in urban areas,"" said Mary Brown, Cisco's director of government affairs. The Federal Communications Commission is stepping up its work to reshuffle ownership of airwaves, including efforts to clear large slices of frequencies controlled by government agencies for use by private companies and consumers.Cisco also forecast that U.S. carriers will increasingly rely on WiFi connections to automatically divert data traffic, nearly two-thirds of it by 2018.""Even as networks get more and more powerful, they're certainly continuing to add to the amount of traffic that's traveling over both cellular and WiFi networks,"" Brown said.""We're going to need more than just technological improvements to satisfy those demand curves. We're going to need more spectrum.""",2014-02-05,CSCO,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 8:00am EST",U.S. mobile data traffic to jump nearly 8-fold by 2018 -Cisco,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-spectrum-cisco-idUSL2N0L81PB20140205?type=companyNews
12,"   By Jim Finkle  Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc plans to take on Cisco Systems Inc and Palo Alto Networks Inc in selling intrusion prevention systems, which help companies detect cyber threats that breach their firewalls.FireEye said on Monday it wants to start selling the new products by the middle of this year, adding to its existing technology that helps protect computers from infection by tainted messages and malicious websites.The intrusion prevention systems (IPS) market totaled nearly $1.9 billion in 2012, according to market research firm IDC. That is nearly 10 times the size of the market for specialized threat analysis and protection technology, for which FireEye is best known.""They are really working to broaden their addressable market,"" said John Grady, an analyst with IDC who was briefed by FireEye on the new IPS technology.Besides Cisco and Palo Alto Networks, other players in the IPS market include Intel Corp and Trend Micro Inc, according to Grady. FireEye has been aggressively expanding since it went public last year in one of the hottest U.S. stock market debuts. Its shares have nearly quadrupled since September 2013 and jumped 8.65 percent to close at $78.85 on Monday on the Nasdaq.In December, FireEye purchased cyber forensics and security software firm Mandiant Corp for about $1 billion. The company is best known for uncovering a Chinese military unit believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on U.S. companies.Entering the IPS market is part of FireEye Chief Executive Dave DeWalt's strategy of developing a technology platform that customers can use to run a variety of products to protect their networks from cyber attacks. When he was named CEO in November 2012, FireEye's technology was well regarded by industry analysts, but many described it as a provider of a niche product that companies needed to bolt on to software and equipment from bigger security firms.Adding new product lines could help the company achieve profitability. FireEye has reported large losses over the past year as DeWalt spent heavily to build a global sales force to market its products. ""They continue to add more notches on their product belt,"" said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. ""Combined with Mandiant, they're front and center to really be one of the main consolidators in terms of overall (security) spending, to gain more of a share of the overall budgets.""FireEye posted an operating loss of $111 million in the first nine months of last year, though revenue more than doubled from a year earlier to $104 million.In addition to the IPS product, FireEye also plans to unveil tools to analyze security events and describe how it has incorporated Mandiant's threat detection software into its platform, according to a company spokesman.When asked if other acquisitions are in the works, DeWalt said by email that the company would ""be opportunistic with future acquisitions as the need arises.""(Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Grant McCool)",2014-02-10,CSCO,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 5:37pm EST","FireEye takes on Cisco, Palo Alto with new cyber product",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-fireye-product-idUSBREA191WB20140210?type=companyNews

20,"   By Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors who were shocked by Cisco Systems Inc's dire financial outlook in its last quarterly earnings report are bracing for more bad news when the network equipment maker reports results on Wednesday.Cisco warned on November 13 that revenue would decline as much as 10 percent in its second fiscal quarter ended in January and that it would not resume growth for several quarters.It blamed weak demand in emerging markets and from service provider customers as well as a backlash against U.S. government spying in China.Now, investors may face more gloomy predictions when the company reports fiscal second-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, according to analysts.""Expectations are pretty low. I think the company is not going to be upbeat,"" said Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold. ""They'll meet expectations on earnings, they'll tell us the environment is tough and that they're working to restore their growth.""Leopold said that some investors had hoped that the company was being overly cautious when it issued its bleak financial targets in November. But with few signs of improvement from the broader market, Leopold said that any hopes of a quick turnaround have faded.""That seemingly conservative guidance seems pretty appropriate,"" said Leopold, citing broader concerns about weakness in emerging markets and weak reports from other companies with exposure there.International Business Machines Corp, another U.S. technology bellwether with emerging markets exposure, missed its revenue expectations for the fourth quarter in a row in January, citing weakness in markets such as China. Wall Street on average expects Cisco to report earnings per share of 37 cents on revenue of $11.027 billion for its fiscal second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian Marshall said Cisco's woes could reach a trough in its fiscal third quarter but added that its ""outlook remains uncertain.""""We expect emerging market demand to remain challenged in the near-term and the service provider weakness appears to be more of a Cisco-specific issue,"" White said. The average analyst estimate is for fiscal third quarter revenue of $11.34 billion, which represents a slight sequential increase but a big decline from the year-ago revenue of $12.2 billion.Cisco shares, which closed at $24 on November 13 ahead of the company's warning, fell almost 16 percent to $20.24 by mid-December, when Cisco also cut its long-term growth targets.The stock has gradually improved and closed at $22.71 on Tuesday. But this is likely because of investors' long-term hopes rather than any illusions about a quick turnaround.""Anybody who's been buying here is certainly going to be patient,"" Leopold said.(Reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-02-12,CSCO,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 7:03pm EST",Cisco results to reflect sales slump; investors brace for more bad news,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-cisco-preview-idUSBREA1B00720140212?type=companyNews

U.S. stocks rose, with big gains in technology stocks, putting the Nasdaq on track for a sixth straight session of gains, its longest winning streak since December 2011.

Sales fell unexpectedly in January, while other data showed more Americans filed for jobless benefits last week.

31,"  By Danielle RobinsonNEW YORK, Feb 24 (IFR) - Cisco Systems has launched an US$8 billion seven-tranche jumbo bond issue after being deluged with more than US$21 billion of orders for its first debt transaction in three years.The deal, led by Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan, is the biggest investment-grade bond of the year so far, and the second largest offering from a technology company, behind Apple's US$17bn deal in 2013.Investors jumped at the chance to buy the bond, whose  proceeds will take out US$3.75bn of Cisco notes coming due this year. Cisco, which has suffered lacklustre earnings in recent quarters, was also generous with spread, especially for the short-dated maturities.""This deal looked particularly attractive at the front end,"" said one investor who took part in the deal.

48,"  (Fixes company's name in fourth paragraph to Juniper from Jupiter.)By Nicola Leske and Greg RoumeliotisApril 14 Juniper Networks Inc, the network gear maker under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Corp to restructure, is exploring a sale of its mobile security unit Junos Pulse, according to people familiar with the matter.The move follows an extensive review of Juniper's enterprise businesses and could signal a willingness by the Sunnyvale, California-based company to shed more non-core assets, in line with recent calls by some of its activist shareholders.Juniper, the No 2 gear maker after Cisco Systems Inc , has hired investment bank UBS AG to help find a buyer for Junos Pulse, the people said. Junos Pulse offers a range of mobile security infrastructure products aimed at protecting corporate-owned mobile devices. Juniper has not sent detailed financial information on Junos Pulse to interested parties yet, but some of the sources said any deal will likely value Junos Pulse in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Juniper declined to comment while UBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Juniper, which has a market capitalization of $11.5 billion, carried out a review of its enterprise-focused networking assets last year following an attempt in 2012 to shed some assets that handle networking for enterprise clients, Reuters reported at the time.Following the appointment of a new chief executive, ex-Barclays Chief Operations and Technology Officer Shaygan Kheradpir in January, a number of activist investors began buying shares in the company, sensing an opportunity to push for change.

60,"   By Marina Lopes and Aruna Viswanatha | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON In a series of audits in 2009, Cisco Systems Inc found that much of the business between resellers of its products and a Russian state-owned telecommunications company, Svyazinvest, could not be verified because it was either ""misrepresented"" or documents were withheld by the resellers, according to an executive summary of the audits reviewed by Reuters.The June 2009 report on the audits, other internal Cisco documents, and interviews with two sources familiar with the situation, raise questions about whether the company knew what was happening to telecom equipment sales going through its resellers in Russia, as well as whether discounts were passed on to customers as planned. Cisco, like many Western companies, often relies on local resellers, or distributors, to sell its products in such countries.San Jose, California-based Cisco is currently conducting an investigation into allegations of possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The allegations concerned Cisco's operations in Russia and certain of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and some resellers of its products, the company said in a filing on February 20, without elaborating further.Cisco, which is one of the world's largest telecom equipment companies, has not said whether the probe concerns one or both of the main parts of the law - the anti-bribery or the accounting provisions. Under the former, it is prohibited for American companies and persons to make corrupt payments to officials of foreign governments or state-controlled companies. Under the accounting provisions, companies must keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls.""It's is an ongoing investigation and we're putting a lot of resources into making sure it is done right,"" said Mark Chandler, Cisco's general counsel, in a statement to Reuters. ""We're fully cooperating with and sharing the results with the SEC and the Justice Department. The outcome of the investigation isn't determinable, but we don't expect it to have any adverse material impact on Cisco.""Cisco, which has hired the law firm WilmerHale to do the internal probe, declined to be more specific about the investigation or to comment on the audits summary and other documents.A source familiar with the matter said that the DOJ and the SEC are carrying out their own investigations into Cisco's behavior to see if it breached the FCPA. Often U.S. authorities will ask a company to carry out an internal investigation and determine any possible penalties based on the levels of thoroughness of the probe and the amount of cooperation they receive.According to a March 30 article on the online news website Buzzfeed.com, a whistleblower went to the SEC with the allegations last year. Whistleblowers can be eligible to receive up to 30 percent of fines a company pays to the DOJ and the SEC for FCPA breaches.SOME DOCUMENTS ""FALSIFIED"" The June 2009 audits summary shows that Cisco was having trouble knowing what happened to the product it was selling.Out of $23 million in sales bookings for Cisco's telecom equipment destined for Svyazinvest during 2008-2009 that were examined in the audits, only $5 million, or 22 percent, ""are likely to be ok,"" the summary said. Those sales to Svyazinvest - which is now part of state-controlled Rostelecom - went through a company called Compulink. An opinion on almost two thirds of these bookings, or $14.7 million, ""could not be rendered due to partner refusal to provide supporting documentation,"" the summary said. Those sales were handled by a reseller called Step Logic Companies.And another $3.1 million, or 13 percent, through two firms - AKOM and Stins Coman - were described as ""misrepresented."" Some Stins Coman documents were classified as ""falsified"" in an accompanying table in the summary.A Rostelecom spokesman said that ""we have not heard about such facts"" and declined further comment.A Compulink spokeswoman said Cisco does not carry out audits of the company, while Stins Coman spokesperson Ida Gill said it has not had any contracts with Svyazinvest. Step Logic denied withholding audit documents from Cisco, according to Inna Ozerova, the firm's marketing director. AKOM could not be located for comment.The summary of the audits and other documents do not allege that inappropriate payments were made. It is unclear whether the inability to verify the sales are part of the FCPA investigations by either the authorities or Cisco.The purpose of the audits was to increase the level of assurance about the ""integrity"" of orders that went through the resellers and the ""appropriateness"" of a 68 percent discount provided by Cisco on the sales the resellers reported they had made to Svyazinvest, according to the summary. The report does not reach a conclusion on what happened to the discount and whether it was allocated as Cisco wanted. FOLLOW THE MONEY A separate report of a meeting in February 2008 shows that after various costs - including tax and a margin for the reseller - Svyazinvest should have received 56 percentage points of the 68 percent discount, though that document said there was ""a lack of clarity"" about the final price it paid.One of the sources familiar with the transactions says that Svyazinvest appears to have paid full price for at least some Cisco equipment, raising questions about whether resellers offered or applied the discount.Three legal and compliance experts who have been briefed on the audits summary say one key question that Cisco is likely to be trying to answer is where the 68 percent went. They said the other critical issue concerns the company's records and controls.""The first thing it would trigger in my mind is ‘we have to know where our money is.' We have people in our distribution system who are not giving us reports, and we have money in our transactions that does not seem to be visible to us,"" said Stephen Clayton, an attorney who was head of anti-corruption compliance at server maker Sun Microsystems before it was bought by Oracle Corp in 2010.""The most critical part of the FCPA is not bribery, it is that you are required by U.S. law as a public company to have accurate books and records and to have an adequate system of corporate controls,"" Clayton added. In a guide to the FCPA published in November 2012, the SEC and the DOJ said that ""unreasonably large discounts to third-party distributors"" is a common red flag that might indicate there could be a violation of the law.""If people are unwilling to turn over documents or the ones they turn over on their face have been falsified, it raises numerous questions,"" said Peter Bible, the chief risk officer at U.S. accounting firm EisnerAmper, and a former chief accountant at General Motors. Bible, who spent time in Russia when GM was setting up a joint venture about 10 years ago, said that documentation problems were common there.The summary contains a series of actions that it said were agreed to by Cisco's Russia leadership team, including issuing warnings to some staff involved in the Svyazinvest business, terminating ""Cisco partner status"" for at least one reseller, and tightening controls.Bible said this seemed to signal that Cisco was at the time taking the correct steps to sort out the problem. Based on the summary, ""they didn't just sweep it under the rug,"" he said.It is unclear whether Cisco followed through on all the actions outlined in the document. Cisco declined to comment.BIGGER DISCOUNTS The size of the discount offered to the resellers does not seem to have been extraordinary for Russia.

61,"  (Updating with background on Cisco)By Marina Lopes and Aruna ViswanathaNEW YORK/WASHINGTON May 14 In a series of audits in 2009, Cisco Systems Inc found that much of the business between resellers of its products and a Russian state-owned telecommunications company, Svyazinvest, could not be verified because it was either ""misrepresented"" or documents were withheld by the resellers, according to an executive summary of the audits reviewed by Reuters.The June 2009 report on the audits, other internal Cisco documents, and interviews with two sources familiar with the situation, raise questions about whether the company knew what was happening to telecom equipment sales going through its resellers in Russia, as well as whether discounts were passed on to customers as planned. Cisco, like many Western companies, often relies on local resellers, or distributors, to sell its products in such countries.San Jose, California-based Cisco is currently conducting an investigation into allegations of possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The allegations concerned Cisco's operations in Russia and certain of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and some resellers of its products, the company said in a filing on Feb. 20, without elaborating further.Cisco, which is one of the world's largest telecom equipment companies, has not said whether the probe concerns one or both of the main parts of the law - the anti-bribery or the accounting provisions. Under the former, it is prohibited for American companies and persons to make corrupt payments to officials of foreign governments or state-controlled companies. Under the accounting provisions, companies must keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls.""It's is an ongoing investigation and we're putting a lot of resources into making sure it is done right,"" said Mark Chandler, Cisco's general counsel, in a statement to Reuters. ""We're fully cooperating with and sharing the results with the SEC and the Justice Department. The outcome of the investigation isn't determinable, but we don't expect it to have any adverse material impact on Cisco.""Cisco, which has hired the law firm WilmerHale to do the internal probe, declined to be more specific about the investigation or to comment on the audits summary and other documents.A source familiar with the matter said that the DOJ and the SEC are carrying out their own investigations into Cisco's behavior to see if it breached the FCPA. Often U.S. authorities will ask a company to carry out an internal investigation and determine any possible penalties based on the levels of thoroughness of the probe and the amount of cooperation they receive.According to a March 30 article on the online news website Buzzfeed.com, a whistleblower went to the SEC with the allegations last year. Whistleblowers can be eligible to receive up to 30 percent of fines a company pays to the DOJ and the SEC for FCPA breaches.SOME DOCUMENTS ""FALSIFIED"" The June 2009 audits summary shows that Cisco was having trouble knowing what happened to the product it was selling. Out of $23 million in sales bookings for Cisco's telecom equipment destined for Svyazinvest during 2008-2009 that were examined in the audits, only $5 million, or 22 percent, ""are likely to be ok,"" the summary said. Those sales to Svyazinvest - which is now part of state-controlled Rostelecom - went through a company called Compulink.An opinion on almost two thirds of these bookings, or $14.7 million, ""could not be rendered due to partner refusal to provide supporting documentation,"" the summary said. Those sales were handled by a reseller called Step Logic Companies.And another $3.1 million, or 13 percent, through two firms - AKOM and Stins Coman  - were described as ""misrepresented."" Some Stins Coman documents were classified as ""falsified"" in an accompanying table in the summary.A Rostelecom spokesman said that ""we have not heard about such facts"" and declined further comment.A Compulink spokeswoman said Cisco does not carry out audits of the company, while Stins Coman spokesperson Ida Gill said it has not had any contracts with Svyazinvest. Step Logic denied withholding audit documents from Cisco, according to Inna Ozerova, the firm's marketing director. AKOM could not be located for comment.The summary of the audits and other documents do not allege that inappropriate payments were made. It is unclear whether the inability to verify the sales are part of the FCPA investigations by either the authorities or Cisco. The purpose of the audits was to increase the level of assurance about the ""integrity"" of orders that went through the resellers and the ""appropriateness"" of a 68 percent discount provided by Cisco on the sales the resellers reported they had made to Svyazinvest, according to the summary. The report does not reach a conclusion on what happened to the discount and whether it was allocated as Cisco wanted.FOLLOW THE MONEY A separate report of a meeting in February 2008 shows that after various costs - including tax and a margin for the reseller - Svyazinvest should have received 56 percentage points of the 68 percent discount, though that document said there was ""a lack of clarity"" about the final price it paid.One of the sources familiar with the transactions says that Svyazinvest appears to have paid full price for at least some Cisco equipment, raising questions about whether resellers offered or applied the discount.Three legal and compliance experts who have been briefed on the audits summary say one key question that Cisco is likely to  be trying to answer is where the 68 percent went. They said the other critical issue concerns the company's records and controls.""The first thing it would trigger in my mind is 'we have to know where our money is.' We have people in our distribution system who are not giving us reports, and we have money in our transactions that does not seem to be visible to us,""  said Stephen Clayton, an attorney who was head of anti-corruption compliance at server maker Sun Microsystems before it was bought by Oracle Corp in 2010. ""The most critical part of the FCPA is not bribery, it is that you are required by U.S. law as a public company to have accurate books and records and to have an adequate system of corporate controls,"" Clayton added.In a guide to the FCPA published in November 2012, the SEC and the DOJ said that ""unreasonably large discounts to third-party distributors"" is a common red flag that might indicate there could be a violation of the law.""If people are unwilling to turn over documents or the ones they turn over on their face have been falsified, it raises numerous questions,"" said Peter Bible, the chief risk officer at U.S. accounting firm EisnerAmper, and a former chief accountant at General Motors. Bible, who spent time in Russia when GM was setting up a joint venture about 10 years ago, said that documentation problems were common there.The summary contains a series of actions that it said were agreed to by Cisco's Russia leadership team, including issuing warnings to some staff involved in the Svyazinvest business, terminating ""Cisco partner status"" for at least one reseller, and tightening controls.Bible said this seemed to signal that Cisco was at the time taking the correct steps to sort out the problem. Based on the summary, ""they didn't just sweep it under the rug,"" he said.It is unclear whether Cisco followed through on all the actions outlined in the document. Cisco declined to comment.BIGGER DISCOUNTS The size of the discount offered to the resellers does not seem to have been extraordinary for Russia.

70,"  BEIJING Chinese state media lashed out at Google Inc GOOGL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and other U.S. technology companies on Wednesday, calling on Beijing ""to punish severely the pawns"" of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets.U.S. companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Facebook Inc FB.O threaten the cyber-security of China and its Internet users, said the People's Daily on its microblog, in comments echoed on the front page of the English-language China Daily.It is not clear what sparked this latest round of vitriol, nor what information the U.S. firms are alleged to have stolen. But Chinese media have repeatedly attacked American tech companies for aiding the U.S. government's cyber espionage since U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying programs including PRISM.Under PRISM, the NSA seized data from companies such as Google and Apple, according to revelations made by Snowden a year ago.Chinese state-owned firms have since begun dispensing with the services of U.S. companies such as IBM Corp IBM.N, Oracle Corp ORCL.N and Cisco in favor of domestic technology. As a result, Snowden's revelations may cost U.S. companies billions of dollars, analysts say.""U.S. companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. are all coordinating with the PRISM program to monitor China,"" the People's Daily said on its official microblog.""To resist the naked Internet hegemony, we will draw up international regulations, and strengthen technology safeguards, but we will also severely punish the pawns of the villain. The priority is strengthening penalties and punishments, and for anyone who steals our information, even though they are far away, we shall punish them!"" it said.Google has already had problems in China this week. On Monday, a China censorship watchdog said Google services were being disrupted ahead of Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square. (Full Story) ""We cannot say this more clearly - the (U.S.) government does not have access to Google servers - not directly, or via a back door, or a so-called drop box,"" said Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond in an emailed statement on Wednesday. ""We provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.""Microsoft declined to provide immediate comment. Facebook, Yahoo and Cisco were not immediately available when Reuters sought comment. All of them have previously denied participating in sweeping surveillance efforts.Apple on Wednesday referred to its previous statements on the matter.""Much of what has been said isn't true. There is no back door. The government doesn't have access to our servers. They would have to cart us out in a box for that,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an April interview with ABC Television. ROCKY TIME Facebook is currently blocked by Chinese censors but said last month it may open a sales office in China to provide more support to local advertisers who use the website to reach customers overseas. (Full Story)In December, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo and other Internet companies issued an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress to reform and introduce restrictions on surveillance activities. (Full Story) Even so, U.S. tech companies have had a rocky time in China since the NSA revelations. Just last month, central government offices were banned from installing Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system, on new computers. (Full Story)But the U.S. has responded with its own measures. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice charged five Chinese military officers with hacking U.S. companies to steal trade secrets.The indictment sparked outrage in China and added urgency to Beijing's efforts to promote the development of local information technology (IT) companies.Chinese media called the United States ""a high-level hooligan"" and officials accused Washington of applying ""double standards"" on issues of cyber spying.After the charges were announced, China said it will investigate providers of important IT products and services to protect ""national security"" and ""economic and social development.""

72,"   By Michael Martina | BEIJING, June 25  BEIJING, June 25 Cyber theft of trade secrets by China is a threat to U.S. national security, U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus said on Wednesday in the first major public address of his tenure, warning that Washington would continue to pressure Beijing.Baucus' remarks come as commercial ties between the world's two largest economies have been strained over cyber espionage charges and revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of U.S. spying.In May, Washington indicted five Chinese military officers for hacking U.S. companies, prompting Beijing to suspend a Sino-U.S. working group on cyber issues. It adamantly denies the charges.Such behaviour is criminal and runs counter to China's World Trade Organization commitments, Baucus told business leaders at an American Chamber of Commerce in China luncheon two weeks ahead of annual high-level bilateral talks in Beijing.""Cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets by state actors in China has emerged as a major threat to our economic, and thus, national security,"" Baucus said.""We won't sit idly by when a crime is committed in the real world. So why should we when it happens in cyber space?"" he said. ""We will continue to use diplomatic and legal means to make clear that this type of behaviour must stop."" Tensions over cyber security rose in late 2012 after Washington banned Chinese communications equipment makers Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp from building U.S. telecoms infrastructure.Beijing responded by pressuring big state-owned firms to stop buying U.S.-made hardware, emphasising security risks following Snowden's revelations, people in the industry said.U.S. equipment and software providers such as IBM Corp  and Cisco Systems Inc have already seen their China sales drop after the Snowden leaks. INVESTMENT TREATY A PRIORITY Like a string of ambassadors before him, Baucus, a former Montana senator who arrived in Beijing in March, has made it his immediate priority to boost the two countries' commercial and economic links. He has stressed that stronger economic ties will help resolve a host of thorny political and security challenges.Baucus said a bilateral investment treaty would help China rebalance its economy by opening up its service industries to more foreign investment and that moving forward negotiations would be among his top priorities as ambassador. ""I believe that the U.S.-China bilateral investment treaty ... today could do for China's investment regime what the WTO accession did 15 years ago,"" Baucus said.The investment treaty talks, which were launched in 2008, will likely be at the centre of the Strategic & Economic Dialogue that will bring U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to Beijing in July.Disputes over cyber security topped the agenda at last year's meeting, initiated in 2008 to help manage a relationship that is growing more complex with China's emergence as major economic and military power. However, the annual talks have yielded few substantive agreements.Lew has said he will push China to speed up economic reforms and do more to allow markets to determine the value of its yuan currency.Washington's aim for the investment treaty is to loosen Beijing's restrictions in key sectors from service industries to agriculture, and ensure that foreign companies receive treatment equal to Chinese private and state-owned enterprises.China heavily restricts dozens of industries and U.S. firms have long complained they are forced to meet unfair burdens such as ownership caps and are pressured to transfer technology in exchange for market access.

Hybrid services can be used to combine private infrastructure such as on-premises data centres with public cloud services. U.S. equipment and software providers such as IBM Corp  and Cisco Systems Inc have seen their China sales drop after last year's revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of U.S. spying.""To us, we think about Snowden, we think about these allegations going back and forth, and it's disappointing,"" VMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in an interview on Tuesday following announcements of partnerships with China Telecom and Japan's SoftBank Corp. He said, however, that allowing China Telecom to sell products under its own brand made it easier to do business in China. ""In the face of that bigger negative aura, we do a huge partnership with China Telecom.

Symantec said in a statement that the list referred to in Chinese media reports only affected some types of products.""It is important to note that this list is only for certain types of procurement and Symantec products are not banned by the Chinese government,"" the statement said.  ""We are investigating this report and will continue to bid for and win government projects in China.""Shares of Symantec closed up 1.7 percent at $23.56 on the Nasdaq on Monday.

China remains a headache situation for Symantec as well as other U.S. tech providers across the board."" Ives said. Symantec said last month it was in talks with Chinese authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software.Sunday's report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology amid concerns about U.S. spying and the indictment of five Chinese military officers on cyber espionage charges.Still, Eric Johnson, dean of the business school at Vanderbilt University and an expert on cyber security issues, said the Chinese government's move is only a ""symbolic one"" and will have ""little meaningful impact"" on Symantec.Chinese technology corporations like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp have grown into sophisticated global conglomerates in past years, and some analysts speculate that Beijing is promoting its local industry standard-bearers on its own home turf at the expense of U.S. corporations.Chinese state media have lashed out at Google Inc, Apple Inc and other U.S. technology companies, calling on Beijing ""to punish severely the pawns"" of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets.U.S. tech companies such as Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc have recently faced anti-trust investigations, while IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  have reported declining sales in China.

78,"   By Marina Lopes and Soham Chatterjee  Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said on Thursday its plan to slash 6,000 jobs will result in restructuring charges of $700 million in cash in the year ending July 2015.  The latest round of layoffs, announced on Wednesday, is at least the fourth workforce reduction in about as many years for a company once synonymous with the Internet boom and could spark a shakeup in management, analysts said. Shares in Cisco, still the world's largest networking equipment maker, were down 2.7 percent at $24.52 on the Nasdaq.Cisco has failed to sustain growth in its high-end switches and routers business and is grappling with competition from so-called software-defined networks (SDN) which offer software that can run on cheap hardware. The company will recognize $250 million to $350 million of the charges in the first quarter, it said in a regulatory filing.John Chambers, Cisco's veteran chief executive, blamed the cuts on global uncertainty and said he will use the savings to reinvest in profitable sectors like cloud computing and security. While the company has cut over 17,000 in the past four years, acquisitions have helped its headcount grow to around 74,000 from 71,000 in 2011, according to Cisco's regulatory  filings. ""He is right-sizing Cisco and trying to get some strategic changes put in place. In the interim he has got to maintain his margins,"" said Ken Dulaney, analyst at Gartner. The cuts could put pressure on 64-year-old Chambers to retire. The CEO has led the company for nearly 20 years and in 2012 said he would look to retire in two to four years. But Chambers is unlikely to leave before he is ready. According to Dulaney, Cisco's board is loyal to Chambers, who joined the company as senior vice president in 1991 and helped it grow into a $128 billion operation, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world.Still the announcement, which made Cisco the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on Thursday, could cause a shake up at the company. ""A lot of his software investments have not panned out. He has got to get back to his core business and do greater things. That will happen if he gets new management under him,"" said Dulaney.  Cisco is also battling sluggish sales and increased competition in emerging markets.

The company will recognize $250 million to $350 million of the charges in the first quarter, it said in a regulatory filing.John Chambers, Cisco's veteran chief executive, blamed the cuts on global uncertainty and said he will use the savings to reinvest in profitable sectors like cloud computing and security.While the company has cut over 17,000 in the past four years, acquisitions have helped its headcount grow to around 74,000 from 71,000 in 2011, according to Cisco's regulatory  filings. ""He is right-sizing Cisco and trying to get some strategic changes put in place. In the interim he has got to maintain his margins,"" said Ken Dulaney, analyst at Gartner.The cuts could put pressure on 64-year-old Chambers to retire. The CEO has led the company for nearly 20 years and in 2012 said he would look to retire in two to four years.But Chambers is unlikely to leave before he is ready. According to Dulaney, Cisco's board is loyal to Chambers, who joined the company as senior vice president in 1991 and helped it grow into a $128 billion operation, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. Still the announcement, which made Cisco the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on Thursday, could cause a shake up at the company.""A lot of his software investments have not panned out. He has got to get back to his core business and do greater things. That will happen if he gets new management under him,"" said Dulaney.Cisco is also battling sluggish sales and increased competition in emerging markets. The company's rivals include Juniper Networks Inc and China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.Cisco said on Wednesday that sales fell 23 percent in China and 13 percent in Brazil in the fourth quarter ended July 26.The company also reported flat profit for the fourth quarter and forecast tepid first-quarter profit and revenue.

86,"   By Alina Selyukh | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Regulating internet providers more like public utility companies could hurt the Internet and the U.S. economy, more than two dozen network technology and equipment makers have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.Thirty-three companies including Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp joined the chorus of citizens, activists, lawmakers and companies debating how the U.S. government should regulate Internet service providers (ISPs).Other companies signing a letter to Pritzker published on Tuesday included Alcatel Lucent SA, Ericsson, Nokia Oyj's network arm NSN, Panasonic Corp of North America and CommScope Holding Co Inc.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering so-called ""net neutrality"" rules that would determine how ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc manage web traffic on their networks.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed rules that would allow ISPs to charge content companies to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly, as long as such deals are deemed ""commercially reasonable."" Critics, including popular video streaming service Netflix Corp and numerous advocacy groups, argue the plan would threaten less deep-pocketed content providers by potentially relegating them to ""slow lanes"" on the web. MORE POWER  Instead, they call on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service rather than the less-regulated information service it is now, saying the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality. ISPs and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, have rejected the idea. On Tuesday, 33 telecom network and tech makers, who are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and who depend on ISPs for business, spoke out against the reclassification idea as well.""A sudden shift from the existing light-touch approach – which has been an unqualified success and the basis for billions of dollars in investments – to the prescriptive regime of Title II would be extremely disruptive to the broadband marketplace,"" they wrote, referring to the legal authority the FCC would use to reclassify ISPs. Experts have disagreed on whether or how reclassification would adequately prevent pay-for-priority deals. Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option.FCC is collecting public comment on the tentatively proposed rules until Sept. 15 and will hold several public workshops on various aspects of the regulations in the following weeks.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy will hold a hearing on the issue of net neutrality on Sept. 17.

87,"   By Paul Carsten | TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12  TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12 The sheer size of the Chinese market is so alluring to Western companies that even pro-internet freedom firms like CloudFlare may have to put moral outrage to the side in their pursuit of new business.San Francisco-based CloudFlare has a policy of providing cyber-defence services for all, based on a belief that the internet should be free, decentralised and open.Its clients have included groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorist organisations. Those values may now have to be shelved when it comes to entering China, where state control of the internet is among the world's tightest.CloudFlare is looking for a Chinese partner and aims to be in the country by 2015, said co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern city of Tianjin this week. ""As we think about international expansion it's vital that we get China,"" said Zatlyn of CloudFlare's second-largest market by user traffic. ""There are rules and regulation which operate within the country. As a U.S. company we absolutely have to follow those, and we're okay with that.""The operating environment in China may be even tougher now. U.S. businesses have complained about Chinese protectionism, and American tech firms have repeatedly come under fire from the state since last year's U.S. National Security Agency cyber espionage revelations. Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc are being investigated for anti-trust violations, while IBM Corp, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen sales in China plummet in recent quarters.CloudFlare is joining a long list of companies, from firms that have seen little or no success in China like Yahoo Inc , eBay Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to recent entrants like LinkedIn Corp, for whom China's pull as the world's largest internet market by population has been too strong to resist. CloudFlare is hoping to learn from the lessons of the U.S. tech sector's fallen soldiers in China. One of these came at the World Economic Forum, where Lu Wei, the director of China's State Internet Information Office, said Facebook will be unable to access China any time soon, according to state media.""You have to play a slightly long game if you're a Western multi-national company in China,"" said Mark Spelman, a managing director at Accenture PLC.""It's very important to think about which Chinese partners you should be working with, and organisations need to think very  carefully about what business model you need in China - it might not be the same as in other countries,"" he cautioned.

92,"  (Adds comment from NSS, analysts. Palo Alto declined comment)By Jim FinkleBOSTON, Sept 26 Palo Alto Networks Inc's  flagship next-generation security firewall ranks as the least effective in a new test of such equipment by NSS Labs, results that surprised some analysts because the product is widely considered an industry leader.NSS, which reviews technology products for Fortune 500 companies, gave Palo Alto's firewall a ""caution"" rating in a survey released to clients Tuesday. It had rated the product ""recommended"" in its last survey, released in February 2013.NSS recommended rival firewalls from Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, Cisco Systems Inc, Dell Inc , Fortinet Inc, Intel Corp's McAfee division and WatchGuard.A Palo Alto Networks representative declined comment.NSS Chief Executive Officer Vikram Phatak said that Palo Alto had issued two major revisions to its firewall operating system since the last test. ""They broke something in the process,"" he said.NSS marked down Palo Alto heavily for failing key tests that determine how easily hackers could evade a firewall's security, Phatak said.""They have a fundamental problem in how they are handling TCP/IP traffic, which is the foundation of the Internet,"" he said.Greg Young, an analyst with Gartner which closely follows the next-generation firewall market, said he was surprised by the results. ""Generally NSS stuff has been pretty good, but I need more information to help me understand this one,"" he said. ""I have a lot of questions about the placement. They are really sort of divergent from where we placed the products.""The findings come in the wake of a controversial report released by NSS in April that said FireEye Inc's breach detection system did not work as well as products from rivals including Cisco and Trend Micro.FireEye disputed those claims but shares in the company that went public in one of last year's hottest IPO dropped significantly in the weeks after the report's publication. Securosis analyst Mike Rothman, who advises businesses in selecting firewalls, said that buyers often review NSS surveys when picking products.Yet he said laboratory tests may not be as relevant as they used to be because security has become extremely complex, making it difficult for a test like the one released this week by NSS to be a good indicator of how a product will work for any particular company.""As security has gotten a lot more complicated, it is not as easy to set up a generic test bed and have the results replicated in the real world,"" he said.Rothman said that businesses need to come up with a ""short list"" of several products that look like they will meet their needs, and then ask the manufacturers to lend them the equipment for a trial.""You've got to test them out in your environment,"" he said.NSS also gave ""neutral"" ratings to firewall models from Barracuda Networks Inc, Cisco and Sophos Cyberoam.

93,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Cisco Systems will invest $1 billion over two years to expand its cloud offerings, the company said on Monday, linking hundreds of data centers and cloud providers around the world in a network with more than 30 partners.The network, called Intercloud, will help businesses process and manage data generated from billions of devices and applications around the world, Cisco said.Businesses in the network aim to bridge the gap between public and private cloud computing and will share cloud infrastructure the same way mobile telecommunications companies have roaming agreements.With partners including Deutsche Telekom, BT group and Equinix Inc, Cisco said it will add 250 data centers in 50 countries to its cloud network. Intercloud will also allow companies to direct data traffic through specific clouds and data centers. This will help international businesses deal with foreign regulations requiring companies to house data collected from its citizens in local data centers.

94,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON, Sept 29  WASHINGTON, Sept 29 Cisco Systems will invest $1 billion over two years to expand its cloud offerings, the company said on Monday, linking hundreds of data centers and cloud providers around the world in a network with more than 30 partners.The network, called Intercloud, will help businesses process and manage data generated from billions of devices and applications around the world, Cisco said.Businesses in the network aim to bridge the gap between public and private cloud computing and will share cloud infrastructure the same way mobile telecommunications companies have roaming agreements. With partners including Deutsche Telekom, BT  group and Equinix Inc, Cisco said it will add 250 data centers in 50 countries to its cloud network.Intercloud will also allow companies to direct data traffic through specific clouds and data centers. This will help international businesses deal with foreign regulations requiring companies to house data collected from its citizens in local data centers. The company also hopes the offering will address security and reliability concerns that have prevented businesses from accessing the cloud through public Internet connections.

113,"  WASHINGTON Dec 5 Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc filed two lawsuits on Friday against smaller rival Arista Networks Inc, accusing it of copying Cisco's networking technologies.In the lawsuits, filed in a California district court, Cisco accused Arista of infringing on 14 patents related to networks and also infringing on related copyrights, Cisco General Counsel Mark Chandler said in a blog post.Cisco alleged in one of the lawsuits that Arista was formed by former Cisco employees, including Arista founder and Chief Development Officer Andreas Bechtolsheim, Arista founder and Chief Technology Officer Kenneth Duda and Arista President and Chief Executive Officer Jayshree Ullal. ""Rather than building its products and services based on new technologies developed by Arista, however, and providing legitimate competition to Cisco, Arista took a shortcut by blatantly and extensively copying the innovative networking technologies designed and developed by Cisco,"" Cisco said in one of the complaints. Cisco is a giant in the networking world, with revenues of $12.2 billion in the third quarter. Arista, in contrast, is growing fast but had revenues of just $155.5 million in the third quarter of 2014. Attempts to reach Arista for comment were not immediately successful.

But the Commission - the EU executive - and some countries, such as Germany and France, are pushing to include cloud providers, social networks, search engines and e-commerce platforms because of their widespread use by people and businesses.Internet companies are firmly opposed to such a move, which would incur extra compliance costs.

116,"  * Raises $18 mln in initial funding round* Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco join as strategic partners* Firm led by veterans of Israeli military intelligence unit* Aims to build up to build up to 6 cyber security companiesBy Steven ScheerTEL AVIV, Feb 10 Team8, an Israeli venture capital fund focused on the cyber-security industry, said on Tuesday it had raised $18 million in its first round of funding, including investment from Alcatel-Lucent and Cisco . Also participating in the round were Bessemer Venture Partners, Marker LLC and Innovation Endeavors, which was founded by Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt.Led by veterans of the Israeli army's 8200 intelligence and electronic espionage unit, Team8 aims to develop cyber-security companies that offer more in-depth protection than the usual defence against hacking attempts by generic malware.Bessemer partner David Cowan said that could set them apart from the legions of security start-ups in Silicon Valley. ""When you are being targeted by human-driven campaigns you need a much deeper skill set in cyber operations that you won't find in Silicon Valley and is nearly impossible to find outside of criminal organisations and governments,"" he told Reuters.Team8's approach is ""not going to be quick or cheap"" since there is no silver bullet to solve the problem, he said.Team8 co-founder Nadav Zafrir, who spent 25 years at 8200 and 10 years running the unit, said he aims to build four to six companies in the next few years -- each focusing on a specific domain such as cloud computing, industrial firms and enterprises. He described 2014 as a turning point for cyber security in the wake of attacks on retailer Target -- in which up to 70 million customers had their personal information compromised - and Sony, and that a new approach was critical.To that end, Israel's government has made cyber security a priority, in the hope of building on the country's military-grade technology and innovation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allocated 2 billion shekels ($515 million) in 2012 to set up a cyber security agency within his office and there are a range of venture funds based in southern Israel, where the army is moving its headquarters.Zafrir told Reuters the firms to be created would have to stay one step ahead of hackers, whom he divided into three segments: hard-core cyber criminals whose motivation was to make money through stolen credit cards and other financial information, state-sponsored attackers, and ideologists who hack for a cause.""If we don't find cost-effective and efficient next generation solutions that will keep enterprises and industrial plants safe, there is a true challenge to prosperity to the global economy,"" he said.

129,"   By Anya George Tharakan and Arathy S Nair  Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as demand for switching equipment and routers helped make up for weak spending by the company's traditional telecom customers.Cisco, which saw its shares rise 5.6 percent in extended trading on Wednesday, has been trying to make a transition toward a new cycle of high-end switches and routers.""""We executed very well in a tough environment, and I'd say our strategy is playing out like we expected,"" Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer told Reuters.The switching business, which makes products that handle traffic at large internet data centers, brought in about 39 percent of Cisco's total hardware revenue in 2014, while the router business accounted for about 21.2 percent.""They are seeing very robust switching sales,"" Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson told Reuters, adding that this was good news for others in the sector such as Infoblox Inc BLOX.N, Gigamon Inc (GIMO.N) and F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O).Revenue from Cisco's hardware business rose 7.8 percent to $9.08 billion in the company's second quarter ended Jan. 24. Revenue from services, which includes the company's software and cloud offerings, rose 4.6 percent to $2.86 billion. Subscriptions generate more predictable recurring revenue than hardware sales. The services business is also less likely to suffer from sudden shifts in demand.""They may have the worst in the rear view right now,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Thompson.The quarter showed the best balance of growth across all of the company's geographies, products and segments, Chief Executive John Chambers said in a statement. Cisco, which raised its quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 21 cents, said its net profit rose to $2.4 billion, or 46 cents per share, in the quarter from $1.43 billion, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue rose 7 percent to $11.94 billion.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 53 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 51 cents per share on revenue of $11.8 billion. Cisco forecast an adjusted profit of 51-53 cents per share for the current quarter, in line with analysts' estimates.Kramer added that while Cisco has made progress in the second quarter, the company will continue to be affected by headwinds from emerging markets and telecom service providers. The company also forecast revenue growth of 3-5 percent.Cisco's shares closed at $26.93 on the Nasdaq.

""I think it will add a layer of high-growth revenue to the mix in a way it helps HP reach its goal of growing faster,"" Atlantic Equities analyst Josep Bori told Reuters.HP is way behind market leader Cisco Systems Inc in the networking business, and the Aruba acquisition would help it to gain a little more market share, he said.HP has a 4-5 percent share of the enterprise WLAN market, compared with Aruba's 10-13 percent, FBN Capital Markets analyst Shebly Seyrafi estimated in a note dated Feb. 27. The WLAN market is estimated to grow 40 percent to about $13 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Dell'Oro Group. (bit.ly/1F1eToD)HP, which has struggled to adapt to mobile and online computing, plans to separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations this year.Aruba sells Wi-Fi gear to a wide range of clients including California State University and Dalian Wanda Group, which controls China's biggest property developer and largest cinema chain. The purchase will also help HP better compete for E-Rate - the largest U.S. educational technology subsidy program - which helps connect schools and public libraries to high-speed Internet, JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger said.In December, the Federal Communications Commission voted to raise funding for the E-Rate program by $1.5 billion to $3.9 billion.The all-cash offer of $24.67 per share is a premium of 34.4 percent to Aruba's close on Feb. 24, the day before Bloomberg reported about a possible deal.Aruba shares fell 1.6 percent to $24.41 in afternoon trading on Monday. The stock had risen about 40 percent since the Bloomberg report.

The 65-year-old Chambers, one of the longest-serving leaders of a Silicon Valley company and also company chairman, will become executive chairman, the company said on Monday.Wall Street analysts said a change was expected and could signal a refocusing of Cisco, which acquired dozens of companies under Chambers but has failed to make great headway outside its core networking business.

148,"  * Third-quarter revenue $12.1 bln vs estimates of $12.07 bln* Adjusted profit/share $0.54 vs estimates of $0.53   (Adds CFO comment)By Anya George Tharakan and Arathy S NairMay 13 Cisco Systems Inc's quarterly profit edged past market estimates as demand for new switches, routers, wireless gear and servers made up for sluggish spending by telecom customers and weak sales in emerging markets.The network equipment maker is making a transition towards high-end switches and routers and investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-management tools.Last month, market research firm Gartner forecast a decline in telecom services spending this year. (gtnr.it/1PmWbP0)""In terms of the whole service provider carrier spending, we are not assuming that it's going to improve in the near future,"" Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer told Reuters. In his last post-earnings conference call, outgoing Chief Executive John Chambers also dispelled rumors that Cisco had bid $9 billion for FireEye Inc, sending the cybersecurity company's shares down 3.4 percent in extended trading.Company veteran Chuck Robbins will take over as CEO when Chambers steps down in July after 20 years at the helm.""I will be his wingman,"" Chambers said.Several analysts have interpreted the transition as a signal of changing priorities of the company, which is struggling to boost bottom line in the era of cloud computing. Cisco said it expects an adjusted profit of 55-57 cents per share for the current quarter.Analysts on average were expecting 56 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company also forecast revenue growth of 1-3 percent. ""We are modeling the volatility in emerging markets to continue for several more quarters,"" Chambers said.Revenue from Russia fell 41 percent in the in the third quarter ended April 25, the company said.

150,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled against Cisco Systems Inc(CSCO.O) over a patent infringement claim the tech giant is fighting.On a 6-2 vote, with Justice Stephen Breyer recused from the case, the court threw out a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in favor of Cisco. There is now likely to be a new trial.The case concerns a patent held by Commil USA LLC on a way to improve the implementation of a wireless network where multiple access points are needed. Commil sued Cisco for patent infringement and induced patent infringement based on the network equipment maker's use of similar technology.In April 2011, a jury awarded Commil almost $63.8 million in damages. A judge subsequently added $10.3 million in interest.In June 2013, the appeals court ordered a retrial, concluding in part that Cisco should be allowed to mount the ""good faith"" defense.The high court ruled in an opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy that Cisco's belief that the patent was invalid was not a legitimate defense. Washington-based intellectual property lawyer William Jackson said the ruling means ""the patent owner must merely prove that the other party knew of the patent and intended to induce infringement - not that the party had any particular belief about validity.""The ruling ""restores common sense to patent litigation,"" said Commil's attorney, Mark Werbner.Seth Waxman, one of Cisco's lawyers, said the ruling ""simply eliminates one of many defenses available to Cisco, which looks forward to retrial of the case.""In a brief filed at the invitation of the high court, the U.S. government had warned that companies accused of inducing patent infringement were likely to raise the ""good faith"" defense in most cases, if not all of them. The court appeared to buy that argument, with Kennedy writing that if Cisco prevailed on its theory, there would be ""negative consequences"" in other cases.""It can render litigation more burdensome for everyone involved,"" Kennedy said of the good faith defense.The case was closely watched by Silicon Valley and biotechnology firms. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts.Scalia said the ruling would benefit so-called patent trolls, companies that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products.The case is Commil v. Cisco, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-896.

Scalia said the court's 6-2 decision to throw out a U.S. appeals court ruling in favor of Cisco that held that a mere belief that a patent was invalid could be a defense to induced infringement ""increases the in terrorem power of patent trolls.""

154,"  MILAN Italian telecoms equipment and software supplier Italtel has hired investment bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) to seek buyers, in particular among private equity funds, and expects to reach a deal this summer, its chief executive told Reuters on Friday.Italtel, which is owned by Cisco (CSCO.O), a group of banks and Italian phone group Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI), has gone through a tough restructuring process and expects to finally return to profit this year with revenues rising 15 percent to reach 530 million euros in 2017.   The company is a small player in a market dominated by giants such as Ericsson (ERICb.ST), Nokia NOK1V.HE, Alcatel ALUA.PA and Huawei (002502.SZ). It has an enterprise value of around 300 million euros, including net debt of around 180 million euros, Chief Executive Stefano Pileri said.""The sale process has started and we are happy about this. We will talk to a lot of private equity investors,"" he said. ""We aim for a binding agreement by the end of August.""  The main plan is to sell a controlling stake, he said. Cisco could remain as a shareholder in the company or even increase its stake from 33 percent at present, he added. Pileri said a cash injection of only a few ""tens of millions of euros"" could help the company do much better.  He said he hoped that Italy's state-backed Strategic Fund would consider an investment in the company sooner or later while he did not see Indian commercial and industrial partner Tech Mahindra (TEML.NS) as a potential buyer for now.

156,"   By Dominique Patton | BEIJING  BEIJING Cisco (CSCO.O) plans to invest more than $10 billion in China along with local business partners over the next several years, the U.S. network equipment maker said on Wednesday, as it seeks to shore up its position against strong domestic rivals.Cisco, the world's biggest maker of switching equipment and routers that run the Internet, announced the investment plans following high-level meetings between top executives and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang and other government agency leaders.A statement issued by the Silicon Valley company provided the broad outlines of how it planned to invest but did not detail any specific spending or timelines for doing so.It said in a statement it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, to expand investment.This will be used to fund innovation, equity investment, research and development and job creation, Cisco said. It also signed an MoU with the Association of Universities (Colleges) of Applied Science (AUAS) to advance technical training of information and communications engineers. The company said it will invest in a four-year network engineer training program with 100 universities and colleges of applied science recommended by AUAS.Cisco is looking to capitalize on initiatives promoted by the Chinese government including ""China Manufacturing 2025"",  ""Internet+"" and its strategy to deliver more services as cloud-based Internet services. The move comes as pressure has grown on foreign technology firms in the world's biggest Internet market as Beijing has moved to promote domestic technology suppliers it says are needed to protect state secrets and data.Earlier this year, a Reuters analysis found Cisco was among U.S. technology firms which had been dropped from state procurement lists in recent years. Cisco and arch-rival Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] of China have been battling each other for a decade. Political controversies over ties to their respective governments have raised questions about their futures on each other's lucrative home turf.In 2013, John Chambers, Cisco's long-serving chairman and chief executive, acknowledged that security controversies had stymied the company's moves to expand in China. Chambers took part in the recent meetings with Chinese government officials along with CEO-Designate Chuck Robbins, who is scheduled to take over as chief executive in July.

160,"   By David Morgan | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON General Motors Co plans to begin testing new Cisco Systems Inc technology that could allow ""talking"" cars to share radio communication bands with roadside Wi-Fi devices, a GM executive told U.S. lawmakers.The technology could hold out the promise of allowing Wi-Fi devices to share the same radio band as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety systems without causing interference, he said in written testimony posted to a House oversight committee website on Wednesday.The automaker intends to deploy V2V technology in its 2017 Cadillac CTS sedans.""We are very optimistic about a sharing proposal from Cisco that would operate on a 'listen, detect and vacate' basis,"" said Harry Lightsey, executive director of GM's Global Connected Customer Experience unit. ""We have engaged with Cisco and plan to begin testing their technology as soon as possible."" GM submitted the testimony to the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade ahead of a Thursday hearing on V2V technology.V2V technology would allow cars to talk to each other and avoid collisions, using the 5.9 GHz radio spectrum to share information about their relative positions, speeds, headings and braking status and warning drivers of possible risks. Safety regulators believe the technology could provide warnings in 80 percent of car accidents involving more than one vehicle.    But e-commerce companies have pressed for a share of the same spectrum for roadside Wi-Fi services, a prospect that some in the auto industry say could interfere with V2V systems and prevent them from operating properly.  Barry Einsig, Cisco's global transportation executive, who is also scheduled to testify before the panel, said in his written testimony that the company's ""The Internet of Everything"" envisions a communications network connecting cars and other vehicles with each other and roadside entities including police and other emergency responders. ""Once vehicle-to-vehicle communications are widely installed in cars and light trucks as a safety measure, the private sector and our public sector partners, will respond swiftly to bring the full set of ... benefits to American consumers,"" he said in the testimony.U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in May that auto regulators would propose a rule by year-end requiring V2V-technology in vehicles.

Cisco was a minority investor and was one of the backers that invested $35 million in OpenDNS in May last year.

169,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO BlackBerry Ltd named Carl Wiese as head of global sales on Monday, an appointment that comes at a critical juncture for the smartphone industry pioneer, which needs to spur top-line growth in order for its turnaround efforts to succeed.Wiese has spent the past 12 years at Cisco Systems, first heading advanced technology sales and later its collaboration-product sales efforts. Those teams focus on aspects such as security and web conferencing, areas that BlackBerry is trying to expand within.  At BlackBerry, Wiese replaces John Sims, who had been with the company for 18 months.BlackBerry said Wiese, who has previously worked with Apple Inc, Avaya, Lucent and Texas Instruments, will be responsible for driving its go-to-market strategy and global sales efforts.""Carl has extensive experience in enterprise software and emerging technology solutions, which will be instrumental as BlackBerry moves toward stabilizing revenue,"" BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen said in a statement.  The move comes less than three weeks after BlackBerry posted weaker-than-expected sales growth from its software business in the first quarter.Chen, who set a software revenue target of $500 million for the current fiscal year, has built his turnaround plan around a software growth strategy, hoping sales from device-management software and fledgling areas like the Internet of Things can replace BlackBerry's traditional service fee structure and falling revenue from smartphone sales.Chen indicated last month that he remains comfortable with the $500 million revenue target, and noted that some of that growth is set to come from acquisitions.   Although quarterly software revenue more than doubled year-over-year, much of the growth came from two patent cross-licensing deals. This spooked many investors, who disappointed by the weaker-than-expected core software growth, sent shares in BlackBerry tumbling to a 13-month low on the Nasdaq last week.Ontario-based BlackBerry also backed away from a separate $100 million target for revenue from its BlackBerry Messenger service.Some analysts have long been skeptical about the viability of BlackBerry's software revenue targets.  When Chen went over the company's sales targets at an analysts' event in San Francisco last November and received pushback from some analysts, he laughed and said if targets are not met, he would still be around next year, but some of his team might not.BlackBerry declined to comment on whether Sims' departure was tied to weaker-than-expected software revenue growth. BlackBerry is also widely expected to debut a new Android-based smartphone this year in an attempt to boost its hardware sales.

Energy companies have reeled in recent weeks on concerns about China, a top consumer of energy and commodities.Apple, for which China is a key market, also reversed course after falling more than 3 percent earlier to its lowest since January. It ended up 1.5 percent at $115.24 and was the biggest positive factor for all three major indexes.

""The reversal today is bullish ... at least in the short term.""Among sectors, financial shares declined the most, with the S&P financial index down 0.8 percent. China's currency move has created more uncertainty over how soon the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, analysts said.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.33 points to 17,402.51, the S&P 500 gained 1.98 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,086.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.60 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,044.39. The CBOE Volatility index, a measure of the premium traders are willing to pay for protection against a drop in the S&P 500, also reversed course. It jumped as much as 18.7 percent to 16.28, its highest in a month, before ending down 0.7 percent.Alibaba was down 5.1 percent at $73.38 after hitting an all-time low of $71.03 after revenue growth slowed at China's biggest e-commerce company. Yahoo , which has a 15 percent stake in Alibaba, fell 4.3 percent to $34.49.Macy's fell 5.1 percent to $64.11 after it also reported weak quarterly sales.After the bell, shares of Cisco Systems rose 3.7 percent.

203,"  (Adds comments by FireEye CEO, possible involvement of a national agency; refiled to modify this advisory)By Eric AuchardFRANKFURT, Sept 15 Security researchers say they have uncovered clandestine attacks across three continents on the routers that direct traffic around the Internet, potentially allowing suspected cyberspies to harvest vast amounts of data while going undetected.In the attacks, a highly sophisticated form of malicious software, dubbed SYNful Knock, has been implanted in routers made by Cisco, the world's top supplier, U.S. security research firm FireEye said on Tuesday.Routers are attractive to hackers because they operate outside the perimeter of firewalls, anti-virus, behavioural detection software and other security tools that organisations  use to safeguard data traffic. Until now, they were considered vulnerable to sustained denial-of-service attacks using barrages of millions of packets of data, but not outright takeover.""If you own (seize control of) the router, you own the data of all the companies and government organisations that sit behind that router,"" FireEye Chief Executive Dave DeWalt told Reuters of his company's discovery.""This is the ultimate spying tool, the ultimate corporate espionage tool, the ultimate cybercrime tool,"" DeWalt said.The attacks have hit multiple industries and government agencies, he said. Cisco confirmed it had alerted customers to the attacks in August and said they were not due to any vulnerability in its own software. Instead, the attackers stole valid network administration credentials from targeted organisations or managed to gain for themselves physical access to the routers.""We've shared guidance on how customers can harden their network, and prevent, detect and remediate this type of attack,"" Cisco said in a statement.CYBERSPIES SEEN RESPONSIBLE  Altogether FireEye's computer forensic arm Mandiant has so far found 14 instances of the router implants in India, Mexico, Philippines and Ukraine, the company said in a blog post at bit.ly/1ObMm7u.  It added that this may be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of yet-to-be-discovered attacks.Because the attacks actually replace the basic software controlling the routers, infections persist when devices are shut off and restarted. If found to be infected, FireEye said basic software used to control those routers would have to be re-imaged, a time-consuming task for technicians.Hitherto, infections of commercial routers, while not unknown, have largely remained theoretical threats, DeWalt said, as distinct from routers consumers use at home, which according to media reports have been hit by malware in recent years. Experts reckon there are only a small number of nations with cyber intelligence services which are capable of such attacks on network equipment, including those of Britain, China, Israel, Russia and the United States.""That feat is only able to be obtained by a handful of nation-state actors,"" DeWalt said, while declining to name which countries he suspected might be behind the Cisco router attacks.The malicious programme has been nicknamed ""SYNful"" in reference to how the implanted software can jump from router to router using the device's syndication functions.Network logs from infected routers suggest the attacks have been taking place for at least a year, FireEye's CEO said.The implanted software, which duplicates normal router functions, could also potentially affect routers from other makers, DeWalt said.Infected hardware devices include Cisco routers 1841, 2811 and 3825, FireEye said. Cisco had discontinued selling the products but still supports customers using them.FireEye said it was only announcing its discovery after working with Cisco to quietly notify governments and affected parties. ""We thought it was best to release this so everyone can fix their routers as fast as possible,"" DeWalt said.

The provider, Limestone Networks, pulled the plug on the servers and turned over data that helped show how Angler worked.The research effort, aided by carrier Level 3 Communications, allowed Cisco to copy the authentication protocols the Angler criminals use to interact with their prey.

216,"  * Cybersecurity ""ISPY"" ETF up 3 pct since launch* Issue in spotlight after attack on TalkTalk* Certain stocks have outperformed after TalkTalk hackBy Sudip Kar-GuptaLONDON, Oct 30 The hacking scandal at broadband provider TalkTalk has heightened interest in stocks and companies dealing in cyber security, with some fund managers betting on more growth in the sector.British police said on Friday that they had arrested a second teenager in connection with the breach at TalkTalk, which may have led to the theft of personal data from among the company's more than 4 million customers.TalkTalk was not the first such incident, but traders and investors said it should re-ignite interest in companies offering protection against hack attacks. Market research firm Gartner has estimated that global spending on IT security is set to increase 8.2 percent in 2015 to $77 billion. Corporations around the world will spend $101 billion on information security in 2018, Gartner says.That has caught the attention of financial markets. The ISPY  exchange-traded-fund, which lets investors hold a basket of cyber security stocks - such as Cisco Systems  and Sophos Group - has risen around 3 percent .""As cyber crime continues to grow, governments and companies are prioritising cyber security as an essential investment. This is a sector we can expect to dominate headlines and corporate budgets,"" said Kris Monaco, the head of ISE ETF Ventures.Others focussed on some relatively small British stocks whose shares have risen, in contrast to those of TalkTalk whose stock has fallen 6 percent in the last week. Falanx Group has climbed 15 percent over that same period. NCC Group and Corero Network Security  - an offshoot of the former Corero software business - have risen 3 percent.Corero's products include software that protects against attacks on Internet sites and domain addresses.NCC has similar services, including one to test how vulnerable a company is to ""phishing"" - where internal emails are hacked by someone posing as an employee or outside contact - while Falanx has services monitoring clients' computer infrastructure for signs of suspicious activity. John Blamire, a former British Army officer who is chief executive at Falanx, said customer interest had risen since the attack on TalkTalk.""Incidents such as the one at TalkTalk actively brings attention to organisations such as ours,"" he said.To be sure, stocks such as these would carry the usual risks associated with ""small cap"" stocks with a relatively small market valuation - less liquidity, which can then make them more prone to a slump and harder to sell than bigger stocks.Nevertheless, they have attracted some big-name investment houses, with Liontrust Asset Management holding a near 10 percent stake in NCC while Blackrock Investment Management has a near 3 percent holding in Corero. Both Liontrust and Blackrock declined to comment on those holdings.Mark Slater, chief investment officer at Slater Investments, holds around 3 million NCC shares in his company's portfolio, and he expected NCC and others to continue to grow.""The nature of the Internet makes it open to attack. These problems are not going to go away.""

238,"   By Andrew Chung  Dec 3 - The more than $16 million that Cisco Systems Inc was ordered to pay to Australia's national science agency for infringing a wifi patent is too high because a Delaware judge's damages award did not account for the patent's adoption as an international standard, a U.S. appeals court said on Thursday. Cisco and its lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis were correct in arguing that the lower court judge wrongly calculated the damages figure by not excluding the value the patent accrued by being declared a standard essential patent, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit unanimously ruled on Thursday.

Juniper warned customers on Thursday that it had uncovered ""unauthorized code"" in its firewall software, saying it could be exploited to allow an attacker to unscramble encrypted communications that travel through the security devices.That prompted the code review by Cisco. Security experts said they expect other technology companies to conduct similar investigations after last week's unprecedented news from Juniper. It was the first time a major technology firm discovered the addition of an unauthorized 'back door,"" or code that could be exploited to facilitate cyber attacks, according to security experts. ""I can’t imagine there is a major vendor that isn’t doing a major code audit now,"" said HD Moore, chief research officer with Rapid7 Inc.  Technology companies regularly audit their code for bugs, including ""back doors"" that attackers could leverage to launch cyber attacks on customer networks. But Moore said that such reviews focus on ""back doors"" that are unintentionally created, not ones inserted without the manufacturer's knowledge. ""The challenge is that nobody has been looking for this in the past,"" said Moore, an expert in software vulnerabilities. ""If you know you are looking for a malicious backdoor, you have a much better chance of finding something."" Cryptologist Bruce Schneier said that technology companies should have long been looking for unauthorized code, but that many ignored the problem since the reviews boost expenses.""The fundamental problem is that the market doesn’t reward the things we want like secure code.

Cisco said on its blog that the testing will include code reviews by engineers with deep networking and cryptography experience as well as penetration testing, a process where technicians attempt to attack products to find bugs the way malicious hackers might seek to exploit them. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating how the Juniper ""back door"" might impact government networks.""As we routinely do when such vulnerabilities are brought to light, we are assessing the potential impact, if any, on federal networks, and will take any appropriate mitigation measures in close coordination with interagency partners,"" said agency spokesman S.Y.

250,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Cisco Systems Inc did not infringe a patent holding company's wifi technology, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday, reversing a near $64-million judgment against the networking equipment maker in the long-running patent dispute. After eight years of litigation that also included a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Cisco was not liable for directly infringing or inducing others to infringe a patent held by Commil USA LLC on a way to help spread wireless signals over a large area, where multiple access points are needed.Cisco General Counsel Mark Chandler said the company was gratified by the ruling. ""The patent never had anything to do with our products and the millions of dollars spent defending this unmeritorious suit are a travesty,"" he said in an emailed statement. Representatives for Commil could not be reached on Monday. Texas-based Commil USA sued Cisco in 2007, shortly after buying the patent from an Israeli company, Commil Ltd, according to court documents. Cisco has called it a non-practicing entity, referring to a company that primarily makes money by licensing patents instead of making products.In 2011, a federal jury in Texas found that Cisco induced infringement by encouraging its customers to use Cisco products that infringe Commil's patent. The jury awarded Commil almost $63.8 million in damages. A judge subsequently added $10.3 million in interest.In 2013, the Washington, D.C.-based Federal Circuit, the nation's top appeals court specializing in patent issues, ordered a new trial, saying that Cisco should have been able to mount a defense based on its ""good faith belief"" that Commil's patent was invalid.  The Supreme Court in May said that defense was not legitimate, throwing out the ruling and sending the case back to the Federal Circuit. A three-judge Federal Circuit panel on Monday again ruled in favor of San Jose, California-based Cisco.  The panel said that when it last considered the case, it did not consider some of Cisco's arguments that it did not infringe the patent. In weighing those arguments this time, the panel said that ""substantial evidence did not support the jury's findings.""  The case is Commil USA LLC v.

""The patent never had anything to do with our products and the millions of dollars spent defending this unmeritorious suit are a travesty,"" he said in an emailed statement.Representatives for Commil could not be reached on Monday. Texas-based Commil USA sued Cisco in 2007, shortly after buying the patent from an Israeli company, Commil Ltd, according to court documents. Cisco has called it a non-practicing entity, referring to a company that primarily makes money by licensing patents instead of making products.In 2011, a federal jury in Texas found that Cisco induced infringement by encouraging its customers to use Cisco products that infringe Commil's patent.

254,"   By Sven Nordenstam and Olof Swahnberg | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Swedish mobile gear maker Ericsson said it is ready to cut more costs if needed after lower expenses, patent fees and a sales recovery in China helped it meet forecasts for quarterly operating profit on Wednesday.Ericsson's focus on lifting profits by paring costs comes as demand in its biggest markets shifts to upgrades of existing capacity rather than building new, next-generation networks.Here the Swedish company faces tough competition from Finnish network equipment maker Nokia and Franco-American Alcatel-Lucent which are poised to drive higher sales growth and improve profit margins by merging early in 2016.Ericsson's strategy has been to steer clear of larger acquisitions, instead partnering with data network giant Cisco Systems Inc to jointly sell products.Analysts worry that the combined Nokia-Alcatel Lucent will prove a more attractive supplier to telecom operators as it will be stronger in fixed-line data communications. Ericsson, whose fourth quarter capped a second year of falling like-for-like sales, declining by 5 percent in 2015 after a 2 percent drop in 2014, managed to cut operating expenses by 12 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, mostly in research and development.It said it was on track to save 9 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) annually by 2017 and flagged there could be more cuts."" Our preparedness is much higher if we need to do more,"" Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg told a conference call, without providing specific targets. ZERO GROWTH  ""I think we will see some tough years ahead, and they should be happy with zero growth,"" said Inge Heydorn, a fund manager at Sentat Asset Management who has no position in Ericsson.With no growth in sight for its core business and no firm targets for more savings, Ericsson shares had fallen 5.5 percent by 1127 GMT (6:27 a.m. ET) after a strong performance in the past few days. Ericsson said sales of network equipment in China had picked up, while networks sales in its biggest market North America were stable. Finance chief Jan Frykhammar said North America would not come back to 2014 levels, a year of big investments in new networks, at least not in the short term. Operating profit was 11.0 billion crowns compared to 6.3 billion a year ago and above a mean forecast of 10.6 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.    Sales and profits were lifted by a one-off payment from Apple Inc after the companies settled litigation last month and signed a patent license agreement.

Commil USA LLC said last month's decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clearing Cisco of infringement should have been made years ago when the case was first up at the court, ""thereby mooting the Supreme Court appeal and avoiding the expenditure of vast time and resources of both parties and the Supreme Court.""

262,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Networking giant Cisco Systems Inc reported it is weathering a global slowdown in information-technology spending, but signs potential customers are putting some projects on hold exacerbated concerns about broader IT growth.Cisco shares rose 10 percent on Thursday, bucking the overall market after it set a profit target in line with Wall Street expectations despite the weaker spending it noted around the world by businesses. The company also cut targets three months ago, moderating Wall Street expectations.Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins on Wednesday told analysts that customers in January “paused a bit” as they evaluated the economy. Spending on key projects continued while more optional ones were put on hold.Analysts took that as a bad sign for some technology companies.“This was really a litmus test for all of IT spending,” said Sun Trust analyst Inder Singh about Cisco’s comments. “When they speak, and they talk about a slowdown, and a deceleration, usually it affects the broader market.” Cisco's guidance was ""prescient in terms of affecting other companies,"" he added.Cisco reported weakness in data centers and switching. Some analysts saw potential trouble for other data-center products such as networking, servers, storage, and virtualization.  Shares in storage company EMC were down 1 percent on Thursday. Shares of IBM, which makes servers and sells other related services, were down 2 percent. HP Enterprises, which sells server products, fell 5 percent in a generally weak market. Conversely, Cisco said demand for security and next-generation data centers, which rely more heavily on software than traditional data centers, withstood the downturn. Shares of Arista Networks, which makes next-generation data center switches, showed slight gains Thursday. The company reports earnings next week.One believer in next-generation data centers, insurance company Assured Guaranty, has upgraded its facilities by replacing separate components with all-in-one hardware and software from Westborough, Mass.-based SimpliVity. The new system includes components from Cisco.  “The busywork is gone,” said Jason Elizaitis, Assured’s director of IT operations, who said the system also cost 50 percent less to buy than replacing the previous one.Still, such business remains a relatively small part of the overall IT market. Global IT spending is slated to rise 1.7 percent this year, but Gartner analyst Richard Gordon says the research firm may revisit that estimate.  “I would not be surprised to see our forecast for IT spending growth decline in our next update due to increased macroeconomic concerns, geopolitical worries and market volatility creating negative business sentiment,” he said, adding he wasn’t expecting a “dramatic slowdown” due to the essential nature of technology spending. Many chief information officers are likely searching for ways to save money short term that will not get in the way of overall long-term planning, said Ralph Loura, formerly chief information officer at HP. But that tactic might change.“Once the pressures on cost persist for an extended time or are a significant enough inflection point,” he said, “then you revisit core strategy.” (Reporting by Sarah McBride; Editing by Peter Henderson and Andrew Hay)",2016-02-11,CSCO,"Thu Feb 11, 2016 | 3:36pm EST","Earnings bolster Cisco, but raise concerns for broader IT spending",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-cisco-systems-results-impact-analysis-idUSKCN0VK2EB?type=companyNews

267,"   By Joseph Menn and Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO The legal showdown between Apple Inc and U.S. law enforcement over encryption, no matter the outcome, will likely accelerate tech company efforts to engineer safeguards against government intrusion, tech industry executives say.Already, an emerging industry is marketing super-secure phones and mobile applications.An Apple executive said the company will strengthen its encryption if it wins its court battle with the federal government, which last week secured a court order requiring Apple engineers to help extract data from a phone associated with the mass shootings in San Bernardino.The executive spoke on condition of anonymity. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment publicly.If Apple loses the court case, the legal precedent could give the U.S. government broad authority to order companies to assist in breaking into encrypted products.But even a government victory could have unintended consequences for law enforcement, potentially prompting a wave of investment by U.S. tech companies in security systems that even their own engineers can't access, said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society.""A success for the government in this case may further spur Apple and others to develop devices that the makers aren't privileged to crack,"" he said.The fast-growing online storage provider Box has already made it a priority to give customers sole custody of data, said  Joel De la Garza, chief information security officer at the company. The intent is to make it impossible for the company to access its customers' data - even under a government order, he said.""Our goal is to achieve a `zero-knowledge' state"" for the company, he said, ""where our customers have total control over their data.""It's unclear whether Apple can - or would even want to - make smartphones the company can't access. Two Apple employees familiar with the company's security strategy said the company had no such plans. SMARTPHONE BLACK OUT One immediate beneficiary of the government's case against Apple is the niche industry, based mostly overseas, that has sprung up to design apps and phones to thwart snooping by governments, business rivals and criminals.In the more than two years since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying via U.S. companies, a handful of companies have released secure phones with names such as BlackPhone, RedPhone or Priv that trumpet security as a prime selling point.Phones such as Boeing Co's Black target government customers. Blackberry markets the Priv, an Android device, to corporate clients seeking more security.Others include Silent Circle, with launched its Blackphone 2 late last year, and Turing Robotic Industries, whose Turing Phone is due in April.

In the court's current term, Alito recused himself in an electricity markets regulation case, likely due to his ownership of shares in auto parts maker Johnson Controls Inc, which was involved in the dispute. Alito also stepped aside in a Puerto Rico debt-restructuring law case because of his investments in funds with assets in Puerto Rico municipal bonds.The bronze Douglass bust, estimated to be worth $6,500, was given to Thomas by businessman Harlan Crow, a contributor to conservative causes and a friend of the justice.Justice Elena Kagan also received an expensive gift: a signed copy of a book by one of her predecessors on the court, Justice Felix Frankfurter, who died in 1965. It was given to her by the University of Chicago Law School, where she once worked. The documents showed that Alito, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer continue to hold stocks in various companies.

301,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Technology heavyweights might be all that keeps the U.S. earnings recession from extending into a fifth quarter in September if they hit the higher estimates Wall Street is calling for. A bright spot in generally dour second-quarter results reported so far, technology is the only sector showing improved third-quarter analyst expectations, mostly because of strong scorecards recently from Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and others.Analysts' third-quarter expectations for all other sectors have been deteriorating since last year on worries about slower global growth and the strength of the U.S. dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, though profit growth still is expected in consumer discretionary, materials and other sectors.Earnings across the S&P 500 are now seen growing just 0.2 percent in the third quarter over the same quarter a year ago, down from an estimate of 2 percent growth a month ago.Technology profits, which this year have been the biggest contributor to S&P 500 earnings after financials, are now seen growing 3.1 percent in the third quarter, up from the 2.4 percent growth predicted a month ago.  Without the contribution of leaders like Alphabet and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for example, the entire index might show another quarter of slowing profit growth.Investors have been predicting that S&P 500 aggregate earnings would start to grow again in the third quarter of this year after starting to shrink in the third quarter of 2015. The second quarter, mostly over, is on track to show a 2.4 percent decline. Wall Street has been banking on fatter corporate profits to justify pricey valuations following a recent rally that has propelled the S&P 500 to record highs. Part of the reason for strength in the tech sector may be related to the weight of just a few larger players. In 2015, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft, Alphabet, IBM (IBM.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) pulled in combined earnings of $125 billion, equivalent to over half of all profits in the sector, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis.""They have just become such powerful, dominant market players that they don't face quite the pressures of other companies,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""In the case of Facebook and Google, they continue to just steal share, advertising share, from traditional sources. So they are truly shifting the pie towards them,"" he said. All those companies beat Wall Street's earnings expectations for the June quarter, except for Cisco, which is expected to report its quarterly results on Aug. 17. Its earnings per share beat expectations in at least the past eight quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.Tech's improving outlook has been noted on Wall Street, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen 12 percent since its June 27 post-Brexit referendum low.""Tech looks attractive,"" said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors.

303,"   By Alexandria Sage and Arathy S Nair | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Cisco Systems Inc said it would cut nearly 7 percent of its workforce, posting charges of up to $400 million in its first quarter, as the world's largest networking gear maker shifts focus from its legacy hardware towards higher-margin software.The gradual move to fast-growing sectors such as security, the Internet of Things and the cloud is a response to sluggish demand for Cisco's traditional lineup of switches and routers from telecom carriers and enterprise customers, amid intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper Networks Inc.Savings from up to 5,500 job cuts would be reinvested into key growth areas, Cisco said.""We think this is partly an effort by (CEO) Chuck Robbins to put a stake in the ground and send a message that this is going to be a leaner, meaner Cisco that is focused on driving software and recurring revenue business,"" said Guggenheim Securities analyst Ryan Hutchinson.Revenue at the company's routers business fell 6 percent in the fourth-quarter ended July 30, while switching unit revenue was up 2 percent. Orders from service providers fell 5 percent, while revenue in emerging markets fell 6 percent, Cisco said.Cisco projected flat revenue in the first quarter and gave an earnings forecast that was shy of analysts' estimates, saying it expected adjusted earnings of 58 cents to 60 cents per share, versus Wall Street estimates of 60 cents.""We're uncertain how to model any improvement in those two (segments) in particular going forward,"" Robbins told analysts on a call, speaking of service providers and emerging markets.  Robbins, who took over from John Chambers in July last year, has been steering Cisco toward more software and subscription-based services. Security, which Robbins said was the top priority of all its customers, posted a revenue gain of 16 percent in the quarter.

304,"   By Alexandria Sage and Arathy S Nair | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Cisco Systems Inc said it would cut nearly 7 percent of its workforce, posting charges of up to $400 million in its first quarter, as the world's largest networking gear maker shifts focus from its legacy hardware towards higher-margin software.The gradual move to fast-growing sectors such as security, the Internet of Things and the cloud is a response to sluggish demand for Cisco's traditional lineup of switches and routers from telecom carriers and enterprise customers, amid intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper Networks Inc.Savings from up to 5,500 job cuts would be reinvested into key growth areas, Cisco said.""We think this is partly an effort by (CEO) Chuck Robbins to put a stake in the ground and send a message that this is going to be a leaner, meaner Cisco that is focused on driving software and recurring revenue business,"" said Guggenheim Securities analyst Ryan Hutchinson.Revenue at the company's routers business fell 6 percent in the fourth-quarter ended July 30, while switching unit revenue was up 2 percent. Orders from service providers fell 5 percent, while revenue in emerging markets fell 6 percent, Cisco said.Cisco projected flat revenue in the first quarter and gave an earnings forecast that was shy of analysts' estimates, saying it expected adjusted earnings of 58 cents to 60 cents per share, versus Wall Street estimates of 60 cents.""We're uncertain how to model any improvement in those two (segments) in particular going forward,"" Robbins told analysts on a call, speaking of service providers and emerging markets.  Robbins, who took over from John Chambers in July last year, has been steering Cisco toward more software and subscription-based services. Security, which Robbins said was the top priority of all its customers, posted a revenue gain of 16 percent in the quarter.

313,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Trade Representative has upheld an import ban on Arista Networks Inc's ethernet switches following a federal commission's finding in June that the company's products infringed patents owned by rival Cisco Systems Inc, Cisco said.The decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), which investigates purported violations of U.S. intellectual property, stemmed from a complaint Cisco filed in December 2014 about the switches, which are used in computer data centers and servers.In a blog post on the company's website on Monday, Cisco general counsel Mark Chandler said the import ban was to start on Tuesday. Representatives for the USTR could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. The ITC said Arista infringed three Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. The ruling excludes the import of Arista's network devices, including its 7000 series of switches, which generates most of that company's product revenue, according to regulatory filings.

331,"   By Mia Shanley and Helena Soderpalm | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM The crisis at Ericsson (ERICb.ST) deepened on Wednesday when the world's biggest maker of mobile network equipment reported a 94 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit and tumbling sales.The Swedish company is struggling with a drop in spending by telecoms companies, with new 5G technology still years away, and stiff competition from Finland's Nokia and China's Huawei.Its shares dropped more than 15 percent to an eight year low in early trading after it missed analysts' forecasts for a fifth straight quarter and said it saw no sign of a quick upturn.Having been slower to cut costs than recently merged rivals Nokia and Alcatel, Ericsson ousted Hans Vestberg as chief executive in July. It has since announced plans to axe thousands of jobs, but analysts said third-quarter results showed the challenges facing the firm as it looks for a new leader.""Now the market is pressuring them for transformation and clarifying what they are, and what they need to do,"" said Gartner analyst Sylvain Fabre. ""It's a case of being a little more clear of what they want to do when they grow up.""Acting CEO Jan Frykhammar was confident Ericsson could fight back, noting it had faced a similar situation in 2007-2009 when it was waiting for demand for 4G technology to kick in. ""This is absolutely not the beginning of the end for Ericsson,"" he said on a call with analysts and media.Ericsson said third-quarter operating income plunged to 300 million Swedish crowns ($34.8 million) from 5.1 billion crowns a year ago, including restructuring charges of 1.3 billion crowns. Sales dropped 14 percent to 51.1 billion crowns, including an almost 20 percent drop in its core networks division. Analysts' mean forecasts were for operating income of 4.3 billion crowns and sales of 53.6 billion.CONSOLIDATION?  Ericsson said sales fell most in markets with weakening economies such as Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. Sales in Europe were hit by the completion of mobile broadband projects in 2015.Frykhammar said current market trends were expected to continue in the short term, suggesting two to three quarters.Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at Inderes Equity Research, said the results did not bode well for Nokia (NOKIA.HE), whose shares fell more than 4 percent on Wednesday.But he added the Finnish firm was less dependent on mobile broadband demand than Ericsson as its merger with Alcatel gave it a bigger fixed-line network business. With Ericsson struggling and its stock sliding, speculation has resurfaced it could be a bid target for Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), the world's biggest supplier of data network gear. The two firms struck a sales partnership last year, but some analysts say this has yet to produce meaningful results and there are few benefits that would justify Cisco paying a premium for Ericsson shares.""We would rarely rule out speculated consolidation but feel it is unlikely,"" UBS analysts said, adding there was a lack of overlap between the two businesses and Cisco's prized 30 percent operating profit margin would only be dragged lower by Ericsson.At 1030 GMT, Ericsson's shares were down 17.3 percent at 51.10 crowns, after trading as low as 50.50 crowns. The stock has fallen around 36 percent this year. ""Unless Ericsson can provide a solid explanation to why the gross margin should rebound during early parts of 2017 and why the market should pick up ... we see clear risk that the share will come down sub 50 crowns as estimates will have to come down heavily and (the) dividend likely will have to be cut,"" SEB analysts said.($1 = 8.6231 Swedish crowns) (Additional reporting by Niklas Pollard, Bjorn Rundstrom, Johannes Hellstrom in Stockholm, Tuomas Forsell and Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki, Eric Auchard in Frankfurt, Simon Jessop in London; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Mark Potter)",2016-10-12,CSCO,"Wed Oct 12, 2016 | 6:56am EDT",UPDATE 3-Ericsson crisis deepens as profits plunge 94 pct,http://www.reuters.com//article/ericsson-results-idUSL8N1CI0O2?type=companyNews

340,"   By Dan Levine  U.S. customs officials ruled that Arista Networks Inc (ANET.N) can import redesigned ethernet switches that had been banned by the International Trade Commission, reducing pressure on Arista as it battles allegations of intellectual property infringement made by rival Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O).The U.S. International Trade Commission had ruled earlier this year that Arista infringed three Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. An import ban on the Arista switches was subsequently upheld by the U.S. Trade Representative.However, in a securities filing on Monday, Arista said it received a letter last week from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, saying Arista's current redesigned products ""are not within the scope"" of the ITC import ban. Marc Taxay, Arista's general counsel, said in a statement that the company looked forward to resuming the importation of its redesigned products. In a statement, Cisco said it believes Arista's redesign ""is a thin veil to cover Arista's ongoing infringement.""Cisco and Arista are expected to begin trial next week in a California federal court over claims of copyright and patent infringement brought by Cisco.
