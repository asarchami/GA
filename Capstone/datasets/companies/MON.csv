0,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co (MON.N), the world's largest seed company, reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as a rise in herbicide sales offset a decline in its corn business.The company also said it was making fast progress on more than two dozen new projects and was laying the groundwork for an extension of its precision farming platform, which uses data and technology to prescribe production tools for individual farmers.Shares of Monsanto were up 2.3 percent at $115.44 in afternoon trading.Analysts lauded the company's performance, saying it reflected a good balance of high-margin herbicide sales and advances in the seed businesses.""The ag productivity segment carried the day this quarter in terms of where most of the earnings growth came from,"" said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold. ""But the seed business did fine ... They are intelligently focusing on where they can win.""Monsanto, which develops genetically engineered corn, soybeans and other crops and sells the popular Roundup herbicide, said it was seeing strong early seed orders for spring planting in the United States. Farmers are expected to plant more soybeans this year and devote fewer acres to corn as part of a routine rotation, Monsanto officials said. The company said it had notched a record 29 ""phase advancements"" across several research and development platforms, and signed a deal with a large U.S. agricultural retail distributor to expand its new precision farming system products.Monsanto noted that it was advancing development of an herbicide-tolerant wheat, pushing what would be the world's first biotech version of the grain a step closer to market. It is also progressing on work to make crops more drought-hardy and more pest- and disease resistant.The company is working on a new combination of biotech crops and herbicide chemistry to control weeds that have become resistant to its Roundup herbicide.Environmental experts and others have criticized Monsanto's request for regulatory approvals for that new ""Xtend"" herbicide-tolerant cropping system, saying it would contribute to increased weed resistance over the long term. But Monsanto said Wednesday that recent regulatory progress by a competitor on a similar system was an encouraging sign for its own sought-after approval.In the first quarter ended November 30, the company's net sales rose nearly 7 percent to $3.14 billion from $2.94 billion a year earlier, even as sales of corn seeds and specialized genetic traits for corn fell 7 percent to $1.05 billion.Sales of cotton seeds and traits slumped 26 percent to $137 million, but soybean sales surged 16 percent to $267 million. In the agricultural productivity segment, which includes Roundup herbicide, sales jumped 24 percent to $1.5 billion.Net income rose to $373 million, or 69 cents per share, from $349 million, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier.The profit of 67 cents a share from continuing operations was 3 cents higher than the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company affirmed its fiscal-year earnings forecast of $5.00 to $5.20 a share from continuing operations and $5.02 to $5.22 including income from discontinued operations.Monsanto officials said they still expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million for 2014.(Reporting by Carey Gillam in Kansas City; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Bernadette Baum and Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-01-08,MON,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 1:26pm EST",Monsanto profit beats expectations; shares rise,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-monsanto-results-idUSBREA070Q520140108?type=companyNews

5,"  WASHINGTON Jan 13 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by organic farmers and others seeking to require Monsanto Co  to promise never to sue farmers if their fields inadvertently have plants containing the company's patented genetically modified traits.A company lawyer said Monsanto had not sued for inadvertent use of its biotech seeds and did not plan to, but that it would not make a blanket promise to that effect. Lower courts held that none of those who sued had been injured.The Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association and a group of dozens of organic and conventional family farmers, seed companies and public advocacy interests sued Monsanto in March 2011.The suit sought to prohibit the company from suing farmers whose fields became inadvertently contaminated with corn, soybeans, cotton, canola and other crops containing Monsanto's genetic modifications.Monsanto has genetically engineered its specialty seeds to withstand dousings of glyphosate, the main ingredient of the company's Roundup herbicide. The company charges a premium to farmers for use of its seeds and prohibits unauthorized plantings. But there have been several cases in which the patented genetic traits have been found to have mixed into fields where farmers had not purchased or planted the biotech seeds. Monsanto routinely sues farmers who it says intentionally plant its biotech seeds without paying for the technology, but it has said it will not sue farmers whose fields are accidentally contaminated.In the suit filed by the organic and conventional growers, the group asked Monsanto for a pre-emptive pledge not to sue them since they do not use the biotech seeds. But Monsanto refused to do so saying a ""blanket covenant"" not to sue any present or future member of the organizations would enable ""virtually anyone to commit intentional infringement.""The biotech crops are widely used throughout the United States. The group of Monsanto critics lost in district court and in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeals court decision now stands.""Monsanto never has and has committed it never will sue if our patented seed or traits are found in a farmer's field as a result of inadvertent means,"" said Kyle McClain, the company's chief litigation counsel. ""The lower courts agreed there was no controversy between the parties,"" McClain added, ""and the Supreme Court's decision not to review the case brings closure on this matter.""Daniel Ravicher, executive director of the Public Patent Foundation and lead counsel to the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the high court's action was disappointing but that ""it should not be misinterpreted as meaning that Monsanto has the right to bring such suits.""""Indeed, in light of the court of appeals decision, Monsanto may not sue any contaminated farmer for patent infringement if the level of contamination is less than 1 percent.""Monsanto shares were down 1.5 percent at $111.30 just before the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.The case is Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association, et al., v.

They claimed that more than 2.6 million members support their efforts.The resolutions come at a time of heightened debate over the spread of genetically modified crops.

11,"  PARIS, March 15 France's agriculture ministry on Saturday banned the sale, use and cultivation of Monsanto's MON 810 genetically modified maize, the only variety currently authorised in the European Union.The French government, which maintains that GM crops present environmental risks, has been trying to institute a new ban on GM maize (corn) after its highest court has twice previously struck down similar measures.The decision is timed to avert any sowing of GM maize by farmers before a draft law is debated on April 10 aimed at banning planting of GMOs (genetically modified organisms). ""The sale, use and cultivation of varieties of maize seed from the line of genetically modified maize MON 810 (...) is banned in the country until the adoption, on the one hand, of a final decision, and secondly, of (EU) community action, "" said a decree published on Saturday.Annual sowing of maize in France gets under way in the second half of March. The current Socialist government, like its conservative predecessor, has opposed the growing of GMO crops in light of public suspicion and widespread protests from environmentalists. Longstanding differences between EU countries resurfaced in February when they failed to agree on whether or not to approve another GM maize variety, Pioneer 1507, developed by DuPont and Dow Chemical, leaving the way open to the EU Commission to clear it for cultivation.France is trying to win support to overhaul the EU rules.",2014-03-15,MON,"Sat Mar 15, 2014 | 9:11am EDT",France bans Monsanto GM maize ahead of sowing season,http://www.reuters.com//article/france-monsanto-idUSL6N0MC0BR20140315?type=companyNews

The group raised its full-year outlook and now expects operating profit to grow by 8 to 10 percent from an earlier 6 to 9 percent.Novozymes' shares were over 4 percent higher in early trade.The firm's sales of enzymes to the United States' bioethanol sector grew by 29 percent to 514 million crowns even though the sector's production of ethanol only grew around 11 percent.""Our new enzyme products for the ethanol producers are doing really well,"" chief financial officer Benny Loft told Reuters. He said the products, which were launched during 2013, helped ethanol producers to increase their production using the same amount of corn and that was why producers had increased use of Novozymes' products.Analysts polled by Reuters had expected sales of bioenergy ethanol of 488 million crowns in the quarter.""Overall, it's a very good first quarter,"" analyst Morten Imsgard from Sydbank said. ""Novozymes demonstrates to the investors that there is good growth in several of the major business areas, especially the bioenergy division,"" he said. Analyst Michael Friis Jorgensen from Alm. Brand Bank said that both the sales of ethanol enzymes and the one-off boost from the alliance with Monsanto were better than expected.Sales of detergent enzymes, Novozymes largest business area, grew by 7 percent to 1.08 million crowns, in line with analysts' expectations, driven by a new large customer and increasing sales in emerging markets.Detergent producers add enzymes to the washing powder to increase its performance, enable low-temperature washing and replace traditional chemicals.Novozymes' enzymes are also used in amongst other things food, beer and animal feed. Its peers include Denmark's Chr. Hansen, Dutch group DSM and Dupont  from the United States.The expectation for total sales growth for 2014 was adjusted to 4 to 6 percent from 4 to 7 percent in Danish crowns due to a negative currency impact.($1 = 5.3989 Danish Crowns)   (Additional reporting by Ole Mikkelsen, Stine Jacobsen and Shida Chayesteh; Editing by Erica Billingham and Mark Potter)",2014-04-24,MON,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 3:07am EDT","UPDATE 1-Novozymes Q1 beats forecast, raises earnings outlook",http://www.reuters.com//article/novozymes-results-idUSL6N0NG1J120140424?type=companyNews

With a new 400 million euro fund, Index Ventures will stick with its global strategy, but perhaps with more of a U.S. twist.""In some ways, we are going to be more present in the U.S. than we were in the past,"" Danny Rimer, a San Francisco-based partner at Index, said in an interview. ""You're going to see earlier-stage investments that come out of the U.S."" Rimer's investments include Los Angeles-based fashion company Nastygal, San Francisco-based artificial-intelligence gaming developer Anki and San Francisco-based file-storage company Dropbox.Index Ventures, which was founded in Geneva, has seen some big outcomes in recent months. Over the last year, one portfolio company, Helsinki-based gaming company Supercell, sold a majority stake for $1.53 billion to two Japanese companies. Monsanto Co, the world's largest seed company, bought another, San Francisco-based Climate Corp, for $1.1 billion. But Index's most impressive accomplishment has come via recent initial public offerings, including five over the last year at valuations of $1 billion or more.Those comprise online food-ordering company Just Eat Plc  and Candy Crush owner King Digital Entertainment Plc , both based in London; Paris-based online advertising company Criteo SA ; San Francisco-based help-desk software company Zendesk Inc ; and Santa Clara, California-based data-center company Arista Networks Inc . The latest fund's roughly 80 investors, known in the industry as limited partners, are about half U.S.-based and half Europe-based, Rimer said.Returns for venture capital are steadily improving. In the 10 years to Dec. 31, venture capital has returned 9.7 percent annually, compared with 7.4 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average, according to a report from consultancy Cambridge Associates.Until last year, 10-year venture returns had lagged the stock market, reports from Cambridge Associates show.

Competitors are also focusing on volumes, with very low food inflation,"" Bank Degroof analyst Hans D'Haese said. The Belgian supermarket sector has been fiercely competitive over the past few quarters, partly due to Dutch rival Ahold's  Albert Heijn entering the market and German hard discounters Aldi and Lidl gaining ground.Trading volume in Colruyt was at twice its 90-day daily average. The broader FTSEurofirst 300, meanwhile, traded only around three-quarters of its average volume - with the index down 0.1 percent at 1,386.75 points, retreating from a 6-1/2 year high hit last week.Signs of economic weakness in the region weighed on the market. Germany's Ifo index of business sentiment fell more than expected in June to its lowest this year.Comments by Bank of England officials also made investors reluctant to place big bets on equities.

23,"   By Jamie McGeever | LONDON  LONDON European stocks and major currency and bond markets struggled for direction on Tuesday, underpinned by manufacturing data from China, Japan and the United States the previous day but unnerved by growing signs of economic weakness in Europe.Germany's Ifo index of business sentiment fell more than expected in June, eating into gains across Europe's major stock markets that had been racked up on merger and acquisition talk. [ECON]Crude prices pushed deeper into the red as the Ifo's signal of moderating activity in Europe's largest economy dovetailed with figures on Monday that showed oil supplies from Iraq unaffected by the Sunni Islamist insurgency there.In early trade the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares was up 0.1 percent at 1390 points .FTEU3, Germany's DAX was up 0.1 percent at 9935 points .GDAXI and France's CAC 40 .FCHI was up 0.3 percent at 4529 points.Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE was flat at 6799 points.Agrochemicals company Syngenta SYNN.VX surged as much as 6.5 percent on a media report that peer Monsanto (MON.N) had considered buying it in a deal worth $40 billion. At 0831 GMT Syngenta was up 4.5 percent, far and away the biggest gainer among Europe's leading shares.""Our outlook for equity markets for the remainder of the year is positive. M&A has made a welcome return in recent months,"" said Mark Burgess, chief investment officer at Threadneedle Investments.But the Ifo data put a lid on gains. ""The German Ifo data was very disappointing. Yes, it is a lagging indicator, but this is the third number in a row which is skewed towards the downside, clouding investors' confidence,"" said Naeem Aslam at online trading platform AvaTrade.Close attention was also being paid to Bank of England governor Mark Carney's testimony to parliament, which started at  0830 GMT. He is likely to be grilled by lawmakers on his surprise statement earlier this month that UK interest rate could go up later this year. Earlier in Asia, the majority of markets edged ahead after a sluggish start, and the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei .N225 added a slender 0.05 percent. OIL EASES BACK Major currencies were flat. The euro was at $1.3607, the dollar was at 101.98 yen and sterling was at $1.7025.That left the dollar index .DXY little changed at 80.255, well within the narrow 80.000-81.000 range seen since May.The Australian dollar was down 0.2 percent at $0.9402, having touched a three-month peak overnight. There was more life in commodity markets, where oil eased from recent nine-month highs after data on Monday showed that Iraq's oil exports neared record levels in June despite the Sunni Islamist insurgency sweeping through the country.Brent crude oil futures dipped below $114 a barrel LCOc1, down 0.4 percent on the day and on track for the third straight day of decline, something not seen for a month.U.S. oil futures CLc1 were down 0.4 percent at $105.80 a barrel.""The supply news isn't really supporting oil prices. The only thing supporting them is the fear factor,"" said Carsten Fritsch, an oil analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.Spot gold was down slightly on the day at $1,315.80 an ounce as the market consolidated last week's 3 percent jump. U.S. Treasury bonds edged higher, pushing the 10-year benchmark yield down a basis point to 2.61 percent.

A spokesman for Syngenta was not immediately available for comment.

M&A has made a welcome return in recent months,"" said Burgess.Syngenta's gains enabled Switzerland's main SMI equity index  to rise by 0.5 percent, beating gains of 0.2 percent on Germany's DAX equity index and a rise of 0.4 percent on France's CAC-40. The FTSEurofirst 300 index has risen by about 6 percent since the start of 2014, while the DAX has hit record highs and is up by about 4 percent.Although European stock markets have edged back from those highs over the last week, partly due to a rise in the price of oil following violence in Iraq, many traders and investors expect further gains for stock markets for the rest of the year.

37,"  SAO PAULO, July 17 An impasse between U.S.-based Monsanto Co and soybean buyers in Brazil over royalty payments on a new seed technology may complicate the country's sales of the upcoming oilseed crop.Monsanto has fought farmers over royalty payments for its seed technology in courts around the world. In Brazil, it now wants commodity trading firms to ensure farmers pay the proper fees for its new South American seed, Intacta RR 2 Pro.But trading firms are afraid to get caught in the crossfire.Brazil's Vegetable Oils Association (Abiove), which represents international soybean traders such as ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, said members have been negotiating with Monsanto for six months.""We can serve as monitors in this process, as Monsanto requests ... but we cannot assume legal responsibility for the collection of royalties,"" said Abiove President Carlo Lovatelli. Monsanto said in a statement on Thursday that it was confident the best solution would be found in favor of Brazilian soybean growers.The main concern for the soy industry in Brazil, which exports more than half of its annual harvest, is what would happen if questions arise over a royalty payment on a soy cargo that has already been shipped, Lovatelli said in an interview.""It would be like selling a complete car and then having the tire manufacturer come and complain about something to do with the rubber,"" he said. If the impasse continues, buyers may not be able to purchase  soy from Brazilian farmers who planted their fields with Intacta. Brazil, the world's No. 1 soy exporter, is Monsanto's second-largest market after the United States.Herbicide-resistent Intacta will likely make up 25 percent of the soybean crop to be planted in September, compared with 4 percent in the inaugural 2013/14 season. Farmers have said the seed is resistant to a devastating Asian caterpillar, helicoverpa armigera, that first appeared in Brazil in 2012. Farmers are already buying seeds for next year's crop. The U.S. Agriculture Department expects Brazil to produce a record 91 million tonnes of soybeans but has said the United States may replace Brazil as the top soybean exporter next season.""Producers want certainty, in this time of seed buying, that they are not going to have problems when they deliver their soy six months from now,"" Lovatelli said.Brazilian farmers dropped a long-running legal battle against Monsanto last year, accepting the company's offer to lower the price of Intacta seeds in exchange for ending the case over its old Roundup Ready seed technology.Earlier this year the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Monsanto's biotech seed patents, dealing a blow to a group attempting to ward off the company's lawsuits against farmers.

38,"  (Adds Monsanto statement)By Caroline StaufferSAO PAULO, July 28 Genetically modified corn seeds are no longer protecting Brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs, increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides, a farm group said on Monday.Producers want four major manufacturers of so-called BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state.""The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn't die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare ... at a time that corn prices are terrible,"" he said.Large-scale farming in the bug-ridden tropics has always been a challenge, and now Brazil's government is concerned that planting the same crops repeatedly with the same seed technologies has left the agricultural superpower vulnerable to pest outbreaks and dependent on toxic chemicals. Experts in the United States have also warned about corn  production prospects because of a growing bug resistance to genetically modified corn. Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.In Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.Seed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds. Dow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Co, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop ""an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,"" it said in an email.Another company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company's Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement. Monsanto Co also said in a statement that it has not been formally notified by the group. The other company, Syngenta AG, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers during a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas. But he said the seed companies have not given clear instructions.""There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,"" he said. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.Brazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season's record. Domestic prices recently fell to  their lowest in four years because of abundant supplies.($1 = 2.223 reais)     (Reporting by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Steve Orlofsky)",2014-07-28,MON,"Mon Jul 28, 2014 | 6:57pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Brazil farmers say GMO corn no longer resistant to pests,http://www.reuters.com//article/brazil-corn-pests-idUSL2N0Q327P20140728?type=companyNews
39,"   By Carey Gillam  Aug 6 U.S. regulators on Tuesday said they are leaning toward approval of a new line of herbicide-tolerant crops developed by Monsanto Co even though they could increase problematic weed resistance for farmers.Under the draft ""environmental impact statement"" (EIS) by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the agency said its analysis shows the new genetically modified cotton and soybean plants should be approved.St. Louis-based Monsanto, said the APHIS move was ""a noteworthy sign of progress.""""It is an important step in the regulatory process and we are encouraging farmers to urge APHIS to complete this action as soon as possible,"" Michelle Vigna, Monsanto's product manager, said in a statement.Monsanto developed the new soybeans and cotton to resist a new herbicide that combines dicamba and glyphosate and which Monsanto is branding as Roundup Xtend. The ""Roundup Ready Xtend crop system"" is aimed at combating the millions of acres of weeds that have grown resistant to Monsanto's glyphosate-based Roundup, which has been used extensively on the company's biotech corn, soybeans and cotton. APHIS also on Tuesday issued a final EIS for genetically altered corn and soybean plants developed by Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical. That EIS also states that the agency intends to approve the products. APHIS has already said in January that it was leaning toward approval for Dow's products.Dow has developed what it calls Enlist corn and soybeans that resist a new herbicide developed by Dow that includes both glyphosate and 2,4-D.A final decision is expected after a 30-day public review period, the agency said. American farmers are ""one step closer to obtaining a critical tool needed to manage resistant and hard-to-control weeds,"" Dow said in a statement.Both Monsanto's and Dow's new cropping systems have seen regulatory decisions delayed by intense opposition from many consumer, environmental and farmer groups who say there are a host of concerns with both products.The groups say using more herbicides on weeds will only increase weed resistance over the long term. And increased herbicide use also brings increased risks of health problems and environmental pollution, they say. ""We are outraged,"" said Marcia Ishii-Eiteman, senior scientist with the Pesticide Action Network North America. ""Despite all of this public outcry, what these decisions show is that USDA is much more interested in working with Dow and Monsanto and getting their products to market than in protecting the public.""In its statement about Monsanto's new products issued Tuesday, APHIS said farmers would see benefits, but acknowledged there also would likely be ""an increased chance of the development of weeds resistant to dicamba.""The draft EIS for Monsanto's products will be available for a 45-day public review and comment period, APHIS said.Alongside the USDA/APHIS regulatory process, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is concluding its concurrent review of the related herbicides.(Reporting by Carey Gillam in Kansas City; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-08-06,MON,"Wed Aug 6, 2014 | 3:15pm EDT","USDA leaning toward approval of Monsanto's new GMO beans, cotton",http://www.reuters.com//article/monsanto-xtend-idUSL2N0QC1SE20140806?type=companyNews
40,"   By Carey Gillam | Sept 17  Sept 17 The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday gave final approval to new genetically modified corn and soybeans developed by Dow AgroSciences that, while heavily criticized by environmentalists and some farmers, are portrayed by Dow as an answer to weed resistance problems that limit crop production.Approval of the specialty corn and soybeans to be sold as part of a branded ""Enlist Weed Control System"" means the traits could be on the market for the 2015 U.S. planting season, according to Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical.Dow is still awaiting approval from the Environmental Protection Agency for Enlist herbicide, which the genetically altered Enlist corn and beans are designed to tolerate.Like the popular Roundup Ready system developed by rival Monsanto Co., farmers who plant Enlist crops can spray their fields with Enlist herbicide and kill weeds but not the crops.Corn and soybeans containing Monsanto's Roundup Ready trait, which can tolerate sprayings of Roundup herbicide, make up roughly 90 percent of U.S. corn and soybean plantings every spring. But heavy use of Roundup has triggered an explosion of herbicide-resistant ""super weeds"" that are hard for farmers to fight and which can choke off crop yields.The prevalence of resistant weeds has more than doubled since 2009 and so-called ""super weeds"" now infest roughly 70 million acres of U.S. farmland, according to Dow.Because weeds have not yet developed resistance to Enlist, the system addresses the problem. ""Enlist will help farmers increase their productivity to meet the growing demand for a safe and affordable food supply,"" Tim Hassinger, president of Dow AgroSciences, said in a statement.Dow pegs the market opportunity for Enlist at about $1 billion. Monsanto is also developing a new biotech cropping system.Enlist combines a 60-year-old herbicide component known as 2,4-D with glyphosate, the chief ingredient in long-used Roundup.Opponents say the use of 2,4-D can cause potential health and environmental problems, including increasing weed resistance. And they fear the chemical will damage neighboring farm fields. Fruit and vegetable farmers are particularly concerned that 2,4-D drift will lead to crop damage. But Dow has said the Enlist system is safe if properly used.""The USDA approval of Enlist after such a fundamentally flawed review process is a slap in the face to farmers,"" said Marcia Ishii-Eiteman, senior scientist with Pesticide Action Network (PAN). ""Thousands of farmers have warned USDA of the crop damage, economic losses and health risks they will face from pesticide drift, if these 2,4-D resistant seeds hit the market.""Ishii-Eiteman hinted at a lawsuit, saying PAN would pursue ""legal options"" to protect farmers.

41,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co's experimental genetically engineered wheat, never approved for sale, has been found growing in a second U.S. state, and regulators said on Friday they could not explain how the plants escaped field trials that ended almost a decade ago. About a year after discovery of the company's unapproved wheat in a single Oregon field disrupted U.S. wheat export sales, the GMO wheat has also been found in Montana, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said on Friday. APHIS launched an investigation into the Montana discovery on July 14, said Bernadette Juarez, director of investigative and enforcement services for APHIS. The wheat was found growing at a research facility for Montana State University in Huntley, where field trials of Monsanto's wheat were conducted between 2000 and 2003, she said in a news conference.After conclusion of field trials, crop developers like Monsanto are obligated to inform regulators of any ""volunteers,"" or plants that grow on their own following a previous harvest, Juarez said.Monsanto said in a statement that it and Montana state notified APHIS of the unintended GMO wheat and were ""cooperating fully"" with the government investigation. USDA officials said there are no health and safety concerns from Monsanto GMO wheat, and that they do not believe the wheat has entered commerce. The area where it was found primarily produces sugar beets and barley, not wheat, Juarez said. The varieties of wheat in Montana differ significantly from  Oregon's, but both contain Monsanto's herbicide-tolerant trait.There is no commercially approved genetically modified wheat. The wheat in question was developed by Monsanto to withstand treatments of its Roundup weed killer, but the company never commercialized the ""Roundup Ready"" wheat. International buyers threatened to boycott U.S. wheat if the product was introduced to the marketplace. Monsanto said in 2004 that it was ending efforts to commercialize the GMO wheat, and the wheat was supposed to have been destroyed or stored securely.Monsanto and several other companies are still trying to develop a biotech wheat acceptable to the market. APHIS said on Friday it was stepping up oversight of those field trials.Word of the wheat in Montana comes after last year's discovery by an Oregon farmer of the GMO wheat in his field. That discovery prompted South Korea and Japan to temporarily halt purchases of U.S. wheat due to fears of contamination. APHIS said on Friday that despite a ""comprehensive"" investigation, the agency has not determined how the biotech  wheat came to grow in Oregon. No field trials were ever authorized on that Oregon farm.Juarez said there would not be any penalties or disciplinary action against Monsanto for the Oregon incident.Several farmers sued Monsanto, however, accusing the company of failing to protect the market from contamination.

44,"  (Adds Monsanto comment)By Carey GillamSept 26 Monsanto Co's experimental genetically engineered wheat, never approved for sale, has been found growing in a second U.S. state, and regulators said on Friday they could not explain how the plants escaped field trials that ended almost a decade ago.About a year after discovery of the company's unapproved wheat in a single Oregon field disrupted U.S. wheat export sales, the GMO wheat has also been found in Montana, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said on Friday.APHIS launched an investigation into the Montana discovery on July 14, said Bernadette Juarez, director of investigative and enforcement services for APHIS.The wheat was found growing at a research facility for Montana State University in Huntley, where field trials of Monsanto's wheat were conducted between 2000 and 2003, she said in a news conference.After conclusion of field trials, crop developers like Monsanto are obligated to inform regulators of any ""volunteers,"" or plants that grow on their own following a previous harvest, Juarez said. Monsanto said in a statement that it and Montana state notified APHIS of the unintended GMO wheat and were ""cooperating fully"" with the government investigation.USDA officials said there are no health and safety concerns from Monsanto GMO wheat, and that they do not believe the wheat has entered commerce. The area where it was found primarily produces sugar beets and barley, not wheat, Juarez said.The varieties of wheat in Montana differ significantly from  Oregon's, but both contain Monsanto's herbicide-tolerant trait. There is no commercially approved genetically modified wheat. The wheat in question was developed by Monsanto to withstand treatments of its Roundup weed killer, but the company never commercialized the ""Roundup Ready"" wheat. International buyers threatened to boycott U.S. wheat if the product was introduced to the marketplace.Monsanto said in 2004 that it was ending efforts to commercialize the GMO wheat, and the wheat was supposed to have been destroyed or stored securely.Monsanto and several other companies are still trying to develop a biotech wheat acceptable to the market. APHIS said on Friday it was stepping up oversight of those field trials. Word of the wheat in Montana comes after last year's discovery by an Oregon farmer of the GMO wheat in his field. That discovery prompted South Korea and Japan to temporarily halt purchases of U.S. wheat due to fears of contamination.APHIS said on Friday that despite a ""comprehensive"" investigation, the agency has not determined how the biotech  wheat came to grow in Oregon. No field trials were ever authorized on that Oregon farm.Juarez said there would not be any penalties or disciplinary action against Monsanto for the Oregon incident.Several farmers sued Monsanto, however, accusing the company of failing to protect the market from contamination.The parties agreed to settle, prior to the announcement of the Montana wheat discovery.

47,"  MEXICO CITY, Sept 30 Global seed technology giant Monsanto expects to invest $90 million over the next five years in a new corn seed research center in Mexico, the company said on Tuesday.On Monday, Monsanto said it had launched a new global center for developing conventional hybrid strains of corn in Tlajomulco de Zuniga on the southern fringe of Guadalajara, the country's second biggest city.The new research center will not develop new corn seeds that harness genetically modified organisms (GMO) and is not connected to Monsanto's pending applications to expand beyond pilot plantings of GMO corn in Mexico, company spokeswoman Erika Campuzano told Reuters in an emailed response to questions. The center ""aims to create new conventional varieties of corn that are tolerant to diseases as well as biotic and abiotic stresses that affect the cultivation of corn all over the world,"" said Campuzano. She added that Monsanto's research efforts seek to contribute to the doubling of global corn output by 2030.

48,"   By Carey Gillam | Oct. 2  Oct. 2 Japan and South Korea are continuing to test the U.S. wheat they buy to make sure the grain is not contaminated with an experimental version developed by Monsanto Co, but could soon stop the practice, the head of a U.S. wheat association said on Thursday.The two countries, which are among the top purchasers of U.S. wheat, have been sampling and testing all the U.S. wheat they have purchased since last year, when news broke that a farmer in Oregon had found Monsanto's unapproved biotech wheat growing in his field, according to U.S. Wheat Associates, which markets American wheat to international buyers.All of their test results on over five million tonnes of wheat have been negative, it said.The testing requirements are a competitive disadvantage for U.S. wheat, said U.S. Wheat President Alan Tracy. But both countries now should be able to stop the testing after assurances last week from the U.S. Department of Agriculture  that the Oregon event was isolated and no biotech wheat had made its way into commercial supplies.""We're hopeful that they'll be able to suspend the testing. It is not something they really want to keep doing indefinitely,"" Tracy told Reuters. ""They approach things cautiously. They felt they had no choice until this report (from USDA) was out."" U.S. Wheat Associates will meet representatives from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea later this month, he said.According to U.S. export sales data, Japan bought about 3 million tonnes of U.S. wheat in the 2013/2014 marketing year, which ended May 31, making it the fourth-largest buyer of U.S. wheat for that period after Brazil, China and Mexico. So far this marketing year, Japan has bought 1.4 million tonnes. Japan has the sampling and testing of the wheat it buys handled in the United States before it is shipped, Tracy said.South Korea bought 1.3 million tonnes during the last marketing year, making it the seventh largest buyer. So far this year, it has purchased 749,000 tonnes.There is no commercially approved biotech wheat, but Monsanto's herbicide-tolerant ""Roundup Ready"" wheat was near commercialization a decade ago before the company shelved the project amid fears that export sales would be hurt. The fact that experimental wheat was found growing uncontrolled in Oregon last year led to fears the biotech wheat might be in commercial supplies. The unapproved wheat was also found this summer in Montana, growing in a research plot where field trials of the GMO wheat were conducted from 2000 to 2003.The USDA said on Friday that it was investigating the Montana situation, but like Oregon, there are no indications  the unapproved wheat entered commercial supplies.Tracy said Asian markets remain very cautious about GMO grains generally.""It's not up to us to tell them what to do,"" he added.

49,"   By Caroline Stauffer | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO At least one soybean exporter in Brazil has agreed with Monsanto to collect royalties, in exchange for a fee, from farmers who planted genetically engineered seeds marketed by the company, according to industry sources. The landmark deal, already finalized by a firm that declined to be identified, highlights an increasingly complex relationship between global grain merchants and biotech firms. Other bigger merchants like ADM and Bunge  will finalize agreements soon, the sources said, resolving a months-long dispute that had threatened to disrupt as much as a quarter of all soy shipments from the world’s second-largest grower. The trading firms are wary of serving as biotechnology police in Brazil, a role they have not had to play in the United States because biotech company's patents are protected by laws that do not allow farmers to reuse seeds year after year there. In Brazil, where genetically modified seeds have only been legal since 2005, reusing seeds is more common and it is easier for farmers to skip out on Monsanto's fees after buying the seeds the first season.Soy-crushing group Abiove, which represents global firms including ADM, Bunge, Cargill [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus [LOUDR.UL], spent months negotiating to ensure companies are compensated for collecting and monitoring payments on Monsanto's new Intacta RR2 Pro strain of genetically modified soy.""Now the question is for Monsanto and each company to work out payments,"" said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of soy farmer's lobby Aprosoja in Brazil's top-growing state Mato Grosso after meeting with Abiove representatives this week.While some merchants have been collecting royalties on Monsanto's first-generation RoundupReady soy seeds in Brazil for as long as a decade, that arrangement was a source of deep frustration as it required merchants to accept legal liability for their shipments, without any compensation from Monsanto.The industry has been determined to avoid a similar arrangement for Intacta, a seed that includes a gene to ward off pests, which was first planted in South America last year. The local firm that has already accepted the compensation, said it did so reluctantly.“We assume the risk of not receiving royalties from producers,” said a manager at the firm who was not authorized to speak with the press. ""They (Monsanto) offered compensation for the company,"" she added. She declined to say what that was.Concerns remain that Monsanto might force firms to halt soy shipments without proof of royalty payments on cargos containing the strain. Brazil is Monsanto's second-largest market, making up about a tenth of its $15 billion in net sales last year. Monsanto has blamed a downturn in royalty payments on its mainstay Roundup Ready products for a drop in net sales of soybean seeds last year The spat bubbled under the surface until an Abiove statement in July said the association had failed to reach an agreement after six months of negotiations, potentially stalling soy sales in Brazil.  An Abiove representative confirmed Monsanto is negotiating with individual companies but declined further comment. Monsanto said in an e-mailed statement that negotiations with Abiove companies “are ongoing and progressing.”Bunge, ADM, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus declined comment.TENSE TIME  Tensions are growing between the merchants who dominate the world's grain trade, buying from farmers and shipping to importers, and the GMO makers whose products have become deeply embedded in the global supply chain.Brazil's Intacta saga is part of a broad trade, copyright, environment and food-safety debate about genetic modification in agriculture that is far from resolved. Intacta was not planted in Brazil until after China, which buys the vast majority of Brazilian soybeans, approved it last year. But farmers are worried that the trading dispute could limit buyers.""If this hadn't been resolved, the companies affiliated with Abiove were unlikely to trade Intacta soy,"" said Tomczyk. Early this year, China rejected 1.25 million tonnes of U.S. corn and byproducts containing the genetically modified strain MIR-162 manufactured by Swiss firm Syngenta that China has not yet approved.Cargill, one of the largest privately held U.S. corporations, last month sued Syngenta for marketing the seeds in the United States even though it lacked Beijing's approval, estimating it suffered losses of more than $90 million.Brazil's foreign ministry says the same MIR-162 corn, which has been sold in small amounts in the country since 2012, is preventing the sale of more Brazilian corn to China after the two countries signed a bi-lateral agreement earlier this year.

52,"  (New throughout, adds Monsanto, companies agreeing)SAO PAULO Oct 23 Some soy exporting companies in Brazil have still not agreed to collect royalties for Monsanto Co seeds, which could prevent farmers from selling a portion of this year's crop.Monsanto, however, said around 500 firms that purchase soybeans from farmers have agreed to police royalty payments at more than 3,000 points across Brazil, an arrangement that highlights the increasingly complex relationship between global grain merchants and biotech firms.One exporter told Reuters this month it would collect payments on Monsanto's new Intacta RR2 Pro seeds in exchange for a fee, and Abiove told soy growers group Aprosoja in September that other companies were in the process of settling on compensation amounts.But Abiove said on Thursday a broader deal had stalled, citing lingering legal concerns that Monsanto could halt shipments on cargoes that contain soy for which the company has not received royalties.""The risks of possible future embarrassment to the soy industry from Monsanto... may prevent crushing and trading firms from receiving that (Intacta) soy,"" Abiove said in a statement. Trading firms have not had to oversee royalty payments in the United States, the world's No. 2 soy exporter after Brazil, because farmers are not allowed to reuse seeds year after year there.In Brazil, where genetically modified seeds have only been legal since 2005, it is easier for farmers to skip out on Monsanto's fees and reuse the seeds. Brazil is Monsanto's second-largest market.While some merchants have been collecting royalties on Monsanto's first-generation RoundupReady soy seeds in Brazil for a decade, that arrangement was deeply frustrating for merchants as it required them to accept additional work and liability without any compensation. The industry has been determined to avoid a similar situation with Intacta, which includes a gene to ward off pests and was first planted in South America last year.Farm groups believe between 15 and 25 percent of Brazil's current crop, which is now more than 10 percent planted, was sown with Monsanto's Intacta seeds. Monsanto said farmers would have plenty of companies to sell their Intacta soybeans to as it continues to negotiate with Abiove members.Abiove represents global merchants Bunge, ADM , Louis Dreyfus and Cargill as well as smaller Brazilian firms.

53,"  SAO PAULO Oct 23 The majority of soy exporting firms in Brazil have still not agreed to collect royalties for seed giant Monsanto Co, threatening sales of up to a quarter of the country's soy crop, industry association Abiove said on Thursday.A small, local exporter told Reuters earlier this month it had agreed to police farmers' royalty payments on Monsanto's new Intacta RR2 Pro seeds in exchange for a fee, and Abiove told soy growers group Aprosoja in September that the months-long dispute was close to being resolved.But a broader deal has stalled due to lingering legal concerns that Monsanto could halt shipments on cargoes that contain soy for which the company has not received royalties, Abiove said, highlighting an increasingly tense relationship between global grain merchants and biotech firms.""The risks of possible future embarrassment to the soy industry from Monsanto... may prevent crushing and trading firms from receiving that (Intacta) soy,"" Abiove said in a statement.Trading firms have not had to oversee royalty payments in the United States, the world's No. 2 soy exporter after Brazil, because biotech company's patents are protected by laws that do not allow farmers to reuse seeds year after year there. In Brazil, where genetically modified seeds have only been legal since 2005, reusing seeds is more common and it is easier for farmers to skip out on Monsanto's fees after buying the seeds the first season.While some merchants have been collecting royalties on Monsanto's first-generation RoundupReady soy seeds in Brazil for a decade, that arrangement was deeply frustrating for merchants as it required them to accept additional work and liability for their shipments, without any compensation from Monsanto. The industry has been determined to avoid a similar situation with Intacta, which includes a gene to ward off pests and was first planted in South America last year.Farm groups believe between 15 and 25 percent of Brazil's current crop, which is now more than 10 percent planted, was sown with Monsanto's Intacta seeds. Monsanto did not immediately respond to request for comment. Abiove represents global grain merchants Bunge, ADM , Louis Dreyfus and Cargill as well as smaller Brazilian firms.Brazil's Intacta saga is part of a global trade, copyright, environment and food-safety debate about genetic modification in agriculture that is far from resolved.Early this year, China rejected 1.25 million tonnes of U.S. corn and by-products containing the genetically modified strain MIR-162 manufactured by Swiss firm Syngenta that China has not yet approved.Cargill last month sued Syngenta for marketing the seeds in the United States even though it lacked Beijing's approval, estimating it suffered losses of more than $90 million.

54,"   By Caroline Stauffer | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Nov 4 The largest soy exporters in Brazil are waiting for a final payment offer from Monsanto Co  in exchange for collecting seed royalties from farmers, the chairman of crushing association Abiove said on Tuesday.Reuters reported last month that a basic framework had been worked out in a dispute involving the world's most powerful agro-business companies, and that at least one exporter had agreed to collect royalties for a fee.Monsanto said in a statement on Oct. 23 that 500 companies had agreed to help police royalty payments in Brazil, an arrangement that highlights the increasingly complex relationship between grain merchants and biotech companies.Abiove represents multinational companies such as Cargill Inc, Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd  and Louis Dreyfus Corp in Brazil, the world's largest soybean exporter.The ball is now in Monsanto's court to make good on the base agreement and negotiate individual payments with Abiove members, which account for some 85 percent of the soybeans bought in Brazil, Abiove Chairman Manoel Pereira told Reuters. ""What is missing is the most important part - the payment,"" said Pereira, who is also director of grains at Minas Gerais-based trading firm Algar Agro.He said none of Abiove's members had received a payment offer and the association was trying to organize another meeting with Monsanto.""We hope they don't wait until harvest or it will be a problem,"" he added. Without compensation, Abiove members could refuse to buy soybeans grown from Monsanto's pest-resistant Intacta RR2 pro soybeans, which should make up as much as a quarter of Brazil's 2014/15 crop, expected to be more than 90 million tonnes.An impasse could limit the soybeans Brazil has available for export in January, when harvesting starts.The trading firms are wary of serving as a biotechnology police in Brazil, a role they have not had to play in the United States because biotech patents are protected by laws that do not allow farmers to reuse seeds year after year. Some merchants had been collecting royalties on Monsanto's first-generation RoundupReady soy seeds in Brazil for a decade. That arrangement was a source of frustration as it required merchants to accept legal liability for their shipments, without any compensation from Monsanto.Pereira said Abiove had worked out a framework that eliminated legal concerns over Monsanto halting shipments on cargoes containing soy for which it had not received royalty payments.He declined to say what Abiove's members considered a fair value for this service, adding that was up to individual companies.A Monsanto spokeswoman said negotiations continued and the company was confident a solution would be found.Brazil is Monsanto's second-biggest market after the United States, making up a tenth of its $15 billion in net sales last year. The company has blamed a downturn in royalty payments on its Roundup Ready products for a drop in net sales of soybean seeds last year.

57,"   By Carey Gillam  Nov 12 Monsanto Co said on Wednesday it reached a settlement with U.S. wheat farmers who sued the seed company over market disruption after unapproved genetically engineered wheat was discovered growing without oversight in Oregon.Monsanto's ""Roundup Ready"" wheat, which was never approved by U.S. regulators and which the company said it stopped testing a decade ago, was found growing in an Oregon farmer's field in 2013. The company had said all the experimental grain was destroyed or stored away.South Korea and Japan temporarily halted purchases of U.S. wheat after the announcement on fears the unapproved wheat, engineered to withstand Roundup herbicide, might have contaminated U.S. wheat supplies. Monsanto did not admit liability, but agreed to pay $250,000 to wheat growers' associations, including $100,000 to the National Wheat Foundation, and $50,000 each to the Washington Association of Wheat Growers, the Oregon Wheat Growers' League and the Idaho Grain Producers' Association.It will also pay $2.125 million into a settlement fund for farmers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho who sold soft white wheat between May 30, 2013, and Nov. 30, 2013. Monsanto will reimburse plaintiffs' counsel for a portion of their out-of-pocket costs and fees associated with the litigation. At least three class action lawsuits will be dismissed as part of the settlement, but the company said it does not resolve pending claims by growers of wheat other than the soft white variety.Monsanto still faces scrutiny over its biotech wheat after the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in September there had been a second discovery of unapproved Monsanto wheat. That wheat was found growing at a Montana State University research facility in Huntley, Montana, where field trials were conducted between 2000 and 2003.There is no commercially approved genetically modified wheat, although Monsanto and several other companies are trying to develop biotech varieties of the grain.

62,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co (MON.N) on Wednesday reported a 34 percent drop in quarterly profit, in part because of lower planted corn acreage in South America and a shift in timing of some sales, but the decline was less steep than analysts expected.Shares of the world's largest seed company, which is known for its genetically engineered corn, soybeans and other crops as well as the popular Roundup herbicide, rose nearly 2 percent.     Net sales fell to $2.9 billion in the first quarter ended Nov. 30 from $3.1 billion a year earlier, hurt by a 12 percent decline for corn seeds and genetic traits to $928 million. Sales of soybean seed and trait products, however, surged 48 percent to $396 million.One key new product is the company's ""Intacta RR2 PRO,"" a new soybean genetically engineered to fight off damaging worms and marketed to South American farmers. New soybean products will be a core factor for profit growth this fiscal year, the company said, as corn acres in the United States and globally are seen dropping. The company's early order book and prepayments for spring planting in the United States point to strong soybean demand, Monsanto said.Due in part to expectations for reduced planting of corn in U.S. fields this spring, Monsanto officials said second-quarter earnings were likely to drop 5 percent to 10 percent from a year earlier on an ongoing basis. First-quarter earnings fell to $243 million, or 50 cents a share, from $368 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Some analysts had been expecting a drop of as much as 50 percent. Excluding discontinued operations, earnings on an ongoing basis amounted to 47 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting 34 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Monsanto said it still expected earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.00 in fiscal 2015. In an update on its progress on new products, Monsanto said it was advancing disease-resistant breeding traits along with new insect control products, and was upgrading and expanding its farm data services. The company said it also was rapidly expanding its work into microbe strains that can enhance yields in key crops.

66,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co. received final U.S. approval on Thursday for herbicide-tolerant crops to be used with a new herbicide the company says will fight problematic weed resistance on farm fields, but critics say will only worsen the problems.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the genetically modified cotton and soybean plants are granted ""non-regulated"" status. Monsanto is still waiting for final approval from the Environmental Protection Agency for the herbicide it designed to be used with the crops.The company also is still awaiting approval from Chinese regulators to allow imports of the new soybeans. China is a key buyer of U.S. soybeans, but the country has shown reluctance to approve imports of new GMO crops recently. Last week, Monsanto Chief Technology Officer Robb Fraley told analysts the company expects to have Chinese approval in time for a commercial launch in 2016.Monsanto developed the new soybeans and cotton to resist a new herbicide that combines dicamba and glyphosate and which Monsanto is branding as components of the ""Roundup Ready Xtend crop system."" The new products are aimed at combating the millions of acres of weeds that have grown resistant to Monsanto's glyphosate-based Roundup, which has been used extensively on the company's biotech corn, soybeans and cotton. Monsanto's Xtend system drew intense opposition from many consumer, environmental and farmer groups who say using more herbicides on weeds will only increase weed resistance over the long term. Increased herbicide use also brings increased risks of health problems and environmental pollution, they say.""The pesticide treadmill spins on, and that's great news for Monsanto,"" said Gary Ruskin, executive director of U.S. Right to Know, a food issue research group. ""This is just the latest in a endless string of favors from our federal government to Monsanto.""

69,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Monsanto Company's (Monsanto, NYSE: MON) proposed senior unsecured notes in the  amount of $365 million. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this  release.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with the  company's $7.6 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding  as of Nov. 30, 2014. Monsanto plans to use the net proceeds of the issuance for  general corporate purposes, which may include share repurchases and capital  expenditures. The notes are callable after two years at par and will have a put  option upon a change of control and a downgrade of the notes below investment  grade. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Monsanto's substantive market positions in corn, soybean,  cotton and vegetables seeds and traits; in addition to leading or sizeable  positions depending on crop and geography. The company has R&D-driven expertise  in plant biotechnology that enables high profit margins and strong cash flows.  The company's portfolio benefits from patent protection for most of its key  products which creates high barriers of entry for new market entrants. In  addition, Monsanto licenses its technologies and traits to its competitors.  These agreements generate a recurring royalty stream that further supports the  company's profitability.  Monsanto's credit profile is strong, marked by robust operating margins,  significant free cash flow, moderate leverage and solid liquidity. The company  generated $4.8 billion of operating EBITDA in the LTM period ended Nov. 30,  2014, corresponding to 30% of net sales. Over the same period, free cash flow  after dividends but before acquisitions was approximately $738 million. Pro  forma for the debt issuance, total debt to operating EBITDA for the period was  1.7x. Fitch expects financial leverage to remain at or below 2x. Fitch expects Monsanto to continue to generate substantial positive free cash  flow in most fiscal years and to maintain a strong credit profile appropriate  for an R&D-driven company.  Monsanto's operating profits are driven by its corn seeds and traits which  accounted for about 60% of fiscal gross profits. Farm economics are very  healthy, which enables more farmers to buy newer generation seeds and traits.  Corn planting in the U.S. is expected to be lower in 2015 than in 2014 given  high stores and low prices, but soybean planting should benefit and overall  results should be flat.  The rating is constrained by the company's share buyback program and sizeable  dividends. As of Nov. 30, 2014, Monsanto had about $4.6 billion remaining under  the June 2014, two-year, share repurchase program. Fitch expects Monsanto to  balance share repurchases with investment opportunities to retain its target  capital structure of 1.5x net debt/EBITDA. The Stable Outlook is based on robust operating performance and expectations for  long term sales and earnings growth.  Fitch notes that the November quarter is the seasonal working capital use but  free-cash flow positive quarter. The company's liquidity totaled approximately  $5.6 billion at Nov. 30, 2014 with available cash at $3.1 billion and full  availability under the company's $2.5 billion revolving credit facility due  April 2016. As of Nov. 30, 2014, commercial paper outstanding was $395 million,  accrued marketing programs were $952 million and deferred revenues were $2.5  billion. The revolver has a total debt to total capital covenant of less than 66  2/3% compared to the Nov. 30, 2014 ratio of 52%. Fitch expects the company to  remain in compliance. Estimated maturities of long-term debt over the medium  term are $300 million in FY 2016, $900 million in FY 2017, $300 million in FY  2018 and $800 million in FY 2019.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include:  --Total Debt/EBITDA declines on a sustained basis below 1.25x.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --Total Debt/EBITDA increases on a sustained basis above 2.25x; --Liquidity, of which cash is at least $2 billion, less than $3 billion; --Regulatory actions that threaten Monsanto's business model.  Fitch currently rates Monsanto as follows:  --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'A-';  --Senior unsecured debt 'A-';  --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial Paper 'F2'.

70,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR), revolving credit facility rating, and senior unsecured  note ratings of Monsanto Company (Monsanto) at 'A-'. Fitch has also affirmed  Monsanto's Short-term IDR and commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F2'. A complete  list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Company Profile. The ratings reflect Monsanto's substantive market positions in  corn, soybean, cotton and vegetables seeds and traits, and crop protection  products. The company has R&D-driven expertise in plant biotechnology and  breeding that enables high profit margins and strong cash flows. The company's  portfolio benefits from patent protection for most of its key products which  creates high barriers of entry for new market entrants. In addition, Monsanto  licenses its technologies and traits to its competitors. These agreements  generate a recurring royalty stream that further supports the company's  profitability.  Monsanto's operating profits are driven by its corn seeds and traits which  accounted for about 46% of FY 2014 gross profits. Corn planting in the U.S. is  expected to be lower in 2015 than in 2014 given high stores and low prices, but  soybean planting should benefit and Fitch expects overall 2015 operating profits  to be flat with 2014. Strong Profitability and Free Cash Flow. The company generated $4.8 billion of  operating EBITDA in the LTM period ended Nov. 30, 2014, representing 30% of net  sales. Over the same period, operating cash flow after dividends and capital  expenditures but before acquisitions (FCF) was approximately $738 million. The  company guides to FY 2015 free cash flow (defined as the total of cash flows  from operating activities and investing activities) of $2 billion to $2.2  billion and Fitch believes FY 2015 FCF will be at least $1.3 billion.  Moderate Financial Leverage. Pro forma for the $365 million notes to be issued  in January 2015, total debt/operating EBITDA for the period was 1.7x. Fitch  expects financial leverage to remain at or below 2x on a gross basis, which is  consistent with Monsanto's net debt/EBITDA target of 1.5x. The rating is constrained by the company's share buyback program and sizeable  dividends. As of Nov. 30, 2014, Monsanto had about $4.6 billion remaining under  the June 2014, $10 billion, two-year share repurchase program. Fitch expects  Monsanto to balance share repurchases with investment opportunities to retain  its target capital structure of 1.5x net debt/EBITDA. Solid Liquidity. Fitch notes that the November quarter is a seasonal  working-capital use but FCF positive quarter. The company's liquidity totaled  approximately $5.6 billion at Nov. 30, 2014 with available cash at $3.1 billion  and full availability under the company's $2.5 billion revolving credit facility  due April 2016. As of Nov. 30, 2014, CP outstanding was $395 million, accrued  marketing programs were $952 million and deferred revenues were $2.5 billion.  The revolver has a total debt-to-total capital covenant of less than 66 2/3%  compared to the Nov. 30, 2014 ratio of 52%. Fitch expects the company to remain  in compliance. Estimated maturities of long-term debt over the medium term are  $300 million in FY 2016, $900 million in FY 2017, $300 million in FY 2018 and  $800 million in FY 2019. The Stable Outlook is based on robust operating performance and expectations for  long-term sales and earnings growth. Fitch expects Monsanto to continue to  generate substantial positive FCF in most fiscal years and to maintain a strong  credit profile appropriate for an R&D-driven company.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include:  --Total Debt/EBITDA declines on a sustained basis below 1.25x.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --Total Debt/EBITDA increases on a sustained basis above 2.25x; --Liquidity, of which cash is at least $2 billion, falls to less than $3  billion; --Regulatory actions occur that threaten Monsanto's business model.

72,"  * Farm sales boosted by strong demand for insecticides* Adjusted profit 85 cents/ share vs est 69 cents* Shares rise 2 pct in early trade   (Adds CEO comments, details; updates shares)By Swetha GopinathJan 29 Dow Chemical Co's adjusted profit handily beat analysts' estimate as margins in its agricultural sciences business soared, helped largely by new crop protection products.Shares of the company, the biggest U.S. chemical maker by sales, rose about 2 percent to $43.94 in early trading.The company's profit beat comes despite flat sales due to a stronger dollar.A stronger dollar hurts about 30-35 percent of Dow's revenue and one-tenths of profit, Chief Executive Andrew Liveris told Reuters. Rival DuPont forecast lower-than-expected revenue and profit on Tuesday, citing the strengthening dollar. The dollar  surged nearly 13 percent in 2014, its biggest yearly gain since 1997.Dow continues to see strong demand for its products amid weak oil prices and the strengthening dollar, Liveris said.The company's farm sales were boosted by strong demand for its insecticides in the quarter ended Dec. 31, contrasting weak agriculture sales at Monsanto Co and DuPont, which were hurt by a fall in corn plantings.Dow's sales of new crop protection products jumped 23 percent in the fourth quarter, led by Spinetoram and Isoclast insecticides. ""Even though corn prices are down and even though there is a rotation from corn to soy ... no one has told the bugs that,"" said Liveris.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) at the agriculture business rose 40 percent to $222 million.Dow, which has been focusing on more profitable businesses such as packaging, electronics and agriculture, plans to raise $7.5 billion to $8 billion from asset sales by mid-2016.Adjusted EBITDA at the company's performance plastics business, its biggest by sales, rose 6 percent in the quarter. The business has gained from the U.S. shale gas boom that has reduced prices of raw materials such as ethane and propane.But with the 60-percent slump in global crude prices, Dow is now cracking propane in both Europe and United States, Liveris said.""We have flexibility, which is really what helps us make more money even in a low oil price.""Dow averted a proxy fight with activist investor Dan Loeb last November by agreeing to add four independent directors to its board. Loeb wants Dow to spin off its petrochemical business.Dow's adjusted profit was 85 cents per share, well ahead of the average analyst estimate of 69 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(Reporting By Swetha Gopinath and Kanika Sikka in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2015-01-29,MON,"Thu Jan 29, 2015 | 9:42am EST",UPDATE 2-Dow Chemical profit beats Street estimate as farm margins jump,http://www.reuters.com//article/dow-results-idUSL4N0V85ZL20150129?type=companyNews

74,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Feb 23 U.S. farmers nervous that slumping grain prices will crimp profits are increasingly leasing equipment instead of buying it, creating new risks for manufacturers like Deere & Co that could suffer from declining values for leased machinery.Farmers, facing weak markets after years of cashing in on soaring crop prices, are readjusting to a new normal in which they scrutinize every expense, particularly high-ticket items like massive shiny tractors and planters.The shift toward leases is the latest ripple effect from the downturn in the farming economy, which the Agriculture Department predicts will cut net farm income by more than 30 percent this year to $73.6 billion, the lowest since 2007.Deere, the world's largest maker of farm equipment, on Friday reported a 43 percent drop in first-quarter profits due to reduced demand.Last year, the company known for its signature green and yellow vehicles saw a small increase in leases versus purchases, said Tony Huegel, director of investor relations, on a call to discuss earnings. A company spokesman declined to provide data.Deere has said in regulatory filings that its estimates for the value of its leased equipment on the used market, after leases expire, jumped 66 percent in recent years to $2.78 billion as of Oct. 31. An increase in the size of its leased fleet is the main driver of the growth, documents show. Analysts have noted the shift to leasing.""We're seeing some farmers even probably liquidate some of their fleets and move towards that model"" of leasing, Lawrence De Maria, co-head of global industrial infrastructure at William Blair & Co, told Deere executives on the earnings call.Switching to equipment leases allows farmers to take advantage of historically low interest rates and frees up capital for other financial needs, such as buying seed produced by companies like Monsanto Co and DuPont Pioneer, along with fertilizer and paying farmland rents.Equipment leases began gaining in popularity last year, when corn prices fell 6 percent after a decline of nearly 40 percent in 2013, said Andy Huneke, director of leasing and trade credit for AgStar Financial Services ACA. AgStar, one of the nation's Farm Credit associations, works with dealerships for equipment manufacturers, including Deere, Agco Corp and Case IH. At one typical U.S. dealership last year, 17 percent of equipment was leased, up from 6 percent in 2013, Huneke said.""It gives producers a lot more flexibility, where they're not committing long term to equipment during a challenging time,"" he added.Agco Chief Executive Martin Richenhagen has seen an increase in leasing but said interest started years before the recent softening in the farm economy. Case IH, a brand of CNH Industrial, did not respond to a request for comment.Deere's Huegel said there are ""very aggressive leasing programs that are rumored to be in the market,"" but the company is not participating in them.Leases make up only about one-tenth of Deere's equipment portfolio, Chief Financial Officer Rajesh Kalathur said, adding the company will ""continue to manage our residual values very conservatively.""Growth in leased fleets of tractors, combines and other equipment could impact earnings per share in the future, particularly if weakness in the farm economy accelerates the decline in the value of machinery, market analysts said.Deere projects that if future market values for the fleet of equipment it leases to farmers falls by 10 percent from current estimates, it would increase annual depreciation for the fleet by $125 million, according to regulatory filings.That would reduce Deere's earnings per share by close to 25 cents -- a near 5 percent hit to Wall Street's consensus earnings estimate of $5.49 per share for fiscal year 2015, according to JP Morgan.

75,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The world's most widely-used weed killer can ""probably"" cause cancer, the World Health Organization said on Friday.The WHO's cancer arm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), said glyphosate, the active ingredient in the Monsanto Co herbicide Roundup, was ""classified as probably carcinogenic to humans"".It also said there was ""limited evidence"" that glyphosate was carcinogenic in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, said scientific data do not support the conclusions and called on the WHO to hold an urgent meeting to explain the findings.""We don't know how IARC could reach a conclusion that is such a dramatic departure from the conclusion reached by all regulatory agencies around the globe,"" Philip Miller, Monsanto's vice-president of global regulatory affairs, said in a statement. Concerns about glyphosate on food have been a hot topic of debate in the United States recently, and contributed to the passage in Vermont last year of the country's first mandatory labeling law for foods that are genetically modified.   The U.S. government says the herbicide is considered safe. In 2013, Monsanto requested and received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for increased tolerance levels for glyphosate. Glyphosate is mainly used on crops such as corn and soybeans that are genetically modified to survive it. The weed killer has been detected in food, water and in the air after it has been sprayed, according to the report from the WHO agency. However, glyphosate use is generally low in and near homes where the general public would face the greatest risk of exposure, the report said.The evidence for the WHO's conclusion was from studies of exposure, mostly agricultural, in the United States, Canada, and Sweden that were published since 2001. Carcinogens are substances that can lead to cancer under certain levels of exposure.Monsanto's stock price rose 0.3 percent on Friday to $115.75 after setting a four-month low on Thursday.

77,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co, maker of the world's most widely used herbicide, Roundup, wants an international health organization to retract a report linking the chief ingredient in Roundup to cancer.The company said on Tuesday that the report, issued on Friday by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), was biased and contradicts regulatory findings that the ingredient, glyphosate, is safe when used as labeled.A working group of the IARC, based in Lyon, France, said after reviewing scientific literature it was classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""""We question the quality of the assessment,"" Philip Miller, Monsanto vice president of global regulatory affairs, said on Tuesday in an interview. ""The WHO has something to explain.""Monsanto officials have asked to meet with WHO and IARC members, and Miller said the company wants a retraction.A representative of the IARC could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Miller said the company provided scientific data to the IARC showing the safety of glyphosate, but that the agency largely ignored it. Miller said the IARC report should not affect the safety review of glyphosate currently under way by the Environmental Protection Agency.The EPA, which has the power to limit or ban use of glyphosate, said it would look at the WHO report as part of the review process. Farmers have been using glyphosate in increasing quantities since Monsanto in the mid-1990s introduced crops genetically engineered to withstand being sprayed with Roundup herbicide. ""Roundup Ready"" corn, soybeans and other crops are popular because of the ease with which farmers have been able to kill weeds. But weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, leading farmers to use more herbicide.The U.S. Geological Survey estimated agricultural use of glyphosate in 2012, the most recent year available, at more than 283 million pounds, up from 110 million pounds in 2002.

78,"   By Carey Gillam | March 24  March 24 Monsanto Co, maker of the world's most widely used herbicide, Roundup, wants an international health organization to retract a report linking the chief ingredient in Roundup to cancer.The company said on Tuesday that the report, issued on Friday by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), was biased and contradicts regulatory findings that the ingredient, glyphosate, is safe when used as labeled.A working group of the IARC, based in Lyon, France, said after reviewing scientific literature it was classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""""We question the quality of the assessment,"" Philip Miller, Monsanto vice president of global regulatory affairs, said on Tuesday in an interview. ""The WHO has something to explain.""Monsanto officials have asked to meet with WHO and IARC members, and Miller said the company wants a retraction. A representative of the IARC could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.Miller said the company provided scientific data to the IARC showing the safety of glyphosate, but that the agency largely ignored it.Miller said the IARC report should not affect the safety review of glyphosate currently under way by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, which has the power to limit or ban use of glyphosate, said it would look at the WHO report as part of the review process.Farmers have been using glyphosate in increasing quantities since Monsanto in the mid-1990s introduced crops genetically engineered to withstand being sprayed with Roundup herbicide. ""Roundup Ready"" corn, soybeans and other crops are popular because of the ease with which farmers have been able to kill weeds. But weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, leading farmers to use more herbicide.The U.S. Geological Survey estimated agricultural use of glyphosate in 2012, the most recent year available, at more than 283 million pounds, up from 110 million pounds in 2002.The United States and other international regulatory bodies have backed the safety of glyphosate when used as directed, but the IARC report cited studies that raised concerns about glyphosate and impacts on health.Monsanto says such studies are invalid. But critics say they merit attention.""There are a number of independent, published manuscripts that clearly indicate that glyphosate ... can promote cancer and tumor growth,"" said Dave Schubert, head of the cellular neurobiology laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California.

79,"  * Analyst have trouble keeping up with currency fluctuations* Estimating currency impact like ""playing darts with blindfold""* Currency volatility may shave $25 bln off Q1 revenue: FiREappsBy Sinead CarewMarch 31 Wall street analysts may be inadequately accounting for the dollar's sharp rise in the first quarter, setting up a scenario in which some multinationals may miss already low consensus estimates - and their shares sell off as a result.Equity analysts admit they have had trouble keeping up with the dollar's rapid 9 percent rise so far this year. While companies have issued forecasts mentioning ""currency headwinds,"" most Wall St. analysts are not updating their estimates to reflect those rapidly moving exchange rates. That could hurt. North American public companies could give up more than $25 billion in revenues and 7 cents per share in earnings in the first quarter alone because of currency-related volatility, said Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FiREapps, a foreign exchange data analytics firm in Phoenix, Arizona.An early example to watch is Monsanto Co, which reports results on Wednesday, April 1 for its fiscal quarter ended Feb. 28. On Jan 7, before the dollar's biggest moves of the quarter, the company said currency issues would reduce its 2015 earnings by between 15 cents and 20 cents, similar to 2014, when the dollar rose 12.8 percent against a basket of major currencies.Yet only five of 25 analysts covering Monsanto have changed their outlooks for the firm since it closed the books at the end of February, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""The chance of U.S. earnings coming through lower (than estimates) is noticeably high,"" said Chris Faulkner-MacDonagh, market strategist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, a global asset manager with $383.6 billion under management. ""You're going to really feel it this quarter and next.""To be sure, not every analysis that fails to update for the dollar's rise will miss its mark. At Monsanto, for example, other factors such as an improving outlook for corn planting may help offset currency losses, said Paul Massoud, analyst at Stifel.But even some companies that meet expectations find the lack of currency-based analysis disturbing. Investor relations experts at software firm Red Hat Inc told Reuters that consensus forecasts are ""dubious at best"" because of the lack of revisions, and the company's chief financial officer used its March 25 conference call to complain. ""The rapid devaluation of nearly every foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar is not news, yet surprisingly only about 30 percent of the sell-side analysts who follow Red Hat have updated their models at current rates,"" said Charles Peters, the CFO.For their part, analysts say it can be near impossible to quantify currency headwinds if companies give little detail about their hedging strategies or the expected revenue and earnings break-down for different currency regions.""Currency moves faster than the Street's ability to publish updated estimates,"" said Ed Maguire, an analyst at CLSA in New York.He and other analysts, such as Daniel Ives, covering software for FBR Capital Markets in New York, mentioned the challenges to their models posed by the dollar's volatility.""Analysts are trying to play a game of darts with a blindfold depending on the granularity provided by a respective management team,"" said Ives.

Following attempts by the U.S. Treasury to clamp down on such moves, known as tax inversion, Monsanto may have to buy Syngenta in a cash rather than stock transaction and would be unable to redomicile in Switzerland, an industry source said.The St Louis-based group, however, might struggle to finance such a deal, which could cost up to $40 billion, and may need to find a partner to take on Syngenta's U.S. seeds business before launching a takeover bid, another person familiar with industry said.Monsanto foresees strong benefits from a takeover of Syngenta, which makes heavy research and development (R&D) investments in crop technology to increase the average productivity of crops such as corn, soybeans, sugar cane and cereals.Monsanto, meanwhile, is focused on conventional and biotech seeds and last year raised its R&D spending to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion in 2013. ""There is a clear strategic logic to a deal,"" one of the industry sources said. ""Syngenta is the only available target in crop protection. It's no wonder Monsanto continues to circle the company.""A deal would come as prospects for genetically modified (GM) crops are improving in the European Union after a change in its legislation unlocked a stalled approval process. Monsanto owns the only GM product approved for cultivation in the EU, a modified maize.Despite the two companies' cultural affinity, a merger may be challenged by antitrust regulators, primarily in North America, where the two groups are already seen as market leaders in the seeds industry.Syngenta would need to go through a portfolio clean-up and carve out its U.S. corn and soybean businesses, said a banker close to other potential bidders weighing their options, hoping to derail a deal that would reshape the industry. RIVAL SUITORS? German chemicals company BASF and U.S. petrochemicals group Dow Chemical could be among possible bidders for all or parts of Syngenta, one of the sources said.He mentioned Chinese state-owned firm, China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina), as another possible buyer with strong appetite to bulk up its European presence, though Syngenta may be reluctant to cede control to an Asian rival.""No one wants to make the first move,"" the source said. ""Everyone is waiting to see the level of the first bid before reacting.""Syngenta has not been open for any deal, another source said. ""They are a proud Swiss company. They see themselves as market leader and wouldn't agree to anything without a fight.""Spokesmen at BASF and Dow Chemical declined to comment, while representatives of ChemChina were not immediately available for comment.Syngenta, which was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals, also competes with Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.

It is still working on the deal and could decide to increase its initial bid which valued the firm at 449 Swiss francs a share, a 36 percent premium to Thursday's closing price. A deal would give Monsanto, which dominates the market for seeds and genetically-modified crops, access to lucrative crop protection chemicals and create an industry behemoth with combined sales of more than $31 billion.Syngenta rebuffed the cash-and-shares offer, saying it undervalued its prospects and did not fully take into account regulatory risks. But the Swiss firm does not consider the deal dead, according to another source, who is familiar with Syngenta.Monsanto, which earlier confirmed it had made an offer, declined to comment on whether it would improve the bid. A spokesman for Syngenta declined to comment.    Meanwhile, major investors in Syngenta told Reuters that they were confident a deal with Monsanto would come off if the U.S. firm upped its initial $45 billion bid by at least 10 percent. ""Monsanto is likely to come back relatively soon, and not with a modest price,"" said a third source, a banker who has worked with the U.S. company in the past. Monsanto may need to pay a premium of up to 40 percent to Syngenta's shareholders to make the deal attractive, the banker said.To ease antitrust concerns, it may also team up with an industry partner to acquire Syngenta's U.S. seeds business, as the two groups are already seen as market leaders in the American seeds industry, according to the first source close to Monsanto.        ANTITRUST SCRUTINY Monsanto foresees strong benefits from a takeover of Syngenta, which makes heavy research and development (R&D) investments in crop technology to increase the average productivity of crops such as corn, soybeans, sugar cane and cereals.

It's no wonder Monsanto continues to circle the company.""Other large providers of crop chemicals such as BASF , Bayer and Dupont Pioneer are not seen as sellers and have diversified their operations in areas which are less relevant for Monsanto, the banker said.However, Monsanto could seek to strike an alliance with the likes of Bayer and BASF and place a joint bid in an effort to ease ""draconian antitrust scrutiny,"" the banker added.""The production of seeds is a concentrated industry,"" said Andre Barlow, an antitrust expert at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.""Both (companies) overlap in crop protection and seeds and there is a lot of R&D in this space, which would raise additional concerns,"" he said.(Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia in London and Alexander Huebner in Frankfurt; Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze, Diana Bartz, Greg Roumeliotis, Mike Stone, Sybille de La Hamaide, Avik Das; Editing by Keith Weir and Pravin Char)",2015-05-08,MON,"Fri May 8, 2015 | 4:27pm EDT",UPDATE 5-Monsanto set to press ahead with Syngenta takeover plan - source,http://www.reuters.com//article/syngenta-ma-monsanto-idUSL5N0XZ04Q20150508?type=companyNews
89,"   By Katharina Bart and Pamela Barbaglia | ZURICH/LONDON  ZURICH/LONDON Agrochemicals firm Syngenta on Friday rejected a $45 billion takeover offer from Monsanto, saying the offer undervalued the Swiss firm and did not fully take into account regulatory risks.Sources had told Reuters overnight that the two agricultural companies were working with investment banks on a takeover deal that would create an industry behemoth with combined sales of more than $31 billion.But on Friday Syngenta said its board had unanimously rejected a 45-percent cash offer by Monsanto that would value Syngenta at 449 Swiss francs ($486.35) per share.""The offer fundamentally undervalues Syngenta's prospects and underestimates the significant execution risks, including regulatory and public scrutiny at multiple levels in many countries,"" Syngenta said in a statement.Syngenta shares rose 17 percent to 390 Swiss francs by 0715 GMT (3.15 a.m. EDT) on Friday after the bid approach was confirmed.    Swiss company Syngenta had been working with Goldman Sachs to assess the merits of a sale to the world's largest seeds company Monsanto, which is being advised by Morgan Stanley, the sources had earlier told Reuters.    Rumours of talks between the two companies gained pace at the end of April, sending shares in Syngenta to a record high of 351 Swiss francs on May 4. Monsanto, which initially approached Syngenta last year, has long been interested in its Swiss rival and the potential to base itself in Switzerland and benefit from lower taxes, one of the sources told Reuters.Following attempts by the U.S. Treasury to clamp down on such moves, known as tax inversion, Monsanto may have to buy Syngenta in a cash rather than stock transaction and would be unable to redomicile in Switzerland, an industry source said.RIVAL BIDDERS?  Monsanto foresees strong benefits from a takeover of Syngenta, which makes heavy research and development (R&D) investments in crop technology to increase the average productivity of crops such as corn, soybeans, sugar cane and cereals.Monsanto, meanwhile, is focused on conventional and biotech seeds and last year raised its R&D spending to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion in 2013.    ""There is a clear strategic logic to a deal,"" one of the industry sources said. ""Syngenta is the only available target in crop protection. It's no wonder Monsanto continues to circle the company.""    A deal would come as prospects for genetically modified (GM) crops are improving in the European Union after a change in its legislation unlocked a stalled approval process. Monsanto owns the only GM product approved for cultivation in the EU, a modified maize. Despite the two companies' cultural affinity, a merger may be challenged by antitrust regulators, primarily in North America, where the two groups are already seen as market leaders in the seeds industry.German chemicals company BASF and U.S. petrochemicals group Dow Chemical could be among possible bidders for all or parts of Syngenta, one of the sources said.    He mentioned Chinese state-owned firm, China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina), as another possible buyer with strong appetite to bulk up its European presence, though Syngenta may be reluctant to cede control to an Asian rival.     Spokesmen at BASF and Dow Chemical declined to comment, while representatives of ChemChina were not immediately available for comment.    Syngenta, which was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals, also competes with Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.

The St. Louis-based group is after Syngenta SYNN.VX for its industry-leading crop chemicals, driven by the idea that seeds and pesticides will be better sold and developed together.Monsanto produces glyphosate, or Roundup, the world's most widely used broad-spectrum herbicide, and has engineered a range of proprietary crops that resist it.Syngenta closely integrated its seeds and crop chemicals operations in 2011 and Monsanto is expected to unravel some of the main strategic decisions that shaped the group over the last four years - selling off seeds and merging Syngenta's crop chemicals with Monsanto's seeds.Global antitrust authorities are expected to demand remedies to reshape the balance of power in the crop protection industry before any combination is allowed.Syngenta's management will not want to be seen backing a deal that is then shot down by antitrust watchdogs, two industry sources said. Monsanto commands about a quarter of the $40 billion global seeds market while Syngenta's own seeds business has a global market share of 8 percent.    The Swiss group's seeds business could be worth between $6 billion and more than $8 billion, according to analysts. It will have to be sold because authorities are expected to block Monsanto from entrenching its dominance of the U.S. soy and corn seeds market.Monsanto has worked closely with BASF since 2007 when the two companies established a joint venture to develop higher-yielding and stress-tolerant versions of corn, soy, cotton and canola. But Monsanto could also sound out Chinese companies such as China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) for Syngenta's glyphosate-based herbicides, a sector banker said, pointing to products containing glyphosate as likely to raise antitrust concerns.""What Monsanto needs is a stronger antitrust case,"" said another source, who is close to a rival chemicals group monitoring the situation and asked not to be named.The U.S. group has so far been unable to get a firm commitment from prospective buyers which include German pharmaceutical and chemical company Bayer (BAYGn.DE), another banker familiar with the industry said.The bankers said some suitors will likely demand chunks of Monsanto's seeds business as part of any deal. Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Martin Schreiber said Dow Chemical (DOW.N) could be another possible bidder for Syngenta's assets. Liberum analyst Sophie Jourdier said antitrust issues would not be insurmountable but highlighted the risk that U.S. farmers might lobby authorities to consider the combined group's dominance of the broader agricultural inputs market and not look at seeds and chemicals separately, which would put the entire deal at a risk.    Monsanto is looking to a new generation of compounds, such as Syngenta's Acuron herbicide to replicate the success of the glyphosate-centered seeds franchise.Spokesmen at Monsanto, Syngenta, BASF and Bayer declined to comment while representatives at Dow Chemical and ChemChina were not immediately available for comment.

""Our goal is simply to introduce our company to those who may not know us and invite people to engage in a broader conversation about food,"" Monsanto spokeswoman Sara Miller said on Thursday. Monsanto's campaign comes as organic, natural food and wellness companies in the United States are pushing anti-Monsanto messaging this month in a ""social media march"" across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other websites. Activists are also organizing a global ""March Against Monsanto"" for May 23 with events planned in roughly 400 cities throughout North America, Europe, Asia and elsewhere.One key criticism of Monsanto is its promotion of glyphosate, the key weed-killing ingredient in its Roundup herbicide products.Monsanto says the long-used herbicide has proven safe and highly effective. But the World Health Organization's cancer research unit on March 20 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" after some scientific studies raised concerns about the chemical's health and environmental impacts.

105,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co (MON.N), the world's largest seed company, said on Wednesday it plans to divest Syngenta Ag's SYNN.VX seeds and genetic traits businesses as well as some overlapping chemistry assets to win regulatory approval for a takeover of its Swiss rival.""We intend to make this a really clean deal ... really easy to get done,"" Monsanto President Brett Begemann said in a presentation to investors. He said U.S.-based Monsanto is confident it can address all regulatory concerns about a combination of the agrichemical and seed giants.Syngenta already has rejected a $45 billion offer, but Monsanto continues to pursue a deal.""We made an offer,"" said Begemann. ""They rejected that offer, we continue to talk and we'll continue to talk with them and see where we move this along to."" He said if Syngenta continues to reject an offer, Monsanto is ""not precluded from developing relationships with other chemical suppliers.""     Syngenta officials said they did not agree that a sell-off of its seeds business would be sufficient to appease regulators.""The regulatory hurdles are more challenging than implied by the announcement,"" a Syngenta spokesman said in a statement.Syngenta shares rose 4.4 percent to $91.09, while Monsanto shares were off 0.65 percent at $119.13 in midday trade on Wednesday. Acquiring Syngenta is a compelling need for Monsanto, according to those who follow the industry, as the company known best for its Roundup herbicide and biotech seeds faces mounting threats from both regulatory scrutiny and consumer opposition. Though Monsanto has sought to diversify its business, the bulk of its profits are tied to its long-held glyphosate-based Roundup herbicide and genetic alterations to seeds that make crops impervious to glyphosate herbicides.But widespread weed resistance to glyphosate has created problems for farmers, and health concerns about glyphosate and glyphosate-tolerant crops are growing. ""I view the deal as being partly a defensive maneuver around managing the chemical glyphosate exposure,"" Jefferies analyst Laurence Alexander said.  Alexander said glyphosate chemistry and the related crop traits contribute roughly 70 percent of Monsanto earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).If Monsanto takes over Syngenta, it would gain a broad portfolio of fungicides, insecticides and other herbicides.Syngenta's new agrichemical products include one that combats rust disease on soybeans in Brazil, another that uses natural soil bacteria in a seed treatment to fight soybean and sugar beet pests, and a seed treatment that combats pest damage to soybeans, corn and sunflower. Syngenta's agrichemical portfolio brought in more than $11.3 billion in revenue last year, compared to Monsanto's $5.1 billion from its herbicides. Each company saw total revenue exceeding $15 billion in 2014.An industry banker familiar with the situation said developing just one new agrichemical can take a decade or more and cost $200 million to $300 million, and Monsanto needs an entire portfolio of new offerings.""A deal with Syngenta is a necessity for Monsanto's long-term viability as a leading agricultural player,"" said the banker, who did not want to be quoted by name.A merger is expected to face opposition from environmental groups as well as farm lobbies who worry that farmers could end up paying higher prices for agricultural inputs.Monsanto officials say glyphosate remains a key part of the company's future, and that it has signed an expanded commercial licensing and technology agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro Co (SMG.N) to extend its Roundup brand herbicide in the lawn and garden industry, a deal that adds $300 million in gross profit contribution for Monsanto.

Each company saw total revenue exceeding $15 billion in 2014.An industry banker familiar with the situation said developing just one new agrichemical can take a decade or more and cost $200 million to $300 million, and Monsanto needs an entire portfolio of new offerings.""A deal with Syngenta is a necessity for Monsanto's long-term viability as a leading agricultural player,"" said the banker, who did not want to be quoted by name.A merger is expected to face opposition from environmental groups as well as farm lobbies who worry that farmers could end up paying higher prices for agricultural inputs.Monsanto officials say glyphosate remains a key part of the company's future, and that it has signed an expanded commercial licensing and technology agreement with Scotts Miracle-Gro Co  to extend its Roundup brand herbicide in the lawn and garden industry, a deal that adds $300 million in gross profit contribution for Monsanto.

107,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co (MON.N), the world's largest seed company, said on Wednesday it plans to divest all of Syngenta AG's SYNN.VX seeds and traits businesses as well as some overlapping chemistry assets to get regulatory approval for a takeover of its Swiss rival.The $45 billion transaction would create an industry giant with combined sales of over $31 billion before any divestitures and a market capitalization of nearly $100 billion, based on current share prices. It would likely attract scrutiny from regulators in Europe and the United States.Following are brief profiles of the companies:MONSANTO Products: -- Genetically-modified seeds and genetic traits to grow corn, soybeans, cotton and other crops-- Weed killer Roundup, which contains the active ingredient glyphosate, whose use is being reviewed European and U.S. regulators.Recent acquisitions: -- Weather and crop data company Climate Corp, acquired in 2013 for $930 millionLeadership:-- 57-year-old CEO Hugh Grant, named to post in 2013. Grant joined the company in his home country of Scotland in 1981 as a product development representative. -- Grant unveiled a plan last year to double earnings per share by 2019 and raise gross profits by $4 billion. SYNGENTA Products:-- Herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and seed treatments that protect crops from insects, weeds and disease -- Seeds for a variety of crops, some of which are also genetically engineered.-- Syngenta, like Monsanto, is developing crop protection products that use naturally-occurring microbes. It has one such product, targeting a soybean pest, already on the market. Recent acquisitions:-- Two small European seed makers in early 2014, both for undisclosed amountsLeadership:-- CEO Mike Mack is an American appointed in 2008 after starting work at the company in 2002. The 55-year-old has held leadership roles in both Syngenta's seeds unit and its crop protection business.

108,"  ZURICH/FRANKFURT May 20 Swiss crop chemicals maker Syngenta said on Wednesday that Monsanto's  proposal to sell Syngenta's entire seeds business to pave the way for a merger of the two groups would not be enough to allay regulators' concerns about the tie-up.""The Syngenta board's rejection of the Monsanto proposal was made in full knowledge of everything they have announced today. The regulatory hurdles are more challenging than implied by the announcement,"" a Syngenta spokesman said in a statement.  Monsanto earlier said it remained confident it could address regulatory concerns by taking measures including selling all of Syngenta's seeds and traits businesses and ""certain overlapping chemistry assets"".

110,"   By Maximiliano Rizzi | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES May 19 Argentina's Agriculture Ministry is creating a registry that will track the amount of genetically modified soybean seeds reaped from farmers' crops in order to crack down on the illegal resale of seeds developed by Monsanto Co.The ministry on Tuesday maintained its stance that farmers should only have to pay Monsanto once, at the time of purchase, for the seeds, but the registry represents a halfway measure to try and prevent farmers from selling the genetically modified seeds generated from their crops.Monsanto has wanted farmer to pay a royalty if seeds carrying the company's Intacta technology are obtained from prior harvests.Under the new registry, farmers will also have to declare how much of the seeds they replant and how much they kept aside, the ministry said on Tuesday,Monsanto has previously said that the repeated use of seeds without payment each crop cycle denies the company a return on its investment in the Intacta technology, which carries a gene that protects the bean against crop-devouring worms. The company has also said that uncertified seeds are sold on the black market, depriving it of revenue. Monsanto said on Tuesday it welcomed the government's recognition of an underground market place for its seeds.Soy export companies in Argentina began in April inspecting cargoes for bootlegged biotechnology at the behest of the U.S. seed maker, raising raised tensions with farmers who object to Monsanto's demand they pay a royalty on seeds obtained from prior harvests. Argentina's Agricultural Ministry on Tuesday reiterated its opposition to such royalties.""There should not be two property right claims on the same benefit,"" Agriculture Minister Carlos Casamiquela said in a statement.The Agriculture Ministry added that a fund would be created ""to finance the development of biotechnology in the country."" A source in the Agriculture Ministry involved in the negotiations with Monsanto said the country's largest producers would pay contributions to this fund, but stopped short of saying whether the money would ultimately end up with Monsanto.""We are going to create a royalty payment for the biggest producers. They will have to pay for the use of seeds they produce,"" the ministry source said.The ministry's statement said details would be published in the government's official bulletin in the coming days.Argentina's 2014/15 soybean harvest will hit a record 60 million tonnes, the Buenos Aires grains exchange forecasts.

111,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co, the world's largest seed company, is also known for the popularity of its Roundup herbicide, a weedkiller beloved by farmers and homeowners alike for its speed and deadly assault on tough weeds.But Monsanto's ongoing efforts to try to take over Swiss agrochemicals firm Syngenta, a rival whose product portfolio offers an array of agricultural chemicals, could spark a sell-off or de-emphasis of a product line that last year brought in roughly $5 billion, or a third of total revenues for Monsanto, according to industry sources.The key ingredient in Roundup is glyphosate, the world's most widely used weed-killing agent. But glyphosate's heavy use has led to high levels of weed resistance, and Monsanto, Syngenta, and rivals BASF, Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical, and others have been developing alternative herbicide options. ""It makes sense for them to do that, to move away from glyphosate,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Brett Wong. ""They've been doing that internally for awhile. As resistance continues to grow with glyphosate the value of that product is likely going to decline."" Kerry Preete, Monsanto's executive vice president for global strategy told investors at a conference Wednesday that in addition to selling off Syngenta's seeds and traits business to make the deal work, the company was open to selling ""certain overlapping crop protection chemical assets that exist.""Wong said China's state-owned China National Chemical Corp, better known as ChemChina, is a good candidate to purchase Monsanto's Roundup business, but Robert Lu, ChemChina's VP in charge of overseas acquisitions told Reuters on Friday the company was not considering such a bid.While Monsanto is known for Roundup, Syngenta has more than 30 herbicides brands using different active ingredients. Syngenta officials publicly noted concerns with glyphosate and a need for alternatives years ago and the company said last year it was actively pulling back its glyphosate-based Touchdown brand to focus on mixtures that address weed resistance. Monsanto has been moving internally to pivot to a post-glyphosate future for some time, building a biopesticide research pipeline, a farm data business unit and new biotech crops not dependent on glyphosate-tolerant traits.Monsanto introduced Roundup to the world in 1974, and Roundup is the largest crop protection brand globally.  For fiscal 2014, net sales for Monsanto's herbicide unit  grew 13 percent over 2013 with a 5 percent spike in volumes and a 10 percent hike in pricing.

119,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Ludwig Burger | LONDON/FRANKFURT  LONDON/FRANKFURT U.S. agrochemicals firm Monsanto Co and its advisers are working flat out to accommodate Syngenta's qualms about regulatory hurdles to a deal whose perils may well outweigh the rewards.Investment bankers and analysts expect Monsanto to increase its bid by about 10 percent, to just short of 500 SFr, while others say Monsanto cannot afford to be scorned by the target again and would be ready to offer potentially close to 550 SFr.But chances that antitrust regulators will block the deal remain high since the combined entity would control more of 40 percent of the U.S. seeds market.""The deal may not happen,"" said a source close to Syngenta, speaking on condition of anonymity.He mentioned growing scepticism among Syngenta's board that antitrust hurdles could be overcome.Driven by regulatory concerns, Monsanto said on May 20 it would make the deal ""really clean"" and ""really easy to get done,"" in the words of the U.S. group's Chief Operating Officer Brett Begemann, by selling Syngenta's entire seeds business and certain crop chemical assets.Yet the deal is anything but easy.Sources said Monsanto has recently made changes to its team of external legal advisers in an effort to win Syngenta's support, which it needs to follow the deal through.Antitrust advisers of both companies have met twice in New York, the most recent a week ago, a person familiar with the matter said, but it remains unclear whether there has been any agreement. Selling Syngenta's seeds business, which accounts for about 30 percent of the group's sales and which commands an 8 percent global market share, means unravelling Syngenta's ""integrated"" strategy of managing the seeds and pesticides product lines as one, in place since 2011.Syngenta's board, led by Michel Demare, wants a ""safe deal"" and is unwilling to share the risk of the deal falling apart after months of regulatory scrutiny.The Swiss firm, the world's largest agrochemical maker by market share, expects regulators to consider the combined group's dominance of the broader agricultural inputs market and not look just at seeds and chemicals markets separately, said people with knowledge of the industry.Even excluding Syngenta's seeds business, the combined group would still command roughly 30 percent of the global seeds and pesticides market. That figure would be much higher in North and South American markets, where Monsanto generates about 80 percent of the group's revenues. MANAGERS IN A BIND Beside undertaking a radical change of strategy, Syngenta would also face reputational risks as Monsanto's key products are challenged by regulatory scrutiny and a consumer backlash in Monsanto's top market, the United States.Syngenta will find it hard to weigh up any substantial breakup fee, which sources say will be a key element of any bid, against management attention diverted by a futile merger project.But if Syngenta continues to reject Monsanto's or any rival bidders' advances, the onus will be on management to create the same value going it alone. Analysts on average expect earnings per share at the Swiss group, created from the agribusinesses of Novartis and AstraZeneca in 2000, to grow an average 6-7 percent per annum over the next three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.Syngenta's integrated business model of folding seeds into its pesticides business has missed expectations in core markets such as Western Europe and the United States, analysts say.Monsanto first tested Syngenta's appetite for a deal in 2014. Last month it offered to buy the business for $45 billion with a 45-percent cash offer.

Antitrust advisers of both companies have met twice in New York, the most recent a week ago, a person familiar with the matter said, but it remains unclear whether there has been any agreement.Selling Syngenta's seeds business, which accounts for about 30 percent of the group's sales and which commands an 8 percent global market share, means unravelling Syngenta's ""integrated"" strategy of managing the seeds and pesticides product lines as one, in place since 2011.Syngenta's board, led by Michel Demare, wants a ""safe deal"" and is unwilling to share the risk of the deal falling apart after months of regulatory scrutiny.The Swiss firm, the world's largest agrochemical maker by market share, expects regulators to consider the combined group's dominance of the broader agricultural inputs market and not look just at seeds and chemicals markets separately, said people with knowledge of the industry. Even excluding Syngenta's seeds business, the combined group would still command roughly 30 percent of the global seeds and pesticides market. That figure would be much higher in North and South American markets, where Monsanto generates about 80 percent of the group's revenues.MANAGERS IN A BIND Beside undertaking a radical change of strategy, Syngenta would also face reputational risks as Monsanto's key products are challenged by regulatory scrutiny and a consumer backlash in Monsanto's top market, the United States.Syngenta will find it hard to weigh up any substantial breakup fee, which sources say will be a key element of any bid, against management attention diverted by a futile merger project. But if Syngenta continues to reject Monsanto's or any rival bidders' advances, the onus will be on management to create the same value going it alone.Analysts on average expect earnings per share at the Swiss group, created from the agribusinesses of Novartis and AstraZeneca in 2000, to grow an average 6-7 percent per annum over the next three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.Syngenta's integrated business model of folding seeds into its pesticides business has missed expectations in core markets such as Western Europe and the United States, analysts say.Monsanto first tested Syngenta's appetite for a deal in 2014.Last month it offered to buy the business for $45 billion with a 45-percent cash offer.

121,"  German chemicals group BASF SE is considering a potential offer for Syngenta AG, its Swiss rival which has received a $45 billion takeover offer from Monsanto Co, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.BASF is speaking to investment bankers about the possibility of an offer for Syngenta, though it has made no decision and no bid may materialize, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.Syngenta has so far spurned Monsanto's overtures citing antitrust hurdles, though lawyers representing the two companies met last week in New York to discuss whether the regulatory obstacles can be overcome, a separate source said. A BASF bid for Syngenta would also likely face significant antitrust issues. BASF, Syngenta and Monsanto declined to comment. BASF, the world’s largest chemicals group by sales, is also developing improved plant characteristics such as drought tolerability but relies on partners, the biggest being Monsanto, to bring finished seed products to market. Other partners of BASF’s plant biotechnology business, which does not disclose sales, include Bayer AG and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL].BASF’s crop chemicals division with 5.4 billion Euros in 2014 sales, commands about 11 percent of the global crop chemicals market, in third place after Syngenta and Bayer. Any tie-up with the Swiss group would be expected to trigger considerable antitrust related asset sales. BASF is also a potential buyer of Syngenta's seed business should Monsanto agree to a deal with Syngenta and then sell its seed business to allay antitrust concerns, sources have previously told Reuters. The German group, which has oil and gas operations and makes products including coatings, catalytic converters and super absorbers for diapers, trades at about 8.4 times core earnings compared with Syngenta’s multiple of 15.9, according to StarMine data.

Syngenta had earlier rejected a $45 billion offer, but St. Louis-based Monsanto has continued to pursue a deal.  Most recently, Monsanto and its advisers were said to be working to accommodate Syngenta's worries over regulatory hurdles, although a source close to Syngenta indicated that a deal may not happen.  Monsanto's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hugh Grant said in the statement that it is ""disappointing"" that Syngenta has not engaged in substantive talks about the deal, but the company remains committed to ""unlocking the opportunity of this combination"" and pursuing discussions with Syngenta's management and board.  A takeover would create a combined entity with control of more than 40 percent of the U.S. seed market. Syngenta expects regulators to consider the combined group's control in the broader agricultural inputs market, people with knowledge of the industry previously said.

131,"  ZURICH/FRANKFURT Monsanto is hosting meetings across Europe to woo shareholders in Syngenta after the Swiss seed and crop chemical firm rejected a second takeover approach from its U.S. rival on Monday.Monsanto's initial approach was rebuffed by Syngenta in May partly on the grounds it did not address regulatory concerns. The U.S. firm said on Sunday it had offered to pay Syngenta $2 billion if the merger failed to get approval from regulators, but this was rejected as ""wholly inadequate"".The meetings with Syngenta shareholders being arranged by Monsanto are scheduled for this week in London, Zurich and other European cities, according to people familiar with the matter.The U.S. company's Chief Operating Officer Brett Begemann, for instance, is down to meet Syngenta investors at a Zurich luxury hotel on Tuesday, one of the sources said.""The objective is to convince shareholders of Syngenta to pressure the company to negotiate with Monsanto,"" said another source.The person said Monsanto would be hesitant to take an official offer to shareholders sidestepping Syngenta management, because it would have to organize the sale of businesses for anti-trust reasons without having control over the target.Monsanto declined to comment.In a June 6 letter to Syngenta management published by Monsanto, the U.S. company's Chief Executive Hugh Grant said he wanted to ""reinforce my personal disappointment with the pace of progress in what we seek to be a constructive, good-faith process to negotiate a mutually beneficial transaction"". The stock market has been dubious about the likelihood of a deal succeeding, with shares in Syngenta 1.3 percent lower at 407.4 Swiss francs on Monday. The original proposal from Monsanto valued Syngenta shares at 449 francs.""WHOLLY INADEQUATE"" Syngenta was dismissive of Monsanto's second approach which added the $2 billion regulatory break-up fee proposal to the original offer terms. ""Monsanto's second letter represents the same inadequate price, same inadequate regulatory undertakings to close, same regulatory risks and same issues associated with dual headquarters' moves,"" Syngenta said in a statement.""The only change by Monsanto is to add a wholly inadequate reverse regulatory break fee.""Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, faces mounting threats from both regulatory scrutiny and consumer opposition. A drive by the producer of Roundup herbicide to diversify its business is making Syngenta a compelling target, analysts say. If Monsanto takes over Syngenta, it would gain a broad portfolio of fungicides, insecticides and other herbicides.Some investors agreed that Monsanto would need to put more on the table to have any chance of landing Syngenta.""A higher price improves the risk-reward profile for Syngenta shareholders, but I would also like to see greater commitment to regulatory undertakings and a higher break fee,"" said John Melsom, chief investment officer of the event driven hedge fund at London-based Omni Partners.Mark Denham, European equities fund manager at Aviva Investors, highlighted the risk of Monsanto's plan to sell Syngenta's seeds business, which would mean unravel its strategy of managing seeds and pesticides product lines as one.""Let's say we were to go through the deal and it were to fall at the last minute, that would be hugely disruptive for that business model. So I agree that the 2 billion break-up fee does look a little low.""

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras recently announced tax and reforms proposals, which market participants took as a sign of progress. But creditors demanded sweeping changes to the proposals on Wednesday, adding fresh uncertainty to talks aimed at unlocking aid to avert a debt default next week.""The optimism we had about getting close to a deal has faded.

The subdued outlook and lack of progress in Monsanto's pursuit of Syngenta offset news of the company's higher-than-expected profit in the third quarter.""Expectations are being tempered,"" said Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold.Low commodity prices that translate to reduced plantings of specialty seeds, along with weakening foreign currencies, and pricing pressure on Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller from generic offerings were among the headwinds, said Arnold.Monsanto said Wednesday that it was working to reduce its operating spending, potentially by $300 million to $500 million by the end of fiscal 2017.Monsanto Chairman Hugh Grant also emphasized Wednesday that the company still hopes for a friendly deal to acquire Syngenta, but would look at other opportunities if a deal doesn't come together. ""If unsuccessful, this isn't something we're going to turn into an epic struggle,"" Grant said in a conference call with analysts. Syngenta has rebuffed Monsanto's overture, saying the offer is undervalued and that there would be a range of antitrust hurdles. But Grant said the offer already provided a substantial premium and that Syngenta was overstating the risks.Grant said a deal would have to come together in months, not years. He said a combination of the two companies would result in substantial cost savings and revenue growth opportunities.  ""There is mounting frustration on both sides of the Atlantic and puzzlement on why they won't sit down,"" Grant said. ""The two companies together are more valuable than the two alone.""Syngenta and Monsanto are among the world's largest agricultural seed and chemical providers.

153,"   By Carey Gillam | DES MOINES, Iowa July 9  DES MOINES, Iowa July 9 Monsanto President Brett Begemann on Thursday told U.S. soybean growers that if it buys Syngenta, the combined company would be run out of the United States and enough Syngenta operations would be shed to ensure continued market competition for seeds and chemicals.""There will be good competition. Whatever choice was available before the transaction, if there is one, will be available after the transaction,"" Begemann said in a presentation to the United Soybean Board (USB) in Des Moines, Iowa.Begemann's appearance at the United Soybean Board meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, is one of a series of presentations he and Monsanto Chairman Hugh Grant are making to shareholders and farmer groups in Europe and the United States to solicit support for the company's $45 billion offer for Swiss-based Syngenta AG. Grant has even offered to change the Monsanto name from the merged entity as he woos Syngenta shareholders.Monsanto is the world's largest seed company and the maker of Roundup herbicide. Syngenta is also a large seed company and a global leader in the agrichemical/crop protection market.Syngenta has thus far rejected Monsanto's overture, saying it is undervalued, and would be difficult to win regulatory approval due to antitrust hurdles. Some farmer groups have expressed concerns about a tie-up, fearing that putting the seeds they buy as well as a wide range of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides and other inputs in the hands of one provider could limit choices and raise prices.""As a producer you have to have options,"" said David Hartke, a USB director who grows corn and soybeans on a 1,400-acre farm in Illinois. Hartke called it ""nerve-wracking"" to consider how a Syngenta/Monsanto merger might impact the market.Begemann reiterated the company's plan to sell off all of Syngenta's seed operations, and to sell off some agrichemical assets as well, likely Syngenta's Touchdown herbicide. ""We'll likely keep Roundup and sell Touchdown,"" said Begemann.He said Syngenta's seed treatment business was one example of an area where Monsanto currently falls short. ""Our crop protection is limited to basically Roundup and a few other corn grass herbicide products,"" said Begemann. ""We've done some work in soybeans and corn where we have our own seed treatment portfolios but most of those molecules are coming from other companies, including our competitors in the marketplace.""Begemann said that while a merged entity might be domiciled in Europe to make the deal more appealing to European shareholders worried about tax implications, operations would be run out of Monsanto's current home base of St. Louis, Missouri.""It's not going to be run from Europe, it's going to be run from here. Where we're domiciled doesn't mean anything,"" Begemann said.So far, Monsanto's efforts to win shareholder support have met with mixed results, according to a source close to Syngenta.""We don't feel pressure from shareholders to accept Monsanto's proposal,"" the source told Reuters.

The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said in March that it had concluded that the ingredient, called glyphosate, was probably carcinogenic after reviewing a range of scientific literature. [ID:nL2N0WM2I4]Monsanto reacted to the finding by demanding a retraction, labeling the findings by a team of international cancer scientists as ""junk science.""

""This panel is going to review the data thoroughly, and they are going to make their findings available to everyone for review."" Monsanto said the process and the findings will be independent and will be transparent. But the company said it would be involved in providing information and data for the review. Farmers have been using glyphosate in increasing quantities since 	Monsanto in the mid-1990s introduced crops genetically engineered to withstand being sprayed with Roundup.  Genetically modified corn, soybeans and other crops branded as ""Roundup Ready"" are popular because of the ease with which farmers have been able to kill weeds. But weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, prompting farmers to use more herbicide. Agricultural use of glyphosate in 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, was more than 283 million pounds (128 million kg), up from 110 million pounds (50 million kg), in 2002, according to U.S. Geological Survey estimates.The United States and other international regulatory bodies have said glyphosate is safe when used as directed.

158,"   By Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop | LONDON  LONDON A leading Syngenta SYNN.VX investor has criticized the board for excluding all but ""a very small group"" of shareholders from talks that could determine the fate of a $45 billion takeover bid by Monsanto (MON.N), a letter seen by Reuters showed.Henderson Global Investors, Syngenta's 20th biggest shareholder according to Thomson Reuters data, said the Swiss pesticide maker had relied on a YouTube video to communicate with other investors. It said this strategy was ""short-sighted"" and likely to prove ""counter-productive"" in its attempt to thwart its U.S. suitor. ""The most recent proposal by Monsanto is credible and deserves serious consideration. We have met with Monsanto management to discuss their proposals and we have also engaged with other shareholders,"" it said in the letter addressed to Syngenta Chairman Michel Demare. ""Whilst we have not yet taken a firm position to support them, the lack of any opportunity to engage with Syngenta is likely to be an important factor in our decision making.""    Henderson said it had historically enjoyed good relations with Syngenta management.

159,"  * Paulson expected to put pressure on Syngenta board* Size of Paulson stake not disclosed* Syngenta shares gain 2.9 percent   (Adds shares, analyst comment)By Mike StoneJuly 15 Hedge fund Paulson & Co has taken a stake in Syngenta AG and could push for the Swiss pesticide maker's board to accept a takeover offer from U.S. seed company Monsanto Co, people familiar with the matter said.Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, has made a $45 billion bid for Syngenta that the Swiss company rejected. The U.S. company has been hosting meetings with Syngenta's shareholders to win support for its takeover approach. Shares in Syngenta, created from the agribusinesses of Novartis and AstraZeneca in 2000, gained 2.9 percent to 399.20 Swiss francs at 0946 GMT on Wednesday, on speculation that the investment firm headed by billionaire John Paulson could eventually trigger a deal.""It's clear that he wants to put pressure on management. He wants them to open their books,"" said Baader Bank analyst Markus Mayer. ""There already is discontent among investors, but now it's clearly more likely that this will be brought directly to the attention of Syngenta's management.""Paulson is probably best known for betting on a burst in the U.S. housing bubble before the financial market crash of 2007-2009. The people familiar with the matter asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Syngenta, slated to report first-half results on July 23, has said the suitor's proposed 449 francs per share offer undervalued the company, also dismissing as too low the $2 billion Monsanto offered to pay if the merger was agreed but failed to get regulators' approval. It has declined to give rival Monsanto privileged access to business data. Syngenta declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Monsanto in Europe. Officials at Paulson & Co were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. office hours.Paulson & Co was said to have begun amassing its stake in June, one of the people said, but the size of the stake remained unclear. Swiss securities law requires public disclosure of stakes in listed companies of 3 percent and more.Paulson has in the past purchased shares of potential acquisition targets in contested mergers such as that of drug companies Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc, the outcome of which remains unclear.Bloomberg LP previously reported Paulson & Co's stake, citing one source as saying it may put the hedge fund among Syngenta's 20 largest shareholders.

162,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | ST. LOUIS, MO  ST. LOUIS, MO Any hostile bid by Monsanto Co for Swiss rival Syngenta AG is some way off, the U.S. seed company's president and chief operating officer told Reuters, adding he was focused on trying to secure a negotiated deal. Monsanto, the world's biggest seed company, is keen to know more about Syngenta's research capabilities, product liability exposure and the quality of its reported sales, Brett Begemann said in an interview. So taking an offer directly to Syngenta shareholders, without seeing the Swiss company's books, was ""not a very compelling idea,"" Begemann said. ""It’s too early to say (we’ve) ruled it out,"" he added, but any hostile bid was ""a ways out yet.""Syngenta has rejected a $45 billion bid proposal and refused to open its books, despite the offer of a $2 billion cash payment should Monsanto examine its business and decide not to proceed with a transaction.Earlier this month, Monsanto executives toured Europe to make their case to Syngenta investors and have now met ""the vast majority"" of its 20 largest shareholders, Begemann said.Monsanto officials declined to comment on how many of those shareholders had committed to back its pursuit of talks with Syngenta's board. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Henderson Global Investors, a leading Syngenta investor, had criticized the Swiss company's board for excluding all but ""a very small group"" of shareholders from talks that could determine the fate of Monsanto’s proposal. If Monsanto does not merge with Syngenta, its alternative will be to seek out other acquisitions, or establish a series of partnerships or licensing agreements, to help expand its portfolio of herbicides and agricultural chemicals, Begemann said.“There are other alternatives,” Begemann said. For now, he said, Monsanto remained focused on Syngenta and talking with its shareholders.    He declined to say which companies Monsanto might approach either for acquisition or licensing talks, but widespread speculation has focused on Bayer CropScience and BASF as potential partners. Monsanto strongly prefers a negotiated deal with Syngenta, in part because in hostile transactions there is no opportunity to review a company’s financial records or any proprietary material. “You find yourself buying a company blind,” Begemann said.Among other things, Begemann said Monsanto wanted to better understand Syngenta's perspective about potential legal risks and ongoing litigation associated with a strain of Syngenta corn called Agrisure Viptera corn, also known as MIR 162.Last year, global grain handlers Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Archer Daniels Midland Co, along with hundreds of farmers, sued Syngenta for losses allegedly sustained from China's rejection of shipments of U.S. crops that contained Viptera corn. At the time, the trait was approved for planting in the United States but not for import by China, a major corn buyer.“I’d like to better understand the MIR 162 issues, and their perspective of how they’re thinking about it,” Begemann said of Syngenta. He said he and other Monsanto executives were also concerned about whether ongoing cost cuts affected Syngenta's research and development capabilities.“I just want to be confident that what we’ve seen historically from their R&D program and the capabilities they have, that those are still intact,” he said. The lack of inside information in a hostile deal could add risk to Monsanto’s plan to sell Syngenta’s seeds business in order to alleviate anti-trust concerns. “We would be in the position of selling those seed and trait assets blind,” Begemann said.Begemann acknowledged uncertainty about how events will transpire. ""If I knew how the next six weeks, eight weeks played out, and we were in constructive dialogue, then you look at it very differently than if we go another six, eight weeks and we still don’t have any dialogue,"" he said. ""We’ll continue with the conversations we’re having with their shareholders and see where that goes.""  (Reporting by P.J.

Syngenta has rejected the proposal and refused to open its books, despite the offer of a $2 billion cash payment should the transaction fail to win regulatory approval.Adjusted earnings per share from Syngenta fell 6 percent and sales fell 10 percent in the first six months of the year but still exceeded average estimates in a Reuters poll. Adjusted for currency swings, sales rose 3 percent.Syngenta also said it was sticking with profitability targets viewed as ambitious by some analysts, and highlighted the potential of new products in development, such as fungicides for vegetable and cereals farmers, which it believes give it a strong future alone, despite Monsanto’s repeated approaches.""We said no in 2011, we said no in 2012, we said no in 2015.

""Syngenta's earnings announcement confirms it still does not have a long-term vision or plan that would create the same value as Monsanto's very attractive 449 Swiss franc (per share)proposal,"" Monsanto Chairman Hugh Grant said in a statement.""Monsanto remains ready to discuss with Syngenta a combination that would provide highly attractive returns to shareholders ... The ball remains in their court.""Syngenta shares were down 2 percent at 395.40 francs at 1215 GMT (0815 EDT). UNDER PRESSURE Last week, Monsanto said it was a long way off a hostile bid for Syngenta and focused on a negotiated deal.Syngenta is under pressure from some shareholders. Hedge fund Paulson & Co has taken a stake in the Swiss company and could push for it to accept an offer form Monsanto, people familiar with the matter have said, while Henderson, one of Syngenta's top-20 investors has criticized it for limiting communication with all but the biggest investors to a YouTube video. Mack said on Thursday Syngenta's stance was backed by a broad base of important investors.The company also said it was sticking with its target for a 24-26 percent margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over sales for 2018. That is seen by many analyst as a challenge, coming from a 19.3 percent margin in 2014 and a projected 20 percent for this year.Syngenta is trying to catch up with key rivals, mainly through cost cuts in its underperforming seeds business. Its closest peer in pesticides, Bayer's (BAYGn.DE) CropScience unit, had an EBITDA margin of 24.8 percent last year while Monsanto had 29 percent. The Swiss group, the result of Novartis and AstraZeneca pairing up their agribusinesses in 2000, also drew attention to its development effort, predicting $3.6 billion in peak sales from products to be launched by 2022.It even pointed to $3 billion in annual sales potential as far in the future as 2032 from new hybrid wheat seeds it is working on.""I completely reject any suggestion that the company is incomplete in any way,"" Mack told Reuters in a phone interview.MainFirst bank analyst Bernd Pomrehn said the Swiss firm had options. ""These results certainly put Syngenta in a strong position for negotiations on a combination with any other player in the industry. We consequently confirm our ""Outperform"" rating,"" he said.

Hedge fund Paulson & Co has taken a stake in the Swiss company and could push for it to accept an offer form Monsanto, people familiar with the matter have said, while Henderson, one of Syngenta's top-20 investors has criticised it for limiting communication with all but the biggest investors to a YouTube video.Mack said on Thursday Syngenta's stance was backed by a broad base of important investors.The company also said it was sticking with its target for a 24-26 percent margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) over sales for 2018. That is seen by many analyst as a challenge, coming from a 19.3 percent margin in 2014 and a projected 20 percent for this year.Syngenta is trying to catch up with key rivals, mainly through cost cuts in its underperforming seeds business. Its closest peer in pesticides, Bayer's CropScience unit, had an EBITDA margin of 24.8 percent last year while Monsanto had 29 percent.The Swiss group, the result of Novartis and AstraZeneca pairing up their agribusinesses in 2000, also drew attention to its development effort, predicting $3.6 billion in peak sales from products to be launched by 2022.It even pointed to $3 billion in annual sales potential as far in the future as 2032 from new hybrid wheat seeds it is working on.""I completely reject any suggestion that the company is incomplete in any way,"" Mack told Reuters in a phone interview.MainFirst bank analyst Bernd Pomrehn said the Swiss firm had options. ""These results certainly put Syngenta in a strong position for negotiations on a combination with any other player in the industry. We consequently confirm our ""Outperform"" rating,"" he said.

172,"   By Ludwig Burger | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Syngenta SYNN.VX has said a $2 billion break-up fee that unwanted U.S. suitor Monsanto (MON.N) has pledged to pay if its proposed $45 billion merger failed would only apply in limited cases, leaving its shareholders exposed to the bulk of regulatory risks.Swiss Syngenta, the world's largest maker of farming pesticides, told Reuters that based on its legal interpretation of Monsanto's proposal, the payment would only be triggered if so-called horizontal antitrust concerns were to trip up the deal. Monsanto has rejected this interpretation.Antitrust experts refer to horizontal market power in the context of a merger of companies that have substitutable or directly competing products -- the standard case for regulators to intervene.Other concerns could be about vertical market power, when a company merges with a supplier or with a company that refines or distributes its products, or conglomerate market power, which applies to a tie-up between companies with complementary but not interchangeable products, which is the case in seeds and pesticides.Analysts at Bernstein Research and Bank of America Merrill Lynch in separate research notes on Friday cited Syngenta's top management as saying during a dinner with analysts in London that Syngenta shareholders would bear the risk of a deal getting blocked for non-horizontal antitrust reasons.A Syngenta spokesman confirmed the remarks, saying Syngenta's legal team had concluded that Monsanto's proposal did not cover significant regulatory aspects.  Bernstein analyst Jeremy Redenius said that if the interpretation is accurate, it would amount to a ""huge omission"" in the guarantees offered to Syngenta shareholders.""It's surprising that the break-up fee would not cover that,"" he added.Under the merger plan laid out by Monsanto, Syngenta shareholders would retain a stake of about 30 percent of the combined group.In response, a Monsanto spokeswoman told Reuters the break-up fee would apply to any antitrust concerns, and referred to a June 6 letter sent by Monsanto to Syngenta's board of directors, which had been published by Syngenta. ""Our proposal as outlined in our letter is both clear and unequivocal: the $2 billion reverse break-up fee would bepayable by Monsanto if it is unable to obtain necessary global regulatory approvals – horizontal or vertical. This confusion reinforces the need for the companies to sit down for constructive and direct dialogue to advance these conversations,"" the spokeswoman said in a written statement.Monsanto wants to combine its world-leading seeds business with Syngenta's pesticides business, the largest in the industry. Syngenta has rejected the offer as too low and refused to open its books.It has also argued that regulators would consider the merged group's combined market power in seeds and chemicals, because the two industries were gradually converging, as efforts by firms including Bayer (BAYGn.DE), Monsanto and Syngenta show. These companies are trying to become more efficient by developing seeds and pesticides in tandem and by developing sales and distribution strategies that integrate the two product categories.Monsanto has argued that after the proposed sale of Syngenta's seeds business and some overlapping herbicides operations, regulators would not find any loss in head-to-head competition with its rivals.Syngenta has embarked on a number of meetings with analysts and investors after reporting better-than-expected first-half earnings on Thursday last week.At the time, it also reaffirmed its profitability targets, viewed as ambitious by some analysts, and highlighted the potential of new products in development, as it continued to argue its case for a strong future alone.

181,"   By Caroline Stauffer | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Seed giant Monsanto Co.'s unwanted takeover bid with Switzerland's Syngenta AG would face strong resistance in Brazil should it go forward, farmers and lawyers said, a hurdle that could delay or force major concessions to the $45 billion deal.Much of the public focus on the move has revolved around potential antitrust questions in the United States and the European Union, but challenges could also likely arise from emerging agricultural powers such as Brazil and China.In particular Brazil, the second-largest market for Monsanto and Syngenta, is crucial to the future of both companies. As one of the few places in the world with land available to expand farming, Brazil is likely to surpass the United States as the world's top soybean producer in the coming years, while its tropical climate makes it an enormous pesticide consumer.Brazil's regulator, Cade, could spend up to a year, the maximum time allowed, analyzing any potential deal, said Marcio de Carvalho Silveira Bueno, an antitrust lawyer at Sao Paulo-based TozziniFreire Advogados.""Cade has seen big cases, but this would be one of the biggest without a doubt,"" he said. The Brazil office of Syngenta, which is already showing signs of resisting the takeover, called the idea of resolving antitrust issues by selling the seed business and overlapping chemistry assets ""far too simplistic"" and said ""divesting Syngenta's seeds business would dismantle our integrated strategy in emerging markets such as Brazil.""Monsanto spokeswoman Sara Miller said Monsanto expects ""a thorough global regulatory process"" but remains confident in its ability ""to obtain all necessary global regulatory approvals."" Farmers are the company's No. 1 priority, she said in an e-mail. ""It’s impossible to know how far reaching the restrictions would be, but some kind of divestment or other kind of structural remedy will be solicited,” said Antonio Garbelini Junior, partner and antitrust expert at Sao Paulo law firm Siqueira Castro. He noted that all parties affected by the merger would be heard by the regulator.Brazilian farmers are already opposed to the deal, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Brazil's main farmers' lobby Aprosoja in top growing state Mato Grosso. He said the group would closely monitor Cade's evaluation of any merger proposal and didn't rule out additional legal measures. ""It would distort the free market and hurt the sector all around ... we are quite concerned,"" said Tomczyk, a lawyer who has also represented farmers in legal battles against Monsanto over royalty fees.He said the farmers' main concerns are with genetically modified seeds, where Monsanto leads and Syngenta is developing technology in Brazil, and agricultural chemicals, where Syngenta is the leader and Monsanto has some production.Monsanto has committed to divesting all of Syngenta's seeds and traits business, as well as some overlapping chemistry assets. Ratcheting up the pressure to find a deal, which first came to light in late April, is German chemicals group BASF's bid for Syngenta. BASF has already lined up a loan package from large multinational banks, people familiar with the matter said. [ID:nWEB00OQ8] ""AGRICULTURAL MONSTER"" Independent Brazilian lawyers noted that in recent years Cade has approved some large tie-ups affecting agriculture, one of few bright spots in Brazil's stalled economy, but with restrictions.     It approved the takeover of the country's main railway operator, America Latina Logistica SA, by Cosan Logistica SA in February, addressing sugar and grain producer concerns by requiring third party access to Cosan's two dry bulk terminals at Santos port.Cade threatened to derail a 2009 merger between Perdigao and Sadia to create processed foods giant Brasil Foods, now known as BRF SA, but ultimately endorsed a plan requiring the latter to sell 80 percent of Perdigao's production capacity and halve the sale of some of its products.     Vinícius de Carvalho, the president of Cade, declined to comment on whether a Monsanto-Syngenta deal would require antitrust remedies. Syngenta said in a statement to Reuters that combining the two companies would create ""an agricultural monster accounting for more than 50 percent of farmers' seed and crop protection input costs in many countries, including Brazil."" Brazil is particularly known for its regulatory scrutiny and said a combined entity would dominate in corn and soybeans, Syngenta added.""One would expect Cade to scrutinize a proposed combination very, very closely because the combined firm would have tremendous market power,"" Jon Leibowitz, an attorney for Syngenta at Davis Polk and former Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, said in an interview. The two firms would have high combined shares in glyphosate and in two competing herbicides, he added.    Sources familiar with Monsanto said the company's legal focus so far has been on potential antitrust hurdles in the United States and the EU, but that it has legal teams in Brazil, China and elsewhere studying the merger. One source said Monsanto doesn't have enough information, especially from Syngenta, to do much of an evaluation in these markets right now.     (Additional reporting by P.J.

Paulson did not respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by P.J.

188,"   By Mike Stone and P.J. Huffstutter | NEW YORK and CHICAGO  NEW YORK and CHICAGO U.S.-based Monsanto Co (MON.N) sweetened its offer to buy Switzerland's Syngenta AG SYNN.VX, valuing the company at around $47 billion as it tries to lure the Swiss firm to the negotiating table, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.   Monsanto, which wants to combine its world-leading seeds business with Syngenta's own seeds and pesticides, raised its offer to 470 Swiss francs ($501.98) per share from CHF 449 per share, the person said.The increased offer, which sent Syngenta's shares jumping, is aimed at ending the stalemate between the two firms. Syngenta rejected a previous proposal in April and has refused to open its books to its rival. Monsanto's sweetened offer is primarily comprised of an increase to the cash portion of its cash and stock proposal, the person added.Some top investors had been pushing Syngenta to at least sit down with Monsanto and seek a better offer. Cedric Lecamp, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management, the 17th-biggest investor in Syngenta, told Reuters earlier this year he thought a deal could get done above 500 Swiss francs.A Sanford C. Bernstein survey earlier this month of nearly 100 current and former Syngenta investors found that about 92 percent were in favor of a negotiated deal, and would accept a 5 percent higher offer from Monsanto. The average acceptable offer price among the investors was 473 Swiss francs, according to the report.The new offer also includes an increase in the break-up fee to $3 billion from $2 billion if the transaction is blocked by regulators or falls apart for other reasons, the person said. The offer is not necessarily Monsanto's best and final bid, and the door could be open to negotiations if Syngenta engages, according to the person familiar with the matter.A representative for Syngenta, the world's largest maker of farming pesticides, told Reuters on Monday, ""There is no comment to make."" A spokeswoman for Monsanto, the world's leading seed company, declined to comment.The increased offer was first reported by Bloomberg on Monday. SPARRING The value of Monsanto's share and cash offer has been challenged by a souring U.S. agricultural economy and the recent ructions in the global financial markets.Its stock price has fallen nearly 20 percent in the past three months, as grain prices remain soft and U.S. grain exports are hampered by a strong dollar. Its market capitalization is now about $45.6 billion.Syngenta's U.S. listed shares jumped 10 percent on Monday after closing in Zurich at 357.6 Swiss francs a share, putting the company's market value at roughly $35.5 billion. While Monsanto has so far ruled out taking its bid hostile, sparring between the two companies has become increasingly tense with both launching websites promoting their cause and executives from each meeting investors.Monsanto, which courted Syngenta twice previously without success, has argued the deal will make both firms more efficient by developing seeds and pesticides in tandem and integrating sales and distribution strategies for the two product categories.Syngenta has argued the deal faces tough regulatory hurdles that Monsanto has not addressed and that the offer undervalues the company.""We said no in 2011, we said no in 2012, we said no in 2015. What part of no don't they understand?"" Chief Executive Michael Mack told a press conference in July at the group's Basel, Switzerland headquarters.Monsanto has promised to sell off Syngenta's overlapping seed and chemical assets if it wins control of the Swiss company. But the deal could still face regulatory challenges in the U.S., Brazil, China and elsewhere, creating hurdles that could delay or force major concessions to the deal, should it go forward.

HuffstutterNEW YORK and CHICAGO Aug 24 U.S.-based Monsanto Co sweetened its offer to buy Switzerland's Syngenta AG , valuing the company at around $47 billion as it tries to lure the Swiss firm to the negotiating table, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.Monsanto, which wants to combine its world-leading seeds business with Syngenta's own seeds and pesticides, raised its offer to 470 Swiss francs ($501.98) per share from CHF 449 per share, the person said.The increased offer, which sent Syngenta's shares jumping, is aimed at ending the stalemate between the two firms. Syngenta rejected a previous proposal in April and has refused to open its books to its rival.Monsanto's sweetened offer is primarily comprised of an increase to the cash portion of its cash and stock proposal, the person added.Some top investors had been pushing Syngenta to at least sit down with Monsanto and seek a better offer. Cedric Lecamp, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management, the 17th-biggest investor in Syngenta, told Reuters earlier this year he thought a deal could get done above 500 Swiss francs.A Sanford C. Bernstein survey earlier this month of nearly 100 current and former Syngenta investors found that about 92 percent were in favor of a negotiated deal, and would accept a 5 percent higher offer from Monsanto. The average acceptable offer price among the investors was 473 Swiss francs, according to the report. The new offer also includes an increase in the break-up fee to $3 billion from $2 billion if the transaction is blocked by regulators or falls apart for other reasons, the person said.The offer is not necessarily Monsanto's best and final bid, and the door could be open to negotiations if Syngenta engages, according to the person familiar with the matter.A representative for Syngenta, the world's largest maker of farming pesticides, told Reuters on Monday, ""There is no comment to make."" A spokeswoman for Monsanto, the world's leading seed company, declined to comment.The increased offer was first reported by Bloomberg on Monday. SPARRING The value of Monsanto's share and cash offer has been challenged by a souring U.S. agricultural economy and the recent ructions in the global financial markets. Its stock price has fallen nearly 20 percent in the past three months, as grain prices remain soft and U.S. grain exports are hampered by a strong dollar. Its market capitalization is now about $45.6 billion.Syngenta's U.S. listed shares jumped 10 percent on Monday after closing in Zurich at 357.6 Swiss francs a share, putting the company's market value at roughly $35.5 billion.While Monsanto has so far ruled out taking its bid hostile, sparring between the two companies has become increasingly tense with both launching websites promoting their cause and executives from each meeting investors.Monsanto, which courted Syngenta twice previously without success, has argued the deal will make both firms more efficient by developing seeds and pesticides in tandem and integrating sales and distribution strategies for the two product categories.Syngenta has argued the deal faces tough regulatory hurdles that Monsanto has not addressed and that the offer undervalues the company.""We said no in 2011, we said no in 2012, we said no in 2015. What part of no don't they understand?"" Chief Executive Michael Mack told a press conference in July at the group's Basel, Switzerland headquarters.Monsanto has promised to sell off Syngenta's overlapping seed and chemical assets if it wins control of the Swiss company. But the deal could still face regulatory challenges in the U.S., Brazil, China and elsewhere, creating hurdles that could delay or force major concessions to the deal, should it go forward.

199,"   By Carey Gillam  U.S. agribusiness leader Monsanto Co. (MON.N) on Wednesday abandoned pursuit of Swiss rival Syngenta AG SYNN.VX, which had rejected a recently sweetened $47 billion offer.Syngenta shares fell more than 18 percent on the news, while Monsanto shares jumped more than 7 percent.The Swiss agrichemicals group said its board unanimously rejected the offer, which it said ""significantly undervalued the company."" Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, said it still believes in the value of a combination. It will focus on building its core business and meeting long-term growth objectives and also said it was resuming a share buyback program.Some farmers had feared that a combined company would have too much power to raise prices for seeds and herbicides. Both companies had acknowledged that a deal would face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.Syngenta Chairman Michel Demaré said the company had engaged with Monsanto in good faith and would prosper without the deal.""Our board is confident that Syngenta’s long-term prospects remain very attractive with a leading portfolio and a promising pipeline of new products and technologies. We are committed to accelerate shareholder value creation,” he said in a statement.Still, some Syngenta shareholders expressed disappointment over the scuttled deal and questioned Syngenta's ability to improve its financial fortunes.""They have to justify to their shareholders that they can create the value that they have just turned down,"" said Pauline McPherson, co-fund manager of Kames Capital's global equity fund, which holds Syngenta stock.Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co. had taken a stake in Syngenta, had no comment. Monsanto confirmed that it made a revised offer to Syngenta on Aug. 18, raising a previous offer to 470 Swiss francs per share, valuing the company at roughly $47 billion. It also confirmed it raised a reverse break-up fee to $3 billion.Syngenta said the verbal proposal set a price of 245 Swiss francs in cash and a fixed ratio of 2.229 Monsanto shares per Syngenta share. At market close on Aug. 25 this equated to a price of 433 Swiss francs per Syngenta share.Monsanto has said that it wanted to acquire Syngenta primarily to boost its agrichemicals portfolio, which now relies mainly on glyphosate-based herbicides branded as Roundup.Monsanto is known for its development of genetically altered crops, while Syngenta is the world's largest agrichemical company and has a broad portfolio of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and seed treatments used by farmers around the world. The takeover effort became a public spectacle of sorts over recent months as leaders at both companies argued the merits the proposed deal through the media, videos and other online forums.Monsanto's management also tried to force Syngenta's management team to come to the bargaining table by wooing support from Syngenta shareholders, and met with several farm groups to solicit support for the deal.But Syngenta's management team refused repeatedly to open their books and begin negotiations. Syngenta officials insisted that Monsanto was undervaluing the company and that an attempted combination would raise serious antitrust issues in many countries, possibly provoking lengthy and costly delays. Many U.S. farmers had feared a deal would limit their choices and spell higher prices for seeds and chemicals. The National Farmers Union (NFU) said it was relieved that Monsanto dropped its bid.“This is clearly not only good news for family farmers, but for economically competitive markets as well,"" said NFU President Roger Johnson.  Syngenta also said Monsanto had been unclear on key issues including estimated revenue syngergies. Monsanto said it could handle antitrust hurdles, and said it would sell off Syngenta's seeds and genetic traits businesses. The deal would have brought ""substantial synergies"" translating to higher profits for a combined company, Monsanto said. Monsanto officials ""are pretty fed up. There is a complete frustration about the whole pursuit and that is why this is the end of the Syngenta talks,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Brett Wong.Wong said Monsanto would probably stake out another acquisition target soon to boost its crop chemicals holdings.Syngenta slid to 309.50 Swiss francs, while Monsanto shares jumped to $96.77.  Monsanto officials also said they still plan to  deliver on a five-year plan to more than double fiscal-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019.

201,"  (New throughout, adds comment from shareholder and details)By Carey GillamAug 26 U.S. agribusiness leader Monsanto Co.  on Wednesday abandoned pursuit of Swiss rival Syngenta AG, which had rejected a recently sweetened $47 billion offer.Syngenta shares fell more than 18 percent on the news, while Monsanto shares jumped more than 7 percent.The Swiss agrichemicals group said its board unanimously rejected the offer, which it said ""significantly undervalued the company."" Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, said it still believes in the value of a combination. It will focus on building its core business and meeting long-term growth objectives and also said it was resuming a share buyback program.Some farmers had feared that a combined company would have too much power to raise prices for seeds and herbicides. Both companies had acknowledged that a deal would face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.Syngenta Chairman Michel Demaré said the company had engaged with Monsanto in good faith and would prosper without the deal.""Our board is confident that Syngenta's long-term prospects remain very attractive with a leading portfolio and a promising pipeline of new products and technologies. We are committed to accelerate shareholder value creation,"" he said in a statement.Still, some Syngenta shareholders expressed disappointment over the scuttled deal and questioned Syngenta's ability to improve its financial fortunes.""They have to justify to their shareholders that they can create the value that they have just turned down,"" said Pauline McPherson, co-fund manager of Kames Capital's global equity fund, which holds Syngenta stock. Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co. had taken a stake in Syngenta, had no comment.Monsanto confirmed that it made a revised offer to Syngenta on Aug. 18, raising a previous offer to 470 Swiss francs per share, valuing the company at roughly $47 billion. It also confirmed it raised a reverse break-up fee to $3 billion.Syngenta said the verbal proposal set a price of 245 Swiss francs in cash and a fixed ratio of 2.229 Monsanto shares per Syngenta share. At market close on Aug. 25 this equated to a price of 433 Swiss francs per Syngenta share.Monsanto has said that it wanted to acquire Syngenta primarily to boost its agrichemicals portfolio, which now relies mainly on glyphosate-based herbicides branded as Roundup. Monsanto is known for its development of genetically altered crops, while Syngenta is the world's largest agrichemical company and has a broad portfolio of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and seed treatments used by farmers around the world.The takeover effort became a public spectacle of sorts over recent months as leaders at both companies argued the merits the proposed deal through the media, videos and other online forums.Monsanto's management also tried to force Syngenta's management team to come to the bargaining table by wooing support from Syngenta shareholders, and met with several farm groups to solicit support for the deal.But Syngenta's management team refused repeatedly to open their books and begin negotiations. Syngenta officials insisted that Monsanto was undervaluing the company and that an attempted combination would raise serious antitrust issues in many countries, possibly provoking lengthy and costly delays.Many U.S. farmers had feared a deal would limit their choices and spell higher prices for seeds and chemicals. The National Farmers Union (NFU) said it was relieved that Monsanto dropped its bid. ""This is clearly not only good news for family farmers, but for economically competitive markets as well,"" said NFU President Roger Johnson.Syngenta also said Monsanto had been unclear on key issues including estimated revenue syngergies.Monsanto said it could handle antitrust hurdles, and said it would sell off Syngenta's seeds and genetic traits businesses. The deal would have brought ""substantial synergies"" translating to higher profits for a combined company, Monsanto said.Monsanto officials ""are pretty fed up. There is a complete frustration about the whole pursuit and that is why this is the end of the Syngenta talks,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Brett Wong.Wong said Monsanto would probably stake out another acquisition target soon to boost its crop chemicals holdings.Syngenta slid to 309.50 Swiss francs, while Monsanto shares jumped to $96.77.Monsanto officials also said they still plan to  deliver on a five-year plan to more than double fiscal-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019.(Additional reporting by Oliver Hirt in Zurich, Svea Herbst in Boston, Sinead Cruise in London and Mike Stone in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio)",2015-08-26,MON,"Wed Aug 26, 2015 | 3:25pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Monsanto drops pursuit of Swiss agribusiness rival Syngenta,http://www.reuters.com//article/syngenta-ag-ma-monsanto-idUSL1N11116920150826?type=companyNews

""The Syngenta management team lacks a strong supportive base of shareholders, probably because it lacks credibility after a couple of years of weakish operating performance,"" he said.A Sanford C.

Guillaume Delorme, fund manager at top-40 shareholder Oddo Asset Management, told Reuters on Tuesday, ahead of the aborted bid, that Syngenta had yet to propose a convincing plan on how it would reach its 2018 profitability targets. And for a second top-30 investor, Syngenta's management had to explain why they were so reluctant to open their books, given the security of a bumper $3 billion break fee that equated to a year's earnings before interest and tax.""There will be a huge amount of pressure ... whether they care is another matter ...

In the United States, farmers are tightening their budgets and cutting back on everything from equipment to seeds and pesticides.On Wednesday, Monsanto said it was focused on its core businesses and plans to resume its two year, $10 billion share repurchase program, which was put on hold while it was bidding for Syngenta.Monsanto declined to say anything more about its next move, including which companies might be the St. Louis-based firm's next target or how much it would be willing to spend.Monsanto President Brett Begemann had previously told Reuters in an interview that a Syngenta deal was not its only option going forward.""There are other alternatives,"" Begemann told Reuters last month.Speaking at the same time, Michael Frank, vice-president of Monsanto's global commercial business, said Monsanto wanted to expand its portfolio of crop-protection chemicals and seed-treatment products, with Syngenta or without it. ""If we don't acquire Syngenta, we'll still be on Plan A. But there will be a substitute company,"" Frank said. ""It won't be Syngenta. It will be somebody else, or somebodies else.""Or, say analysts, the company could opt to steer away from acquisitions and head into a different direction.""We would expect Monsanto to continue to pursue further agreements in both licensing further molecules and collaborating with partners on joint development of molecular applications that expand Monsanto's product offerings,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts Keith Carpenter and Vitali Savitski wrote in an analyst report Wednesday.For months, some of the major players in the farm chemicals and seeds business have been the subject of restructuring talk. During the summer, BASF SE put together loan guarantees for a prospective bid for Syngenta - but wouldn't submit a bid unless Monsanto made a formal offer. Meanwhile, activist investors in recent years have pushed DuPont Co (DD.N) and Dow Chemical (DOW.N) to divest assets exposed to commodity price swings, in efforts to tap into value not reflected in the parent company stock prices, industry sources said.""Crop chemical assets are undervalued by the market and therefore any crop chemical asset is attractive,"" said Pauline McPherson, co-fund manager of Kames Capital's global equity fund, which holds Syngenta stock.Paulson & Co., the hedge fund headed up by billionaire investor John Paulson, took a stake in Syngenta in July and may have tried to pressure its board to negotiate with Monsanto, according to people familiar with the matter. The Swiss pesticide maker could face further pressure in the coming months from incoming shareholder activists buying stock, said one senior Europe-based investment banker. ""They will be smelling an opportunity,"" said the banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Still, with Monsanto out of the picture, there are no obvious buyers for Syngenta with the possible exception of BASF (BASFn.DE), the German chemicals group, which lined up a loan package earlier this summer from large multinational banks.Sources said BASF made the move, in part, so it could be in a position to block Monsanto from becoming the world's largest agricultural chemical and seeds business.A BASF spokeswoman told Reuters on Wednesday the company could not comment on the market or other companies.

Speaking at the same time, Michael Frank, vice-president of Monsanto's global commercial business, said Monsanto wanted to expand its portfolio of crop-protection chemicals and seed-treatment products, with Syngenta or without it.""If we don't acquire Syngenta, we'll still be on Plan A. But there will be a substitute company,"" Frank said. ""It won't be Syngenta. It will be somebody else, or somebodies else.""Or, say analysts, the company could opt to steer away from acquisitions and head into a different direction.""We would expect Monsanto to continue to pursue further agreements in both licensing further molecules and collaborating with partners on joint development of molecular applications that expand Monsanto's product offerings,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts Keith Carpenter and Vitali Savitski wrote in an analyst report Wednesday. For months, some of the major players in the farm chemicals and seeds business have been the subject of restructuring talk. During the summer, BASF SE put together loan guarantees for a prospective bid for Syngenta - but wouldn't submit a bid unless Monsanto made a formal offer.Meanwhile, activist investors in recent years have pushed DuPont Co and Dow Chemical to divest assets exposed to commodity price swings, in efforts to tap into value not reflected in the parent company stock prices, industry sources said.""Crop chemical assets are undervalued by the market and therefore any crop chemical asset is attractive,"" said Pauline McPherson, co-fund manager of Kames Capital's global equity fund, which holds Syngenta stock. Paulson & Co., the hedge fund headed up by billionaire investor John Paulson, took a stake in Syngenta in July and may have tried to pressure its board to negotiate with Monsanto, according to people familiar with the matter.The Swiss pesticide maker could face further pressure in the coming months from incoming shareholder activists buying stock, said one senior Europe-based investment banker.""They will be smelling an opportunity,"" said the banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Still, with Monsanto out of the picture, there are no obvious buyers for Syngenta with the possible exception of BASF , the German chemicals group, which lined up a loan package earlier this summer from large multinational banks.Sources said BASF made the move, in part, so it could be in a position to block Monsanto from becoming the world's largest agricultural chemical and seeds business.A BASF spokeswoman told Reuters on Wednesday the company could not comment on the market or other companies.

217,"  * Syngenta under pressure to boost stock market value* Launches programme to buy back more than $2 bln in shares* CFO signals vegetable seeds could fetch up to $3.9 bln   (Adds CFO comment, deal value estimates, analyst comment, background)By Ludwig Burger and Michael ShieldsFRANKFURT/ZURICH, Sept 3 Swiss agricultural chemicals group Syngenta AG plans to buy back more than $2 billion worth of stock to boost shareholder returns after rejecting a takeover approach from Monsanto Co, selling its vegetable seeds business to fund the measure.The world's largest pesticides company is under pressure to offer tangible rewards to shareholders after it turned its back last week on a cash-and-shares bid from unwanted U.S. suitor Monsanto worth $47 billion at the time.The Swiss group will part with the most profitable of its seeds businesses, which has gross profit margins of well above 60 percent compared with about 45 percent for all seeds last year, complicating its efforts to widen group margins. However, finance chief John Ramsay said a sale was the best way to exploit the strength of that business.""We're not getting proper recognition either by the market or by Monsanto's approach for the fundamental value of our vegetable seeds assets,"" Ramsay told Reuters.Investors welcomed the share buyback decision, lifting Syngenta shares by 3.6 percent. With no alternative bidder on the horizon, analysts had speculated that a buyback could help to appease investors.Ramsay added there was also little point in combining vegetable seeds with their respective pesticides, as vegetable seeds were mostly grown in greenhouses with pesticides applied more precisely than on crops grown outdoors in fields. One of Syngenta's strategic principles since 2011 has been to develop and sell seeds in tandem with crop chemicals, but investors have been unimpressed by the results.Valuation multiples in vegetable seeds are ""quite easily"" in the 3-6 times sales range, the CFO said. With revenues of $650 million, that implies targeted proceeds of up to $3.9 billion that should easily pay for the share buyback.""Ultimately the two will wash out,"" he said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts put the value of the business at between $1.6 and $2.4 billion. Bernstein analyst Jeremy Redenius estimated it could fetch more than $2.5 billion, adding that pressure from investors would not let up.""The 2018 targets (for the entire group) still look unachievable and selling the highest gross-margin seeds business makes them even more distant,"" he said.The company, however, expressed confidence in its 2018 margin goal of 24-26 percent and reiterated the full-year guidance for 2015 it gave in July.It said that the share repurchase programme, which it described as ""initial"", would commence in the coming weeks, with no change to its policy of increasing dividends .Syngenta's Chairman Michel Demare had promised a thorough review of the company's product lineup after Monsanto walked away, and raised the prospect of taking a major investor on board.CFO Ramsay on Thursday specified that only if efforts to boost profitability and market share failed would the group be keen to seek outside partners.

220,"  (Changes headline, first paragraph to show Monsanto liable, not ""guilty"", in the civil court ruling)LYON/PARIS, France, Sept 10 A French court upheld on Thursday a 2012 ruling in which Monsanto was found to be liable in the chemical poisoning of a French farmer, who says he suffered neurological problems after inhaling the U.S. company's Lasso weedkiller.The decision by an appeal court in Lyon, southeast France, confirmed the initial judgment, the first such case heard in court in France, that ruled Monsanto was ""responsible"" for the intoxication and ordered the company to ""fully compensate"" grain grower Paul Francois.Monsanto's lawyer said the U.S. biotech company would now take the case to France's highest appeal court.Francois, who says he suffered memory loss, headaches and stammering after inhaling Monsanto's Lasso in 2004, blames the agri-business giant for not providing adequate warnings on the product label. Lasso, a pre-emergent soil-applied herbicide that has been used since the 1960s to control grasses and broadleaf weeds in farm fields, was banned in France in 2007 after the product had already been withdrawn in other countries such as Canada, Belgium and Britain.Monsanto phased out of Lasso in the United States several years ago for commercial reasons, its spokesman in France said.Though it once was a top-selling herbicide, it gradually lost popularity, and critics say several studies have shown links to a range of health problems. Monsanto said in a statement after the ruling that experts, including those nominated by the French civil court, had not found any causal link between the alleged accidental exposure and the alleged damages for which Francois claims compensation.The company's lawyer, Jean-Daniel Bretzner, said a potential fine to compensate for the farmer's loss would be decided after the decision of the highest court but he said that in any case it would be very low. ""We are speaking about modest sums of money or even nonexistent. He already received indemnities (by insurers) and there is a fundamental rule that says that one does not compensate twice for a loss, if any,"" Jean-Daniel Bretzner said.Lasso is not Monsanto's sole herbicide accused of being harmful.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in March that glyphosate, the key ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup, one of the world's most used herbicides, was ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""Monsanto reacted to the finding in June by demanding a retraction, labeling the findings by a team of international cancer scientists as ""junk science.""

222,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Carey Gillam | CHICAGO/KANSAS CITY  CHICAGO/KANSAS CITY With its shares trading at three-year-lows since it abandoned a $46 billion bid to buy Syngenta AG SYNN.VX last month, Monsanto Co plans to offer its shareholders a new corporate vision: a future in big data.Monsanto (MON.N) executives are seeking to reposition the company as a business built on data science and services, as well as its traditional chemicals, seeds and genetic traits operations, Chief Technology Officer Robert T. Fraley told Reuters in an interview.“We transformed from industrial chemical company to a biotech company, then to a seeds company,” Fraley said. “Now, we’re transforming again.”Top executives are sketching out plans now, and briefing major shareholders ahead of a wider presentation to investors in November at the company’s St. Louis headquarters, he said.Fraley and others have met with around 200 technology start-ups in recent months and identified five as potential acquisition targets, pending Monsanto’s testing of products they make, company sources said. They declined to identify any possible targets.Monsanto is seeking to provide services, software and hardware tools that use data to help farmers boost their crop yields by understanding what is happening with their fields – including catching shifts in soil chemistry, being more precise with their seed choices and knowing how they should apply pesticides in various conditions.But the agricultural-data field is crowded, Monsanto’s initial moves into the sector have had spotty results and the shifting narrative is a sharp departure from the vision Monsanto described just weeks ago, as it bid for Syngenta. That vision was of a future based on agricultural chemicals and high-tech seeds.The latest pivot comes as longtime profit stalwarts — the weed killer Roundup and the company’s portfolio of genetically modified seeds — both are showing signs of strain. Roundup's longevity as a farmer mainstay has become vulnerable as weed resistance to its active ingredient glyphosate has grown.The company has also been facing increasing regulatory and consumer scrutiny over the safety and environmental impact of  Roundup and Monsanto’s genetically engineered crops that are sprayed with glyphosate. RELUCTANT TO PAY Company officials declined to say how big a part of the firm it expects the data science and services arm to become, or to project sales and profits. It already owns Climate Corp, a weather forecasting firm it acquired in 2013, and Precision Planting, which it bought for $250 million in 2012. The latter makes computer hardware and software tools that seek to help farmers plant seeds in ways that will be most productive for boosting yields.Still, farmers and agribusiness customers so far have been reluctant to pay for data services, particularly with farm income down by half since its 2013 high.Sam Miller, head of agriculture banking at BMO Harris Bank, said farmers, especially large producers, are looking for data services. But the competitive landscape is fierce with Monsanto and rivals Syngenta SYNN.VX, Dupont Pioneer, WinField Solutions and others all fighting to sell data services.The companies “are all talking to these producers about their data services,” Miller said.SELLING ITS VISION As the key ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide – glyphosate - loses effectiveness, the company is ramping up production of the weed killer dicamba to be combined with glyphosate in a new herbicide that can be used with new herbicide-tolerant crops Monsanto is developing. But rival Dow AgroSciences has created alternative herbicide-tolerant crops and a newer herbicide to compete with Monsanto. And the strong dollar and sluggish commodity prices are adding to the company's problems.The company’s 2015 fiscal third quarter showed the strain.During the quarter, Monsanto announced a deal with Scotts Miracle-Gro Co (SMG.N) that boosted profits by $274 million. Without that one-time boost, Monsanto’s crop protection and herbicide segment - dominated by glyphosate - would have seen a 16 percent drop in gross profits, according to regulatory filings.Monsanto has warned that its results for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, which are due to be announced on Oct. 7, will only likely be break-even at best.Overall, Monsanto's strategy is to cut its operational costs, improve its return on existing investments and develop lucrative new product lines. Work already under way includes a focus on tools that improve planting efficiency, sensors that help Monsanto track its seeds shipped in cargo containers, and computer modeling that can speed the rollout of new seeds and traits. PREVIOUS MOVES This is not the first time Monsanto has touted data services. Chief Executive Officer Hugh Grant in 2013 cited a “big change"" and stated data was one of two new platforms for growth, along with biological research in crop protection. Since then, its biologics and data efforts have taken a larger overall bite of Monsanto’s more than $1 billion in annual R&D spending, according to company officials.Securities analysts are skeptical of the shift in vision.""There's a big difference between profits and meaningful profits that will move the needle,” said Matt Arnold, an equity analyst with Edward Jones. “We would not expect [data services] to be a needle mover in the near future.”Climate Corp has shown signs of promise. But so far, there is little evidence that the venture can help Monsanto conquer what the St. Louis company sees as a $20 billion potential market for its Integrated Farming System platform, with its products ranging from precision planting sensors to weather and planting forecasts, wireless data devices and soil analysis services.Climate Corp’s free offerings are used by farmers or consultants on 22 percent of U.S. cropland, or 75 million acres. But only 1.5 percent of U.S. farmland is tilled by people who have agreed to pay for Climate’s data services, Monsanto and Climate officials said.“I like what I see, but I like it more because it’s free,” said Thomas Bonnster, a Midwestern crop farmer, while touring Climate Corp’s booth at a recent farm show near DeKalb, Illinois.Monsanto’s rivals have taken different approaches in their own efforts to earn profits from big data.For example, Bayer CropScience’s digital strategy is focused on applying data to improve agrichemicals products the company sells to farmers, company officials told Reuters.“We make money the old-fashioned way: Selling those (chemical) products,” said Bayer CropScience (BAYE.NS) CEO Jim Blome.

226,"   By Carey Gillam  Monsanto Co, one of the world's largest seed and agrichemical companies, said on Wednesday that it was slashing 2,600 jobs and restructuring operations to cut costs in a slumping commodity market.The company, which said it expected low prices for agricultural products to squeeze results well into 2016, also reported a much wider quarterly loss and gave an outlook below many analysts' expectations. The layoffs would affect 11.6 percent of Monsanto's regular workforce, according to the company. The global restructuring will also include an exit from the sugar cane business and ""streamlining and reprioritizing"" some commercial and research and development work.To try to shore up investor confidence, the company announced a $3 billion accelerated share repurchase program that Chairman Hugh Grant said would be completed in the next six months. Its shares, which fell as much as 4.3 percent early on Wednesday, were nearly unchanged in afternoon trading. Monsanto said it expected to incur restructuring costs of $850 million to $900 million. When completed, the moves should help save as much as $400 million a year. The restructuring, which caps a year when Monsanto's sales fell more than 5 percent, comes during an agricultural slump and a currency collapse in the important Brazilian market. Swiss rival Syngenta AG, which Monsanto had tried to acquire over the summer, has said it is trying to bolster its bottom line by selling a vegetable seed business and undertaking a $2 billion share repurchase. And DuPont, which operates agricultural seed seller DuPont Pioneer, has lowered its profit outlook. Monsanto forecast earnings per share of $5.10 to $5.60 for its new fiscal year, which began on Sept. 1. That is well below many analysts' expectations for more than $6.00.The company said its losses widened to $1.06 a share in the fourth quarter ended on Aug. 31 from 31 cents a year earlier. Sales of corn seeds and traits, Monsanto's key products, fell 5 percent to $598 million in the quarter. And sales at the company's agricultural productivity unit, which includes Roundup herbicide, dropped 12 percent to $1.1 billion.  Despite the bleak results, Grant said the company's fundamentals were strong.Monsanto will remain focused on achieving growth targets for its core seeds and traits business and be ""disciplined"" with its herbicide business, he said. The company said it would still meet its target of more than doubling fiscal 2014 earnings per share, excluding special items, by 2019.Strong demand for corn and soybeans remains a key fundamental for Monsanto, Grant said. The company has particularly high hopes for new soybeans, corn and cotton that can be sprayed with a new combination of Monsanto's glyphosate-based Roundup and dicamba herbicides. The combination is aimed at combating widespread weed resistance to glyphosate. Monsanto still needs final regulatory approvals but said advance orders for ""Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System"" soybeans were on track to sell out by early December, company officials said. It expects pricing at a $5-to-$10-an-acre premium.Monsanto also wants to expand sales of agricultural digital data products designed to help farmers boost crop yields. It will soon start field trials in Brazil, officials said. While farmers have shown interest in the new software and hardware data products offered by Monsanto and several competitors, they have been reluctant to pay for them.At Tuesday's close, the stock had dropped roughly 30 percent from a high set last February, and the company's growth strategy has under intense investor scrutiny after the failed Syngenta takeover attempt.

The firm held town hall gatherings in August in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska seeking clients.Monsanto said the WHO classification is wrong and that glyphosate is among the safest pesticides on the planet.""Glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" company spokeswoman Charla Lord said in an emailed statement. ""The most extensive worldwide human health databases ever compiled on an agricultural product contradict the claims in the suits."" Roundup is used by farmers, homeowners and others around the globe and brought Monsanto $4.8 billion in revenue in its fiscal 2015. But questions about Roundup's safety have dogged the company for years.Attorneys who have filed or are eying litigation cited strong evidence that links glyphosate to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). They said claims will likely be pursued collaboratively as mass tort actions. To find plaintiffs, the Baltimore firm of Saiontz & Kirk  advertises a ""free Roundup lawsuit evaluation"" on its website. The Washington, D.C. firm Schmidt & Clark is doing the same, as are other firms in Texas, Colorado and California.One plaintiff in the Delaware lawsuit, Joselin Barrera, 24, a child of migrant farm workers, claims her non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is related to glyphosate exposure. Elias de la Garza, a former migrant farm worker and landscaper diagnosed with NHL, has a similar claim. Both live in Texas.The third plaintiff is Judi Fitzgerald, a horticultural worker diagnosed with leukemia in 2012. The Virginia resident joined the Delaware case after asking for dismissal of a similar lawsuit initially filed in federal court in New York.Monsanto is also fending off claims over its past manufacturing of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which the WHO classifies as known carcinogens.At least 700 lawsuits against Monsanto or Monsanto-related entities are pending, brought by law firms on behalf of people who claim their non-Hodgkin lymphoma was caused by exposure to PCBs that the company had manufactured until the late 1970s.

237,"   By Karl Plume and P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday signed off on a new genetically modified type of corn developed by Monsanto Co after a review concluded it posed no significant threat to agricultural crops, other plants or the environment.The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced it would deregulate Monsanto's MON 87411 maize, which was developed to protect plants against corn rootworms that can damage roots and drag down grain yields and be tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate.The so-called trait would be inserted into a line of corn seeds' genetic code and could be ""stacked"" with other traits.Glyphosate, which the World Health Organization has said is ""probably"" linked to cancer, is the active weed-killing ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup and other herbicides produced by farm chemical companies. The agency's move is a step in the multiyear process of commercializing genetically engineered seed traits. Other steps include assessments by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and regulators in other countries.The EPA's review is still ongoing. The agency's scientific advisory panel has raised red flags on the issue, however, and criticized weak guidelines in assessing the risks of such biotechnology, said Doug Gurian-Sherman, a senior scientist at advocacy group the Center for Food Safety. Among their concerns: better understanding the impact on pollinators like bees and other insects.Monsanto is planning a full commercial launch of its  SmartStax PRO, a line of products featuring MON 87411 maize, by the end of the decade pending necessary regulatory approvals, the company said in a statement. Separately, APHIS said Friday it was extending the comment period for a genetically-engineered corn trait developed by Syngenta Seeds Inc., a unit of Syngenta AG, for 30 days.Syngenta's genetically engineered MZHG0JG corn is resistant to glyphosate and glufosinate – an herbicide combination the company says will expand options for farmers battling the growing problem of weed resistance, but one that critics say will fuel the problem.As of 2014, there were 14 different glyphosate-resistant weed species and one resistant to glufosinate, according to the USDA's preliminary findings of the Syngenta petition. The risk of herbicide-resistant weed development will be ever present where herbicides are used, the assessment added. Syngenta could not be immediately reached for comment.The regulatory moves come amid increased scrutiny of glyphosate following a report issued in March by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer that said it can ""probably"" cause cancer.Monsanto and others have challenged the report's findings, but the controversy continues.California environmental officials have announced plans to list the herbicide as cancer-causing, a move Monsanto is trying to block. The company recently told state regulators that such actions could be considered illegal because they are not considering valid scientific evidence. Monsanto is also facing mounting litigation over the issue as law firms representing U.S. farm workers have filed lawsuits against the company, accusing it of knowing of the dangers of glyphosate for decades.

Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Agrichemical company Monsanto Co (MON.N) plans to shutter three research and development centers in 2016 with a loss of about 90 jobs, it said on Monday, as it restructures operations to cut costs in a slumping agricultural commodity market.The centers are in Middleton, Wisconsin, and Mystic, Connecticut, both of which focus on seed trait development research, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, which focuses on research on plant screening and phenotyping.The company plans to close the Middleton center in the first half of 2016, and the Mystic and Research Triangle Park locations in the second half of the year.The three research centers currently employ 155 people. A Monsanto spokesman said the company plans to move about 65 of those jobs to its Chesterfield Research Village in the St. Louis, Missouri, area. Workers at the three centers were told about the cuts on Monday. Employees who are offered a job in St. Louis but decide not to take it will be given a severance package, the company said. Other affected workers will also be given a severance package, including pay, extended benefits and educational assistance, among other things.Monsanto, which owns the facilities in Wisconsin and Connecticut, said it is looking for buyers for those properties and for a replacement tenant for its leased property in North Carolina.

244,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Monsanto Co's (MON.N) Climate Corp subsidiary on Tuesday announced a definitive agreement to sell its Precision Planting farm equipment business to Deere & Co (DE.N) for an undisclosed sum.The deal also allows nearly real-time data connections between certain John Deere farm equipment and Climate's farming software programs, Climate FieldView. Climate will keep its digital farming tools. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, the companies said in a statement.John May, Deere's president of agricultural solutions and chief information officer, said in a statement that the agreement would allow the company to extend the range of retrofit options available from Precision Planting to many more products and into new geographies.But the news was met with skepticism and some unease by some farmers who have long used Precision Planting's computer hardware and software tools, and farm equipment hardware, to help them plant seeds in ways that will be most productive for boosting yields. ""Precision Planting was a very innovative company,"" said Steve Pitstick, a corn and soybean farmer who farms about 2,600 acres in Illinois. ""When they were privately held, they were bringing us two or three new things a year that were great. ""When Monsanto bought them, it was one or two new things a year, and nothing that wowed. Now, I don't know what to expect.""For Deere, the news marks the second push into the precision-planting equipment arena this week. On Monday, it announced plans to acquire Monosem, a European family-owned farm equipment manufacturer that specializes in ""precision planters"" designed to increase crop production. But Tuesday's announcement comes at a challenging time for Monsanto, which is restructuring its operations to cut costs in a slumping commodity market. It is also contending with a years-low share price, a failed $46 billion bid to buy Syngenta AG SYNN.VX and an agricultural economy expected to remain sluggish in the coming years.As part of its corporate shift, Monsanto had been seeking to reposition itself as a business built on data science and services, as well as its traditional chemicals, seeds and genetic traits operations. But Tuesday's news could signal that the company is trying to hone its high-tech strategy, industry analysts said.Monsanto made its first major move into high-tech farming when it acquired Precision Planting for $250 million in 2012. The business unit was later rolled under its Climate Corp umbrella.

250,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Monsanto Co (MON.N) expects to lose 23 to 33 cents a share in its fiscal first quarter of 2016, dragged by restructuring costs, pricing pressures on its herbicide glyphosate, slower-than-expected U.S. corn seed sales and a weak currency in Brazil, a top executive said on Tuesday.Monsanto shares slid more than 1 percent. Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of 6 cents per share for the quarter ending Nov. 30.Monsanto now expects to earn $4.00 to $4.66 a share for fiscal 2016 which ends next August, Kerry Preete, executive vice president of global strategy, told investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Chemicals & Agriculture Conference.Last month, the company had forecast fiscal 2016 earnings of $4.44 to $5.01 a share.  Agrochemical and seed companies are struggling to cope with a souring farm economy. A global glut of corn and soybeans has sent prices plummeting, and some of the world's largest agricultural companies have started talking about possible mergers. Monsanto has said it plans to focus on developing its digital farming strategy, and expand the reach and licensing deals of new corn and soybean traits. Still, market analysts and company investors have wondered what acquisition deals, if any, Monsanto might make after this year's failed $45 billion bid to purchase rival Syngenta AG SYNN.VX.Last month, Monsanto announced plans to restructure, slashing about 11.6 percent of its regular work force. On Tuesday, Monsanto said in a statement it would have larger one-time restructuring charges than previously estimated.Now, the company forecasts it will see $200 million in savings from its restructuring. This brings the total amount to $500 million in savings by fiscal 2018, sharply higher than the previous estimate of $275-to-$300 million of savings from restructuring over two years. Monsanto's profit stalwarts, weed killer Roundup and its portfolio of genetically modified seeds, have been showing signs of strain. Roundup's longevity as a farmer mainstay has become vulnerable as weeds have developed resistance to its active ingredient glyphosate.Profits have also been hit by currency pressures as Brazil's real BRL= has weakened against the U.S. dollar. This has reduced the dollar value of Monsanto's licensing fees in that country. Excluding special items Monsanto expects to earn $5.10 to $5.60 per share in fiscal year 2016, unchanged from previous guidance, Preete told investors.A Thomson Reuters poll found analysts are expecting $5.34 a share in adjusted earnings.Monsanto shares fell $1.22, or 1.3 percent, to $93.05 by 12:02 ET.

Syngenta is the No.1 in crop chemicals with a 19 percent market share last year, just ahead of Bayer's (BAYGn.DE) CropScience division with 18 percent.Monsanto is the leader in seeds with a 26 percent market share, followed by Dupont Pioneer's (DD.N) 21 percent.    Demare's remarks echo those of Dupont interim Chief Executive Edward Breen, who said last month the U.S. group was talking to rivals about its agriculture business. That was less than a week after Dow Chemical (DOW.N) announced a strategic review of its farm chemicals and seeds unit, ranked number four and seven respectively, in these industries.The idea of marketing large offerings of seeds and pesticides in a bundle, and even adding computer and satellite-guided farming solutions on top, has been promoted by Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, among others.But the major crop chemicals players, Syngenta and Bayer, have ruled themselves out as easy targets of seed makers.  Syngenta fiercely rebuffed Monsanto's repeated overtures this year, while Bayer on Wednesday reaffirmed it would not part with its crop chemicals business, describing it as an ""integral part"" of the German healthcare group..While some analysts have said weak third-quarter demand from farmers, due to faltering crop and grain prices, has prompted the race to bulk up, Syngenta's Demare told the Financial Times that the current talks were fallout from Monsanto's failed move.""This is the result of the Monsanto approach for Syngenta, which for sure has shaken the whole industry ...

Bumper harvests in the past decade have also reduced the urgency for new technologies. ""Consumer attitude is one thing, but the government attitude is even more important,"" said Huang Dafang, professor at the Biotechnology Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. That leaves firms like Origin with few options to earn revenues from GMO products in China, he added.U.S.-listed Origin has invested more than 300 million yuan ($46.90 million) in biotech since 2005 and, without an opportunity to market its product at home, it now plans to enter the United States in 2016, according to a presentation on the Securities and Exchange Commission website.Entering the U.S. market could take several paths from licensing its technology to setting up a unit there, Origin's chief financial officer, James Chen, told Reuters.But getting a foothold in such a highly competitive market will not be easy, experts warn. TOUGH COMPETITION Origin's most advanced product is a corn with two special characteristics, or ""traits"", that resist pests while top seed firm Monsanto already markets a GMO corn that combines or ""stacks"" as many as eight traits to combat pests.""The only way they might be able to break into the market is if their technology fees are going to be cheaper than Monsanto,"" said Carl Pray, professor at Rutgers University's agricultural, food and resource economics department. Referring to seed firm Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group's  agreement to test its technology in Argentina, Pray said competition was tougher in the United States. ""It's one thing to do this in Argentina, and another to go into the U.S.""But Origin's Chen sees a market for its products there.""We think the technology has a fundamental value. Farmers are looking for alternatives to current products on offer,"" Chen said, adding that Origin would likely seek partners interested in licensing its traits to stack alongside others.The company will meet with potential partners at December's American Seed Trade Association conference in Chicago.But even with a local partner, the Chinese product would need U.S. regulatory approval, which could take years.A successful U.S. test could, however, boost confidence in Chinese technology and pave the way for Beijing to roll out its products. For Origin, it could mean a better valuation than the current $33.9 million.The company, which is looking to sell a majority stake in its conventional seed business, says it is undervalued due to the lack of a viable biotech market.""Our valuation on Nasdaq is much lower than the valuation of seed production companies in China. If we attract investment, our valuation will shoot up,"" said CFO Chen.

Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO With agricultural lenders fearing a tidal wave of farm bankruptcies as soon as this spring, lawyers in the Midwest say they want U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to raise the debt limit for so-called ""family farmer"" bankruptcies.Farmers in states like Illinois, Indiana and Iowa are scrambling to secure lending for the 2016 growing season at a time when prices for their corn have halved from three years ago.Many younger farmers, who tend to be more cash poor than their elders, are expected to be among the hardest hit by stubbornly high input costs such as fertilizer and seeds and souring export sales.As they seek restructuring advice, many are told their debts surpass the $4 million limit for a Chapter 12 family farm bankruptcy, said at least five lawyers who represent either debtors or creditors.They say the $4 million cap is out of touch with most farms' current operating size, often thousands of acres of land paid for by expensive leases and worked using tractors that can cost more than $250,000. ""The debt limit for Chapter 12 bankruptcies should be raised to at least $10 million,"" said Joseph Peiffer, a bankruptcy attorney in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.Chapter 12 was created during the 1980s farm crisis as a simple court procedure to let farmers keep operating while working out a plan to repay lenders. Without a new limit, farmers would be forced into a Chapter 11 filing, which is more costly and onerous.Peiffer has presented his proposal to Grassley, who also heads the Senate Judiciary Committee which oversees bankruptcy law.Grassley's office said the senator had seen a proposal to raise the Chapter 12 debt limit and was still gathering information. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that net farm income plummeted in 2015 to $55.9 billion, down nearly 55 percent from an all-time high in 2013. The final data is set for release next month.The USDA has also forecast that the data will show farmers' debt-to-asset ratio grew to 12.8 in 2015 from 11.3 in 2013.Last spring, some farmers took the extreme step of breaching their lease contracts, reducing how much land they will sow this spring and risking years-long legal battles with landlords.Since then, leading players in the agricultural sector have seen their businesses hurt by lower farm income and grain prices. These include tractor maker Deere & Co, seeds and chemical leader Monsanto Co. and top grain buyer Archer Daniels Midland Co.",2016-01-16,MON,"Fri Jan 15, 2016 | 7:13pm EST","Fearing wave of bankruptcies, U.S. corn belt wants new debt cap",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-agriculture-bankruptcy-idUSL2N15000G?type=companyNews

""The IARC classification of glyphosate is inconsistent with the findings of regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world, and it is not a sound basis for any regulatory action,"" said Phil Miller, Monsanto's vice president of regulatory affairs.Monsanto's lawsuit argues that listing glyphosate under Proposition 65, as the state's law is known, based on IARC's classification cedes regulatory authority to an ""unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable, and foreign body"" that is not subject to oversight by any state or federal entity. Monsanto argues that the lack of oversight violates the company's right to procedural due process under California and U.S. law.A listing would also require Monsanto and others offering products containing glyphosate to provide a ""clear and reasonable warning"" to consumers that the chemical is known to cause cancer, damaging Monsanto's reputation and violating its First Amendment rights, the company said.OEHHA did not comment, as it had not seen the lawsuit. The case is Monsanto Company v.

Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, et al, case number 16-CECG-00183 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Fresno. Roundup is used by farmers around the world, generating Monsanto $4.8 billion in fiscal 2015 revenue. Genetically modified seeds designed to tolerate glyphosate are immensely popular among corn and soybean growers.But questions from environmentalists and other critics about the safety of the herbicide have dogged Monsanto for years.Since IARC's classification last year, Monsanto has been named in numerous lawsuits accusing the company of knowing of the dangers of glyphosate for decades.

286,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Monsanto Co stepped up its defense of a widely used weed killer on Thursday by filing a lawsuit in California seeking to prevent glyphosate, the main ingredient in its Roundup herbicide, from being added to the state's list of known carcinogens.The seed and agrochemicals company said it filed the suit against the state's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and the agency's acting director, Lauren Zeise, in California state court, according to the filing seen by Reuters.California law requires the state to keep a list of cancer-causing chemicals to inform residents of their risks.OEHHA said in September that it planned to add glyphosate to the list after the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified it as a probable human carcinogen last March.Monsanto has disputed assessment, citing decades of studies deeming glyphosate safe, including a 2007 study by OEHHA that concluded the chemical was unlikely to cause cancer.

291,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR), revolving credit facility (RCF) rating, and senior  unsecured note ratings of Monsanto Company (Monsanto) at 'A-'. Fitch has also  affirmed Monsanto's Short-term IDR and commercial paper rating at 'F2'. Roughly  $11.6 billion of obligations, including the $3 billion RCF, are affected by  these actions. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Stable Outlook is based on robust operating performance and expectations for  long-term sales and earnings growth. Fitch expects Monsanto to continue to  generate substantial positive free cash flow in most fiscal years and to  maintain leverage with net debt/EBITDA generally at or below 1.5x and below 2x  in 2016. Leading Market Position: Monsanto's rating reflects its substantive market  positions in corn, soybean, cotton and vegetable seeds and traits, and crop  protection products. The company has R&D-driven expertise in plant biotechnology  and breeding that enables high profit margins and strong cash flows. Monsanto's  portfolio benefits from patent protection for most of its key products which  creates high barriers of entry for new market entrants. Farm Economics Pressured: High stocks following two bumper crop years is  resulting in low prices for corn and soybeans which in turn is resulting in  lower planted acres, crop protection volumes and seed demand. The U.S.D.A.  projects lower planted acres for corn worldwide for the 2015-2016 season to  result in corn prices below $4.00 per bushel. Seasonality: Some customers pre-pay for their products, which combined with the  cyclical nature of farming, results in seasonal working capital swings. The May  31 quarter is the highest working capital use quarter and the August 31 quarter  is the highest free cash flow quarter. Shareholder-Friendly Actions: The rating is constrained by the company's share  buyback programs and sizeable dividends. As of Nov. 30, 2015, the company had  about $1.1 billion remaining under its June 2014, two-year share repurchase  authorization of up to $10 billion. Headline Risks: Consumers are looking to have food products using genetically  modified organisms (GMO) labelled as such, which may cut into demand for  Monsanto's traits. The issue of the use of glyphosate and health risk has  generated recent headlines, despite long-term regulatory approval in a variety  of jurisdictions. Strong Profitability and Free Cash Flow: The company generated $4.3 billion of  operating EBITDA in the LTM period ended Nov. 30, 2015, corresponding to 30% of  net sales. Over the same period, operating cash flow after dividends and capital  expenditures but before acquisitions (FCF) was approximately $1.2 billion. The  company guides to FY2016 FCF (defined as the total of cash flows from operating  activities and investing activities) of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and Fitch  believes FY2016 FCF will be at least $1.1 billion.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Monsanto include: --Crop protection selling prices decline in FY2016 to reflect lower grain prices  and competition offset by improved seed and trait prices and volumes; --Revenue growth beyond FY2016, improving to 6%; --EBITDA margins decline to 28% in FY2016 on lower pricing and macro headwinds,  improving modestly thereafter on greater seeds and traits sales and lower  relative GA and R&D; --Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion per annum on average; --Debt and FCF share repurchases consistent with net debt/EBITDA target of 1.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: --Total Debt/EBITDA declines on a sustained basis below 1.25x. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --Total Debt/EBITDA increases on a sustained basis above 2.25x; --Liquidity, at least $2 billion of which is cash, of less than $3 billion;  --Regulatory actions that threaten Monsanto's business model.  LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: The company maintains high cash balances and high availability  under its $3 billion RCF due March 2020. The revolver has a maximum consolidated  leverage ratio (substantially total debt/EBITDA) of 3.5x. Estimated maturities  of long-term debt over the medium term are $300 million in FY2016, $900 million  in FY2017, $300 million in FY2018 and $800 million in FY2019. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion, of which $970 million was held by  foreign entities as of Nov. 30, 2015. Fitch assumes 35% of the cash at foreign  entities is not readily available to repay debt to represent leakage upon  repatriation.  Higher Near-term Leverage: Fitch expects weaker earnings to result in leverage  temporarily above Monsanto's target capital structure of 1.5x net debt/ongoing  EBITDA but below 2x net debt/EBITDA. Fitch has affirmed Monsanto Company's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured RCF at 'A-';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial Paper at 'F2'.

The rebate program was created to combat rising generic competition which threatened to cut into the company's profits.The agency said that Monsanto had insufficient internal controls to account for millions of dollars in rebates that it offered to retailers and distributors. It ultimately booked a sizeable amount of revenue, but then failed to recognize the costs of the rebate programs on its books.That led the St. Louis-based agriculture company to ""materially"" misstate its consolidated earnings for a three-year period. In a statement, the company said it fully reserved funds to pay for the penalty in fiscal year 2015.Monsanto added that it is not required to change any of its historical statements because the company already previously in 2011 restated its financial statements for fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. ""Public companies need to have robust systems in place to ensure that all of their transactions are recognized in the correct reporting report,"" said Scott Friestad, the SEC's associate director for the enforcement division.In agreeing to settle, Monsanto neither admitted nor denied the charges, which include fraud. The agency did not charge the company with knowingly committing the violations.Monsanto accounting executives Sara Brunnquell, Anthony Hartke and then-sales executive Jonathan Nienas also each agreed to pay penalties.

299,"   By Krishna N. Das | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered an investigation into a Monsanto joint venture, saying it suspected the company had abused its dominant position as a supplier of genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds.The case arose as Indian authorities consider whether to allow commercial growing of the country's first genetically modified food crop, a technology that promises to improve yields but sharply divides public opinion in India.Local farmers and some of their associations, including one affiliated to PM Narendra Modi's ruling party, have complained that Monsanto overprices its products using its position as supplier of GM seeds used in more than 90 percent of the country's cotton cultivation.U.S.-based Monsanto launched a GM cotton variety in India in 2002 despite opposition from critics who questioned its safety, helping transform the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fibre.Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India)(MMB), a joint venture with India's Mahyco, licenses a gene that produces its own pesticide to a number of local seed companies in lieu of royalties and an upfront payment. MMB also markets the seeds directly, though the local licensees together command 90 percent of the market. Acting on a complaint by India's farm ministry that the JV was charging ""unreasonably high"" royalties, CCI said there were indications that MMB had abused its dominant position and asked its director general (DG) to complete an investigation within two months.In its order, the commission also asked the director general to investigate the role of executives in charge of the business if any wrongdoing is found. MMB said it was evaluating the order and its options, but that it was confident it would be found blameless.""MMB conducts its business in an honest, transparent and respectful manner and it remains confident that this will be evident after all relevant information has been considered by the CCI,"" a spokesman said in an email.""MMB has assured the CCI (of) its full cooperation with the investigation and we remain confident that all allegations which the CCI proposes to investigate will be ultimately dismissed in their entirety."" Its counsel told the CCI that the royalty charged from Indian seed companies was the lowest in the world, that prices had come down over time and innovation had to be rewarded.A minister involved in the issue said the government was determined to lower GM cotton prices before it potentially allows the cultivation of GM mustard, final trial reports for which are being examined by experts.

Acting on a complaint by India's farm ministry that the JV was charging ""unreasonably high"" royalties, CCI said there were indications that MMB had abused its dominant position and asked its director general (DG) to complete an investigation within two months.In its order, the commission also asked the director general to investigate the role of executives in charge of the business if any wrongdoing is found. MMB said it was evaluating the order and its options, but that it was confident it would be found blameless.""MMB conducts its business in an honest, transparent and respectful manner and it remains confident that this will be evident after all relevant information has been considered by the CCI,"" a spokesman said in an email.""MMB has assured the CCI (of) its full cooperation with the investigation and we remain confident that all allegations which the CCI proposes to investigate will be ultimately dismissed in their entirety."" Its counsel told the CCI that the royalty charged from Indian seed companies was the lowest in the world, that prices had come down over time and innovation had to be rewarded.A minister involved in the issue said the government was determined to lower GM cotton prices before it potentially allows the cultivation of GM mustard, final trial reports for which are being examined by experts.

Concern lingered that the U.S. economy was on a weaker footing than thought, but recent data including a better-than-expected reading on private sector job creation last month has helped dispel those concerns.The improvement in U.S. economic data, including manufacturing, construction spending and auto sales earlier this week, rekindled expectations that the Federal Reserve could raise rates at least once later this year, giving support to bank shares.""I've been encouraged by the economic numbers,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, citing jobs and manufacturing data. Crude prices hovered in and out of negative territory with U.S. crude reaching $35.17 at one point, its highest since Jan. 6.""There's been so much pessimism around energy,"" said Bradshaw, ""and in spite of that oil is near $35. When crude moves up it is telling the world, and particularly the U.S., is not going through a recession.""The Dow Jones industrial average was up 8.04 points, or 0.05 percent, to 16,873.12, the S&P 500 gained 4.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,982.4 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 2.12 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,691.71. The U.S. economy continues to show signs of recovery even as China and the euro zone continue to look for support from their central banks.The materials sector was the worst performer on the S&P 500, weighed by a more than 8-percent drop in Monsanto shares  after the agricultural products maker cut its earnings guidance.The energy sector rose 2 percent and financials  added 0.6 percent.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,872 to 1,146, and by 1,728 to 1,066 on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 24 new lows.

308,"   By Barbara Lewis | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS The European Union is expected to extend approval next week for weed-killer ingredient glyphosate, used in many herbicides including Monsanto's Roundup, despite a dispute between EU and U.N. agencies over whether it causes cancer.Experts from all 28 member states will hold a closed-door meeting on Monday and Tuesday in Brussels and appear set to endorse a European Commission proposal to extend authorization of glyphosate for 15 years until 2031.Two EU sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected approval, preventing a legal vacuum when the existing authorization lapses at the end of June.Another diplomat said at least one big member state was undecided, but a block on approval was unlikely.Ahead of the meeting, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which advises EU policymakers, issued an opinion that glyphosate was unlikely to cause cancer. That conclusion was at odds with the view of the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and the difference between them has stoked a fierce debate. Environmental campaigners want a ban. In a statement,  Greenpeace said governments should oppose renewing the EU license for glyphosate ""as long as uncertainty remains over the risks it poses"".A statement on the website of Monsanto, which calls Roundup the flagship of its agro-chemicals business, said it strongly disagrees with IARC's classification of glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"". It has filed a legal challenge in the United States. It said it did not wish to comment further before next week's EU meeting.Highlighting the sensitivity of the issue, a German environmental group said last week it had found traces of glyphosate in the country's 14 most popular beers. A German brewers' association said the findings, based on a small number of samples, were not credible.The European Commission said it would seek to identify whether some products should be banned because of the substances they combine with glyphosate, which could add to risks.  It said ""a list of banned co-formulants"" could probably be agreed this year.The EFSA study focused on glyphosate as a single active substance. Once glyphosate is authorized at EU level, it is up to national authorities to grant or refuse authorization of pesticide products that contain it at national level.

316,"  * U.N. and EU bodies disagree on safety* Monsanto rejects U.N. body's finding on cancer risk   (Updates with confirmation, comment)By Barbara LewisBRUSSELS, March 8 The European Union on Tuesday put off a decision on whether to extend approval for weedkiller ingredient glyphosate, used in herbicides including Monsanto's Roundup, after a dispute between EU and U.N. agencies over whether it causes cancer.Experts from all 28 member states attended a closed-door meeting on Monday and Tuesday in Brussels, which had been expected to endorse a European Commission proposal to extend authorisation of glyphosate for 15 years until 2031, EU diplomats said. Commission sources said the meeting stopped short of a vote  and the discussion would continue at another session of the committee on May 18-19, or possibly before.Already on Monday, it had become clear a decision was very unlikely after France said last week it was opposed to approval of glyphosate and diplomats said the EU's biggest power, Germany, planned to abstain from any vote. The Commission has said it needs a decision over the coming weeks to prevent a legal vacuum when an existing approval expires at the end of June.Before the meeting, the European Food Safety Authority, which advises EU policymakers, issued an opinion that glyphosate was unlikely to cause cancer.

317,"   By Ludwig Burger and Mike Stone  Monsanto Co (MON.N), the world's largest seed producer, has approached Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) to express interest in its crop science unit, including a potential acquisition worth more than $30 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The move underscores Monsanto's unabated expansion drive after Switzerland's Syngenta AG (SYNN.S) rejected its takeover approaches last year and agreed earlier this year to be acquired by ChemChina for $43 billion.It also illustrates Monsanto's determination to further consolidate its industry, as the global seed and crop protection market continues to suffer from high inventories and low prices for agricultural commodities.Monsanto executives met in Chicago recently to discuss the company's interest in Bayer's agricultural assets, the sources said this week. Monsanto sees valuable synergies between its seed business and the crop protection assets of Bayer, the sources added. Among the possibilities discussed were an outright acquisition of the crop science unit and a joint venture or other type of partnership between the two companies, the sources said. These talks were preliminary, and another meeting between the two sides has been scheduled for April, the sources added.Bayer has been holding the talks with Monsanto to probe its interest, the sources said. The German company currently has no plans to actively pursue a sale of its crop science division, the sources added.The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions were confidential. Monsanto and Bayer declined to comment. Bayer’s crop science division has businesses in seeds, crop protection and non-agricultural pest control. It had sales of 10.4 billion euros ($11.7 billion) in 2015 and posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 2.42 billion euros. Bayer is the second biggest player in crop chemicals, with an 18 percent market share, just behind Syngenta, which has a 19 percent share. Monsanto is a leader in seeds, with a 26 percent market share, followed by Dupont (DD.N), with 21 percent. DuPont agreed last year to merge with Dow Chemical (DOW.N). Bayer said last year it planned to keep its crop chemicals business, saying it was an ""integral part"" of the German healthcare group. It has said it aims to concentrate on its core brands in crop protection. It also wants to strengthen its position in its established crops  - cotton, oilseed rape/canola, rice and vegetables – and to establish competitive positions in soybeans and wheat.

325,"  PARIS France's health and safety agency is poised to ban weedkillers that combine chemicals glyphosate and tallowamine because of concerns over possible health risks, it said Friday.The ANSES agency sent a letter this week to manufacturers informing them that it intends to withdraw the authorization for such products, Francoise Weber, the ANSES deputy director-general, told Reuters.The agency had reviewed products combining glyphosate and tallowamine after conclusions published in November by the European Food Safety Agency suggested there were greater potential health risks in combined use rather than when glyphosate is used alone, she said.""It is not possible to guarantee that compositions containing glyphosate and tallowamine do not entail negative effects on human health,"" Weber said.Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller, has stirred fierce debate over the past year since a World Health Organisation body classified it as a probable carcinogenic, and EU countries are discussing whether or not to extend its EU-wide license.France's environment minister has been pushing for an EU-wide ban on glyphosate-based products and is also supporting legislation that would outlaw a type of pesticide blamed for harming bees. Tallowamine is used in weedkillers to allow them to be absorbed effectively by plants.It is combined with glyphosate in many weedkillers but a large number of glyphosate products without tallowamine are available in France, Weber said.Glyphosate and tallowamine combinations were previously withdrawn voluntarily from the German market by manufacturers, she added. Monsanto said the commercial impact would be ""minimal"" as it had already shifted away from using tallowamine.""The elimination of glyphosate sales in France by itself should not have a material effect on Monsanto, maybe $20 million of earnings impact. If it spreads to the rest of Europe the impact would be greater though, as Europe is a premium market;  could lead to up to $100 million of earnings impact,"" Bernstein analyst Jonas Oxgaard said in an email to Reuters. In an emailed statement, Monsanto described the glyphosate debate in Europe as ""political"" and said that tallowamine-based products ""do not pose an imminent risk for human health when used according to instructions.""Arguments over glyphosate have divided scientists and pitched environmental protection groups against chemical companies and farmers who say there are no viable alternatives.A final decision by ANSES on withdrawing glyphosate-tallowamine mixtures would take at least several weeks because the agency must first consider comments by the manufacturers, who have two weeks to submit arguments, Weber said.

Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday pulled a report offline that concluded glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans, saying the document was inadvertently published and the agency had not finished its review of the chemical, which is the key ingredient in Monsanto's herbicides.The 86-page report, seen by Reuters and published on Friday on the regulations.gov website that the EPA manages, was from the EPA's cancer assessment review committee (CARC). It found that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the world's mostly widely used weedkiller, was ""not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.""The EPA took down the report and other documents on Monday afternoon, saying it did so ""because our assessment is not final,"" in an emailed statement to Reuters. The agency said the documents were ""preliminary"" and that they were published ""inadvertently.""But a covering memo that was part of the documents seen by Reuters described the report as the committee's ""final Cancer Assessment Document."" ""FINAL"" was printed on each page of the report, which was dated Oct. 1, 2015.The EPA declined to comment on whether the report, or the 13 other documents that were also published and subsequently taken down on Monday, indicate whether the agency ultimately will conclude that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.Glyphosate has been the subject of controversy over whether it is cancer-causing. Last year, the World Health Organization's cancer arm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" Other government authorities have issued a variety of opinions on glyphosate. The European Food Safety Authority last November said glyphosate was ""unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.""MONSANTO: REPORT ""CLEARLY LABELED"" Monsanto Co, whose Roundup herbicide line uses glyphosate as a key active ingredient, responded to the EPA's document, saying in a statement on Monday that the agency had issued an ""official classification"" that glyphosate was not likely to be carcinogenic. Monsanto said the document was ""clearly labeled and signed as the final report of EPA's Cancer Assessment Review Committee,"" in an email to Reuters on Monday after the documents had been removed.The EPA said its documents are part of its broader registration review, which began in 2009, of glyphosate and its potential human health and environmental risks.""EPA has not completed our cancer review,"" the EPA told Reuters in a statement. ""We will look at the work of other governments as well as work by (the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services') Agricultural Health Study as we move to make a decision on glyphosate."" The EPA said its assessment will be peer reviewed and completed by the end of 2016.A reporter with Bloomberg BNA, a subsidiary of Bloomberg, had posted a link to the documents on Twitter on Monday morning. The EPA documents, while available, sparked strong reactions from critics of the world's most widely used weed killer. ""All they're doing is reviewing studies that are funded by the industry,"" said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental and public health advocacy group.In addition to the cancer assessment report, the documents that the EPA removed included summaries of three 2015 meetings between EPA officials and Monsanto; preliminary ecological risk assessments of glyphosate on milkweed, which is key to the health of monarch butterflies; a report discussing possible label amendments to two of Monsanto's Roundup products when used on oilseeds, fruit and other crops; and a six-slide Monsanto presentation to the EPA officials.

336,"  (Adds farmer comment, details of Monsanto's new technology, crop forecast)By Hugh BronsteinBUENOS AIRES May 17 Monsanto Co said on Tuesday it would suspend future soybean technologies in Argentina, a move that could limit output of the country's main cash crop, after a disagreement with the government over inspections of genetically modified soybeans.The dispute blew up after Monsanto asked Argentine exporters to inspect soybean shipments to ensure growers had paid royalties for using the company's products. The Argentine government told the world's largest seed company that such inspections must first be approved by the government.The U.S. company issued a statement saying it was ""disappointed"" that talks with the Argentine government had not yielded an agreement on the inspection issue.""The company plans to take measures to protect its current assets and will suspend launching any future soybean technologies in the country,"" Monsanto said in the statement. Argentina, the world's No. 1 exporter of soymeal livestock feed, relies heavily on Monsanto's genetic technology to produce soybeans.A spokeswoman for Argentina's agriculture ministry said the country's rules regarding soybean inspections were designed ""to guarantee free trade and property rights.""""If they (Monsanto) feel threatened, that's their prerogative,"" said the ministry spokeswoman. Soy farming has spread rapidly across Argentina's Pampas  agricultural belt over the last 20 years, thanks in large part to the country's embrace of genetically modified seeds. The technology makes soy plants resistant to glyphosate herbicide, which kills most of the weeds that grow in Argentina.The pullout by Monsanto leaves Argentine growers without the company's new ""Xtend"" technology, aimed at increasing soy yields and controlling glyphosate-resistant broad leaf weeds. Pedro Vigneau, who farms 1,500 hectares in the bread basket province of Buenos Aires, said no other company offered the same technology that Xtend would provide. ""This is not good news for us,"" said Vigneau. ""We need the company and the government to reach an agreement in order to obtain the best technology we can get.""Argentina last month issued a decree saying the government must authorize any grain inspection, dealing a blow to Monsanto's push for exporters to check cargoes.Monsanto has pressured shipping companies to notify it when crops grown with its technology are slated for export without documentation showing royalties had been paid.Argentina, the world's third biggest exporter of raw soybeans, is expected by the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange to harvest a 56-million-tonne crop this year.

340,"   By Hugh Bronstein | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES May 18 Argentine soy growers urged the country's government on Wednesday to strike a deal with Monsanto Co, a day after the U.S. seed company suspended the launch of a new variety of soybean seed that would help ensure the country's international competitiveness.Virtually all the soy grown in the South American grains powerhouse is based on genetically modified (GMO) seeds. Since the start of harvest in March, Monsanto and the Argentine government have been at loggerheads over the best way to inspect soy cargoes to ensure royalties are paid on Monsanto's Intacta beans.The government says Monsanto has yet to submit a proposal for an inspection system. The company says it is waiting for the government to outline its inspection requirements.The conflict is playing out six months into the government of Mauricio Macri, who won the presidency on promises of freeing the economy from years of heavy-handed trade and currency controls.The dispute escalated on Tuesday when Monsanto said it would not sell its newest soy technology, known as Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, in Argentina, a move that could limit output of the country's main cash crop. Argentina is the world's No. 3 soybean exporter and No. 1 supplier of soymeal livestock feed. ""The government needs to strike a deal, because not having Xtend is going to be terrible for the country,"" said Ruben Sgalippa, owner of a family farm in the bread basket province of Buenos Aires. ""If it costs a lot it costs a lot, but this kind of technology is what we need to keep innovating and growing.""Monsanto has agreements with export companies and other grains handlers to inspect export cargos.But farmers and the government both object to private sector actors playing such an enforcement role. ""It will take more time to find a solution. Remember this is happening during a major transition in government,"" said Juan Casanas, a grower in Tucuman province and representative from the Macri-allied Radical party in the lower house of Congress. ""It seems that Monsanto is trying to bully its way to a solution.""A spokeswoman from the company declined to comment, but Brett Begemann, the company's president, said at BMO Capital Markets' Annual Farm to Market Conference in New York on Wednesday that company officials would ""continue to work with"" farmers and government officials in Argentina. ""If there's a country that does not want to pay for the IP [intellectual property], we're not going to take our technology there,"" he added.Soy farming has spread rapidly across Argentina's Pampas agricultural belt over the last 20 years, thanks in large part to the country's embrace of genetically modified seeds. The technology makes soy plants resistant to glyphosate herbicide, which kills most of the weeds that grow in Argentina.Monsanto's withdrawal leaves Argentine growers without the company's new ""Xtend"" technology, aimed at increasing soy yields and controlling glyphosate-resistant broad leaf weeds.""There are other methods of killing broad leaf weeds, but they are more expensive, and that's what would put us at a disadvantage against soy farmers in countries that have Xtend,"" said Ricardo Bergman, who manages thousands of hectares of Buenos Aires farmland. ""Competitiveness is about technology.""The onus is on both Monsanto and the government to come up with an inspection system, said another Buenos Aires farmer David Hughes. ""It should be the government or an independent body rather than a private company. Not Monsanto or anyone else.""   (Reporting by Hugh Bronstein; additional reporting by P.J.

Sources said Bayer would pay Monsanto shareholders with cash and stock, though the offer price could not be learned.Bernstein Research analyst Jeremy Redenius estimated the price at 41.9 billion euros ($47 billion), plus 6.7 billion euros in assumed debt. He said Bayer might need a 27 billion euro share issue to help to fund the purchase.Bayer would probably need to pay 14-16 times Monsanto's core earnings, implying a takeover price including debt of 57 billion euros ($63.87 billion) to 65 billion euros ($72.83 billion), according to Citi analysts.Bayer shares slid 8 percent to a 2-1/2 year low of 88.39 euros as some investors worried about the potential cost.Monsanto was up 4.7 percent at $101.77 in afternoon trading in New York. The $42 billion market capitalization of Monsanto meant the deal would likely eclipse ChemChina's planned acquisition of Swiss agrichemicals company Syngenta and could face U.S. antitrust hurdles. Monsanto itself pursued Syngenta last year.Monsanto said its board was reviewing the proposal, which would be subject to due diligence, regulatory approvals and other conditions. There was no assurance that any transaction would take place, it added.UBS Global Asset Management, which Reuters data showed is among Bayer's 30 biggest investors, said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the burden on Bayer's finances from a takeover. It preferred that the companies agree on a joint venture or use prices before the deal was announced.Deutsche Bank analysts said a deal could shift Bayer's center of gravity to agriculture, accounting for about 55 percent of core earnings, up from roughly 28 percent last year, excluding the Covestro chemicals business Bayer plans to sell.Bayer's healthcare-focused investor base would be unhappy about the shift, the bank said. PRICE ESTIMATES Bayer, with a market value of $90 billion, said the merger would create ""a leading integrated agriculture business,"" referring to Bayer's push for more synergies by combining the development and sale of seeds and crop protection chemicals.Most major agrichemical companies are aiming to genetically engineer more robust plants and custom-build chemicals to go with them - selling them together to farmers struggling with low commodity prices.A sale of Bayer's stake in foam chemicals maker Covestro  could bring about 4 billion euros, while its animal health business, which Bayer might put on the block, could fetch up to 7 billion euros.The proposal comes as U.S. regulators review ChemChina's deal for Syngenta on concerns about the security of the U.S. food supply. Any marriage between Bayer and Monsanto could raise U.S. antitrust concerns due to an overlap in the seeds business, particularly in soybeans, cotton and canola, according to antitrust experts.Bayer's proposal, which would be its largest and dwarf the 17 billion euro takeover of drugmaker Schering in 2006, comes less than three weeks after Werner Baumann took over as Bayer chief executive officer, a sign of the power base he built in his previous role as strategy chief.Bayer, the inventor of aspirin and maker of Yasmin birth control pills, is more diversified than Syngenta or Monsanto, selling cancer drugs, flea and tick collars for pets and Coppertone sunscreen. A deal with Monsanto could lead to a breakup of the group, according to analysts.Bayer's crop science division has businesses in seeds, crop protection and non-agricultural pest control, potentially complementing Monsanto's seeds assets.BAYER, BASF AMBITIONS Both Bayer and German rival BASF SE have been looking to build scale in agrichemicals.Bayer is ranked No. 2 in crop chemicals, with an 18 percent market share, just behind Syngenta at 19 percent, according to industry data.Monsanto leads in seeds, with a 26 percent market share, followed by DuPont with 21 percent. DuPont agreed last year to merge with Dow Chemical Co.

347,"  * Glyphosate widely used in farming pesticides* If no deal by June 30, product to be phased out of market* Debate focuses on scientific evidence over health risks   (Adds reactions from industry, green groups)By Alissa de CarbonnelBRUSSELS, May 19 The European Union on Thursday delayed a vote on renewing sales approval for the pesticide glyphosate, used in Monsanto's weed-killer Roundup, amid a transatlantic row over whether it may cause cancer.Experts from the EU's 28 nations had been due to vote on a proposal to extend by nine years licensing of the herbicide, widely used by farmers and gardeners.EU sources said the delay was due to opposition in France and Germany, which have big farming and chemicals industries.Without their support, the European Commission lacks the majority it needs for a binding vote: ""Since it was obvious that no qualified majority would have been reached, a vote was not held,"" a Commission spokeswoman said.The EU executive had hoped for a decision to stop the clock ticking on a six-month phase-out period for glyphosate products when the existing authorisation lapses at the end of June. In response to opposition, it had already postponed a vote in March and shortened the licence to nine years from 15. The new proposal would ban some products because of the substances they combine with glyphosate, which could add to risks.The banned list of so-called co-formulants includes POE-tallowamine, which is no longer sold in glyphosate-containing pesticides in Germany.Germany had planned to abstain from voting because ministries run by different parties in the ruling coalition remain at odds, a government spokesman told Reuters.Last month, the European Parliament recommended that glyphosate should only be approved for another seven years, and should not be used by the general public. As the debates were continuing in Brussels, German chemicals group Bayer made an unsolicited takeover bid for U.S. seeds company Monsanto, for which the regulatory controversy over glyphosate has been one of a number of recent problems.""This delay undermines the credibility of the European regulatory process and threatens to put European farmers ... and chemical industries at a competitive disadvantage,"" Monsanto's vice president of global regulatory and governmental affairs, Philip Miller, said.If no decision is reached to extend the licence, a spokesman said the company could not rule out seeking legal remedy.ARGUMENTS  Contradictory findings on its carcinogenic risks by various scientific bodies have thrust glyphosate into the centre of a dispute among EU and U.S. politicians, regulators and researchers.Public campaigning by citizen groups has made some EU governments wary of re-approving the substance.Experts from the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) this week said glyphosate is unlikely to pose a risk to humans exposed to it through food. It is mostly used on crops.The finding matches that of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), an independent agency funded by the European Union, but runs counter to a March 2015 study by the WHO's Lyon-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).That agency said glyphosate is ""probably"" able to cause cancer in humans and classified it as a 'Group 2A' carcinogen. It says it assesses whether the substance can cause cancer in any way - regardless of real-life conditions on typical levels of human exposure or consumption.Environmental groups have questioned the independence and transparency of scientists testing for health risks and called for the EU to err on the side of caution.""It's time for the Commission to change course,"" said  Greenpeace's EU food policy director Franziska Achterberg.

350,"  (Repeats Wednesday story for additional subscribers)By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom PolansekCHICAGO May 18 A day after Monsanto Co  said it would stop the launch of its latest soybean trait in Argentina due to concerns over royalty payments, company executives downplayed the impact and sought to turn the focus to business prospects in neighboring Brazil instead.Brazil is ""the real opportunity"" for growth in South America for Monsanto's newest soy technology, known as Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, President Brett Begemann told investors at the BMO Capital Markets' conference in New York on Wednesday.Monsanto Chief Commercial Officer Michael Frank, speaking at a separate investor conference, said the aborted soybean launch  does not impact the rest of the company's business in Argentina.Monsanto's dispute with the country revolves around a key issue: a lucrative revenue stream of royalties farmers typically pay to the company to save crops with genetically modified traits to reuse as seeds.In Brazil, after a long dispute over the issue, Monsanto has negotiated agreements with soybean trading firms to collect such royalties for the seed giant.But Monsanto and the Argentine government have been at loggerheads since the start of harvest in March, over the best way to inspect soy cargoes to ensure royalties have been paid on Monsanto's Intacta variety of soybeans. The government says Monsanto has yet to submit a proposal for an inspection system. The company says it is waiting for the government to outline its inspection requirements. The inspections could involve private-sector companies.""We're not going to sit back and let Argentina steal technology and Brazil pay for it. That's wrong. That's just ethically wrong,"" Begemann told Reuters on Wednesday.BEAN COUNTRY  South America is a key market for Monsanto, which has been battered by a plunging market value, controversy about whether its glyphosate weed killer causes cancer, and a failed bid for rival Syngenta AG. The company has also been rumored to be a takeover target.Brazil, the world's biggest soybean exporter, accounted for $1.73 billion in Monsanto's net sales in fiscal 2015, or nearly 12 percent. Argentina, the No. 3 soybean exporter, was $871 million, or 5.8 percent. The company declined to say how much came from soybeans.Monsanto sees its Xtend soybeans line as a potential blockbuster, but the launch has been problematic. The seeds are genetically engineered to resist the herbicides dicamba and glyphosate. They are being sold for the first time in the United States and Canada this year, despite lingering regulatory hurdles in the United States and the European Union.The company has lowered its forecasts for the likely amount of land to be planted with the new seeds in both the United States and Canada, where planting is underway.In Argentina, Begemann said, Monsanto was further behind in its seed launch. Xtend would not have been planted there until this November, during the Southern Hemisphere's spring.Begemann told Reuters on Wednesday that he was confident Monsanto would get EU import approval ""before we would have a marketing problem."" He emphasized that Monsanto's decision this week had nothing to do with the EU.While Monsanto is reviewing its whole business model in Argentina, corn is not part of the royalty dispute. Frank told the Goldman Sachs Basic Material conference that farmers there do not save corn seed, because it would not deliver high yields. That avoids a dispute over the intellectual property of corn technology.While farmers and the government object to private sector actors playing such an enforcement role for soybeans, some Argentine growers urged their government to strike a deal with Monsanto.""Not having Xtend is going to be terrible for the country,"" said Ruben Sgalippa, owner of a family farm in the bread basket province of Buenos Aires.

355,"  NEW DELHI India has tightened rules for the sale of genetically-modified cotton seeds, a government order said, in a move that will cap royalties for any new variety that the market's sole supplier - U.S.-based Monsanto Co - decides to develop and sell.The farm ministry in March cut royalties that local seed firms pay to Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) (MMB), a Monsanto joint venture with India's Mahyco, following complaints from domestic firms that the venture was overcharging for a gene that produces its own pesticide.As well as cutting the royalties, the government capped genetically modified (GM) cotton seed prices at 800 rupees for a packet of 450 grammes after appeals by some state governments and farmers to lower the price of the Bt variety that commands 90 percent of the market in India.Now, if Monsanto decides to introduce any new, advanced variety of its GM cotton, the world's biggest seed company cannot charge royalties more that 10 percent of the price of seeds, fixed at 800 rupees, for five years from the date of commercialization, according to Thursday's ruling. From the sixth year, the royalties, or trait value, will taper down by 10 percent every year, said the order, which laid down these guidelines without naming Monsanto. Also, as GM traits are expected to have a limited period of efficacy, any variety which loses its effectiveness will not be eligible for royalties, the order said.The new order is tougher than the royalty arrangements announced in March.  ""We are evaluating the order,"" said a Monsanto spokesman in India.The order also specified that any local seed company seeking licenses for selling any new Bt cotton variety shall get the license within 30 days of requesting the licensor. Terming the latest order as a ""huge blow"" to innovation in agricultural biotechnology, the Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises-Agriculture Focus Group, a pro-GM advocacy group, said the decision would discourage companies from investing in research.

360,"  * Farm ministry had capped royalties on new varieties* Government to seek feedback over next 90 days before decisionBy Mayank BhardwajNEW DELHI, May 23 India has temporarily withdrawn an order capping royalties on any new variety of genetically-modified (GM) cotton seeds, a government source said on Monday, bringing relief to U.S.-based Monsanto Co, the market's sole supplier.""We are temporarily withdrawing the order,"" said the source, who is involved in the decision-making process but didn't wish to be named because he is not authorised to talk to the media.In an order last week, the farm ministry said any company providing any new, advanced variety of GM cotton would not be allowed to charge royalties of more that 10 percent of the price of seeds, currently fixed at 800 rupees, for five years from the date of marketing. From the sixth year, the royalties, or trait value, will taper down by 10 percent every year. Along with putting a lid on royalties, New Delhi also tightened rules that regulate the sale of GM cotton seeds.The move was widely seen as another blow to Monsanto, the only company that sells GM cotton seeds in India, a leading producer and exporter of the fibre. The government will now seek feedback from various stakeholders in the next 90 days before reaching a decision, said the source, who gave no reason for the decision to temporarily withdraw the order.In March, India cut royalties paid by local firms for Monsanto's GM cotton seeds by nearly 70 percent and capped the price of its seed at 800 rupees for a packet of 450 grams after appeals by some state governments and farmers to lower the rate of the Bt variety that commands 90 percent of the market.The decision prompted Monsanto to warn it could consider pulling out of India. Shrugging off Monsanto's concerns, government ministers said India would keep regulating Bt cotton seed prices. Separately, India's antitrust regulator has ordered an investigation into Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India)(MMB), a joint venture with India's Mahyco, to probe whether the company had abused its dominant position as a supplier of GM cotton seeds.Monsanto, the target of a $62 billion offer from Germany's Bayer, introduced a GM cotton variety in India in 2002 despite stiff opposition from critics who questioned its safety. GM cotton seeds catapulted the country to being the world's top producer and the second-largest exporter of the fibre.Cotton is the only GM crop grown in India.A Monsanto spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Oil prices fell and were on track for a fourth session of losses as investors worried about global supply, and copper prices fell towards the three-month lows hit last week.In the United States, an imminent rise in interest rates was looking more likely. The Federal Reserve will likely tighten policy a bit quicker in 2017 than this year, by perhaps one or two more interest rate hikes, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Monday.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Monday a relatively tight labor market in the United States may put upward pressure on inflation, raising the case for higher interest rates. The Fed surprised investors when the central bank's meeting minutes released last week opened the door to a rate hike as early as in June, roiling financial markets.Topping the agenda this week is whether U.S. data adds to the likelihood of a June or July rate increase.""Focus remains on the Fed's next move and as you take a look at all the economic indicators we got last week, it certainly suggests that the economy is improving,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.MSCI's all-country world stock index was flat, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional stocks was down 0.5 percent.

U.S.-based Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, turned down Bayer's $62 billion bid on Tuesday, but said it was open to further negotiations.The ECB can buy bonds issued by companies that are based in the euro area, have an investment-grade rating and are not banks, provided that they are denominated in euros and meet certain technical requirements.The purpose for which the bonds are issued is not among the criteria set by the ECB, which will start buying corporate bonds on the market and directly from issuers next month.       This means that, in theory, the ECB could buy debt issued by Bayer, which said on Monday it would finance its cash bid for Monsanto with a combination of debt and equity. ""It will be interesting to observe how much of such a deal would be absorbed by the central bank,"" credit analysts at UniCredit wrote in a note.The ECB is buying 80 billion euros ($90 billion) worth of assets every month in an effort to revive economic growth in the euro zone by lowering borrowing costs. Central bank sources told Reuters that it would not be the ECB's first choice if the money it spent ended up financing acquisitions.But even this would have a silver lining if consolidation made an industry or sector more efficient and if it gave fresh impetus to the stock market, the source added.And if issuers ended up exchanging the euros raised through bond sales for dollars, that would also help the euro zone by weakening the euro against the greenback, the sources said.  Bayer has investment-grade ratings from S&P, Moody's and Fitch, but all three agencies said they were reviewing their ratings for possible downgrades following the offer for Monsanto.Moody's said the Monsanto acquisition might lead to a multi-notch downgrade of Bayer but it did not anticipate that the deal would cause the group to lose its investment-grade status.

This means that, in theory, the ECB could buy debt issued by Bayer, which said on Monday it would finance its cash bid for Monsanto with a combination of debt and equity. ""It will be interesting to observe how much of such a deal would be absorbed by the central bank,"" credit analysts at UniCredit wrote in a note.The ECB is buying 80 billion euros ($90 billion) worth of assets every month in an effort to revive economic growth in the euro zone by lowering borrowing costs. Central bank sources told Reuters that it would not be the ECB's first choice if the money it spent ended up financing acquisitions.But even this would have a silver lining if consolidation made an industry or sector more efficient and if it gave fresh impetus to the stock market, the source added.And if issuers ended up exchanging the euros raised through bond sales for dollars, that would also help the euro zone by weakening the euro against the greenback, the sources said.  Bayer has investment-grade ratings from S&P, Moody's and Fitch, but all three agencies said they were reviewing their ratings for possible downgrades following the offer for Monsanto.Moody's said the Monsanto acquisition might lead to a multi-notch downgrade of Bayer but it did not anticipate that the deal would cause the group to lose its investment-grade status.

375,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Monsanto Co, the world's largest seed company, turned down Bayer AG's $62 billion acquisition bid as ""incomplete and financially inadequate"" on Tuesday, but said it was open to engage further in negotiations.Monsanto's decision, first reported earlier on Tuesday by Reuters, puts pressure on Bayer to decide whether to raise its bid, even as the company faces criticism from some shareholders that its $122-per-share cash offer is already too high.Monsanto shares ended trading up 3.1 percent at $109.3 in New York, substantially below Bayer's bid price, underscoring some investor skepticism that a deal can be done. Bayer shares rose 3.23 percent at 87.15 euros in Frankfurt.""We believe in the substantial benefits an integrated strategy could provide to growers and broader society, and we have long respected Bayer’s business,"" Monsanto Chief Executive Hugh Grant said in a statement. ""However, the current proposal significantly undervalues our company and also does not adequately address or provide reassurance for some of the potential financing and regulatory execution risks related to the acquisition,"" he added.Bayer responded that its $122 per share offer represents ""full and certain value"" for Monsanto shareholders, but that it looks forward to engaging in constructive discussions with Monsanto. ""We are confident that we can address any potential financing or regulatory matters related to the transaction. Bayer remains committed to working together to complete this mutually compelling transaction,"" Bayer Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said in a statement.It was not clear what price Monsanto would be willing to sell for but several analysts have suggested Bayer would have to pay much more than the current offer to clinch a deal.""We believe it is unlikely that the deal gets done at $122 and still believe $135 is a more likely price,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note last week.Manning & Napier Advisors LLC, an investment management firm that is Monsanto's 14th largest shareholder according to Thomson Reuters data, agreed with Monsanto's decision to seek a higher offer. ""Monsanto's assessment that the initial offer was inadequate is valid, as we believe it does not appropriately value the company’s existing product portfolio,"" said Michael Knolla, a managing director at Manning & Napier.Global agrochemicals companies are racing to consolidate, partly in response to a drop in commodity prices that has hit farm incomes. Seeds and pesticides markets are also increasingly converging. This has driven Monsanto to consider a tie-up to build strength.Monsanto approached Bayer in March to express interest in its crop science unit, Reuters reported at the time. Among the possibilities discussed were an outright acquisition of the crop science unit and a joint venture, or other type of partnership between the two companies. ChemChina plans to buy Switzerland's Syngenta for $43 billion, after Syngenta rejected a bid from Monsanto. Dow Chemical Co and DuPont are forging a $130 billion business.With German rival BASF SE having previously considered a tie-up with Monsanto, Bayer has moved to avoid being left behind.Leverkusen-based Bayer's unsolicited bid for Monsanto is the largest all-cash takeover on record, according to Thomson Reuters data, just ahead of InBev SA's $60.4 billion offer for Anheuser-Busch in June 2008.Bayer said on Monday it would finance its cash bid with a combination of debt and equity.

377,"   By Tom Polansek and Greg Roumeliotis  ""There is nothing there.""Monsanto Co President Brett Begemann uttered those words last week to a small group of investors and a Reuters reporter when asked how the world's largest seed company he helps lead might fit with German drugs and crop chemicals group Bayer AG.Those four words, said on the sidelines of a New York conference, set off a series of events leading to the disclosure of Bayer's confidential, $62 billion bid for Monsanto, the largest all-cash corporate takeover offer on record.Bayer had sent a confidential acquisition proposal to Monsanto on May 10. Media reports surfaced two days later that Bayer was considering a bid. Initially, neither company would comment on whether any talks were taking place - a common practice for many corporations that prefer to negotiate deals in private and only tell Wall Street if they manage to come to terms.But Begemann appeared to go a step further than simply declining to comment at the May 18 conference. Monsanto's securities lawyer was concerned that his reply could be interpreted as a denial that any talks were going on, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has strict disclosure rules to protect investors from being misled by companies. To avoid triggering SEC scrutiny, according to the source, Monsanto issued a statement a few hours after Begemann's comment to acknowledge that Bayer had approached the company about a possible takeover.Bayer soon followed with its own statement. The negotiations have since been subject to intense investor scrutiny that has weighed on Bayer's deliberations over how much it can pay, according to sources with knowledge of the talks.The SEC declined to comment on whether it is looking into Begemann's remark.  Monsanto and Bayer also declined to comment, and Monsanto did not make Begemann available for comment. His remark was characterized by sources close to Monsanto as an ""honest mistake.""  Begemann came ""close to a violation but probably not enough"" for the SEC to bring a case, because his answer was open to interpretation, said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Michigan.Begemann's statement could be interpreted to mean that Monsanto and Bayer had not come to a definitive agreement, Henning added.CHARM OFFENSIVE Bayer shares, which fell modestly after the initial media reports, dropped as much as 10 percent the day after the company confirmed the takeover approach, as investors fretted over the impact of such an acquisition on its strategy and balance sheet. Some of Bayer shareholders spoke out against doing a deal. To address those investor concerns, Bayer on Monday unveiled the terms: it had offered $62 billion in cash for Monsanto, and it would finance 25 percent of the bid primarily through a rights offering that would dilute existing shareholders.Before Monsanto publicly responded, Bayer embarked on a highly unusual investor charm offensive, launching a website and holding presentations. Chief Executive Werner Baumann also gave several media interviews.""Because of the Monsanto President’s remark, Bayer’s CEO now has to fight a battle on two fronts, negotiating a deal with Monsanto while also trying to keep his shareholders onboard,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""It can be an easier pitch to investors when they know they can no longer influence negotiations, and a deal is presented as fait accompli,"" he said.On Tuesday, Monsanto rejected Bayer's offer but agreed to hold further talks with Bayer to see if they can agree on better terms. The two companies will now try to carry out negotiations privately, without making further statements until there is an outcome, according to the sources. INVESTOR FEEDBACK MIXED Though the negotiations continued after Begemann's comments, some sources close to Bayer said the company felt more restricted on how much more money it can offer Monsanto, given the investor feedback it received. By Friday, Bayer shares ended down 11 percent from where they were before Monsanto disclosed the approach.    To be sure, overcoming such challenges is possible.""Sophisticated investors understand that deal premiums need to be evaluated"" against the stock price before news of negotiations break, said Steven Scheinfeld, global chair of the corporate department of law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP in New York. Even transactions that have become public often get to the finish line, he added.The fact that Monsanto's shares were trading at around $110 - significantly below Bayer's $122 offer price due to uncertainty about the deal - is in Bayer's favor. Monsanto shares were at $97 before Bayer disclosed its offer.Some Bayer shareholders have been positive about the deal. For example, Royal London Asset Management said that the German company's bid for Monsanto made sense strategically, and that, as a shareholder, it would support a deal if it was priced at around $130-$135 per share.

378,"   By Alissa de Carbonnel | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS European Union states will meet next week in an effort to agree a far shorter license renewal for herbicide glyphosate before the current one expires, which would require the phasing out of products such as Monsanto's Roundup.The EU executive will put a new proposal for a license renewal of between one and two years to experts from the EU's 28 nations on June 6, according to EU sources.The Commission initially proposed a 15-year authorization, which it later cut to nine years, amid a transatlantic row over whether glyphosate may cause cancer.It twice delayed a vote to extend the license because it lacked sufficient support, following opposition from France and Germany. Glyphosate is widely used by farmers and gardeners, but approval for its use in the EU expires at the end of June.    It is still unclear whether the Commission will have the qualified majority needed for a binding decision, as Germany has said it would abstain from voting because ministries run by different parties in the ruling coalition are at odds.    If no decision is reached, manufacturers will have six months to phase out glyphosate products from the market.     Contradictory findings on its carcinogenic risks by various scientific bodies and public campaigning by citizens groups and non-governmental organizations have thrust glyphosate into the center of a dispute among EU and U.S. politicians, regulators and researchers.    Earlier this month, German chemicals group Bayer offered $62 billion to buy U.S. seeds company Monsanto, despite German resistance to glyphosate and Monsanto's genetically modified seeds. The Glyphosate Task Force industry lobby said in a statement there was no reason why the ingredient should not be authorized for 15 years and an extension would only postpone a decision.

388,"   By Alissa de Carbonnel | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS EU nations refused to back a limited extension of the herbicide glyphosate's use on Monday, threatening withdrawal of Monsanto's Roundup and other weed-killers from shelves if no decision is reached by the end of the month.Contradictory findings on carcinogenic risks have thrust the chemical into the center of a dispute among EU and U.S. politicians, regulators and researchers. Citizen and environmental groups have urged governments to exercise caution. The EU executive had offered a 12- to 18-month extension to allow time for further scientific study by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), in hopes of allaying health concerns. Its earlier proposal to renew the glyphosate license for up to 15 years had failed to win support in two meetings this year. The compromise proposal failed to win the qualified majority needed for adoption, an EU official said, adding the European Commission will discuss the issue at a meeting on Tuesday.Seven member states abstained and 20 backed the proposal, a German environment ministry spokeswoman said. Only Malta voted against, diplomats said.Without a majority decision that meets the required percentage of total EU population, the EU executive may submit its proposal to an appeal committee of political representatives of the 28 member states within a month. If there is again no decision, the European Commission may adopt its own proposal.Monsanto on Monday defended the safety of its widely used herbicide, and said glyphosate's license should be renewed for the full 15 years.""Further delays in this process represent a significant deviation from the EU regulatory framework and set a concerning precedent for other active substances,"" Philip Miller, Monsanto's vice president of global regulatory and government affairs, said in a statement. Monsanto has not ruled out a legal appeal if approval lapses after June 30, requiring a six-month phase-out of glyphosate-containing products. The industry lobby has criticized the regulatory uncertainty.The controversy hangs over German chemicals group Bayer's $62 billion offer in May to buy U.S. seeds company Monsanto. Germany was among states which abstained on Monday and has opposed Monsanto's genetically modified seeds.Glyphosate use is key for Monsanto in the United States and Brazil, where the U.S. company depends on sales of genetically modified corn and soybean seeds that can resist the widely used weed killer.In Europe, sale and use of such seeds faces strong opposition and plays virtually no role in commercial farming. But an EU refusal of a new glyphosate license could signal stricter regulation of the broader agricultural chemicals industry. It would also hit Monsanto's bottom line: If the EU were to halt glyphosate sales, the company could see earnings reduced by up to $100 million as its premium branded Roundup product is diverted to the generic market, said Bernstein senior analyst Jonas Oxgaard. SMELLING GAS Quashing the licenses in Europe might further embolden glyphosate foes elsewhere.""With this decision all they do is cast doubt ... and create fear and confusion amongst Europe's consumers,"" Graeme Taylor of the European Crop Protection Association said. Environmental and citizen campaign groups have called for an EU-wide ban in the absence of scientific certainty. ""Extending the glyphosate license would be like smelling gas and refusing to evacuate to check for a leak,"" Greenpeace EU food policy director Franziska Achterberg said in a statement.The prospect of a European ban could complicate EU-U.S. trade talks.The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) said in May glyphosate was unlikely to pose a risk to people exposed to it through food.The finding matches that of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), an independent agency funded by the European Union, but runs counter to a March 2015 study by the WHO's Lyon-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).That agency said the chemical was probably able to cause cancer and classified it as a 'Group 2A' carcinogen. It assessed whether the substance can cause cancer in any way - regardless of real-life conditions on typical levels of human exposure or consumption.

390,"   By Tom Polansek and Michael Hirtzer | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Monsanto Co is developing plans to prevent a new variety of biotech U.S. soybeans from entering European markets where they are not approved, leaders of two agricultural trade groups said, in a sign of the growing impact of regulatory delays on the world's largest seed maker.  The company is working with representatives of the U.S. farm sector on a strategy to keep Xtend soybeans separate from varieties approved in all major export markets, said Jim Sutter, chief executive officer for the U.S. Soybean Export Council. The plan could be used if Europe does not clear imports before harvesting starts in August.Monsanto had no immediate comment on Tuesday.The company launched Xtend soybean seeds, engineered to resist the herbicides glyphosate and dicamba, before obtaining clearance for crop shipments to Europe because executives were expecting approval early this year.The product is designed to replace hugely popular Roundup Ready soybeans planted nationwide and its release could represent Monsanto's biggest technology launch ever, according to the company.But European import approval still has not come, prompting the world's top grain handlers to declare they will reject Xtend soybean deliveries to avoid trade disruptions.""They’ll obviously have to channel it so it doesn’t go to the European market,"" Sutter said of Monsanto. He declined to offer more details. Richard Wilkins, president of the American Soybean Association, also said Monsanto was working on a plan for Xtend soybeans if Europe's approval comes too late. The association, which represents farmers, has asked Monsanto to present the plan next month, he said.""We are particularly interested in preventing anything from disrupting international trade,"" Wilkins said. Last month, Monsanto told agricultural organizations in a letter that it hoped for European approval before summer and was not ""yet in a place where harvest contingency plans are needed.""Rivals, including Syngenta AG and Dow AgroSciences, in recent years have launched programs that specify where farmers must deliver biotech crops lacking approval in key markets or how they can use the harvests domestically.  The United States is the biggest producer of GMO crops and has long been at the forefront of technology aiming to protect crops against insects or allow them to resist herbicides.That innovation is now seen as a risk to trade because it is hard to segregate crops containing traits lacking import approvals from the billions of identical-looking bushels exported every year.China roiled global grain trading two years ago after it rejected boatloads of U.S. corn containing a biotech Syngenta trait that had not been approved for import. Since then, the Swiss-based seed company has partnered with grain handler Gavilon, owned by Marubeni Corp, to oversee U.S. harvests of Duracade corn, another biotech variety that lacks China's approval.

The two companies have since sat down to try to negotiate a deal.Brudermueller said BASF's crop chemicals business was highly profitable and innovative and also ""not quite small"". BASF, the world's largest maker of industrial chemicals by sales, commands 7 percent of the world's combined pesticides and seeds markets but risks relegation to a second-tier position given rivals' merger plans, according to A. T. Kearney data.A Monsanto-Bayer deal would add Monsanto's 15 percent market share in global seeds and pesticides to Bayer's 12 percent, creating an undisputed market leader. The planned merger of U.S. groups Dow Chemical and DuPont would combine 7 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Syngenta, which is being bought by ChemChina, has a 14 percent market share.BASF has so far focused on crop chemicals, unlike its rivals who are combining or want to combine seeds and chemicals businesses. This combination is one of the main drivers of Bayer's plan for a tie-up with Monsanto, the market leader in seeds.BASF is the world's third-largest maker of farming pesticides. Its plant biotechnology unit, which does not disclose financial results, is developing improved plant characteristics such as drought tolerability but relies on partners, the biggest being Monsanto, to bring finished seed products to market.""We expect contracts to be honoured of course, should there be a new owner,"" Brudermueller said, when asked about repercussions on any Bayer takeover on its alliance with Monsanto.

Dekkers left to become Unilever  chairman in May. On May 19, Bayer said it had made a non-binding offer for Monsanto, aiming to create the world's biggest agricultural supplier. Monsanto rejected the offer but has said it is open to further talks.

400,"   By Maximiliano Rizzi | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES Argentina's government is close to striking a deal with Monsanto Co over the inspection of shipments of genetically modified soybeans, an agriculture ministry official said on Monday.Monsanto and President Mauricio Macri's government have been at loggerheads since March over the company's request to have exporting companies inspect soybean shipments to make sure farmers paid royalties on soybean seed technology.Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, threatened to suspend launches of future soybean technologies in Argentina, a move that could limit output of the country's main cash crop.Argentina, the world's No. 1 exporter of soymeal livestock feed, relies heavily on Monsanto's genetic technology to produce soybeans. The government is now analyzing Monsanto's proposed method of inspection, said Guillermo Bernaudo, chief of Argentina's Ministry of Agri-industry. ""It's basically impossible not to have a deal. It's a matter of days,"" he told Reuters.  A Buenos Aires-based Monsanto spokeswoman said talks were ongoing but no deal was finalized.The conflict is playing out just over six months into Macri's term, after he won the presidency on promises of freeing Argentina's economy from years of heavy-handed trade and currency controls. Farmers have urged the government to make a deal with the company though they object to private exporters playing an enforcement role.Monsanto struck deals with individual exporting companies to police royalty collection in neighboring Brazil.

406,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Arno Schuetze | NEW YORK/FRANKFURT  NEW YORK/FRANKFURT Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), the German chemicals and healthcare company trying to acquire Monsanto Co (MON.N), is exploring a sale of its radiology supplies unit that could be worth more than $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.Bayer has said it does not need to sell assets to finance its $62 billion bid for Monsanto but has stressed that the strategic reviews of its businesses would continue as usual. The company is in talks with investment banks about hiring a financial adviser to explore strategic alternatives for the radiology supplies business, including a sale, the sources said this week. Bayer may decide to keep the unit, the sources added.The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Bayer declined to comment. The radiology business generates more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in revenue from contrast agents and related injection equipment. Its main products are Ultravist for computer tomography scans, with 318 million euros in sales in 2015, and Gadovist for magnetic resonance imaging scans, with 290 million euros.Bayer has been taking steps to narrow the focus of its healthcare division to prescription drugs and consumer care products.  In 2014, it sold a unit making vascular catheters to treat clogged blood vessels to Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) for $415 million, followed by the sale of a blood glucose meter business to Panasonic Healthcare Holdings for 1.02 billion euros last year.Bayer Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said last month that the company would continue to develop its healthcare arm, which includes stroke prevention pill Xarelto and aspirin, the painkiller it invented more than a century ago. Monsanto turned down Bayer's $122-per-share cash offer on May 24 but said it was open to continuing discussions. Since then, negotiations between the two companies have been at an impasse, as Bayer has refused to raise its offer without Monsanto first opening its books, sources have said. Monsanto has been holding out for an improved offer before providing confidential information to Bayer.

419,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Monsanto Co is in talks with Bayer AG and other companies regarding ""alternative strategic options,"" a month after it rejected the German company's $62-billion takeover offer, the U.S. seed producer said on Wednesday.Monsanto's options include combinations with other companies and businesses in the sector beyond Bayer. Potential deals could involve BASF and any businesses divested from the Dow/DuPont merger, according to analysts.Monsanto, which also reported lower-than-expected sales for the sixth straight quarter on Wednesday, had approached Bayer about a potential acquisition of its crop science unit, Reuters reported in March.""Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry and I assure you that we will continue to actively explore these opportunities,"" Chief Executive Officer Hugh Grant said.Monsanto said there was ""no formal update on the Bayer proposal,"" but that talks have been ongoing for the past several weeks.A Bayer spokesman said the company had no comment.The seeds and agrochemicals industry, long dominated by six large companies, has been jolted by several large deals in the past year as low crop prices and belt-tightening by farmers pressured earnings. Syngenta agreed in February to be acquired by ChemChina for $43 billion, while Dow Chemical and DuPont struck a $130 billion mega merger last year.Companies have also explored selling assets that may be underperforming or non-core to their businesses going forward.Monsanto had not opened its books more than two weeks after rejecting Bayer's offer but left the door open to a possible deal, Reuters reported this month, citing sources. Bayer, however, has no plans to raise its offer without reviewing Monsanto's confidential information, the sources said.Bayer had planned to issue about $15.4 billion in new shares to help fund the proposed all-cash deal.WEAK EARNINGS Monsanto's weak earnings could increase the possibility of M&A for the company, according to Bernstein analyst Jonas Oxgaard. Still if Monsanto's stock price fails to rally strongly, that could give Bayer some cover if it decided to back out of the deal, he said.""This certainly explains why Monsanto required a higher offer before opening their books – once their books are read it seems to be less likely that a higher offer would materialize,"" Oxgaard wrote in a note Wednesday.Bayer's offer, which was opposed by some of its own shareholders, puts the deal at $122 per share.Monsanto shares rose 0.7 percent to $101.79 on Wednesday, well below a high above $112 shortly after the Bayer offer was announced. Bernstein Research estimated that Bayer can issue no more than 290 million shares before a shareholder vote is needed. That could raise almost 26 billion Euros ($29 billion) based on Bayer's share price on Wednesday. INCOME DROPS Separately, Monsanto reported that net income tumbled more than 37 percent to $717 million, or $1.63 per share, in the third quarter ended May 31.A global glut of generic glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, and delays in securing European Union import approval for Monsanto's next-generation biotech soybeans dragged down profits in the quarter, the company said.Earnings per share totaled $2.17 from continuing operations, well below the average analyst estimate of $2.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales declined 8.5 percent to $4.19 billion, missing estimates of $4.49 billion.Monsanto tweaked its 2016 full-year as-reported EPS forecast to the low end of the $3.36 to $4.14 adjusted range and said it expects to be at the low end of its ongoing EPS full-year range of $4.40 to $5.10.

421,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Monsanto Co is in talks with Bayer AG and other companies regarding ""alternative strategic options,"" a month after it rejected the German company's $62-billion takeover offer, the U.S. seed producer said on Wednesday.Monsanto's options include combinations with other companies and businesses in the sector beyond Bayer. Potential deals could involve BASF and any businesses divested from the Dow/DuPont merger, according to analysts.Monsanto, which also reported lower-than-expected sales for the sixth straight quarter on Wednesday, had approached Bayer about a potential acquisition of its crop science unit, Reuters reported in March.""Monsanto remains the partner of choice in this industry and I assure you that we will continue to actively explore these opportunities,"" Chief Executive Officer Hugh Grant said.Monsanto said there was ""no formal update on the Bayer proposal,"" but that talks have been ongoing for the past several weeks.A Bayer spokesman said the company had no comment.The seeds and agrochemicals industry, long dominated by six large companies, has been jolted by several large deals in the past year as low crop prices and belt-tightening by farmers pressured earnings. Syngenta agreed in February to be acquired by ChemChina for $43 billion, while Dow Chemical and DuPont struck a $130 billion mega merger last year.Companies have also explored selling assets that may be underperforming or non-core to their businesses going forward.Monsanto had not opened its books more than two weeks after rejecting Bayer's offer but left the door open to a possible deal, Reuters reported this month, citing sources. Bayer, however, has no plans to raise its offer without reviewing Monsanto's confidential information, the sources said.Bayer had planned to issue about $15.4 billion in new shares to help fund the proposed all-cash deal.WEAK EARNINGS Monsanto's weak earnings could increase the possibility of M&A for the company, according to Bernstein analyst Jonas Oxgaard. Still if Monsanto's stock price fails to rally strongly, that could give Bayer some cover if it decided to back out of the deal, he said.""This certainly explains why Monsanto required a higher offer before opening their books – once their books are read it seems to be less likely that a higher offer would materialize,"" Oxgaard wrote in a note Wednesday.Bayer's offer, which was opposed by some of its own shareholders, puts the deal at $122 per share.Monsanto shares rose 0.7 percent to $101.79 on Wednesday, well below a high above $112 shortly after the Bayer offer was announced. Bernstein Research estimated that Bayer can issue no more than 290 million shares before a shareholder vote is needed. That could raise almost 26 billion Euros ($29 billion) based on Bayer's share price on Wednesday. INCOME DROPS Separately, Monsanto reported that net income tumbled more than 37 percent to $717 million, or $1.63 per share, in the third quarter ended May 31.A global glut of generic glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, and delays in securing European Union import approval for Monsanto's next-generation biotech soybeans dragged down profits in the quarter, the company said.Earnings per share totaled $2.17 from continuing operations, well below the average analyst estimate of $2.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales declined 8.5 percent to $4.19 billion, missing estimates of $4.49 billion.Monsanto tweaked its 2016 full-year as-reported EPS forecast to the low end of the $3.36 to $4.14 adjusted range and said it expects to be at the low end of its ongoing EPS full-year range of $4.40 to $5.10.

427,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. seed and agrochemicals companies Monsanto Co and DuPont said on Thursday they have signed a multi-year supply agreement for the weed killer dicamba in the United States and Canada.Under the deal, whose terms were not disclosed, Monsanto will supply its farm seeds and chemicals rival with the herbicide, which will be sold as DuPont FeXapan herbicide plus VaporGrip Technology, the companies said.The chemical is meant for use with Monsanto's Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, a genetically modified variety designed to tolerate applications of dicamba and glyphosate herbicides. DuPont signed a licensing agreement in 2013 to incorporate Monsanto's Xtend trait in its seeds.Widespread planting of glyphosate-tolerant corn, soybeans and cotton in the United States has contributed to the rise of weeds resistant to the herbicide so farmers are seeking alternative varieties that can withstand other weed killers.

The company has said the Xtend platform will be its largest-ever technology launch.The Xtend soybean trait was planted on around 1 million acres in the United States this year, less than initially planned due to import-approval delays in the European Union. Monsanto expects 15 million acres to be planted with Xtend soybeans next season and 55 million acres by 2019.

438,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Karl Plume  German drug and crop chemical group Bayer AG on Thursday announced details of a sweetened $64 billion bid for Monsanto Co as it tries to put the U.S. seed company under pressure to engage further.Analysts and some Monsanto shareholders were quick to opine that Bayer's latest offer, the largest all-cash takeover bid on record, was unlikely to entice Monsanto. Bayer, however, is hoping that the sweetened offer will spur enough Monsanto shareholders to call on the company's management to be more accommodative.   Global agrochemicals companies are racing to consolidate, partly in response to a drop in commodity prices that has hit farm incomes. Bayer made its bid for Monsanto public in May, but the two companies have made little progress since in negotiating a deal.Monsanto Chief Executive Hugh Grant said last month that the company was in talks with Bayer and other companies in its sector about ""alternative strategic options."" He did not name the other companies, but Reuters has previously reported that Monsanto had discussed a business combination with BASF SE.Bayer said on Thursday that it had raised its offer to $125 a share from $122 in cash and offered Monsanto a $1.5 billion reverse antitrust breakup fee, ""reaffirming its confidence in a successful closing.""""We don't think the higher offer will be enough to entice Monsanto's board. ... We estimate Monsanto would be worth $130 per share in Bayer's hands, which includes our annual run-rate cost-synergy target of $1 billion,"" Morningstar analysts said in a note. Bayer also said it had comprehensively addressed Monsanto's questions about financing and regulatory matters, and that it was prepared to make certain commitments to regulators, if required, to complete a deal. ""While the breakup fee begins to address one prominent concern regarding the transaction, the modest increase in the bid still does not fairly value the existing product portfolio, nonetheless Monsanto's strong product pipeline,"" said Michael Knolla, managing director of Capital Goods & Materials Group for Manning & Napier, the 14th largest Monsanto shareholder according to Reuters Eikon data.Monsanto said its board would review Bayer's latest proposal, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors. Shares of Monsanto rose 3 percent to end at $104.22 in New York, while Bayer closed up 0.5 percent at 93.44 euros ($103.88) in Frankfurt. Monsanto may respond to Bayer's latest offer as early as this week, according to people familiar with the matter. They asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. While Monsanto has shared more information with Bayer since May, it has yet to provide it with a confidentiality agreement that would allow the German company to go over its books, the sources said. The seeds and agrochemicals industry, long dominated by six large companies, has been jolted by several large deals in the past year as low crop prices and belt-tightening by farmers pressured earnings. Syngenta AG agreed in February to be acquired by ChemChina for $43 billion, while Dow Chemical and DuPont struck a $130 billion megamerger last year. ChemChina and Syngenta however are still waiting for the U.S. to clear their deal based on any national security concerns.Bayer's relatively modest price increase in its offer also reflects the view that Monsanto's recent poor earnings have weighed on its valuation.Monsanto said last month that its net income tumbled more than 37 percent to $717 million in the quarter ended on May 31. It cited a global glut of generic glyphosate, the active ingredient in its Roundup herbicide, and delays in securing European Union import approval for its next-generation biotech soybeans.

Asim Rahman, European equities fund manager at Henderson, one of Bayer's 20 largest investors with a 0.7 percent stake, said the bid for the U.S. seeds company represented ""a major departure from a strategy of focus and integration of existing acquisitions"" that Bayer had consistently communicated to the market for a number of years.Bayer announced a sweetened $125-a-share offer for Monsanto, the largest all-cash takeover bid on record, on July 14 in an effort to entice its reluctant management to give the German company full access to its books.Global agrochemical firms have been weighing a string of big-ticket mergers with rivals in recent months to partly offset a sharp drop in commodities prices that has hit the incomes of some of their biggest agricultural customers.In a letter to the company dated June 7, Henderson's Rahman also called for a shareholder vote on the deal to restore investor trust and ensure support for Bayer's future strategic direction, which he hoped could minimize a likely increased conglomerate discount on its share price relative to peers. ""We cannot accept the Board's decision to deny shareholders any opportunity to vote on it ... Technically the transaction does not require shareholder approval, but an endorsement by shareholders would provide an opportunity to repair market trust in the investment case,"" he said.After meeting with Bayer in May, Rahman said he was unconvinced that the deal would create value for shareholders.

450,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Michael Flaherty  U.S. seeds company Monsanto Co is negotiating the terms of a confidentiality agreement with Bayer AG that would allow extensive due diligence, after the German drug and crop chemical group raised its acquisition bid to more than $64 billion, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.While there is no certainty the latest talks between the two companies will result in a confidentiality pact, let alone in any deal, the move indicates that Bayer's latest offer may at least help the negotiations make progress.Bayer said last week it had sweetened its acquisition offer for Monsanto to $125 per share in cash from $122 per share and offered it a $1.5 billion reverse antitrust breakup fee. Monsanto would still require Bayer to raise its offer further in order to agree to a sale, the source said. The source asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Bayer and Monsanto declined to comment.Monsanto shares closed 2.9 percent higher at $106.44 on Monday on the news. Bayer shares had previously ended trading in Frankfurt down 1.1 percent at 92.90 euros ($102.85). Access to confidential information has been a major sticking point in Bayer's negotiations with Monsanto ever since the Leverkusen, Germany-based company offered to acquire its smaller St. Louis, Missouri-based peer in May.Monsanto Chief Executive Hugh Grant said last month that his company was in talks with Bayer and other companies in its sector about ""alternative strategic options."" He did not name the other companies, but Reuters has previously reported that Monsanto had discussed a business combination with BASF SE. Bayer argued last week that it had comprehensively addressed Monsanto's questions about financing and regulatory matters and said it was prepared to make certain commitments to regulators, if required, to complete a deal.Monsanto responded by noting that its board would review Bayer's latest proposal, in consultation with its financial and legal advisers.The seeds and agrochemicals industry, long dominated by six large companies, has been jolted by several large deals in the past year as low crop prices and belt-tightening by farmers pressured earnings.

ChemChina and Syngenta, however, are still waiting for the United States to clear their deal based on any national security concerns.ACTIVIST DRUMBEAT In a sign of how hedge funds are eyeing opportunities in the latest round of talks between the companies, Corvex Management LP, the activist fund run by former Carl Icahn protégé Keith Meister, has amassed small stakes in both Monsanto and Bayer, sources said on Monday. Corvex, which also owned Monsanto stock two years ago, would favor a sale to Bayer for a price it deems sufficiently rich, the sources said.Activist hedge fund Glenview Capital Management LLC already owns a 2.5 percent stake in Monsanto, making it the company's seventh-largest shareholder, according to regulatory filings.Bayer's relatively modest price increase in its offer last week also reflected the view that Monsanto's recent poor earnings have weighed on its valuation.Monsanto said last month net income tumbled more than 37 percent to $717 million in the quarter ended on May 31. It cited a global glut of generic glyphosate, the active ingredient in its Roundup herbicide, and delays in securing European Union import approval for its next-generation biotech soybeans.

455,"   By Ludwig Burger | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Bayer (BAYGn.DE), the German drugmaker trying to acquire U.S. seed company Monsanto (MON.N), surpassed second-quarter earnings expectations and raised its guidance for the year as strong gains in stroke prevention pill Xarelto offset sluggish farming pesticides markets.Second-quarter profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for one-off items, gained 5.7 percent to 3.05 billion euros ($3.35 billion), above the average estimate of 2.90 billion in a Reuters poll among analysts.Bayer, the inventor of aspirin and maker of Yasmin birth control pills, said it now expected EBITDA before special items to increase by a high-single-digit percentage, where it had previously seen a mid-single-digit gain.Xarelto, which competes in blood clot prevention with Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer's (PFE.N) Eliquis, saw sales jumped 30 percent excluding currency swings to 703 million euros, well above expectations.  Sales in Eylea, the drug jointly developed with Regeneron (REGN.O) which helps stem the loss of vision in the elderly, also exceed the market view.But Bayer also became the latest maker of farming supplies to take a hit as depressed prices of agricultural produce such as wheat and corn have prompted growers to reduce pesticide use to a minimum. Rival Syngenta said last week that excessive rainfall in Europe, among other factors, has kept farmers from spraying. Adjusted EBITDA at Bayer's Crop Science unit dropped 8.2 percent to a worse-than-expected 663 million euros.Bayer last week pointed to Monsanto's recent weak business performance to champion its sweetened $64 billion offer which Monsanto's management had turned down.

Experts said two straight droughts fanned last year's infestation.But the new seed is still a setback for Monsanto, which has also been hit by a roughly 10 percent decline in cotton acreage in India this year as farmers switch to crops like pulses and lentils in the aftermath of the whitefly blight. SEED SALES SLIDE Monsanto's Bt cotton sales in India have fallen 15 percent so far in 2016, said Kalyan Goswami, executive director of the National Seed Association of India. The firm, which last year sold some 41 million packets of Bt seeds in India, could stand to lose up to 5 billion rupees ($75 million) due to lower sales and the steep cut in royalties enforced by the government earlier in 2016, according to Reuters calculations.    The company, which unsuccessfully challenged India's decision to slash royalties in the courts, declined to comment for this article.But in the wake of the whitefly infestation, Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt Ltd (MMB), a joint venture with India's Mahyco, said last year that Monsanto and its Indian licensees marketed their product as resistant to bollworms, not other pests.Some experts were optimistic the indigenous cotton seeds developed by the Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR), which comes under the farm ministry, would catch on over time. ""Just wait for the crucial three to four years to see a complete, natural turnaround. By then most farmers will give up Bt cotton and go for the indigenous variety,"" said Keshav Raj Kranthi, head of CICR.Kranthi said planting a hectare with the Indian variety cost less than half the 80,000 rupees farmers paid to sow Bt cotton over the same area, and the crop yield was almost as high.Unlike GM seeds, farmers could also store and replant the local seeds the following year, he added.Some experts voiced caution over the new variety, however.""By all accounts, the indigenous cotton looks pretty promising, but it will be put to test this year,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst. ""It's a potential game changer, but it has to succeed first.""

463,"   By Karl Plume  Monsanto Co's Climate Corporation is building a network of in-field sensors to expand the scope of soil, weather and other data flowing into its digital agriculture tools that help farmers increase crop yields and reduce costs, the company said on Wednesday.San Francisco-based Climate also said it will open up its software infrastructure to third-party developers, enabling them to create new applications that enhance the data-fueled services it currently offers. Climate announced a deal with a Kansas-based soil sensor company on Wednesday but did not disclose terms.The goal is to build an Amazon.com-like network of agriculture products and services that the company says will speed innovation and bolster the capabilities of its Climate FieldView platform.""We see it as the Amazon of agriculture, where we're bringing additional apps up onto that platform and where the best apps win,"" Hugh Grant, Monsanto's CEO, told investors gathered for an investor event in St. Louis on Wednesday.Agriculture companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technologies that capture and analyze detailed data about plants, soil and weather to help farmers increase yields and lower costs. The companies hope to capitalize on what they believe is the biggest step forward in agriculture since biotech seeds. But many farmers, squeezed by tightening farm profits, have not fully embraced the big data offerings.The strategy of opening up the software platform to developers goes beyond the existing data transfer agreements between Climate and other companies, Climate's chief technology officer, Mark Young, said.Monsanto has spent more than $1 billion in recent years on expanding its digital platform, which has not yet grown into a big revenue generator.

464,"   By Karl Plume  Monsanto Co's Climate Corporation is building a network of in-field sensors to expand the scope of soil, weather and other data flowing into its digital agriculture tools that help farmers increase crop yields and reduce costs, the company said on Wednesday.San Francisco-based Climate also said it will open up its software infrastructure to third-party developers, enabling them to create new applications that enhance the data-fueled services it currently offers. Climate announced a deal with a Kansas-based soil sensor company on Wednesday but did not disclose terms.The goal is to build an Amazon.com-like network of agriculture products and services that the company says will speed innovation and bolster the capabilities of its Climate FieldView platform.""We see it as the Amazon of agriculture, where we're bringing additional apps up onto that platform and where the best apps win,"" Hugh Grant, Monsanto's CEO, told investors gathered for an investor event in St. Louis on Wednesday.Agriculture companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technologies that capture and analyze detailed data about plants, soil and weather to help farmers increase yields and lower costs. The companies hope to capitalize on what they believe is the biggest step forward in agriculture since biotech seeds. But many farmers, squeezed by tightening farm profits, have not fully embraced the big data offerings.The strategy of opening up the software platform to developers goes beyond the existing data transfer agreements between Climate and other companies, Climate's chief technology officer, Mark Young, said.Monsanto has spent more than $1 billion in recent years on expanding its digital platform, which has not yet grown into a big revenue generator.

475,"   By Mayank Bhardwaj | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI Monsanto Co (MON.N) has withdrawn an application seeking approval for its next generation of genetically modified cotton seeds in India, a major escalation in a long-running dispute between New Delhi and the world's biggest seed maker.A letter sent by Monsanto's local partner in India, the conglomerate's biggest market outside the Americas, strongly objects to a government proposal that would force Monsanto to share its technology with local seed companies.The company is also at loggerheads with India over how much it can charge for its genetically modified cotton seeds, costing it tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue every year.The unprecedented decision to pull the application, which has not previously been reported, could set back Monsanto's efforts to introduce its new seed, called Bollgard II Roundup Ready Flex technology, for years and lead to further losses.It will also ratchet up pressure on the Indian government, as it undermines Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to make the country look more attractive to foreign investors.It could also hurt Indian cotton farmers. The new seed variety helps fight against weeds that sap the cotton crop of vital nutrients and depress yields.A Monsanto spokesman said the withdrawal of the application was ""an outcome of the uncertainty in the business and regulatory environment"", but that the move had ""no impact on our current cotton portfolio being sold in India"".A spokesman for the environment ministry, which had the application before it, was not available for comment. In a letter, dated July 5, Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Co Ltd (Mahyco), Monsanto's technology partner in India, singled out a government proposal, mooted in May, that would require Monsanto to share its proprietary technology.After protests by Monsanto and other global seed companies, the government temporarily withdrew the order and decided to seek feedback from stakeholders. It is now evaluating the feedback.    Mahyco said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, that the proposal ""alarmed us and raised serious concerns about the protection of intellectual property rights"".Mahyco also asked the regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), to return data and other material submitted by it as part of the application.    The regulator has done that, a government official said.         LOST OPPORTUNITY     India first allowed GM cotton cultivation in 2002 by approving Monsanto's single gene Bollgard I technology.New Delhi approved the double gene Bollgard II in 2006, helping transform India into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber as output jumped fourfold.    Bollgard II Roundup Ready Flex would have been the first technological breakthrough since the launch of Bollgard II, potentially pushing up crop yields at a time when some farmers have said the existing variety was losing its effectiveness. Bollgard II, introduced in 2006, is slowly becoming vulnerable to bollworms, experts say, and, as any technology, has a limited shelf life.    Still, more than 41 million GM cotton seed packets were sold last year, earning royalties of 6.5 billion Indian rupees ($97 million) for Monsanto.    Mahyco applied to the GEAC for approval of the new GM seed some time in 2007. The application was in the final stages of a tedious and time-consuming process, which included years of field trials.     In its letter to the GEAC, Mahyco said it would seek to revive the application for Bollgard II Roundup Ready Flex ""at a suitable time"".    But the government official said there were no guarantees it would be allowed to do so if it changed its mind in the future and would likely have to start afresh.

The decision to go ahead is likely to be made public soon by the environment ministry's Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, and is expected eventually to move to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's desk via Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave.Dave could not immediately be reached for comment.The environment ministry said in a statement late on Thursday that no final decision has been taken yet and that its Genetic Engineering Approval Committee will put up a 'safety document' on the issue on its website seeking comments from the public.The news of the technical approval comes when U.S. seed maker Monsanto - which dominates the GM cotton market in India - faces heightened government regulation that has forced it to consider quitting a country it has operated in for decades. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Monsanto had withdrawn an application seeking approval for its next generation GM cotton seeds in India, escalating a long-running dispute between New Delhi and the world's biggest seed maker.Top India executives of multinationals like Monsanto, Bayer Biosciences, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont Pioneer and Syngenta have called a joint news conference on Friday to make an ""important announcement"", following what they called difficult times that have impacted operations of seed companies.Permitting GM food crops is a big call for India, which spends tens of billions of dollars importing edible oils and other food items every year. Farmers are stuck with old technology, yields are at a fraction of world levels, cultivable land is shrinking and weather patterns have become less predictable, experts say.  But political and public opposition to lab-altered food remains strong amid fears that GM crops could compromise food safety and biodiversity. Some grassroots groups associated with Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have also opposed GM crops because of the reliance on seeds patented by multi-nationals like Monsanto, DuPont, Dow Chemical and Syngenta, which is to be taken over by a Chinese company.India placed a moratorium on GM eggplant in 2010, also after an experts panel had given its clearance, effectively bringing the regulatory system to a deadlock.  Modi, however, who was instrumental in making Gujarat state India's leading user of GM cotton when he was chief minister there, cleared several field trials for GM crops soon after taking office in New Delhi in 2014.

482,"   By Rod Nickel and Diane Bartz | WINNIPEG, Manitoba/WASHINGTON  WINNIPEG, Manitoba/WASHINGTON Canada's Agrium Inc (AGU.TO) and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc (POT.TO) said on Tuesday they are in talks to merge, a deal that would create a fertilizer and farm retailing giant worth more than $25 billion but also trigger U.S. regulatory scrutiny.Potash Corp (POT.N), the world's biggest crop nutrient company by capacity and Agrium (AGU.N), North America's largest farm retailer, said in separate statements that the talks were at a ""preliminary"" stage about a possible merger of equals, adding that no agreement has been reached.U.S.-listed shares of Potash and Agrium rocketed up 11 and 7 percent respectively.The deal would be the latest in a string of agriculture merger attempts, including potential combinations of seed giants Monsanto Co (MON.N) and Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), and ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] and Syngenta (SYNN.S). Fertilizer companies have suffered lower profits as crop nutrient prices tumbled due to excessive supply and weak demand. Crop prices have also hurt, with corn Cv1 and wheat Wc1 at  seven-year and 10-year lows respectively, giving farmers less incentive to maximize production with fertilizer.For Potash, it would be a chance to grow without a foreign takeover, a politically sensitive point in Canada. In 2010, Ottawa blocked a takeover bid for Potash by Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP.AX)(BLT.L), after political opposition from Potash Corp's home province Saskatchewan.A merger would give Potash a direct channel to U.S. farmers through Agrium's retail stores, which as of May accounted for 17 percent of the U.S. market. Industry watchers said this and other factors would catch the attention of U.S. regulators. “I can't predict what they (U.S. and Canadian regulators) would do but this one would come under intense scrutiny,” said Bob Taylor, an economist and professor emeritus at Auburn University’s College of Agriculture.A combined company would be dominant in North America, controlling 62 percent of potash capacity, 30 percent of phosphate production capability and 29 percent of nitrogen capacity, National Bank analyst Greg Colman said.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute non-profit group, said she would be “very surprised” if antitrust regulators approved such a merger. ""This is bad for the American farmer and the American food consumer,"" she said. “The farmer is in the middle of a squeeze play.”National Farmers Union will likely oppose the merger since the fertilizer industry is already concentrated, said president Roger Johnson. “The problem that these mergers create is that it's probably the same industry supplier that is supplying the local cooperative as well as the distributor 50 miles down the road.”REGULATORS TO EYE DEAL  U.S. farmers are among the world's biggest users of potash. Antitrust concerns there could be addressed by the combined company selling at least one potash mine, brokerage Stifel said in a note.While there would be no concerns this time about a foreign takeover, Canada's Competition Bureau still would review the deal.Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said the two companies' chief executive officers phoned on Tuesday to alert him to the talks.Wall, a key voice against BHP's bid, told reporters that a merger may mean opportunities for his province since Agrium is based in Calgary, Alberta.The companies are similar in market capitalization, but Agrium has weathered the commodity slump better than Potash, due to its balance of fertilizer production and retail sales. ""(A merger) will make them a better force to compete on a global scale,"" said Mohsin Bashir, portfolio manager at Stone Asset Management Ltd, which owns Agrium shares.A combination looks like a good fit for Potash Corp, and is preferable to a foreign takeover, said Ryan Bushell, portfolio manager at Leon Frazer & Associates, which owns Potash shares.""It does make sense from a strategic perspective,"" he said. Shares of Potash Corp, which had a market valuation of C$17.54 billion ($13.43 billion) as of Monday's close, were up 10.7 percent at $17.76 in New York.Agrium, worth C$16.10 billion, was up 7.9 percent in Toronto at C$125.76.The talks were first reported by Bloomberg.($1 = 1.3064 Canadian dollars) (Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York, Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru and John Tilak in Toronto; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Marguerita Choy)",2016-08-30,MON,"Tue Aug 30, 2016 | 4:00pm EDT","Potash Corp, Agrium talk merger; competition scrutiny expected",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-agrium-m-a-potashcorp-idUSKCN1151UT?type=companyNews

485,"   By Karl Plume | BOONE, Iowa  BOONE, Iowa Monsanto Co's digital agriculture platform should begin generating revenue for the seed and chemical company by 2020 as paid subscriptions for data-driven farm management and planting advice services expand, a top executive told Reuters.Revenues from the Climate Corporation business, acquired in 2013 for nearly $1 billion, are expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars by then, Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer said in an interview at the Farm Progress industry show.""By the turn of the decade it will be a clear cash generator for the business,"" Fraley said, noting it will still be a fraction of Monsanto's total sales.Monsanto's high-stakes push into digital agriculture hit a hurdle on Wednesday, when the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping Deere & Co from buying Monsanto's Precision Planting farm equipment business. The agency said in its lawsuit the deal could make it more expensive for farmers to use precise planting technology. Mike Stern, chief executive of Climate Corporation, told Reuters on Wednesday the sale would benefit farmers. Stern also said Climate and Deere are moving forward with plans to allow nearly real-time data connections between certain John Deere farm equipment and Climate's farming software programs, Climate FieldView.Monsanto's Climate acquisition, and the high price it paid for the San Francisco-based weather data analytics firm, ignited intense industry interest in agriculture technology businesses. Numerous competitors and non-farm investors jumped into the space, aimed at helping farmers grow bigger crops more efficiently using data analytics, drones and other high tech tools.But a steep downturn in farm incomes has cooled agrarian demand for the unproven technologies. It is also taking Monsanto longer to turn a profit: At the time of the Climate acquisition, officials told Reuters they expected it to boost Monsanto's earnings within two years.Monsanto's business model for Climate, too, has shifted since the acquisition and transformed the seed company to some degree, Fraley said. ""We're utilizing the Climate tools in our (internal) breeding program, in our manufacturing programs for seed production and in the customer interface. Truly, the digital tools are changing the way the company does its research and develops its products,"" Fraley said.Climate's Field View platform is being used on nearly 100 million U.S. farm acres today, with about 15 million acres in its premium paid services.

486,"   By Rod Nickel and Michael Hirtzer | WINNIPEG/CHICAGO  WINNIPEG/CHICAGO North American farmers will pressure regulators to protect their negotiating leverage with fertilizer suppliers if Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium Inc agree to merge, major farm groups said on Wednesday.The potential deal revealed on Tuesday would combine the world's largest fertilizer producer by capacity with the continent's biggest network of farm retail dealers and consolidate 60 percent of North America's potash production with one company.The tie-up would face regulatory scrutiny in both the United States and Canada. For farmers, already facing the prospect of fewer buying choices for seed and chemicals, the potential merger raises fears they will lose pricing power. Independent retailers in the United States and Canada worry about competing against a fertilizer Goliath that may stock its stores at preferential rates.""It's like the movie 'Mad Max' - one company owns everything,"" said Norm Hall, president of Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan. ""There’s less and less competition out there. We’re being painted into a box because of corporate greed."" The group, based in Canada's largest crop-growing province, will raise concerns with the federal Competition Bureau if the merger proceeds, Hall said.Likewise, Manitoba's Keystone Agricultural Producers will ask the bureau to weigh the risk of higher farm costs, said president Dan Mazier.The Competition Bureau routinely contacts industry groups when it reviews proposed mergers, said spokeswoman Sophie Paluck-Bastien.The American Soybean Association, which represents 21,000 U.S. farmers, might complain to U.S. regulators if the merger advances. It opposes deals that limit competition and drive up prices, said spokesman Patrick Delaney, noting that the combined company would be ""dominant"" in North America. Potash Corp declined to comment and Agrium did not respond.FARM INCOMES SUFFERING Potash prices fell to decade lows this year, pressured by excess capacity and weak demand, but North American farm incomes have also suffered as corn and wheat prices tumbled to multi year lows. Proposed tie-ups between big seed companies Monsanto Co and Bayer AG, and ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] and Syngenta, have raised alarm among farmers, and the U.S. Justice Department is suing to stop Deere & Co from buying Monsanto's Precision Planting farm equipment business.  Fertilizer accounts for as much as one-third of input costs for U.S. corn farmers, according to the National Corn Growers Association.""The cost of farm inputs is a major concern to corn growers right now,"" said Cathryn Wojcicki, spokeswoman for the association. It will scrutinize the Potash-Agrium merger if it proceeds, she said.Agrium’s farm retail rivals, which include small cooperatives and independent dealers, are also wary.Regulators should ensure that the merged company supplies retailers under similar terms as before, said Randy Stephens, president of SureGrow Ag Products, which has three retail stores in Texas. ""They'll always be selling to (their own stores) at a discount to anyone else,"" Stephens said. Kevin Blair, chief executive of a family-owned chain of eight farm retail stores in Saskatchewan, said he would be shocked if the merger is approved in Canada.""Does it put us at a competitive disadvantage? Absolutely. But more important, it puts the grower at a disadvantage,"" Blair said.But Charles Neivert, analyst for Cowen Securities, said there is little reason to worry about competition.If the new company hikes fertilizer prices in the United States, lower-cost offshore producers would increase shipments, he said. Agrium's retail stores are already stocked mostly with its own fertilizer, leaving little room for additional supplies from Potash Corp, he added.Canadian Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains told reporters that his government was ""definitely keeping an eye on"" the possible merger, but added that Ottawa wants Canadian companies to have global success.

The German group reiterated that its crop protection unit would seek to match last year's profitability in 2016, ""which is a stretch but that's our commitment,"" the unit's head Markus Heldt said at a news conference at BASF's Ludwigshafen headquarters.Among farmers, there is ""a wait and see mentality with regard to investment and spending on crop protection,"" said BASF's Harald Schwager, management board member in charge of the unit. The crop protection and seeds industries have been hit by low prices for agricultural produce, Latin American farmers struggling to get bank credit for procurement expenses and weak emerging-market currencies.BASF's crop protection division in 2015 chalked up earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) before special items of 1.1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) over sales of 5.8 billion euros, a margin of 18.7 percent. The group, which also produces industrial chemicals, engineering plastics, oil and gas, has remained on the sidelines of major consolidation moves in the agricultural industry. It said on Tuesday it would lie in wait for antitrust-related selloff of businesses as rivals merge.German rival Bayer said over night that merger negotiations with Monsanto Co had advanced and that it was willing to sweeten its offer to more than $65 billion to acquire the world's largest seeds company.($1 = 0.8961 euros)   (Editing by Maria Sheahan)",2016-09-06,MON,"Tue Sep 6, 2016 | 4:36am EDT",UPDATE 1-BASF warns crop protection markets to remain challenging,http://www.reuters.com//article/basf-cropprotection-idUSL8N1BI1KE?type=companyNews

509,"   By Rod Nickel and Siddharth Cavale  Canadian fertilizer producers Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc and Agrium Inc agreed to combine to navigate a severe industry slump by boosting efficiency and cutting costs, but the new company's potential pricing power may attract tough regulatory scrutiny.    The proposed all-stock tie-up comes as industry profits have fallen due to excessive supply and soft farm incomes. It would combine Potash's crop nutrient production capacity, the world's largest, with Agrium's farm retail network, North America's biggest, plus its own potash mine and fertilizer plants. Potash shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company, with a market capitalization of $26 billion. Agrium shareholders will own the rest if the deal closes in mid-2017 as planned.Agrium Chief Executive Officer Chuck Magro will be CEO of the merged company. Potash Chief Executive Jochen Tilk, who will become executive chairman, said the structure would create an ""equal partnership.""""Chuck and I will run this company together,"" he said in an interview.Tilk said he was confident the transaction would receive regulators' approval as proposed, without the need for divestitures.But others were skeptical that regulators would approve a company that would control nearly two-thirds of North American potash capacity and almost one-third of phosphate and nitrogen capacity there. Fertilizer makes up as much as one-third of costs for U.S. corn farmers, who are already hurting due to falling grain prices.""This deal has some real antitrust concerns,"" said Seth Bloom, a U.S. Justice Department veteran who is now at Bloom Strategic Consulting. An antitrust review is unlikely before January, when a new U.S. president takes office, he added.The merger would leave Mosaic Co as North America's only other major potash producer. When just three companies dominate an industry, a merger of two of them is generally considered risky, said a U.S. antitrust expert who requested anonymity to protect business relationships. Potash Corp's U.S.-listed shares fell 1.1 percent to $16.78, while Agrium shed 2.5 percent to $92.80.COST SAVINGS  Agrium's Magro said the companies' plan to wring up to $500 million in synergies out of the deal, such as by combining Agrium's western North America-based nitrogen business with Potash Corp's in the East, would make for a more efficient industry. ""In commodities, lower costs will be good for everyone, including the farmer,"" he said in an interview.Annual cost savings would come from areas including distribution and retail integration, production and procurement but not from shutting any potash mines.The deal would dilute the importance of Agrium's retail system, which sells fertilizer, seeds and chemicals to farmers, making it less strategically sound in the long term, said Robert Spafford, portfolio manager at Cidel Asset Management, which owns Agrium stock.""One of the reasons most investors own Agrium is the retail business,"" said Spafford. ""(Retail) is a much more stable business than the wholesale business."" The deal may have implications for Canpotex Ltd, which the two companies own with Mosaic. Tilk and Magro said they were committed to keep selling potash to offshore markets through Canpotex.Each of the three companies has equal sway in Canpotex board votes. Tilk said Mosaic would remain an equal partner, although details must still be worked out.Mosaic spokesman Ben Pratt declined to comment on the merger but said the precedent within Canpotex was one vote per company.After the transaction closes, the new company will be based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a key factor in winning over province Premier Brad Wall, whose influence is seen as important.""On the whole, it looks quite positive,"" Wall told reporters.Financial advisers include Barclays Capital Inc and CIBC Capital Markets for Agrium, and BofA Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets for Potash. Morgan Stanley & Co LLC is financial adviser to both.Stikeman Elliott LLP and Jones Day are legal advisers to Potash.

511,"   By Arno Schuetze and Greg Roumeliotis  Monsanto's board is set to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to approve a sale to Germany's Bayer  for more than $65 billion after concluding more than four months of negotiations, people familiar with the matter said.The deal is expected to value Monsanto, the world's largest seeds firm, at a little more than the sweetened $127.50 per share cash offer that the German pharmaceuticals and crop chemicals maker disclosed last week, the people told Reuters.Bayer's supervisory board is due to follow suit and meet on  Wednesday to deliberate on Monsanto's response, the sources said, adding that it is still possible that the deal hits a snag with the board of either company.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Bayer and Monsanto declined to comment. Monsanto's shares were 1 percent lower at $105.82 at 1513 GMT, when Bayer's shares were down 0.3 percent at 93.29 euros.Bayer said last week talks with Monsanto had advanced and that it was willing to offer $127.50 per share, up from $125 previously, valuing Monsanto at more than $65 billion, including debt. Sources told Reuters that topping up the price secured Bayer access to more privileged information on Monsanto's business performance and paved the way for more detailed negotiations.""Given recent updates on the Monsanto approach suggest a final conclusion may be close, we suspect (Bayer) will work hard to try and reach a final conclusion before the Meet Management event, if possible,"" Jefferies Research analyst Jeffrey Wolford said in a research note before the news, referring to Bayer's presentations day for analysts and investors in Cologne next Tuesday. Bayer is trying to combine its crop chemicals business, the world's second-largest after Syngenta, with Monsanto's industry leading seeds business, the latest in a series of major consolidation moves in the agrochemical sector.U.S. chemicals giants Dow Chemical and DuPont  have agreed to merge and spin off their respective seeds and crop chemicals operations into a major agribusiness.Syngenta last year fought off unwanted suitor Monsanto, only to later agree to a takeover by ChemChina.(Additional reporting by Patricia Weiss and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt, Oliver Hirt in Zurich)",2016-09-13,MON,"Tue Sep 13, 2016 | 12:17pm EDT",Monsanto board close to giving nod to Bayer deal on Tuesday -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/monsanto-ma-bayer-board-idUSL1N1BP10P?type=companyNews

513,"   By Gustavo Bonato | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO South American farmers are expected to sow 57 percent more area with Monsanto Co's second-generation, genetically modified soybean seed Intacta RR2 Pro in the new planting season which kicks off on Thursday, a company executive said on Wednesday.Intacta, which tolerates the herbicide glyphosate and resists caterpillars, was planted on 14 million hectares in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay in 2015/2016.Farmers are expected to plant 18 million to 22 million hectares this season, Maria Luiza Nachreiner, head of South American soy operations, said in an interview before Monsanto announced it would accept a $66 billion takeover bid from rival Bayer.""We have a positive outlook this crop,"" Nachreiner said. Intacta will account for 31 percent to 38 percent of the planted area in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, up from 24 percent this season, she noted.Monsanto does not release specific numbers about the area planted with its seeds in Brazil, the world's largest soybean exporter. For years, its Roundup Ready Soybeans dominated the regional GMO seed market, peaking in 2013/14 with 84 percent of Brazil's soybean area, according to data from local consultant Celeres.Soon after, the company began offering Intacta soybeans, which have increased resistance to caterpillars. The insects have become a serious threat in the tropical growing regions of Brazil's center-west where no hard freezes help contain their populations. Unlike Roundup Ready, Intacta is not expected to dominate the soy seed market because new options will soon be available, Nachreiner said. ""In two years, there will be new companies with competing biotechnology. Roundup Ready never faced that scenario.""Monsanto recommends that farmers do not plant Intacta exclusively on their soy fields, but set aside 20 percent for a soy variety without caterpillar protection to attract the pests for farmers to control with insecticide. Rivals Basf and Bayer recently got regulatory clearance and launched their own soy seed technologies in Brazil.Nachreiner declined to comment on Bayer's planned takeover of Monsanto. The deal is expected to raise regulatory concerns about the companies' dominant positions in some of Brazil's seed markets.

Still, marrying two of the world's top farm suppliers, at a time when rivals are also merging, is fueling concern over fewer players competing in the $100 billion global market.Monsanto and Bayer ""have chosen to do a deal in the year of merging dangerously,"" said David Balto, a former policy director at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. ""They are in for a tough time.""U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has called a hearing next Tuesday to scrutinize the wave of consolidation. Farmers in Iowa, the Republican senator's home state, are worried that seed and chemical costs are rising while a global glut of grain has pushed prices close to their lowest levels in years. Farm incomes have plunged.Monsanto agreed to sell itself to Bayer for $128 per share in cash, yet its shares were hovering around $107 on Wednesday, reflecting the significant regulatory uncertainty surrounding the deal in the minds of investors. Bayer has agreed to pay Monsanto a $2 billion breakup fee if regulators thwart the deal.The German company aims to create a one-stop shop for seeds, crop chemicals and computer-aided services to farmers.That was also the idea behind Monsanto's swoop on Syngenta AG last year. The Swiss company fended off that offer only to agree later to a takeover by China's state-owned ChemChina.U.S. chemicals giants Dow Chemical Co and DuPont  plan to merge and later spin off their respective seeds and crop chemicals operations into a major agribusiness.If all of the deals close, three companies would control nearly 70 percent of the world's pesticide market and 80 percent of the U.S. corn-seed market. Other agricultural sectors are also consolidating.Canadian fertilizer producers Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc and Agrium Inc said on Monday they agreed to merge, sparking questions of whether the new company's potential pricing power would attract tough regulatory scrutiny.INEVITABLE SCRUTINY Dealmakers trying to push through aggressive mega-deals in corporate America have had a tough year.Antitrust authorities have challenged deals ranging from oilfield services mergers to health insurance buyouts, while other regulators have sought to crack down on deals that aid tax avoidance or risk harming national security.

Monsanto and Bayer have had ""initial contacts with regulatory agencies describing what this combination would be about,"" Bayer Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said on an investor call on Wednesday, and ""received encouraging feedback.""TOUGH YEAR But U.S. antitrust enforcers will look at more than product overlaps in assessing the proposed merger, said Moss.""People don't get the enormous impact that these deals can have on innovation markets.

In soybean seeds and traits, the group estimated a merged Dow/DuPont would have about 38 percent. Monsanto-Bayer would have 28 percent.One unknown factor that will influence these ag-related deals is the U.S. political landscape after the November federal election.Maurice Stucke, formerly in the Justice Department now with the Konkurrenz Group, said it was highly unlikely that Obama administration antitrust enforcers, who have knocked down a long list of big mergers in concentrated industries this year, would make the final decision in the Bayer-Monsanto deal.""Merger reviews of this complexity would take six to nine months,"" Stucke said.

527,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Ludwig Burger   (Story refiles to change day of Potash/Agrium deal in paragraph 21 of September 14th story to Monday from Tuesday)By Greg Roumeliotis and Ludwig BurgerNEW YORK/FRANKFURT German drug and crop chemical maker Bayer clinched a $66 billion takeover of U.S. seeds company Monsanto on Wednesday, ending months of wrangling with a third sweetened offer that marks the largest all-cash deal on record.The $128-a-share deal, up from Bayer's previous offer of $127.50 a share, has emerged as the signature deal in a consolidation race that has roiled the agribusiness sector in recent years, due to shifting weather patterns, intense competition in grain exports and a souring global farm economy.""Bayer’s competitors are merging, so not doing this deal would mean having a competitive disadvantage,"" said fund manager Markus Manns of Union Investment, one of Bayer’s top 12 investors.Grain prices are hovering near their lowest levels in years amid a global supply glut, and farm incomes have plunged.But the proposed merger will likely face an intense and lengthy regulatory process in the United States, Canada, Brazil, the European Union and elsewhere. Hugh Grant, Monsanto's chief executive, said Wednesday the companies will need to file in about 30 jurisdictions for the merger.Competition authorities are likely to scrutinize the tie-up closely, and some of Bayer's own shareholders have been highly critical of a takeover that they say risks overpaying and neglecting the company's pharmaceutical business.If the deal closes, it will create a company commanding more than a quarter of the combined world market for seeds and pesticides in the fast-consolidating farm supplies industry.What the newly-formed company would be named is unclear.Grant said on Wednesday's media conference call that the future of the Monsanto brand has not yet been discussed, but the world's largest seed company is ""flexible"" about the name going forward.The transaction includes a $2-billion break-up fee that Bayer will pay to Monsanto should it fail to get regulatory clearance. Bayer expects the deal to close by the end of 2017. The details confirm what a source close to the matter told Reuters earlier.Baader Helevea Equity Research analyst Jacob Thrane, with a ""sell"" rating on Bayer, said the German company was paying 16.1 times Monsanto's forecast core earnings for 2017, more than the 15.5 times ChemChina agreed to pay for Swiss crop chemicals firm Syngenta last year.      He also said there was uncertainty over what the combined company would look like as regulators might demand asset sales. Bernstein Research analysts said on Tuesday they saw only a 50 percent chance of the deal winning regulatory clearance, although they cited a survey among investors that put the likelihood at 70 percent on average.""We believe political push-back to this deal, ranging from farmer dissatisfaction with all their suppliers consolidating in the face of low farm net incomes to dissatisfaction with Monsanto leaving the United States, could provide significant delays and complications,"" they wrote in a research note. Bayer said it was offering a 44-percent premium to Monsanto's share price on May 9, the day before it made its first written proposal. It plans to raise $19 billion to help fund the deal by issuing convertible bonds and new shares to its existing shareholders, and said banks had also committed to providing $57 billion of bridge financing. Bayer shares rose 0.3 percent to 93.55 euros. Monsanto's were up 0.6 percent at $106.76. ONE-STOP SHOP Bayer's move to combine its crop chemicals business, the world's second-largest after Syngenta AG, with Monsanto's industry-leading seeds business, is the latest in a series of major agrochemicals tie-ups.The German company is aiming to create a one-stop shop for seeds, crop chemicals and computer-aided services to farmers.    That was also the idea behind Monsanto's swoop on Syngenta last year, which the Swiss company fended off, only to agree later to a takeover by China's state-owned ChemChina.     U.S. chemicals giants Dow Chemical and DuPont plan to merge and later spin off their respective seeds and crop chemicals operations into a major agribusiness.And on Monday, Canadian fertilizer producers Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc and Agrium Inc agreed to combine to navigate a severe industry slump, but the new company's potential pricing power may attract tough regulatory scrutiny.    The Bayer-Monsanto deal will be the largest ever involving a German buyer, beating Daimler's tie-up with Chrysler in 1998, which valued the U.S. carmaker at more than $40 billion.

528,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Ludwig Burger   (Story refiles to change day of Potash/Agrium deal in paragraph 21 of September 14th story to Monday from Tuesday)By Greg Roumeliotis and Ludwig BurgerNEW YORK/FRANKFURT German drug and crop chemical maker Bayer clinched a $66 billion takeover of U.S. seeds company Monsanto on Wednesday, ending months of wrangling with a third sweetened offer that marks the largest all-cash deal on record.The $128-a-share deal, up from Bayer's previous offer of $127.50 a share, has emerged as the signature deal in a consolidation race that has roiled the agribusiness sector in recent years, due to shifting weather patterns, intense competition in grain exports and a souring global farm economy.""Bayer’s competitors are merging, so not doing this deal would mean having a competitive disadvantage,"" said fund manager Markus Manns of Union Investment, one of Bayer’s top 12 investors.Grain prices are hovering near their lowest levels in years amid a global supply glut, and farm incomes have plunged.But the proposed merger will likely face an intense and lengthy regulatory process in the United States, Canada, Brazil, the European Union and elsewhere. Hugh Grant, Monsanto's chief executive, said Wednesday the companies will need to file in about 30 jurisdictions for the merger.Competition authorities are likely to scrutinize the tie-up closely, and some of Bayer's own shareholders have been highly critical of a takeover that they say risks overpaying and neglecting the company's pharmaceutical business.If the deal closes, it will create a company commanding more than a quarter of the combined world market for seeds and pesticides in the fast-consolidating farm supplies industry.What the newly-formed company would be named is unclear.Grant said on Wednesday's media conference call that the future of the Monsanto brand has not yet been discussed, but the world's largest seed company is ""flexible"" about the name going forward.The transaction includes a $2-billion break-up fee that Bayer will pay to Monsanto should it fail to get regulatory clearance. Bayer expects the deal to close by the end of 2017. The details confirm what a source close to the matter told Reuters earlier.Baader Helevea Equity Research analyst Jacob Thrane, with a ""sell"" rating on Bayer, said the German company was paying 16.1 times Monsanto's forecast core earnings for 2017, more than the 15.5 times ChemChina agreed to pay for Swiss crop chemicals firm Syngenta last year.      He also said there was uncertainty over what the combined company would look like as regulators might demand asset sales. Bernstein Research analysts said on Tuesday they saw only a 50 percent chance of the deal winning regulatory clearance, although they cited a survey among investors that put the likelihood at 70 percent on average.""We believe political push-back to this deal, ranging from farmer dissatisfaction with all their suppliers consolidating in the face of low farm net incomes to dissatisfaction with Monsanto leaving the United States, could provide significant delays and complications,"" they wrote in a research note. Bayer said it was offering a 44-percent premium to Monsanto's share price on May 9, the day before it made its first written proposal. It plans to raise $19 billion to help fund the deal by issuing convertible bonds and new shares to its existing shareholders, and said banks had also committed to providing $57 billion of bridge financing. Bayer shares rose 0.3 percent to 93.55 euros. Monsanto's were up 0.6 percent at $106.76. ONE-STOP SHOP Bayer's move to combine its crop chemicals business, the world's second-largest after Syngenta AG, with Monsanto's industry-leading seeds business, is the latest in a series of major agrochemicals tie-ups.The German company is aiming to create a one-stop shop for seeds, crop chemicals and computer-aided services to farmers.    That was also the idea behind Monsanto's swoop on Syngenta last year, which the Swiss company fended off, only to agree later to a takeover by China's state-owned ChemChina.     U.S. chemicals giants Dow Chemical and DuPont plan to merge and later spin off their respective seeds and crop chemicals operations into a major agribusiness.And on Monday, Canadian fertilizer producers Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc and Agrium Inc agreed to combine to navigate a severe industry slump, but the new company's potential pricing power may attract tough regulatory scrutiny.    The Bayer-Monsanto deal will be the largest ever involving a German buyer, beating Daimler's tie-up with Chrysler in 1998, which valued the U.S. carmaker at more than $40 billion. It will also be the largest all-cash transaction on record, ahead of brewer InBev's $60.4 billion offer for Anheuser-Busch in 2008.Bayer said it expected the deal to boost its core earnings per share in the first full year following completion, and by a double-digit percentage in the third year.

The smaller animal health unit could also slightly increase margins, Bayer said.In consumer health, previously boosted by the acquisition of brands from Merck & Co (MRK.N), it now sees sales adjusted for currency swings growing by between 4 and 5 percent by the end of 2018 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 25 percent, up from 24 percent in 2015.Bayer has ""underestimated the country risk from Emerging Markets volatility"", the company said in presentation slides. It also cited ""stronger business disruption than anticipated during the integration of Merck Consumer Care and Dihon in China"", referring to a Chinese non-prescription drugs unit it acquired in 2014.""2018 EBITDA guidance for Pharma and Animal Health may ... offer some upside against consensus, though the consumer margin guidance may disappoint slightly,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors.

536,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Novozymes (NZYMb.CO), already grappling with the consequences of low oil and crop prices, is watching anxiously to see what Bayer's (BAYGn.DE) purchase of Monsanto (MON.N) will mean for the Danish group's ties with its key agricultural partner.Chief Executive Peder Holk Nielsen said in an interview that a merged Bayer-Monsanto could extend the market for the company's smart microbial crop-boosting products, known as inoculants, but added the union also brings uncertainties.""Of course, in the short-term we can all worry about the distraction that a $66 billion acquisition can bring and it is one of the things we have in our risk matrix,"" he told Reuters on a visit to London.""But we think the results we have created together with Monsanto are quite significant and if the deal is concluded I think it would make a lot of sense to bring that into the new company.""Nielsen has not yet held any discussions with Bayer about the future of its strategic tie-up with Monsanto, the BioAg Alliance, but said he expected to do so before the takeover is completed. Novozymes is relying on the alliance, which covers the sale of inoculants, to drive growth and restore sales. The agreed purchase of U.S. seeds company Monsanto by Germany's Bayer is the signature deal in a wave of agribusiness takeovers in recent years. Monsanto shares are still trading well below Bayer's offer price, however, reflecting worries that the merger could stall on antitrust issues.The takeover comes at a challenging time for Novozymes, which was spun off from drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) in 2000.Nielsen disappointed investors last month by lowering the forecast for sales growth this year to only 2-4 percent and warning it would take time to return to more typical growth levels of 6-7 percent. Novozymes had been doing well until recently by selling enzymes that replace chemicals in detergents and also help in the production of bioethanol and animal feed.But it has been hit by a fall in oil prices, which has slowed the development of so-called advanced biofuels made from non-edible biomass. Weak agricultural commodity prices have also reduced the incentive for farmers to invest in its inoculants.The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted last month that farm incomes could reach their lowest point this year since 2009, hit by low corn and soy prices. ""Farmers in the U.S. are clearly being careful with their discretionary spending,"" Nielsen said.The BioAg Alliance currently has around 65 million acres sown with seed using its products, mainly soybeans, but it is hoping to increase that to between 250 million and 500 million acres with the rollout of a corn inoculant in time for the 2017 season.Analysts such as those at Berenberg Bank, which this week initiated coverage of Novozymes with a ""sell"" rating, fear that a weak agricultural economy will weigh on adoption of inoculants and hit selling prices, adding to the company's hard times.

It expects fiscal year 2017 earnings per share of $3.83 to $4.35 on an as-reported basis, which included costs related to the Bayer transaction of 27 to 34 cents. On an ongoing basis, EPS was expected between $4.50 and $4.90 a share, assuming stable currencies, the company said.Monsanto, whose shares traded on either side of the previous day's close on Wednesday, did not offer any update on potential divestitures related to the Bayer deal but said it expects the deal to close by the end of 2017 as previously stated.Some farm groups, seed companies and lawmakers have raised concerns about the deal, saying it could result in higher prices and reduced choices for farmers. Bayer and Monsanto have said they are confident that the deal will pass regulatory muster. Bayer has said it is committed to divest up to $1.6 billion of its portfolio to win approval.The net loss attributable to Monsanto narrowed to $191 million, or 44 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 from $495 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.

543,"  SAO PAULO Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Brazilian lender Banco Votorantim are investing together in financial technology startups, executives said in a Monday interview, as the U.S. tech company adds a new specialty to its venture capital portfolio in Brazil.Votorantim will invest an initial 3 million reais ($930,000) in the BR Startups fund created by Microsoft, with an expectation of funding about a half dozen young firms with investments ranging between 250,000 reais and 1.5 million reais.The partnership underscores how Brazilian banks are looking to ride a wave of innovative financial startups, known as fintechs, which caught peers in more mature markets off-guard over the past decade.""We're looking for startups that have passed the validation and product development stage and need capital to scale up and gain traction in the market,"" said Gabriel Ferreira, head of strategy, planning and retail lending at Banco Votorantim. Those young companies are likely to fall in a ""valley of death"" between early seed capital and the larger rounds led by traditional venture capital firms, according to Franklin Luzes, chief operating officer of Microsoft Participações, the U.S. company's Brazilian investment arm.Microsoft set up BR Startups in 2014 to fill that niche and the fund has now grown to 17 million reais, backing about 70 startups and steering six to acquisitions, Luzes said.  Funding has become especially scarce in Brazil in recent years as interest rates climbed to a decade high amid the country's worst economic recession since at least the 1930s.BR Startups has focused this year on partnerships with ""anchor investors"" such as Banco Votorantim to focus on investing in their areas of expertise, Luzes said. The first such venture came in July, when the fund partnered with Monsanto Co (MON.N) to invest in agribusiness startups.

544,"   By Arno Schuetze, Pamela Barbaglia and Ludwig Burger | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Bayer (BAYGn.DE) has short-listed India's Lupin (LUPN.NS) and  investor BC Partners as prospective buyers of medical skin cream assets in a potential 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) deal, several people familiar with the sale told Reuters.Germany's Bayer has for more than two years sought to narrow the focus of its healthcare division and its planned $66 billion Monsanto (MON.N) takeover has added urgency to that drive.    Bayer has, however, said a debt package and cash call would suffice to finance the Monsanto purchase, its largest ever transaction.Lupin is mainly attracted by the Bayer dermatology business's regional presence in North America, where the Indian maker of generic and specialty drugs is keen to expand, one of the sources said. Buyout firm BC Partners, in turn, has for a while tried to add more healthcare assets to its portfolio.It could not be learned how many other prospective buyers are still in the race. The Bayer unit sells established skin cream brands such as Desonate against allergic skin reaction, Finacea to ease rosacea symptoms as well as acne treatment Skinoren.The business is expected to fetch close to 1 billion euros at least, or more than 9 times its expected core earnings of more than 100 million euros. Lupin was not immediately available for comment, while BC Partners and Bayer declined to comment. Bayer has been shedding assets such as vascular catheters or blood glucose meters. It is exploring the sale of its $3 billion radiology contrast agents unit but the dermatology auction is taking precedence for now, according to people close to the matter.Bayer has already looked into initial offers and picked some suitors to advance to the second round of bids, which are due in the coming weeks, the sources said. Drugmakers Mylan (MYL.O) and Almirall (ALM.MC) as well as Nestle (NESN.S) have lost interest in the asset, they said.Industry experts said financial investors were attracted by the mature brands' reliable income stream while drug makers were discouraged by their limited growth prospects.

Sales of prescription drugs rose more than 7 percent, led by stroke-prevention pill Xarelto and eye drug Eylea, broadly in line with the market view, but Bayer unexpectedly managed to keep selling expenses flat.Bayer shares were flat in early trading, slightly outperforming the German blue-chip index, which slid 0.3 percent. Bayer's plastics business Covestro already reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, boosted by growth in China and by rivals' production outages.Bayer's crop protection division, traditionally weak in the third quarter, managed to lift prices even though subdued demand, particularly in Latin America, showed no signs of rebounding.Bayer, the inventor of aspirin and maker of Yasmin birth control pills, now aims to increase full-year core earnings per share from continuing operations by a high-single-digit percentage, compared with a previous goal of a mid- to high-single-digit percentage gain.Under its plan to close the $66 billion Monsanto deal by end-2017, Bayer said it would seek approval in the United States before the end of 2016, followed by the European Union likely in the first quarter of 2017.

551,"  Nov 9 U.S. seeds and agrochemicals maker Monsanto Co has secured approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for a new dicamba-based weed killer designed for its next generation biotech soy and cotton varieties, the company said on Wednesday.While approval had been expected, it is seen as a major step forward for the company's newest herbicide tolerant products amid rising problems in the U.S. farm belt with weeds resistant to glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup weed killer.Environmental groups criticized the EPA approval.The Center for Biological Diversity said the ruling would lead to sharp increases in pesticide use that could harm threatened plant and animal species, including the whooping crane. ""Piling on more pesticides will just result in superweeds resistant to more pesticides,"" said Nathan Donley, a scientist with the group.The EPA signed off on Monsanto's XtendiMax herbicide for in-crop use on Roundup Ready 2 Xtend biotech soybeans, designed to tolerate applications of glyphosate and dicamba, and its Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton, which can tolerate the two chemicals as well as glufosinate. The company is still awaiting an EPA ruling on its Roundup Xtend herbicide, a glyphosate and dicamba blend.Farmers have used dicamba for years to kill weeds ahead of planting, but until now have not been allowed to use it on growing crops. Monsanto has invested more than $1 billion in a dicamba production facility in Luling, Louisiana, to supply demand it expects will blossom in the coming years. The company has said the Xtend platform will be its largest-ever technology launch.The company said it expects the soybean variety to be planted on 15 million U.S. acres in 2017 and its cotton to be planted on more than 3 million acres.(Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; editing by Diane Craft)",2016-11-10,MON,"Wed Nov 9, 2016 | 7:04pm EST",EPA approves Monsanto's dicamba weed killer,http://www.reuters.com//article/monsanto-epa-dicamba-idUSL1N1DA3YS?type=companyNews

557,"  Washington state filed an environmental lawsuit on Thursday against agricultural company Monsanto Co seeking damages and cleanup costs associated with the company's production of PCBs, the state's attorney general said.Monsanto produced the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ""for decades while hiding what they knew about the toxic chemicals' harm to human health and the environment,"" Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement.St. Louis-based Monsanto, whose products include genetically modified crop seeds and pesticides, said the lawsuit, which was filed in King County Superior Court, lacked merit.""This case is highly experimental because it seeks to target a product manufacturer for selling a lawful and useful chemical four to eight decades ago that was applied by the U.S. government, Washington State, local cities, and industries into many products to make them safer,"" Monsanto Vice President Scott Partridge said in a statement.PCBs, once used widely to insulate electrical equipment and in products like paint and caulk, have been linked to cancer, immune system difficulties and other health problems. The manufacture of PCBs was banned in the United States in 1979. Monsanto was the only U.S. producer of PCBs between 1935 and 1979, Ferguson said.The lawsuit - against Monsanto and two of its splinter companies, Solutia Inc and Pharmacia LLC - seeks compensation for damages to Washington state's natural resources, including the economic impact to the state and its residents, Ferguson said. ""PCBs have been found in bays, rivers, streams, sediment, soil and air throughout Washington state, with more than 600 suspected or confirmed contamination sites from Puget Sound to the Wenatchee River, Lake Spokane to Commencement Bay,"" he said.The company faces lawsuits by at least eight West Coast cities raising similar claims. In September, German chemicals and healthcare group Bayer AG made an offer to buy Monsanto for $66 billion. The deal has to be cleared by regulatory authorities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.
