2,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON May 6 If you're looking for top performing U.S. junk bond funds, pick one that's maxed out in stocks.Bond-fund managers at Loomis Sayles, Fidelity and Eaton Vance are trouncing their benchmarks and almost all their peers by taking advantage of asset allocation rules that permit as much as 35 percent of their holdings in stocks.""Prices are sky high in all sectors of the fixed income market,"" said Matthew Eagan, a portfolio manager at the $18 billion Loomis Sayles Strategic Income Fund. That's why Eagan and some of his competitors are boosting returns by buying stocks and building on existing positions that deliver a one-two punch of dividend yield and capital appreciation.Eagan's bond fund has a 1-year return of 7.92 percent, easily beating the 0.21 advance of its benchmark index and better than 98 percent of its peers in the multisector bond category, according to Morningstar Inc. Its No. 2 overall holding, shares of Corning Inc, have surged 18 percent this year and 41 percent in the past 12 months.Doing even better is the Eaton Vance Bond Fund, whose 1-year return is 9.81 percentage points higher than its benchmark. It is the best performing multisector bond fund with a 1-year return of 10.02 percent, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company.  The $664 million fund's portfolio is about 16 percent to 18 percent invested in stocks, portfolio manager Kathleen Gaffney said.During last month's sell-off of momentum stocks such as biotechnology companies, the Eaton Vance fund took advantage of the stock market dip by adding to existing stock positions, Gaffney said. The fund's largest stock holdings include Ingersoll-Rand PLC, Regions Financial Corp <RF. N>, SLM Corp and Kinder Morgan Inc.Fidelity Investments junk bond fund manager Mark Notkin said the earnings yield of stocks in the S&P 500 Index is now about 6.25 percent. That's better than the 5.2 percent yield of junk bonds, which typically have the highest yields in the bond market.Earnings yield is the inverse of a stock's price-to-earnings ratio and shows the percentage of each dollar invested in the stock that was earned by the company. It's calculated by dividing the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period with the current market price per share. The earnings yield on S&P 500 stocks has been beating junk bond yields ever since the beginning of the economic recovery, with some of the most pronounced gains coming this month, according to Reuters data. ""Historically, if you look back 25 years, high-yield would be several hundred basis points more than the earnings yield of the S&P 500,"" Notkin said. ""Now, the S&P is a 100 basis points more than the high-yield market. That isn't a little off-kilter, but substantially off-kilter.""Notkin said that's a reason to buy stocks, which he said could outperform junk bond yields for the next two to three years.The Lipper Core Bond Funds index is up 0.11 percent for the 1-year period, as of May 2. And that same index is up 3.2 percent year to date, as of May 2.To be sure, bond fund managers still have to be able to pick the right stocks. The Pioneer High Yield Fund, whose portfolio managers declined to comment, hit some turbulence in the first quarter with its stock selection. The portfolio's allocation to equities was the largest detractor from relative returns. The fund's Class A shares returned 2.6 percent in the quarter, compared to the 3 percent return on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index.One of the fund's stock picks, General Cable Corp, is down 19 percent this year after the company said its income from Venezuela would fall because of changes in the currency exchange rate, pricing controls and social unrest in that country.MANDATE FLEXIBILITY Some multisector and junk bond funds have the flexibility in their mandates to buy stocks and preferred stocks in addition to their holdings of bonds of all stripes. Eagan's fund at Loomis Sayles, for example, can hold as much as 35 percent of its assets in preferred stocks and dividend-paying common stocks.The $10.3 billion Fidelity Capital & Income Fund  run by Notkin, has been maxed out for several quarters with almost 20 percent of its portfolio in stocks, according to its latest fund disclosure. Notkin's bet on Station Casinos was a top contributor to the Fidelity fund's first-quarter performance after the casino operator got a lift from better-than-expected results from its Las Vegas operations.United Rentals Inc, a top stock holding in Notkin's fund, has climbed 18 percent in the past three months as a recovery in the commercial construction industry boosts demand and rental rates for the company's equipment.Notkin's fund has been on a winning streak for a long time, posting a 5-year average annual return of 16.93 percent, compared to the benchmark average annual return of 4.89 percent, according to Morningstar.That puts Notkin's fund in the top 97 percent in high-yield bond category. The fund's 1-year return of 7.59 percent has been helped by avoiding pricey high-yield debt that's trading above par.Bond fund managers who venture into the stock market tend to be value investors, hunting for large-cap, dividend-rich stocks that come with solid balance sheets and strong cash flow.""I stay away from the high flyers,"" Eaton Vance's Gaffney said. She added that stocks shelter part of her portfolio from the interest-rate risk that can hurt a bond fund's performance.If a stock has a dividend yield of around 4 percent, it's fine with some bond fund managers if its share price does little in the way of appreciation.""Four percent is shaping up to be a good number for all bond managers in 2014,"" said Eagan at Loomis Sayles.(Reporting By Tim McLaughlin)",2014-05-06,RF,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 11:53am EDT",Junk bond fund yields trounce peers as managers buy stocks to boost returns,http://www.reuters.com//article/funds-bonds-stocks-idUSL2N0NR18W20140506?type=companyNews

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Regions Financial  Corporation's (RF) ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' and revised the Rating Outlook  to Stable from Positive. The upgrade was supported by asset quality improvement,  a strong capital profile, and a generally recovering overall risk profile. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDR, VR and Senior Fitch upgraded RF's ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' and revised the Outlook to  Stable from Positive. The upgrade was supported by asset quality improvement, a  strong capital profile, and a generally recovering overall risk profile. RF's  ratings remain relatively low as compared to its peer group despite the upgrade.  The upgrade and Stable Outlook incorporate Fitch's expectations of an improving  earnings profile over time. RF has reported meaningful asset quality improvement over the past 12 months  with non-performing assets, inclusive of accruing troubled debt restructurings,  falling from almost 6% to roughly 3% at June 30, 2014. This has been  accomplished through loan sales, and improving borrower performance. Similarly  net charge-offs (NCOs) have fallen significantly from crisis levels. While Fitch  does not expect the low level of NCOs in 2Q'14 to be sustainable, RF has still  reported meaningful asset quality improvement over the past couple years.  The upgrade of RF's ratings also reflects the bank's strong capital profile. RF  reports the second highest estimated Tier 1 common ratio (under Basel III) among  the Large Regional Bank Peer Group. RF's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on  a fully phased-in basis under Basel III was approximately 11% at June 30, 2014,  well above the 7% requirement (absent any D-SIB buffer). Fitch expects that RF  will attempt to distribute some of this excess capital to shareholders; however,  these distributions will be constrained by regulatory stress testing, and as  such, RF's capital ratios will likely stay elevated over the near term.  In addition to a solid capital profile, RF's ratings and Outlook reflect a good  liquidity position. In addition to having one of the lowest loan-to-deposit  ratios, RF's has a very low reliance on wholesale funding and a high level of  liquid assets. Further, over the past 10 quarters, RF has meaningfully grown  capital in excess of balance sheet growth.  Offsetting these strengths, RF's ratings are constrained by a relatively weaker  earnings profile. While reported results are roughly in line with peer averages,  Fitch notes that much of the earnings performance reflects large reserve  releases. RF reported just $37 million in provision expenses in 1H'14, as  compared to $149 million in NCOs. Fitch expects the level of reserve releases to  continue to diminish, which may ultimately pressure earnings as RF provides for  new loan growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDR, VR AND SENIOR Ratings could be positively affected by further improvement in core earnings  combined with the maintenance of capital at above peer levels. Over the past  four quarters, RF's return on assets on average has improved materially as  opposed to the prior couple years, and RF has been one of the few banks to  report some stability or even improvement in its net interest margin as higher  cost time deposits have rolled off. Fitch views further upward momentum in RF's  ratings over the long-term given the strength of its franchise, de-risking of  balance sheet the financial crisis, and various improvements made in its risk  management program.  Conversely, a sustained reversal of moderating credit trends, combined with a  large decrease in capital, would likely pressure ratings; although a downgrade  is viewed as less likely given RF's recent progress in addressing many of its  many challenges.  RF has reported significant automobile lending growth over the past year, with  auto loan balances increasing 29% from June 30, 2013. While this asset class  still only represents 4% of total loans, this growth, combined with a pretty big  drop in auto yields relative to peers, warrants monitoring given the competitive  dynamics of the market, and the significant growth. RF had re-entered the  indirect auto lending market in October 2010, after having exited it in October  2008. Indications of excessive risk taking or material weakening in credit  quality could apply downward ratings pressure.  When RF sold Morgan Keegan (MK) to Raymond James in 2012, RF agreed to indemnify  Raymond James for all litigation matters related to pre-closing activities. The  carrying amount of the indemnification obligation at June 30, 2014 totaled $224  million. There is very limited visibility into the ultimate outcome of this or  other pending litigation facing RF, and Fitch's ratings of RF do not currently  incorporate a charge in excess of what the indemnification obligation covers. A  charge in excess that meaningful erodes RF's capital profile could apply  negative ratings pressure.  Fitch also notes that similar to some of its peers, RF is attempting to grow its  capital markets and investment banking activities once again. Given its past  issues with MK, Fitch will monitor its growth and product offerings for any  rating implications.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   RF's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and Viability Rating (VR) are equalized with  those of its operating companies and banks, reflecting its role as the bank  holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength  for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the very close  correlation between holding company and subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should RF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for RF given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that RF may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  RF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, RF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of support  is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  RF's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's assumption  around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by RF and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from RF or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by RF and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in RF's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS RF's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's IDR  and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor  preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior  recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by RF and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in RF's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has taken the following ratings actions:  Regions Financial Corporation --Long-term IDR upgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable --Senior debt upgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR upgraded to 'F2' from 'F3';  --Subordinated debt upgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; --Viability rating upgraded to 'bbb' from 'bbb-'; --Preferred stock upgraded to 'B+' from 'B'; --Support affirmed at '5';  --Support floor affirmed at 'NF'.

6,"  * Jurors had been seated for trial in class action* CEO of plant's developer sentenced to prison for fraudBy Jonathan StempelJan 14 Morgan Keegan & Co on Wednesday settled a class action lawsuit accusing the brokerage of bilking investors who bought $39 million of municipal bonds meant to build a Missouri artificial sweetener plant that failed.Terms were not disclosed. The settlement averted a civil trial set to begin on Wednesday against Morgan Keegan, now a unit of Raymond James Financial Inc. It also came two months after Bruce Cole, the former chief executive of Mamtek U.S. Inc who oversaw the project, was sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud and theft.Roughly 133 investors accused Morgan Keegan of securities fraud over its underwriting of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Moberly, located in north-central Missouri, and sold from July 2010 to September 2011.These bonds were issued to help fund Mamtek's construction of a plant to produce the low-calorie sweetener sucralose, and create about 600 jobs. Investors said the bonds became worthless after Mamtek defaulted in August 2011, leaving behind an unfinished factory. They said Morgan Keegan failed to do proper due diligence to ensure that the bond offering documents were accurate.Jurors had been seated on Tuesday for the trial against Morgan Keegan in the federal court in Jefferson City, Missouri. Raymond James bought Morgan Keegan from Regions Financial Corp in April 2012.Regions spokeswoman Evelyn Mitchell declined to comment. Raymond James spokeswoman Katy Barrett declined immediate comment. Rich McLeod, a lawyer representing the investors, said his clients were pleased to settle.Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster has said Cole pleaded guilty after diverting bond financing for his own use, including to stop the foreclosure of his Beverly Hills, California home, and winning tax credits by falsely promising to create jobs.The case is Cromeans et al v.

7,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Regions Financial Corp has agreed to $125 million of settlements to resolve lawsuits accusing it of mismanaging three Morgan Keegan bond mutual funds that collapsed in 2007 after investing heavily in subprime mortgages and other risky debt.The preliminary settlements call for $110 million of cash to be paid to investors in Morgan Keegan's Short Term Bond, Select Intermediate Bond and Select High Income funds, and $15 million of cash to go directly to the funds, less any legal fees.Papers outlining the settlements, which resolve two class-action lawsuits by the funds' shareholders, were filed Thursday in the federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, where Morgan Keegan has offices. Regions, a southeast U.S. regional bank, is based in Birmingham, Alabama.The settlements require court approval. Regions sold Morgan Keegan to Raymond James Financial Inc in 2012.Regions had no immediate comment on the settlements. It has said it would indemnify Raymond James for legal matters involving Morgan Keegan, and that its indemnification obligation was valued at $193 million as of Sept. 30, 2014. The settlements follow Regions' agreement in June 2011 to pay $210 million to settle charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators that Morgan Keegan fraudulently misled investors about the risks of several funds.These funds included bond funds marketed as conservative investments for older investors, but which nonetheless lost more than half of their value in 2007 as credit conditions worsened.According to Morningstar Inc, the Select Intermediate Bond A fund fell 50.3 percent that year, while the riskier Select High Income A fund tumbled 59.7 percent. The SEC claimed that Morgan Keegan hid the falling value of some funds between January and July 2007, and ""recklessly"" sold shares at inflated prices.James Kelsoe, a Morgan Keegan portfolio manager, accepted a securities industry ban as part of the SEC settlement.The three mutual funds in Thursday's settlements now carry the Helios name, and are being liquidated, court papers show. Lawyers for the funds' shareholders plan to seek fees of up to 30 percent of the settlement amounts.Shareholders had, in 2011, proposed partial settlements, but the court never ruled on their motion.

According to Morningstar Inc, the Select Intermediate Bond A fund fell 50.3 percent that year, while the riskier Select High Income A fund tumbled 59.7 percent.The SEC claimed that Morgan Keegan hid the falling value of some funds between January and July 2007, and ""recklessly"" sold shares at inflated prices.James Kelsoe, a Morgan Keegan portfolio manager, accepted a securities industry ban as part of the SEC settlement. The three mutual funds in Thursday's settlements now carry the Helios name, and are being liquidated, court papers show.Lawyers for the funds' shareholders plan to seek fees of up to 30 percent of the settlement amounts.Shareholders had, in 2011, proposed partial settlements, but the court never ruled on their motion.The case is In re: Regions Morgan Keegan Securities, Derivative and ERISA Litigation, U.S. District Court, Western District of Tennessee, No. 09-md-02009.

9,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Regions Financial  Corporation (RF)'s long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB', reflecting  the company's good capital and liquidity profile, improving earnings, and  continued improvement in asset quality. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects RF's good capital and liquidity profile, improving  earnings, and continued improvement in asset quality. Fitch views greater upside  in RF's ratings over the medium to longer term. This would be predicated on  closing the gap with higher rated peers in terms of asset quality and  profitability. While Fitch recognizes the notable progress RF has made thus far  to improve its performance, further improvements may be more challenging until  and unless rates rise. Fitch views RF's relative profitability and higher  exposure to oilfield services to be rating constraints. Although RF's earnings continue to lag the peer median, they reflect a good  improvement over prior periods. RF reported an ROA of 82bps during 1H15, as  compared the peer median of over 100bps. RF earnings have benefitted from growth  in certain noninterest income categories, and a fairly resilient margin. RF's  NIM contracted 8bps in the second quarter of 2015 (2Q15), as compared to the  prior year ago quarter. This compares favorably to peers. RF maintains  relatively lower deposit costs, while loan yields are in line with peer  averages.  Earnings headwinds have included elevated regulatory and compliance-related  costs, the low asset yield environment, and the discontinuation of the deposit  advance product. To offset some of these challenges, RF is continuing to monitor  its expenses, with further branch rationalizations expected over the near term.  The company plans to consolidate 50 branches or 3% of the total branch count in  2015. RF is also attempting to increase its reliance on noninterest income,  particularly from the insurance, mortgage servicing, and capital markets  activities. RF's is currently slightly more spread income reliant than the  average for large regional bank peers.  RF's capital profile remains good with an estimated fully phased-in Common  Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III of 11% at June 30, 2015. This ratio is one  of the highest of the large regional bank peer group. Fitch expects these  capital levels will diminish over time but will remain above peer averages over  the near term given CCAR-related capital distribution constraints.  RF's liquidity profile also remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio, at  83% at quarter-end, which is up only slightly from a year ago, as loan growth  has eclipsed deposit growth. RF's loan to deposit ratio is one of the lowest of  the large regional peer group, and provides the company more flexibility in  funding loan growth under a more robust economic environment. Loan growth over  the past year for RF has been muted at roughly 5%. This is viewed favorably by  Fitch given the competitive lending environment.  Fitch views RF's deposit franchise as a rating strength, especially in light of  its higher growth footprint. RF has a very low cost of funds, and stands to  benefit from higher than average population growth expectations given its  Southeastern footprint. While depositor behavior under a higher interest rate  environment is difficult to predict, RF's franchises in Alabama, Mississippi,  and Arkansas in particular, where the company holds either the No. 1 or No. 2  market shares, may prove more resilient to pressures of higher deposit costs,  and aid the company's earnings profile. Lastly, RF disclosed that is well  positioned for the final LCR rule and expects to be fully compliant by the  January 2016 deadline.  For the first time in many quarters, RF built its loan loss reserves in 2Q15. RF  attributed the reserve build to loan growth but also reflective of risk rating  adjustments stemming from the annual SNC exam, half of which were  energy-related. Criticized and classified balances have increased 9% from  year-end. RF disclosed that it has $3.3 billion in energy-related exposure at  June 30, 2015, or 4% of the total loan book. RF also held approximately $265  million of energy-related investment grades bonds at quarter-end. Although this  exposure is somewhat on the higher end of peer averages, it is still considered  manageable in the context of loan losses and the capital base. Nonetheless,  Fitch expects some weakness particularly from its oilfield services portfolio,  which represents approximately 45% of energy direct outstandings, which is  higher than its peers.  NCOs declined again to 23bps in 2Q15 for RF, which is in line with the peer  average. Fitch expects NCOs will increase across the industry from currently  unsustainable low levels, particularly in sectors such as energy.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES RF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'bbb' for loss  severity. RF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Regions Bank are rated one notch higher than  RF's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  RF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as the  bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR RF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, RF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of support  is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Ratings could be positively affected with the improvement and maintenance of  core earnings at peer levels combined with a continued reduction in problem  asset levels. Fitch anticipates more ratings upside for RF than downside risk  over the medium  to long term.  Fitch expects some deterioration in RF's energy portfolio, as well as for its  peers. If overall asset quality continues to modestly improve and deterioration  in RF's energy book is not outsized relative to the performance of peers, this  may be consistent with an upgrade. However, if RF's energy portfolio performs  noticeably worse than peers, ratings upside may be impacted. Conversely, a sustained reversal of moderating credit trends, combined with a  large decrease in capital, would likely pressure ratings, although a downgrade  is viewed as more remote given RF's recent progress in addressing many of its  many legacy challenges. Fitch views more potential for ratings upside for RF  than downside risk.  Similar to some of its large regional bank peers, RF is going to continue to  build out its capital markets capabilities. While these businesses can result in  much more volatile earnings, Fitch expects that the capital markets revenues  will remain low relative to total revenues for RF. Outsized growth or  contribution from capital markets-related revenues may impede upwards rating  momentum, though this is considered a low likelihood over the near to medium  term.  When RF sold Morgan Keegan to Raymond James in 2012, RF agreed to indemnify  Raymond James for all litigation matters related to pre-closing activities. The  carrying amount of the indemnification obligation at June 30, 2015 totaled $203  million. There is very limited visibility into the ultimate outcome of this or  other pending litigation facing RF. However, Fitch's ratings of RF do not  currently incorporate a charge in excess of what the indemnification obligation  covers. A material charge in excess of the indemnification asset may impact  ratings.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for RF and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to RF's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to RF's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should RF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since RF's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

24,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Regions Financial  Corporation (RF)'s ratings at 'BBB'/'F2' reflecting the company's good capital  and liquidity profile, improving earnings, and continued improvement in asset  quality. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects RF's good capital and liquidity profile. Fitch views  greater upside in RF's ratings, and has revised the Rating Outlook to Positive  to reflect RF's improving overall credit profile. An upgrade would be predicated  on closing the gap with higher rated peers in terms of profitability and asset  quality.  Fitch observes that profitability to date still lags the peer average, but on a  risk-adjusted basis, Fitch views the earnings profile as more in line with peer  averages. Earnings also incorporate a fairly resilient margin, which compares  favorably to the peer median. RF maintains relatively lower deposit costs, with  loan yields around 16bps better than the peer median.  Further, RF has higher energy-related exposure, particularly to oilfield  services companies, than peers, which is expected given its operating footprint.  Despite a higher exposure to energy than peers, Fitch views the risk as  manageable, and RF has demonstrated success in lowering this exposure with  appropriate reserves.   RF's capital profile remains good with an estimated fully phased-in Common  Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III of approximately 11% at June 30, 2016,  around 20bps higher than the peer median. Fitch expects these capital levels  will diminish over time, but will remain above peer averages over the near term  given CCAR-related capital distribution constraints, the lack of strong organic  balance sheet growth, and bank M&A restrictions.  RF has publicly stated its long-term CET1 target is 9.5%. Fitch views RF's  capital planning practices as solid, and are informed by appropriate triggers  and limits. Fitch expects RF to operate above its long-term target over the near  term given the lack of balance sheet growth. RF expects to grow loans less than  3% for the year. Fitch notes that a higher relative capital target is important  in light of weaker capital generation capabilities than peers.  RF's liquidity profile remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio, at 84% at  quarter-end, and one of the lowest of the large regional peer group. This may  provide RF more flexibility in funding loan growth under a more robust economic  environment.  Loan growth over the past year for RF has been muted at roughly 2%. This is  viewed favorably by Fitch given the competitive lending environment. Some of  this loan growth was due to a market slowdown, while the other half was  attributed to RF's self-imposed decision to slow lending in certain sectors,  including CRE, where RF is approaching internal concentration limits. Further,  RF is also de-emphasizing credit-only relationships. Fitch notes that while multi-family and owner-occupied CRE balances are down  from a year ago, RF continues to grow indirect auto and credit card balances.  These portfolios comprise 5% and 1% of total loans, respectively, mitigating  some of the risk inherent in the relatively robust loan growth in these loan  types amidst relatively sluggish economic growth. Fitch notes at June 30, 2016,  0.48% was more than 60 days past due in the indirect auto book, and only 9% has  a FICO score less than 620.  Fitch views RF's deposit franchise as a rating strength, especially in light of  its higher growth footprint. RF has a very low cost of funds, and stands to  benefit from higher than average population growth expectations given its  Southeastern footprint. While depositor behavior under a higher interest rate  environment is difficult to predict, RF's franchises in Alabama, Mississippi,  and Tennessee in particular, where the company holds either the number 1 or  number 2 market shares, may prove more resilient to pressures of higher deposit  costs, and aid the company's earnings profile.  RF's ratings are currently constrained by asset quality. At June 30, 2016, RF's  NPAs were the highest of the peer group due primarily to commercial,  particularly energy-related, and CRE nonaccrual loans. Fitch believes RF's TDR  accounting practices to be more conservative than peers, and notes that 86% of  accruing TDRs are current as of June 30, 2016. Current loan losses remain low and at the peer median in 2Q16, though Fitch  expects them to deteriorate from unsustainably low levels, in part due to RF's  energy-related portfolio. RF reported $3.1 billion in total energy-related  exposure at June 30, 2016, or around 3.8% of the total loan book, on the higher  end of peer averages. Despite some improvement in oil prices from a year ago,  Fitch expects some weakness particularly from its oilfield services portfolio,  which represents approximately 36% of energy outstandings, which is higher than  its peers. RF has built its energy reserves to 9.4% at June 30, 2016, the second  highest level among its peer banks. Further, RF has been very successful in  reducing direct exposure, down 19% from a year ago.  Fitch views energy-related risk as an earnings headwind for RF, and not  necessarily a capital issue. RF anticipates that it will incur between $50  million and $75 million in related losses throughout 2017, and if prices average  below $25 a barrel through the end of 2017, RF could experience additional  losses of $100 million. At June 30, 2016, RF had $225 million in energy-related  reserves against the potential stress losses of up to $175 million through  year-end 2017. Given current prices are averaging around $44 a barrel; realizing  this level of losses appears remote. Fitch expects that RF may benefit from some  reserve releases in this book over time.  In 4Q15, RF was assigned a ""needs to improve"" CRA rating, despite receiving  ""High Satisfactory"" ratings on the CRA components. RF's CRA rating was  downgraded due to the bank's April 2015 consent order with the CFPB related to  overdrafts and Regulation E. Regions Bank had self-reported these matters, and  provided refunds to the affected customers in 2011 and 2012. Nonetheless, the  current CRA rating means the bank will be unable to pursue bank acquisitions  until the CRA rating is upgraded. RF expects its next CRA rating will occur in  2016, but the timing of the exam or the results is unclear. The bank's inability  to pursue M&A is not viewed as a credit negative. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES RF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'bbb' for loss  severity. RF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Regions Bank are rated one notch higher than  RF's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  RF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as the  bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR RF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, RF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of support  is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT An upgrade of RF's ratings would be driven by the improvement and maintenance of  core earnings at peer levels combined with a continued reduction in problem  asset levels. Fitch expects the resolution of the rating outlook to be on the  latter part of the 12 to 24 month rating horizon as earnings improvement may be  difficult to achieve over the next twelve months given the low-rate interest  environment.  If overall asset quality continues to modestly improve and further deterioration  in RF's energy book is not outsized relative to the performance of peers, this  may be consistent with an upgrade. However, if RF's energy portfolio performs  noticeably worse than peers, ratings upside may be impacted. Conversely, a sustained reversal of moderating credit trends, combined with a  large decrease in capital, would likely cause the outlook to be revised back to  Stable. Fitch expects it will take some time to manage its capital down to its  long-term capital target of CET1 of 9.5% given CCAR constraints and subdued  organic loan growth expectations. Since RF cannot participate in bank M&A given  its CRA rating, if RF were to become much more aggressive with its capital  distribution plans under CCAR or began to materially grow its balance sheet, its  ratings could be adversely impacted.  Similar to some of its large regional bank peers, RF is continuing to build out  its capital markets capabilities. While these businesses can result in much more  volatile earnings, Fitch expects that capital markets revenues will remain low  relative to total revenues for RF. Outsized growth or contribution from capital  markets-related revenues may impede upwards rating momentum. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for RF and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to RF's VR.   LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to RF's  Long-and Short-Term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should RF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since RF's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Regions Financial Corporation Long-Term IDR at 'BBB'; Outlook Revised to Positive; Short-Term IDR at 'F2';  Subordinated debt at 'BBB-'; Viability rating at 'bbb'; Senior unsecured at 'BBB'; Preferred stock at 'B+'; Support at '5';  Support floor at 'NF'. Regions Bank Long-Term IDR at 'BBB'; Outlook Revised to Positive; Long-Term deposits at 'BBB+'; Short-Term deposits at 'F2'; Short-Term IDR at 'F2';  Senior debt at 'BBB'; Subordinated debt at 'BBB-';  Viability Rating at 'bbb'; Support at '5';  Support floor at 'NF'. AmSouth Bancorporation Subordinated debt at 'BBB-'.

The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue.
