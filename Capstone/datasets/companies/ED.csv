0,"  (In 3rd paragraph, corrects to show that the call was made to Consolidated Edison, not to 911)By Victoria CavaliereNEW YORK, March 18 U.S. investigators were looking into gas lines and meters to determine what caused a natural gas explosion last week that leveled two New York City apartment buildings and killed eight people, fatalities that a city official said were accidental.Five women and three men died of burns, smoke inhalation or blunt-force trauma as the five-story buildings collapsed in the East Harlem neighborhood on March 12, a spokeswoman from the New York City Medical Examiner said Tuesday. All the deaths were accidental, she said.The buildings came down moments after a resident in the area called Consolidated Edison to complain of the smell of gas, and the force of the explosion was felt up to a mile (1.6 km) away.On Monday, a Harlem resident filed the first lawsuit relating to the blast, charging utility Consolidated Edison Inc  and the owner of one of the buildings with negligence. The suit by Harlem resident Michelle Nelson contends that she ""was caused to sustain serious injuries and to have suffered pain, shock, mental anguish."" It says the utility and landlord were ""negligent in the ownership, operation, management, control, maintenance, repair and/or construction of the aforesaid premises and its natural gas service lines.""A spokesman for Con Edison said on Tuesday the company would review ""the complaint at an appropriate time.""Representatives of the building's owner could not immediately be reached. Police identified the final victim on Monday as Japanese tourist Mayumi Nakamura, 34. Nakamura had been staying in one of the buildings that fell, and it took longer to release her identity as her family had to travel from Japan to identify her, authorities said.The National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency that looks into accidents involving pipelines carrying hazardous materials, has taken charge of the investigation after emergency crews finished removing debris from the site over the weekend. NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said more information from the investigation was expected to be released later on Tuesday.Last week, the agency said that preliminary tests had indicated a high concentration of gas underground.Con Edison said two spot checks of the building's gas equipment in February had shown that all systems were operating normally.""We're working with the City, the Salvation Army and the Red Cross to assist the affected families with their expenses in the wake of the tragedy,"" Con Edison spokesman Sidney Alvarez said.About 60 families, or 100 people, were evacuated from the neighborhood following the collapse of the buildings and many have yet to return to their homes as the investigation continues.

1,"  NEW YORK, March 20 Consolidated Edison Inc  has made payments to nearly 90 survivors and other people displaced by the deadly gas explosion that leveled two apartment buildings in New York City last week to help them with living expenses, the utility company confirmed on Thursday.The company declined to detail the amounts given to the 87 affected people. It said the payments, which were made a week ago, were to cover living expenses for those who lost their homes or have been forced to leave their homes.Five women and three men were killed and dozens more were injured by the explosion in Manhattan's East Harlem neighborhood on March 12, which occurred just moments after a resident reported a gas leak. The two nearly identical five-story buildings, which housed a church, a piano store and more than a dozen apartments, were quickly reduced to rubble and debris. The National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency that monitors the safety of the nation's pipelines, is continuing to investigate the explosion. On Tuesday, the agency said investigators examining a gas main using tracer gas found signs of a leak near one of the destroyed buildings.Con Edison has said that the most recent survey on the block where the buildings stood was done at the end of February, and no leak was found at the time.

3,"  (Adds DEC comment)July 21 New York state environmental regulators are proposing shutting the giant Indian Point nuclear power plant to protect fish in the Hudson River during summer months, when demand for electricity for air-conditioning is greatest.The 2,061-megawatt plant, located about 40 miles north of Manhattan, provides about a quarter of the power used in the New York City area.The New York Department of Environmental Conservation proposed closing the plant for an average of 42 days during prime fish migrations between May 10 and August 10, according to a document dated in May posted on the DEC website.The DEC said in an email that the proposal, which will be discussed in a public meeting on Tuesday, is similar to what Consolidated Edison Inc did when it owned the reactors and is consistent with the practice of other facilities on the Hudson.""This would not curtail operations this summer,"" the DEC said, noting it would give Entergy and other organizations responsible for the reliability of the state's power grid enough time to ensure that the outage plan does not disrupt power supplies. The DEC proposal is the latest salvo in a lengthy battle between Entergy Corp, which owns Indian Point and wants to keep the plant operating for another 20 years, and state environmental regulators, who are seeking to protect fish and other aquatic life.Indian Point withdraws up to 2.5 billion gallons of water per day from the Hudson to cool equipment, and then discharges that water back into the river a little warmer than before.Environmental groups and the DEC have long argued that Indian Point's water intake system kills about a billion fish, fish eggs and larvae each year, and the plant should install cooling towers to reduce the use of river water by recycling it. Entergy argues that cooling towers are too expensive, with an estimated cost of up to $2 billion and likely could not enter service before 2029. Instead it has proposed installing a Wedgewire screen system to protect the fish. The company said the screens would save more fish as it would take only about three years to install at a cost of up to $250 million.""Wedgewire screen technology is more effective over time and far less disruptive than a massive cooling tower and forced outages,"" Entergy said in a statement on Monday.Business and labor groups supporting the continued operation of Indian Point last week sent an open letter to the DEC, urging the state to drop its ""forced outage"" proposal. ""The DEC proposal would mean lost jobs, higher electricity prices, significantly lower electric reliability and vast economic uncertainty,"" New York Affordable Reliable Electricity Alliance, the pro Indian Point group, said in a statement.NY AREA said the DEC proposal will ""spawn more environmental problems than it will solve,"" in part because it would require utilities to burn more fossil fuels, producing carbon and other harmful emissions. Nuclear plants produce minimal emissions.Entergy filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to renew the operating licenses for the two Indian Point reactors in 2007.The units can continue to operate under existing licenses until the NRC completes the relicensing process, which Entergy has said could take until 2018. Unit 2's license expired in 2013 and Unit 3's will expire in 2015.Before the NRC can grant new licenses, the state must approve water permits.

4,"  (Adds details on dangerous gas line connection)By Barbara GoldbergNEW YORK, March 28 Utility workers dispatched in August to one of three buildings destroyed in an explosion and fire in Manhattan last week found dangerous gas line connections that created a ""hazardous situation,"" a Con Edison spokesman said on Saturday.The crew was sent to the building after a Con Edison worker reading gas meters smelled gas on Aug. 6 in the basement, said Con Edison spokesman Allan Drury.The basement could hold the key to the cause of the devastation, in which 22 people were injured - four critically - and two people remained unaccounted for, police said. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that the blast was possibly tied to someone ""inappropriately"" tapping into a gas line.The owner of the sushi restaurant where the explosion occurred told The New York Times that utility workers determined that gas intended for his restaurant was being siphoned off illegally for use in newly renovated apartments upstairs. Drury said that utility workers found multiple leaks on Aug. 6 in hoses that had been connected to the gas line leading to a restaurant in the building, creating a ""hazardous situation."" He noted that Con Edison shut off the building's gas for about 10 days, until it was determined to be safe.On Saturday, rescue crews with cadaver dogs clawed through smoldering rubble in the search for two people still unaccounted for. Authorities said it could take a week of careful digging through twisted debris, bricks and splintered wood before the basement is reached. In all 11 buildings were evacuated, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay. Con-Ed said they may return to their homes as soon as Sunday.Investigators were looking into whether gas and plumbing work being done privately in one building led to the explosion.An hour before the blast Con Edison utility inspectors had been at the scene and determined that pre-existing work was not satisfactory, but the problems were not safety related, the mayor said.The contractor, identified as Dilber Kukic, was one of 50 people arrested in February in a sweep of the city by building and housing inspectors. He was accused of bribing an undercover investigator to dismiss violations at two properties, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. The hospitalized Kukic could not be reached for comment.

7,"   By Ramkumar Iyer | June 9  June 9 A federal regulator on Tuesday found Consolidated Edison Inc largely liable for a natural gas explosion that destroyed two buildings and killed eight people in Manhattan's East Harlem neighborhood in 2014, while also putting some blame on New York City.The blast was mainly caused by a defective connection between two gas pipes that allowed gas to leak from a gas main into the building where it ignited, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which monitors the safety of the nation's pipelines, said in a report. (1.usa.gov/1f1ppoJ)The pipes were installed by a contractor to Con Edison, the NTSB said.The NTSB also called out the New York City Department of Environmental Protection for not repairing a breach in the sewer line for nearly eight years. The breach allowed groundwater and soil to flow into the sewer, resulting in erosion. The loss of support for the gas pipe caused it to sag and stress the defective pipe joint, the regulator said.Five women and three men were killed and dozens more were injured by an explosion in East Harlem on March 12 last year, which occurred just minutes after a resident reported a gas leak. Con Edison had said at the time that the most recent survey on the block where the buildings stood was done at the end of February, and no leak was found at the time.The NTSB also said Con Edison did not immediately contact the fire department when notified by a resident of a gas odor in one of the buildings about 25 minutes before the explosion occurred. Responders could have arrived at the gas leak location up to 15 minutes before the explosion had Con Edison immediately notified the fire department when the gas leak was brought to its attention, the NTSB said.Con Edison and New York City have also been hit by lawsuits that allege their carelessness contributed to the explosion.Con Edison in a statement agreed with the NTSB that the city's sewer breach contributed to the explosion but the utility took issue with some findings.""Not all of the participants involved in this investigation reached the same conclusion concerning the sequence of infrastructure failures that led to the explosion,"" Con Edison said.

8,"   By Daniel Wiessner  Consolidated Edison of New York Inc CENY.UL will pay up to $3.8 million to end a government investigation into claims that it failed to stop frequent sexual harassment and discrimination against female employees, the New York Attorney General's office said on Wednesday.The utility company, which serves about 3.4 million customers in New York City and its suburbs, will pay the money to more than 300 female field workers.The investigation by the attorney general and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission began in 2007, spurred by complaints that male employees routinely taunted and made sexual comments to their female coworkers. The women also said they were denied promotions, overtime and on-the-job training given to men and received less positive job evaluations.  The company in a statement said it does not tolerate workplace harassment and would enhance training of employees and supervisors. ""With this agreement, Con Edison is reaffirming its commitment to maintaining a workforce that promotes diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity,"" it said.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in a statement said the case should serve as a reminder that women frequently face workplace harassment.“All women, especially those working in male-dominated workplaces, deserve respect and equal treatment,” he said.
