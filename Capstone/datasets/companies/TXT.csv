24,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 6 Northrop Grumman Corp  said on Friday it is designing and already building a new aircraft for the upcoming U.S. Air Force T-X competition to build 350 new training planes, an $11 billion program that analysts say could double in value in coming years.Northrop, which built the B-2 stealth bomber and makes the center fuselage of the F-35 fighter jet, said it planned to fly a prototype of the new trainer for the first time this year.The company is also vying with a team of Boeing Co  and Lockheed Martin Corp to build a new long-range bomber for the Air Force.Northrop teamed up with Britain's BAE Systems Plc  in 2011 with the idea of offering BAE's Hawk trainer, already in use in Britain, as a replacement for the aging T-38 trainer. The new system will be used to train pilots for the next 50 years. About two years ago, as the Air Force began to refine its requirements for the new plane, the companies decided it made more sense to start from scratch with a new design. Other companies on the team include L-3 Communications Holdings  and German robotics giant Kuka AG.Another key player is Scaled Composites, a Northrop unit that builds experimental aircraft like the X-47B, a drone that Northrop successfully tested on an aircraft carrier. General Electric built the engine for the prototype. The competition will be fierce: Boeing, Lockheed, Textron Inc, and a joint venture of General Dynamics and Italy's Finmeccanica Spa, all plan to submit bids when the tender kicks off in 2017.Marc Lindsley, director and head of Northrop's T-X ""capture team,"" declined to give any details about the new airplane or its attributes. He said all the companies on the team were investing heavily in the project, which will include ground-based training equipment, advanced simulators and an open architecture design to facilitate continual upgrades. Lindsley said the companies first told the Air Force about the change in their plans several months ago.He said a ""clean sheet"" design would allow the team to take advantage of new technologies and advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3-D printing, which would help keep down the cost of the new planes.""We want to give the Air Force what they want,"" he said. ""We're designing in affordability from the start.""

25,"   By Lewis Krauskopf and Andrea Shalal | March 12  March 12 United Technologies Corp's  Sikorsky helicopter unit could be acquired by another big defense company, but the potential for a big tax bill means the maker of Black Hawk helicopters will more likely be spun off into a standalone company, analysts said.UTC shares were up 1.9 percent on Thursday as company executives were scheduled to discuss alternatives for Sikorsky, including a split-off, at an investor day.Potential buyers include Boeing Co, Textron Inc , Airbus and BAE Systems and even Lockheed Martin Corp.Lockheed does not build helicopters but works closely with Sikorsky on outfitting and servicing MH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters for the U.S. Navy. Chief Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall told UTC that the Defense Department would not object to a spinoff, a source told Reuters.A former defense official said the Pentagon would probably insist that Sikorsky was well capitalized to ensure its survival.U.S. weapons makers could object to a combination of  Sikorsky and Boeing, which makes Apache and Chinook helicopters for the Army, the former defense official said. But the Pentagon might view the situation differently since the existing Boeing and Sikorsky helicopter programs are beginning to wind down. The two companies have teamed up to compete to build a replacement for the Black Hawk and Apache helicopters.UTC has not ruled out a sale, but a buyer could face significant taxes since the value of Sikorsky has increased so much since the company acquired it in 1929, analysts said. ""The tax bill would be very punitive,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Peter Arment. ""You'd have to have a premium well above to cover that liability.""Analysts put Sikorsky's value at $7 billion to $10 billion. The unit posted a profit of $219 million last year on sales of $7.5 billion. UTC reported revenue of $65 billion.Bank of America Merrill Lynch senior research analyst Ron Epstein said the high tax bill would be less of an issue if Sikorsky was a standalone company for two years. However, a buyer could act now to avoid paying a higher price once the company begins trading on its own, he said.UTC's decision to consider spinning off Sikorsky follows similar moves in the defense industry in recent years. Northrop Grumman spun off its Huntington Ingalls Industries  shipbuilding unit, and ITT Corp spun off Exelis , which Harris Corp is now buying.

26,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) will explore spinning off its Sikorsky helicopter unit, in the first major move by the company's new chief executive officer to overhaul the U.S. conglomerate's portfolio of businesses.The company's board authorized the review, which also could include a sale of the maker of Black Hawk helicopters. Sikorsky had $7.5 billion in sales last year. The review is expected to finish before the end of the year.Sikorsky's fit with United Tech, which had $65 billion in overall sales last year, has been long debated on Wall Street. The potential split is the first major strategic move under Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes, who was elevated in November after previously serving as finance chief.The company's portfolio review found that “while Sikorsky is a great helicopter company, it probably didn’t fit into the UTC  portfolio,” Hayes told reporters.Hayes said the company was very comfortable with its other businesses, which include Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier climate control systems. Splitting apart its aerospace and commercial building segments would not create much value, he said. The new CEO is set to discuss the decision at United Tech's highly anticipated investor day on Thursday in New York.Sikorsky did not match up with the rest of the company on several fronts, Hayes said. Its margins of 10 percent lagged the target of at least 15 percent for UTC's businesses. While UTC wants to capitalize on growth in commercial aerospace and urbanization in emerging markets, Sikorsky is primarily a military contractor, with the U.S. Department of Defense representing two-third of sales.   United Tech shares have climbed 7 percent since Hayes was named CEO, compared to a 1 percent decline for the S&P 500 index .SPX.The Sikorsky move comes as many diverse manufacturers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) have taken hard looks at their businesses to determine best strategic fits.While the focus is on spinning off Sikorsky, Hayes said acquisition interest might come from companies in the United States or Europe.  A standalone Sikorsky could be an attractive takeover target for Boeing Co (BA.N) or Textron Inc (TXT.N), RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a recent research note.Hayes said the company had spoken to government officials in Washington who believe a standalone Sikorsky would be a viable supplier.

27,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, March 12  WASHINGTON, March 12 A spinoff of United Technologies Corp's Sikorsky Aircraft as a standalone company should not have any impact on the U.S. Defense Department's costs, the Pentagon's acquisition chief said Thursday.Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall said he was ""neutral"" about United Technologies' announcement that it was considering a spinoff of the maker of Black Hawk helicopters.""At this point, based on what I know about the deal, I'm neutral about it. It should not impact us as far as cost or rates are concerned,"" Kendall told reporters after an event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Analysts on Thursday said the potential for a big tax bill means Sikorsky will more likely be spun off into a standalone company than sold outright to potential buyers such as Boeing Co , Textron Inc, Airbus or BAE Systems .Asked about his views on possible consolidation among top tier weapons makers, Kendall said the department was not encouraging such moves by industry despite a downturn in military spending. ""At the top tier, we're comfortable where we are. We want the market forces to work below that, and we'll look at individual mergers on a case-by-case basis, or deals like the Sikorsky one,"" he said.

28,"  (Corrects the newspaper's name to Shanghai Securities News, not Journal, in the second paragraph)BEIJING, April 15 China's civil aviation authority has promised a major ""break through"" to open up airspace for small planes, state media said on Wednesday, a move which could boost sales for planemakers such as Bombardier Inc  and Textron Inc.Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) will step up its support for the country's fledgling general aviation industry and work toward loosening restrictions on flying in  lower airspace, CAAC chief Li Jiaxiang was quoted as saying by the Shanghai Securities News.The military currently controls about 80 percent of China's airspace. In 2010, Beijing issued guidelines which aimed to open up airspace below 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) by 2015 and below 3,000 metres by 2020. The former measure has yet to be enacted.Three years later, CAAC simplified flight approval procedures for private jets and made it easier to obtain a private pilot licence. Li said the CAAC has already yielded some aviation controls to regional authorities and is encouraging local governments to build airports for small planes. Investment in small airports alone could top 100 billion yuan ($16.12 billion) if each of China's over 2,800 counties each build an airport, he said.Textron's Cessna Aircraft Company, Embraer SA have already started making jets in China, while General Dynamics'  Gulfstream Aerospace Corp, Dassault Aviation SA  and Bombardier have been stepping up their sales across the country.($1 = 6.2027 Chinese yuan renminbi)   (Reporting by Fang Yan and Matthew Miller in BEIJING; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)",2015-04-15,TXT,"Wed Apr 15, 2015 | 5:58am EDT",REFILE-China aviation regulator to push for air space reform -paper,http://www.reuters.com//article/china-aviation-idUSL4N0XC2TM20150415?type=companyNews

35,"   By Andrea Shalal and Mike Stone | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Textron Inc (TXT.N) have emerged as final contenders to buy United Technologies Corp's  (UTX.N) Sikorsky Aircraft business, which could be valued at around $8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.UTC is weighing offers from the two companies and may come to a decision by the end of the month, one of the people said. The company could still decide against an outright sale and instead spin off Sikorsky to shareholders in a tax-free deal, the people added, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Last month, UTC announced it was exiting the helicopter business and would either sell or spin off Sikorsky, which has come under pressure in the commercial market, where lower energy prices have slashed demand from the oil and gas sector.Textron, which has a market capitalization of about $12 billion and is up against a much larger suitor, has reached out to private equity firms to put together a cash bid for Sikorsky, the people said. Lockheed Martin has a market value of about $60 billion. Textron, maker of Bell helicopters and Cessna aircraft, had initially proposed a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) merger between Sikorsky and Textron, a transaction that allows a parent company to sell its subsidiary while avoiding a hefty tax bill, Reuters previously reported.UTC made clear it was not interested in acquiring a stake in Textron as part of the more complex transaction, the sources said. People familiar with the process had said that arrangement would have had substantial tax savings.Textron then reached out private equity firms for help to make a cash offer, the sources said. Boeing Co (BA.N), which had expressed interest in a potential deal, is no longer active in the sale process, the sources said. Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA), the world's largest civil helicopter maker which has said it is keeping an eye on the fate of Sikorsky, is not in the race to acquire it, another source familiar with the situation said.Representatives for UTC, Lockheed, Textron, Boeing and Airbus declined comment.Analysts have focused on Textron as the likeliest buyer, given its interest in beefing up its existing Bell Helicopter business. But industry executives said there could be antitrust questions on the commercial side, given that both companies make helicopters in similar market segments. For Lockheed, acquiring Sikorsky would be the first major acquisition for Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson, who has helped nearly double the company's share price since taking over as CEO in January 2013.Sikorsky is seen as a ""signature company"" that could help Lockheed produce strong revenues in the medium term, when production of the F-35 fighter jet program begins to taper off, said one of the sources. ""It would certainly help Lockheed diversify its portfolio,"" said one of the sources.Lockheed and Sikorsky already work together on several major helicopter programs, including the presidential helicopter, a combat rescue helicopter and the MH-60R- and S-model helicopters built for the Navy and Marine Corps.

37,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | July 9  July 9 As United Technologies Corp nears a decision on how it will divest its Sikorsky helicopter division, the U.S. conglomerate faces challenges to its financial outlook that may limit the lift to its stock in the near term.UTC shares have declined 5 percent this year, hurt by the  global economic jitters that have spooked shareholders of many multinational manufacturers, investors and analysts said on Thursday. Stock market upheaval in China and stalled sales at some of its businesses also darken the horizon.""As long as there's economic weakness outside the U.S., which doesn't seem to be lifting anytime soon, it's going to be one of those stocks that suffers,"" said Keith Davis, principal at investment management firm Farr, Miller & Washington, which holds about 250,000 UTC shares.UTC has twice trimmed its 2015 profit forecast this year, and recently signaled further pressure. In an analyst meeting last month, it pointed to weak equipment order trends at its Otis elevators business, which accounts for about one-fourth of its operating profit and is dependent on China. Since then, the Chinese stock market rout has heightened concern about the country's economy. China has been expected to account for about two-thirds of all new elevator sales this year, analysts at William Blair said this week.Also, UTC said last month its UTAS aircraft components and systems unit would not hit sales growth targets in the commercial aftermarket business. ""It's hard to see a real catalyst"" for the stock, said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which holds more than 520,000 shares. ""The stock is probably going to be stuck for a while.""Following UTC's June announcement that it would split off Sikorsky, Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lockheed Martin Corp and Textron Inc have emerged as final contenders to buy it, with a decision possible by month's end.  UTC, however, could decide instead to spin Sikorsky off. While a strong sale price might boost the stock, benefits from the divestment are now largely incorporated into the shares, Pettengill said.New Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who was elevated to his post in November and subsequently initiated the Sikorsky strategic review, has said he is interested in large acquisitions but that expensive valuations have undercut his desires.How the company decides to use its cash ""continues to be a focus of investors,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment.Pettengill advocates using some to buy back shares.

Bell-Boeing, a strategic alliance between Textron Inc's  Bell Helicopter and Boeing, said the deal would give Japan access to a game-changing technology, offering the ability to get people and cargo to remote areas without an airstrip.""The V-22 redefines what's operationally possible for a country, and we're looking forward to delivering this capability to Japan as we continue our enduring partnership there,"" said Shelley Lavender, president of Boeing's military aircraft division. Mitch Snyder, executive vice president of Bell's military business, said the Osprey offered ""an unrivaled combination of speed, range, and payload.""The United Arab Emirates and other countries are also looking at possible orders of six to 12 V-22 aircraft, which could add up to another 100 sales in coming years, industry executives told Reuters at the Paris Airshow last month. First fielded by the U.S. Marine Corps in 2007, the aircraft has rapidly become one of the U.S. military's most popular and sought after aircraft due to its long range and ability to carry out missions quickly and participate in humanitarian missions.Foreign sales have been slower to materialize than initially expected, partly due to the relatively high price of the aircraft compared with helicopters.The U.S. Navy's decision to buy 44 V-22s to replace the aging C-2A fixed wing aircraft that now ferry people and supplies on board aircraft carriers will help extend production of the planes from 2020 to 2025.Last month, Bell Helicopter President John Garrison said it was unclear if or when Israel would revisit plans to buy some V-22s after the deal was put on hold for budget reasons.

44,"  KIEV Ukrainian state-run defense company Ukroboronprom said on Monday it had agreed a joint venture with U.S. defense group Textron Inc to upgrade military vehicles for Ukraine's army.Under the deal, Textron Inc will upgrade Ukraine's Humvee vehicles with high-protection armor, Ukroboronprom said in a statement.While the U.S. government has agreed to give Ukraine equipment such as radar, and training, this is the first sale of military hardware by a U.S. company, industry sources said.The company gave no financial details of the deal. The United States gave Ukraine 30 Humvees earlier this year. Ukraine has been pushing Western nations to supply it with weapons but so far countries like France and the United States say they will only supply non-lethal equipment.The venture will be a boost for Ukroboronprom which was forced to cut exports to Russia, a major customer, following the outbreak of conflict with pro-Russian rebels in the east.

45,"   By Andrea Shalal | DUBAI  DUBAI Lower oil prices and conflicts in Yemen, Iraq and Syria have focused the attention of many Gulf countries on smaller drones, ground vehicles and other short-term equipment needs, a senior Textron Inc executive said Sunday.""Oil and the conflicts going on are making everything about what is needed here and now, versus what do we need for the future,"" Textron Systems President Ellen Lord told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow. ""People are much more price conscious.""The Saudi-led effort to put Yemen's previous government back in power was a huge focus for the countries in the region, she said.""There's a near-term need for equipment to support the ongoing conflicts,"" she said.Lord said Kuwait was looking at a potential order of 100 wheeled vehicles and hoped to carry out vehicle trials in the desert next summer, with a contract award likely late in the year. The United Arab Emirates was looking at a similar sized order, although the timetable was less clear, she said. Saudi Arabia was considering an order for several hundred new vehicles and seeking competitive bids to carry out an upgrade of 1,500 older V-150 vehicles Textron built in the 1980s, she said.Iraq could also place orders for potentially hundreds of vehicles, she said.Textron typically built such vehicles in 12 months, but could potentially accelerate that timetable and supply them to potential buyers by the summer of 2016, she said. The company is also in discussions with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar about possible orders for its Shadow or Aerosonde unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, Lord said, adding that those talks could result in orders sometime over the next year.She said Gulf countries were looking at smaller drones to  meet their intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance (ISR) needs both for the military and border security, but there was also interest in possible orders for armed drones.Textron was working through the licensing process for surveillance drones but had not yet requested permission to export an armed drone, she said. The United States last week approved Italy's request to arm its existing MQ-9 Reaper drones, only the second country after Britain to be authorized to receive armed drones.It was not immediately clear how the government would respond to possible requests to arm smaller drones.Lord said Textron was looking at different options, including leasing, to help make orders more affordable for the increasingly price-conscious Gulf countries which have been hammered by lower oil prices.

47,"   By Alwyn Scott | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS - GE Aviation (GE.N) said on Monday it had teamed up with Textron (TXT.N) to produce an all-new turboprop aircraft and engine for the general aviation market, part of an effort GE expects will generate more than $1 billion in annual sales of engines by 2020.    GE Aviation said its so-called advanced turboprop engine takes aim at a widely used engine by United Technologies (UTX.N) unit Pratt & Whitney known as the PT6, which has dominated the market for 50 years, producing 51,000 units. GE said it plans to invest up to $1 billion in the project, including $400 million for a new factory in Europe.    The venture aims to produce an all-new single-engine aircraft seating up to 12 passengers, the companies said. The target range and speed are in excess of 1,500 nautical miles and 280 knots, according to Textron.    GE said it will choose an engine plant location in 2016 and the first plane would be built in 2017 or 2018.    GE said Textron's decision to develop an all-new aircraft using the engine allowed GE to justify the engine investment. Textron, maker of Cessna, Beechcraft and Hawker airplanes and Bell helicopters, is the largest user of small turboprop engines.     The new engine will use technology proven on GE’s larger jetliner and military engines and adapt it to an engine suitable for single and twin-engine general aviation aircraft and helicopters, said Brad Mottier, head of GE business and general aviation.    “Our plan is to create a family of engines like Pratt successfully did, and we’re talking to other airframers now,” aiming to create a new class of aircraft, he said. ""This is a big move for GE Aviation. We want to be a major player in this market.""     Mottier said the engine would have up to 1,650 horsepower, burn 20 percent less fuel than the competing PT6, and generate 10 percent more thrust at cruising altitude, in part because of integrated computer control of both the propeller and engine.    GE began talking with airframe makers about four years ago. GE already is producing a smaller PT6 competitor known as the H80, with up to 850 horsepower.     The propeller maker has not been chosen yet, Textron said, but GE's Dowty Propellers unit is a strong contender, Mottier said.

60,"   By Andrea Shalal | RAF FAIRFORD, England  RAF FAIRFORD, England U.S. group Textron Inc is launching a new company on Friday that will use its private fleet of older fighter jets and experienced former military pilots to provide combat training for U.S. military forces, the head of the new unit told Reuters.Textron Airborne Solutions was created after Textron earlier this year acquired Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), the world's largest firm providing adversarial role playing and other live tactical training services for air forces""The air services business is exploding. It could grow to billions of dollars over time,"" Russ Bartlett, president and chief executive officer of the new unit, told Reuters in an interview. Bartlett previously headed Textron's Beechcraft Defense unit, maker of the T-6 turboprop air force training  aircraft.Bartlett, a former commander of the U.S. Navy's elite Blue Angels performance squadron, said outsourcing live air training to the private sector saved the U.S. military money and helped preserve U.S. military jets and pilots for actual missions. ATAC, which operates a fleet of 27 former foreign fighter jets, is the only civilian group approved to train with the U.S Navy's elite Top Gun fighter weapons school and the U.S. Air Force's F-22 Raptors. It has a staff of 35 former fighter pilots, with aircraft on both U.S. coasts and in Hawaii and Japan.Before a U.S. carrier strike group deploys, ATAC pilots fly their own jets equipped with jamming pods to simulate opposition forces and help prepare the ship and pilots for possible air-to-air or air-to-ship threats. ATAC pioneered the idea of using private firms for live air training in 1996, but the concept has gained acceptance around the world as military forces seek to save on flight hours on ageing aircraft for actual missions instead of using them for training.  Bartlett said Textron would help ATAC expand the existing market and look for new opportunities in areas such as basic pilot training, and training for ground-based troops that call in air strikes.Outsourcing frees up military jets and pilots for actual missions, he said, noting that in 2015 the U.S. Navy flew 6,000 hours of missions simulating opposition forces -- the current life span of a Boeing Co F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. ""Every time you use one of the (U.S. Department of Defense's) own airplanes to provide those essential training services, it’s just consuming the life of that precious resource that could be very comfortably and affordably outsourced,"" he said,The U.S. Navy is currently ATAC's biggest customer, but it also works for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps, Bartlett said.

71,"  ORLANDO, Fla. Cessna Aircraft Co said on Monday it is going ahead with a new large-cabin business jet, the Hemisphere, and will use an engine made by Safran of France that has suffered delays.Cessna, a subsidiary of Textron Inc (TXT.N), said it chose Safran's Silvercrest engine to power the Hemisphere even though Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA) delayed first flight of its Falcon 5X jet, originally set for the summer of 2015, because of delays in getting Silvercrest engines. ""We're confident"" the engine will meet specifications and be delivered on time, Textron Aviation Chief Executive Officer Scott Ernest said in a briefing at the National Business Aviation Association conference here.Safran is expected to certify the engine for the Hemisphere in the spring of 2018, and Cessna plans first flight of the Hemisphere in early 2019, providing a buffer if the engine is delayed, Textron executives said at the briefing. The Hemisphere will use avionics made by Honeywell International (HON.N).  The Hemisphere carries a $35 million price tag and is due to enter service in late 2019 or early 2020, the executives said. Dassault expects the Falcon 5X to be certified in 2020.Cessna has brought two other business jets to market in recent years. The Latitude, with a range of 2,500 nautical miles, entered service in 2015. The Longitude, with a 3,500-nautical-mile range, is due to be certified next year. Both use Honeywell engines.  The Hemisphere can travel 4,500 nautical miles without stopping.  Plane deliveries by Wichita, Kansas-based Textron are expected to be flat this year, compared with 2015, but sales are ""up year-on-year in a slow market,"" said Christi Tannahill, senior vice president of interior design and engineering.
