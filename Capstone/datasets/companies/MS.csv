3,"   By Taiga Uranaka and Denny Thomas | TOKYO/HONG KONG  TOKYO/HONG KONG A joint venture between U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), which suffered from a culture clash in its early stages, looks to have found its footing.The venture, spawned from MUFG's $9 billion investment in the Wall Street firm during the financial crisis, is a big winner from Suntory Holdings Ltd's $13.6 billion deal this week to buy U.S. whiskey maker Beam Inc BEAM.N.That deal involves a bridge loan of up to 1.4 trillion yen ($13.5 billion) by MUFG, say people familiar with the matter - one of the biggest such loans in Asia - and will earn the two banks almost $34 million in advisory fees alone, according to Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting Co estimates.Teaming up with MUFG - just before Japanese companies embarked on a series of overseas deals - helped Morgan Stanley take the top spot on Japan's M&A league table last year for the first time in more than a decade.When the venture was born in 2010, skeptics warned it would be a messy clash of Japanese and Western corporate cultures and a difficult marriage of commercial and investment banking. People involved with the venture said at the time that the U.S. bank's style of deal-hungry investment banking clashed with MUFG's conservative, commercial lending practices.Others, however, said Morgan Stanley's investment banking prowess, coupled with MUFG's sizeable lending book, would be a winning combination.The pairing did struggle from the start, and had to ditch plans to merge their investment operations into a single entity in Japan due in part to regulatory reasons. As a result, there are two joint ventures: Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities - the names alone point to the complicated structure of the partnership. Questions were raised about how efficiently they could work. Plans to share each other's trading book also fell by the wayside.In its first year, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities reported a 144.9 billion yen ($1.4 billion) net loss due to trading losses on positions held by Mitsubishi before the venture started, stoking tensions within the tie-up.Those look to have eased, say people familiar with the venture, helped in part by a resurgence in Japanese overseas dealmaking.The venture has succeeded in large part because MUFG, aware of its limitations, has conceded some control to Morgan Stanley bankers in managing investment banking operations, say people at the banks and those who watch them closely. ""We're commercial bankers. We don't delude ourselves that we can do investment banking business,"" said a senior MUFG executive.TIES THAT BIND The companies bring complementing strengths to the venture: Morgan Stanley's global network helps those seeking overseas acquisitions and deals, while MUFG has a strong balance sheet and deep-rooted ties with Japanese companies.Before the Suntory/Beam coup, the venture advised on advertising agency Dentsu Inc's (4324.T) 395.5 billion yen acquisition of Britain's Aegis Group in 2012, with MUFG again providing finance. That deal, in particular, registered with bankers as Dentsu had historical ties with MUFG's rival Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T). ""It's thanks to Morgan Stanley. We're not even the main lender for Dentsu,"" an MUFG executive told Reuters at the time.A string of debt-funded overseas acquisitions from Asia underscores the importance for Wall Street banks in having a strong local partner in the region.Japan was Asia's biggest investment banking market last year, generating $4.6 billion in fees, Thomson Reuters data show. Mergers and acquisitions contributed $881 million to that fee pool, though its share of the total dipped to below a fifth from 26 percent in 2012 as Japanese outbound deals slowed.The tie-up still has room to improve. MUFG officials say they want the venture to have a bigger M&A advisory role for smaller companies - a notion that could run counter to Morgan Stanley's hunger for big deals.""Nomura (8604.T) dominates in medium- and small-sized business advisory,"" said one MUFG official.

8,"  (Adds investor comment, detail on wealth management business)By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tanya AgrawalJan 17 Morgan Stanley posted stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results, as its retail brokerage and asset management businesses won more assets from clients and benefited from rising stock markets.The bank's retail brokerage business, which manages money for wealthy clients, reached the company's target for profit margins, and Morgan Stanley raised that forecast for the coming years. The bank's shares rose 4.2 percent to $33.33, their highest level since November 2009, when the bank was recovering from the financial crisis.The results underscored how Morgan Stanley, the second largest U.S. investment bank, has retooled itself since it came uncomfortably close to failing in 2008. It now earns more revenues from brokerage and asset management than traditional investment banking businesses like underwriting stock offerings and trading bonds.""They're doing what they set out to do, and I think it's a better direction to go in,"" said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, which manages about $3.8 billion.Chief Executive James Gorman still has work to do. The investment banking businesses, particularly its long-troubled bond trading efforts, were a drag on results in the quarter, and helped pull down Morgan Stanley's profit.Net income for common shareholders in the fourth quarter fell to $133 million, or 7 cents a share, from $568 million, or 29 cents, in the same quarter in 2012.""We've said pretty consistently we're a one-step-at-a-time management team,"" Gorman said on a conference call. Excluding items such as $1.2 billion in legal expenses, the bank earned 50 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, beating the average analyst estimate of 45 cents.Retail brokerage generated $3.73 billion in revenue in the quarter, up from $3.33 billion a year earlier.Income from the business rose, helped by its purchase of the 35 percent of the retail business it did not own from Citigroup Inc, its joint venture partner, in mid-2013. All of the income from the unit now goes to Morgan Stanley, which agreed in 2009 to buy Citigroup's Smith Barney unit over multiple years.Brokers generate relatively steady fees for the bank, and the business is much less risky than areas like bond trading, where bad bets hobbled Morgan Stanley in 2008.In the fourth quarter, the unit delivered a pretax margin of 19 percent, or 20 percent excluding a charge. Results were helped by positive inflows and higher commissions, as well as rising markets. Morgan Stanley raised its margin targets to a range of 22 percent to 25 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015, from a prior 20 percent to 22 percent. The increased forecast is a positive, but Morgan Stanley's wealth business has lagged major rivals on the measure. Bank of America Corp's wealth business delivered a pretax margin of 26.6 percent in the quarter.One way the bank hopes to boost its margins in wealth management is through lending more to clients. Morgan Stanley has been pushing advisers to make more loans, an effort that may be paying off. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told Reuters in an interview that the bank's loans and lending commitments rose 48 percent in 2013 from 2012.Anecdotally, Morgan Stanley brokers confirm that they are lending more. One adviser in California said he had a wealthy client recently who needed a quick loan to help buy a home for his grandchildren. Collateralized by the client's securities portfolio, the loan was approved in about a week and was paid off quickly when the grandchildren obtained a mortgage a few weeks later, said the broker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Only about five percent of wealth management clients currently have loans from the bank, significantly less than at competitors, but Morgan Stanley expects to bring that up to 10 percent over the next several year, consistent with competitors, a bank spokesman said. TOUGH FOR INVESTMENT BANKING Revenue at Morgan Stanley's investment management unit jumped 41 percent to $842 million.But Morgan Stanley's investment banking performance was more mixed. Bond trading revenue fell 14 percent to $694 million, excluding an accounting adjustment.Revenue from fixed income and related businesses like commodities trading have been hurt across Wall Street by falling bond prices, which weigh on client volume. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc posted similar declines in revenue, but Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co managed to boost their bond trading revenue. [ID: nL2N0KQ1SW]Speaking on a conference call with analysts, CFO Porat said the bond trading business was hurt by ""rates"" products, which typically include U.S. government debt and other bonds with interest-rate risk but little credit risk.As with most Wall Street banks, the equities market was a bright spot for Morgan Stanley in the latest quarter.Equities trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion, while equity underwriting revenue rose 75 percent to $416 million on an increase in both initial public offerings and secondary stock offerings.

Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc posted similar declines in revenue, but Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co managed to boost their bond trading revenue.Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the bond trading business was hurt by ""rates"" products, which typically include U.S. government debt and other bonds with interest-rate risk but little credit risk.As with most Wall Street banks, the equities market was a bright spot for Morgan Stanley in the latest quarter.Equities trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion, while equity underwriting revenue rose 75 percent to $416 million on an increase in both initial public offerings and secondary stock offerings.(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Ted Kerr and Jeffrey Benkoe)",2014-01-17,MS,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 2:50pm EST",Morgan Stanley profit beats estimate; raises margin target,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-morganstanley-results-idUSBREA0G0PQ20140117?type=companyNews

12,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In early 2011, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman thought he had finally figured out how to rebuild the bank's depleted bond trading business without taking too much risk.He hired traders from rivals in areas where the bank was relatively weak, such as trading government debt, and exhorted his sales staff to gain new clients and win more trades from existing customers.On Friday, after three years of spotty results, Gorman flipped the script, announcing a new strategy for fixing the operation: shrinking and taking less risk. It is at least the fourth time the bank has tried to retool the business since the financial crisis.Rivals and some analysts are skeptical that Gorman has it right this time.""Whether banks can really compete and be profitable on a smaller scale - that's the million dollar question,"" said Lisa Kwasnowski, an analyst at the bond ratings firm DBRS who is supportive of Gorman's plan.Bond trading - including fixed income, currencies, and commodities - has historically been a profit driver for banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, but new capital and trading rules from regulators in the aftermath of the financial crisis have squeezed profits.Morgan Stanley saw its bond trading revenue fall 14 percent, excluding an accounting adjustment, in the fourth quarter. Revenue from the business also fell for Goldman and Citigroup Inc. Nearly every major global bank is examining what to do with their fixed income businesses in light of new regulations.Bond trading has been critical for banks for more than a decade, both as a source of profits and as a way to win lucrative underwriting and merger advisory assignments.If it is too small, those benefits can disappear fast. For example, a company looking to issue bonds may not be confident that the underwriting bank will continue to trade them after the deal is initially sold. But Gorman has said he thinks that Morgan Stanley can continue to meet client needs even after it shrinks the business. His latest plan includes a new, more centralized management team, and ""a particular focus on expenses, technology, capital, and balance sheet,"" he said on a conference call with analysts on Friday.He is meeting some resistance from traders. Glenn Hadden, global head of interest-rates trading, was so vocal in his opposition to the changes that he was eventually asked to resign, said two people familiar with the matter.Hadden declined to comment when reached on Friday.Earlier this month, Hadden cited the new strategy as his reason for leaving.Morgan Stanley hired Hadden, a former Goldman Sachs trader in March 2011, and told him to win new business. But soon after that, new regulations started to hurt bond trading. Morgan Stanley's debt ratings fell as well, making customers less willing to enter into lucrative longer-term derivatives contracts with the bank. In May, Hadden's boss quit, to be replaced by Michael Heaney and Robert Rooney as co-heads of fixed-income sales and trading. The two executives sought to reduce risk and centralize management of the sprawling business.One element of that centralization plan particularly irked senior traders: the co-heads now make decisions about how much money every individual trader can trade, according to the sources.In the past, heads of fixed-income sales and trading would allocate capital to the desk, and let the desk determine how much money individual traders could use. Traders complained that the tighter controls limited their risk-taking and bonus potential, the sources said.'THEY CUT AND CUT' Limiting risk is critical to Gorman. He is keenly aware of Morgan Stanley's bad bets on subprime mortgages that in 2008 nearly capsized the company and forced it to take a government bailout. Coming out of the crisis, then-CEO John Mack took a much more cautious stance in fixed-income trading, slashing jobs and risk-taking. His move made sense at the time but left Morgan Stanley unprepared for a bond trading boom in 2009 and 2010 that created the most profitable year ever for rivals, including Goldman Sachs.Part of Gorman's strategy is to cut the bank's risk-weighted assets, a measure of assets that makes it easier for the bank to hold onto safer instruments like U.S. government bonds.The bank is in the process of winding down a big pool of fixed-income assets by more than half to $180 billion by the end of 2015, on a risk-weighted basis. The bank has another $30 billion worth of assets to go, and on Friday accelerated the timeframe for the task to be completed.Some rivals have argued that the bank cannot compete if it is too small, and say Morgan Stanley should go the way of UBS AG, which announced a decision to exit FICC trading almost entirely in October 2012.""History has shown people don't give up businesses easily - they cut and cut, and make strategic changes before they finally throw in the towel,"" said an executive at a rival firm. ""If you cut and are weak to begin with, it's hard to see how you get stronger.""Morgan Stanley officials say they do not want to be big just for the sake of it, preferring to be smaller but profitable.They also say they are not shrinking the business so drastically that they won't be able to compete and that it is big enough to maintain a presence in most major bond and derivatives markets. The bank knows it needs a fixed income arm to serve its other clients.""At a minimum, they need to accommodate clients in the wealth management and investment banking businesses,"" DBRS' Kwasnowski said.(Editing by Dan Wilchins and Paritosh Bansal)",2014-01-18,MS,"Sat Jan 18, 2014 | 1:16am EST","Analysis: Morgan Stanley bets on smaller bond unit, defying skeptics",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-morganstanley-bondtrading-idUSBREA0H05L20140118?type=companyNews

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 21 (Fitch) Morgan Stanley reported strong fourth-quarter 2013  (4Qâ€™13) core earnings, excluding legal expenses and other one-time items,  according to Fitch Ratings. Core financial performance for the quarter continued  to benefit from improved margins in the wealth management platform and solid  investment banking revenues. These were partially offset by weaker fixed income  and commodities net revenues.  The firmâ€™s overall results were impacted by a $1.2 billion legal charge  associated with pre-crisis mortgage securities. Given the increased earnings  diversification, improving performance and capital levels, these latest results  have no rating implications on Morgan Stanleyâ€™s 'A/F1' ratings or Stable  Outlook. Morgan Stanleyâ€™s core profitability remained consistent with 3Qâ€™13. Fitch  calculated pre-tax operating profits (excluding debt-value adjustment  impact and legal expenses) of $1.5 billion for both quarters. As a result,  pre-tax operating return on assets (excluding DVA impact and legal expenses)  remained unchanged at 0.7%. Non-compensation expenses increased 49% to $3.9  billion, as 4Qâ€™13 results included legal expenses of $1.2 billion for litigation  related to pre-crisis residential mortgage-backed securities. For full year  2013, as calculated by Fitch, pre-tax operating profits (excluding DVA impact  and legal expenses) of $6.5 billion were 32% higher than 2012.  The significant mortgage-related legal charge taken during the quarter is  consistent with the recent industry trend. Over the last six months, several  large securities firms have settled lawsuits filed in 2011 by the Federal  Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) over pre-crisis mortgage securities sold to Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac. As a result, significant charges have been incurred by  these firms. The FHFA complaint against Morgan Stanley cited securities with  $10.6 billion in face value. Morgan Stanley did not disclose what matters were  related to the litigation expense this quarter. Wealth management profits were positively impacted by a 7% sequential increase  in revenues. Pre-tax operating margin continued to improve increasing to 20%  (excluding a one-time impairment charge) from 19.2% at 3Qâ€™13 and is above the  2013 target margin of 18%. Fitch believes that Morgan Stanleyâ€™s targeted pre-tax  operating margin of 22%-25% in 4Qâ€™15 is achievable if the company successfully  executes on its strategy to deploy these deposits into securities and loans with  higher returns.  Institutional securities net revenues (excluding DVA impact) decreased  sequentially but were up 3% year over year (YoY). The firm had a challenging  quarter in fixed income and commodities, where net revenues declined 17% quarter  over quarter (QoQ), which was weaker than peers. Weaker performance in  commodities and interest rates were partially offset by increases in credit and  foreign exchange business. For 2013, fixed income and commodities net revenues  (excluding DVA impact) were 25% lower than 2012. Equity sales and trading net  revenues of $1.5 billion (excluding DVA impact) were down 12% quarter over  quarter as weaker derivatives revenues following a strong 3Qâ€™13 was partially  offset by strong client activity and higher cash volumes.  Investment banking net revenues of $1.4 billion were 37% higher than 3Qâ€™13 due  to higher advisory revenues across all regions and increased underwriting  volumes. Equity underwriting, which rebounded from a weak 3Qâ€™13, benefited from  strong IPO volumes. Debt underwriting revenues increased moderately in 3Qâ€™13 due  to higher loan syndication fees. The investment banking backlog continues to be  strong, and Morgan Stanley should continue to benefit from a higher level of  activity. On a full year basis, investment banking net revenues increased 11% to  $4.4 billion.  Morgan Stanleyâ€™ global liquidity reserve was a solid $202 billion, or 24% of  total assets, comprised of unencumbered liquid securities and cash. Liquidity  continues to be managed conservatively. Value at risk (VaR) was virtually  unchanged from 3Qâ€™13 at $51 million.  Morgan Stanley estimates that itâ€™s Basel III Tier I common ratio was  approximately 10.5% at 4Qâ€™13, comfortably above the 8.5% minimum. The company  estimated that its supplementary leverage ratio for the bank exceeded 6%. The  holding company supplementary leverage ratio was 4.2%, below the 5% threshold.  Fitch continues to believe that Morgan Stanley will be able to meet the  supplementary leverage minimums ahead of the required timeframe. During 4Qâ€™13, Morgan Stanley repurchased approximately $228 million shares  following its announcement in 2Qâ€™13 of a $500 million share buyback. For 2013,  Morgan Stanley repurchased approximately $350 million shares. Given the firmâ€™s  capital levels, Fitch would expect additional share repurchases in the coming  quarters.

Smaller competitors to the big six typically do not produce energy. Energy regulator Ofgem is imposing changes in the retail market, such as generation auctions, to make it easier for independent companies to access energy supplies. Spark Energy said its trading agreement with Morgan Stanley would allow it to carry out long-term hedging against price movements.Morgan Stanley is one of a few major banks that still actively trade European power and gas as tighter regulation and a fall in prices has made the market less attractive. Consumer energy bills have been rising over the past years due to added costs from government subsidies and modernisation of the grid, leading many households to switch to new, independent energy suppliers.Spark Energy started supplying domestic energy in July 2008 and is the only British utility focused on the residential letting sector.",2014-01-22,MS,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 9:07am EST",Morgan Stanley signs deal to buy energy for UK retailer,http://www.reuters.com//article/morganstanley-energy-britain-idUSL5N0KW2IJ20140122?type=companyNews

21,"   By Michael Connor and Hilary Russ | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 22 Morgan Stanley, rebuffed late last year by Puerto Rico officials over an offer to arrange a high-cost loan of up to $2 billion for the cash-strapped commonwealth, is now trying to pique investor interest in backing the idea, according to people briefed on the matter.The investment bank's pitch, aimed at hedge funds, private equity firms and others with a possible appetite for the U.S. territory's tax-free and high-yielding debt, comes as Puerto Rico scrambles to retain its investment grade rating against the threat of a downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, which could trigger further financial pain for the Caribbean island's government.""Under discussion is a 10-year deal with a non-call five-year option priced slightly below 10 percent,"" said a San Juan-based investment banker and former government official, who has been briefed on the proposal by hedge fund investors.Morgan Stanley's discussion with investors follows a pitch directly to Puerto Rico officials in late 2013 for a loan of roughly the same size and cost, according to two people familiar with that proposal. Officials rejected the idea as too costly.Puerto Rico, battling population decline, chronic recession and perennial budget shortfalls, is under pressure to show it can access the bond market after delaying a debt sale late last year and promising to bring a deal to market by late February. Puerto Rico has around $55 billion of tax-supported debt and another $15 billion supported by other revenue streams, such as water and power rates.On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Obama administration said the White House is not considering a bail out for Puerto Rico. The administration has established a task force to work with Puerto Rico on its economic and fiscal problems, and would prefer to allow that group to do its work.Unlike Detroit, which filed for the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy ever last year, Puerto Rico does not have the option to seek a restructuring of its debt under bankruptcy protection.Last month, Moody's placed Puerto Rico on notice that it was considering cutting its credit rating to junk status within three months. All three major ratings agencies have assigned the island's credit their lowest investment-grade ratings. A drop to junk could trigger accelerated repayments of debt and demands for more collateral for interest rate swaps. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the San Juan banker said the high rates in the Morgan Stanley proposal may put off government officials, who are actively weighing a sale of municipal bonds worth between $500 million and $1.2 billion.But they may have few other options, given how risky the market believes its debt to be.""Seeing how the secondary market is trading, it doesn't seem they would do much better in terms of pricing ...,"" the banker said.Intermediate and near-term Puerto Rico bonds on Tuesday yielded over 9 percent. An eight-year maturity carried a yield of 9.92 percent, even as maturities beyond 20 years yielded less than 9 percent. A deal worth $2 billion would allow Puerto Rico to demonstrate to markets and ratings agencies that it has enough liquidity for two years, which could translate into tighter spreads on new bonds, the banker said.The Morgan Stanley financing effort, which was first reported by The New York Times, might also relieve pressure around the possible ratings cut.Both Moody's and Fitch Ratings have said that the government needs to demonstrate its ability to sell new bonds if it is to avoid being stuck with junk-bond ratings.Yields on Puerto Rico's widely held debt have long been among the highest of big issuers in America's $3.7 trillion muni market, and shot up in September as worries about its finances intensified, but have inched back from recent highs. The credit spread for Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds maturing in 10 years over top-rated municipal bonds, a measure of the risk investors assign to owning its debt, was 680 basis points on Tuesday, according to Municipal Market Data.

A spokesman for the bank declined comment.Morgan Stanley may also have a hard time getting a go-ahead on a high-interest, $2 billion deal from Puerto Rico officials, who were just stung by a temporary court halt to unpopular reforms of the island's vastly underfunded teachers pension system.Some analysts say the government is concerned about some of the provisions being discussed, such as liens on revenue streams, and don't want to weaken protections that current bondholders enjoy.""Raising money prior to receiving an official go-ahead from authorities is unique,"" co-founder David Tawil of Maglan Capital, a hedge fund that owns Puerto Rico debt, said in an email. ""Perhaps Morgan Stanley feels it's worth putting in the time and effort because Puerto Rico will need to raise funds, and the bank will then be top of mind when it comes time to select an underwriter.""The effort to stir up investor interest in Puerto Rico's debt has gathered steam recently.

26,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Fred Katayama | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc are considering forming a partnership to provide administrative services to hedge funds, a senior official of the Japanese lender said on Wednesday.The two banks have been examining ways to collaborate in that area since MUFG purchased a fund-servicing business last year, Masaaki Tanaka, deputy president of MUFG, told Reuters in an interview.""Obviously Morgan Stanley deals with a lot of hedge funds, and they need administrative services,"" said Tanaka. ""We are discussing if there is any coordination (we can) create with Morgan Stanley. There are a lot of discussions around this right now.""Morgan Stanley and MUFG already have several partnerships, stemming from a $9 billion lifeline MUFG provided the Wall Street bank at the height of the financial crisis. MUFG now owns 22 percent of Morgan Stanley, making it the bank's largest shareholder.The two banks first announced a joint venture in 2010 that focused on trading and investment banking in Japan, but the relationship has expanded since then.The two banks now collaborate on mergers, underwriting, trading and loans in the U.S. as well as Japan, Tanaka said. They banks have a list of 150 major U.S. corporations that they are targeting for investment banking business.""We will present ourselves and Morgan Stanley as a single team,"" said Tanaka. ""Morgan Stanley will provide very sophisticated products and services, and we will provide our balance sheet."" As a recent example, Tanaka cited the $13.6 billion purchase of Beam Inc by Suntory Holdings Ltd. Morgan Stanley had an investment banking relationship with Beam while MUFG had a banking relationship with Suntory, and was also able to provide bridge financing for the deal, he said.In addition to the capital markets partnerships, MUFG also recently exited a wealth management joint venture in Japan with Merrill Lynch to partner with Morgan Stanley instead.A hedge-fund servicing agreement between the two banks would work much the same way as their others do.MUFG last year acquired Butterfield Fulcrum Group, which provides administrative services to $100 billion worth of client assets across 850 funds. Morgan Stanley has extensive relationships through its prime brokerage business, which loans money and securities to hedge funds. DEEPENING RELATIONSHIP Despite recent progress in expanding their relationship, Morgan Stanley and MUFG got off to a rocky start. In early 2011, their Japanese securities joint venture lost about $950 million through bad trades in a single quarter.MUFG also suffered for some time as Morgan Stanley's largest shareholder. Since MUFG's investment, the Wall Street bank has faced volatile markets, regulatory pressures, strategic changes and a ratings downgrade, with its share price trading well below book value at times.But Morgan Stanley's shares were among the best performing financial stocks, up 64 percent last year, as the bank completed its acquisition of the Smith Barney business from Citigroup Inc, providing more stable income to offset unpredictable swings in trading and investment banking revenue. Tanaka acknowledged that the two banks ""had a lot of bumpy experiences"" and that there was initially a great deal of skepticism on Wall Street about how their partnership would fare. He said MUFG management has had many tense conversations with Morgan Stanley management through the years.""Obviously when you're kind of husband and wife, there are things that you have to discuss between you two,"" he said. ""In the middle of that, it's never an envious position. Nevertheless, we have been able to address all those issues together and provided solutions and so on. This relationship has been deepening very, very well.""Morgan Stanley executives have also been touting the deepening relationship with MUFG for the past few years, highlighting it as an area for revenue growth.""That is a partnership and a relationship on the business side that will continue to grow for many years ahead, and is not something that just occurred in the financial crisis and will disappear,"" Gorman said at a conference in June. ""This is something which is very long-term.""The relationship has started to bear fruit, Tanaka said.In 2013, nearly 10 percent of Morgan Stanley's net income came from joint ventures with MUFG, said Tanaka, who sits on Morgan Stanley's board. For the first six months of MUFG's fiscal year, which begins in April, about 9 percent of its net income came from Morgan Stanley partnerships, he said.(Editing by David Gregorio)",2014-01-29,MS,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 6:29pm EST","Exclusive: Mitsubishi UFJ, Morgan Stanley eye deal to serve hedge funds",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mufg-morganstanley-idUSBREA0S28J20140129?type=companyNews

30,"  NEW YORK Blackstone Group's (BX.N) asset-light model may not fit with the potentially risky, capital-intensive business of trading physical commodities, a top executive said on Thursday, in comments that seemed to jar with its interest in the industry.Blackstone is one of three finalists in the running to buy JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) physical commodity division, which includes metals warehouses, a large global oil trading group and gas and power deals. A final decision is expected within days, industry sources have said.Blackstone President Tony James did not directly discuss the JPMorgan business, one of the biggest raw material operations on Wall Street, but in a call with reporters offered rare insight into the world's largest alternative asset manager's thinking three years after it first started looking at diversifying its revenue by getting into commodities.""Our business is to manage other people's capital and most of the successful commodities businesses are firms that are based around having a strong presence in physical assets and a lot of infrastructure. That provides some other asset management or trading opportunities but you've got to be able to build the business up,"" he said.""That is inconsistent with the asset-light asset manager model that we have.""His comments also touched on challenges that have pushed some of Wall Street's biggest banks to retreat from the industry amid razor-thin margins, rising capital costs and unprecedented regulatory scrutiny. ""I can't see us having a vast balance sheet with lots of assets on our balance sheet. It's just not the way we are,"" he said.""If you are in the physical commodities business and you have oil spills and stuff like this, it's complex, so we are trying to figure out - is there a strategy that is a winning strategy in commodities that is compatible with us and what we do well. I don't think we have got that figured out just yet.""JPMorgan put the commodities business up for sale last July, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) sold the bulk of its physical oil business to Rosneft in December. Blackstone is up against Australian bank Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) and Mercuria, the Swiss-based oil trader.The three bidders have never publicly commented on their participation in the seven-month process. JPMorgan declined to comment.Some analysts said James' candid comments on the potential hurdles also underscore how its rival bidders may be a more logical and natural fit for the business. ""It is a big move away from Blackstone's core businesses,"" said Kris Tremaine, a longtime commodities trader and managing director of Kimura, a commodities trade finance fund set to launch later this year.Macquarie has the deep pockets and roots in mining, agriculture and energy, while Mercuria has ambitions to expand further into commodities and industry know-how.Neither would be under the regulatory glare that has pushed JPMorgan to exit the business.(This story was corrected to clarify that James spoke to reporters, not analysts)(Reporting by Josephine Mason and Anna Sussman; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2014-01-31,MS,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 8:54am EST",Physical commodity assets 'inconsistent' with Blackstone model: executive,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-blackstone-commodiites-idUSBREA0U0X520140131?type=companyNews

34,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 05 (Fitch) The $1.25 billion mortgage settlement between  Morgan Stanley and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) conforms to the  recent pattern of lawsuit settlements made by large global banks, and Fitch  Ratings says the payment will have no impact on Morgan Stanley's ratings. The size of the Morgan Stanley settlement, at 11.8% of the original face value  of affected mortgage-backed securities, is largely in line with the 12.1% paid  by JP Morgan Chase, though slightly lower than Deutsche Bank's 13.6%. Morgan  Stanley had already largely reserved for the payment in the fourth quarter.  Though the FHFA settlement puts a key source of legal uncertainty behind Morgan  Stanley, there are some remaining private-label securities lawsuits that remain  unsettled. Half of the FHFA's suits against 18 large institutions have now been settled,  but this amounts to only 35% of the securities' face value. This is not  surprising, as most of the banks that have settled had lower exposure and were  looking to settle more quickly. The remainder of FHFA lawsuit exposure is  concentrated in four institutions -- Bank of America, the Royal Bank of  Scotland, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have booked sizable litigation gains related to the  FHFA suits in second-half 2013, and we expect more in 2014. The gains are  effectively remitted to the U.S. Treasury under the terms of the net worth sweep  agreement between Treasury and GSEs.

36,"  Feb 4 Morgan Stanley said it would pay $1.25 billion to the U.S. regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to settle a lawsuit related to the sale of mortgage-backed securities.The Wall Street bank will add $150 million to its legal reserves as a result of the settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Morgan Stanley disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.

38,"  * Picks DBS, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, UOB for IPO-sources* Marks first step toward merging of Charoen, FCL property assets* Listing comes after F&N, FCL split last month   (Adds detail on FCL properties, valuation)By Saeed AzharSINGAPORE, Feb 6 Frasers Centrepoint Ltd (FCL) , a company controlled by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, is looking to raise up to S$600 million ($473 million) through the listing of a hospitality real estate investment trust in Singapore in the second quarter, sources said.This listing would mark the first step toward the merging of property assets of Charoen's business empire, which operates under the Singapore-listed FCL and his TCC Group, after the Thai tycoon won control of the drinks-and-property conglomerate Fraser and Neave in an $11 billion deal last year.Charoen's fortunes appear better than rival businessman Dhanin Chearavanont, whose retail firm CP ALL has become Asia's most indebted food retailer after an expensive acquisition funded by a large foreign currency loan. FCL's planned real estate investment trust would hold serviced residences owned by F&N and other assets such as the InterContinental Hotel in Singapore, which Charoen's TCC Group owns, sources said.FCL, which split from Fraser and Neave into a separately listed property-focused company, has a market value of $3.2 billion, while Fraser and Neave is valued at $3.8 billion.F&N returned S$4.73 billion to shareholders as part of a capital reduction last year.If dividends are included, Charoen's deal to takeover F&N is profitable especially after the split, which now reflects a better market value of its Singapore property business, one of the sources told Reuters. In a research note last month, UBS also flagged the possibility of Charoen's Thai Beverage selling its stake in the property business and taking a larger stake in F&N to focus on the food and beverage firm.SERVICED RESIDENCES  FCL's Frasers Hospitality owns serviced residences in Singapore, Europe, North Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Australia, offering about 8,000 apartments in more than 30 cities, according to its website.FCL has picked DBS, HSBC, Morgan Stanley  and United Overseas Bank as the main advisers on the deal, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.These banks also played a key role the F&N transaction with DBS and UOB providing the bulk of the financing.""The deal could come as early as April, but all depends on the markets,"" a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, adding the deal size could be between S$500 million and S$600 million.A spokesman for FCL said the group has previously announced that it is exploring the possibility of a hospitality REIT, but declined to confirm the name of the advisers and the size of the deal.

39,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 7 Mary Mack, who last month became head of Wells Fargo Advisors, the second largest U.S. brokerage firm, has reorganized the sprawling strategy group she ran before her promotion.In a memo to employees on Friday, the 51-year-old executive said she has split the Financial Services Group that was responsible for broker recruiting, products and technology into three units with their heads reporting directly to her.She named only one leader, Joe Nadreau, who will continue to run the strategic solutions unit that she has renamed ""Innovation and Business Strategy."" The other open roles in the technology and products areas will be posted next week and filled as soon as possible by outsiders or insiders, Mack said.""What began as a search for someone to replace me (as head of the Financial Services Group),"" she wrote in the memo, ""led to a more comprehensive look at our overall structure to ensure it was the best one to lead us into the future."" The three team leaders will join Wells Advisors' executive committee, she said.The reorganization puts Mack's stamp on the brokerage network of Wells Fargo Corp that had been run for almost 15 years by Danny Ludeman, who retired at age 56 at the end of 2013. Some brokers said they had been impatient to see Mack's plan, given that she spent the bulk of her 30-year banking career in areas outside retail brokerage. Their anxiety may have led her to announce the reorganization before personnel details were set, they said.In an interview, Mack denied that the memo was sent impulsively. ""I get asked a lot about my style, and it's very collaborative,"" she said. ""The opportunity to share context around the new roles and our team was important.""The functions of the financial services group that she ran for a year before her promotion have changed often since Wells Fargo Corp became a major force in retail brokerage after buying Wachovia Corp. In 2008, she said. In addition to renaming the strategy group, Mack has created a new ""Mobile and Online Group"" to develop better ways for brokers to sell products and services to clients and to emphasize the need to invest in digital media that clients increasingly use for their financial needs, she wrote.Major rivals such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley  have recently invested heavily in platform technology that directs brokers to fee-based services the firms promote and embrace new technology. Mack declined to discuss the firm's technology budget. She also has made some personnel changes. Chip Walker, who ran broker recruiting and branch manager productivity is taking a new position in sales management. Wells is looking for two people to replace him for the essential job of recruiting and retaining brokers, according to the memo.Mack also has moved chief administrative officer Mary Atkin to run Wells Fargo Advisors' brokerage operations in St. Louis, the firm's home base. Atkins, a veteran of the former A.G. Edwards brokerage firm that has been integrated into Wells, is not being replaced.People in her group, which coordinated functions ranging from supplier planning and real estate to community affairs, are being deployed to other parts of Wells Fargo Advisors. The reorganization is not tied to staff reductions, Mack said.Wells Fargo Advisors includes 11,000 brokers working with ""affluent"" clients out of brokerage offices in 50 states, about 1,000 brokers who work with less wealthy clients in Wells Fargo bank branches and another 1,215 ""independent contractors"" who buy services and products from Wells in exchange for about 10 to 20 percent of the revenue they generate.",2014-02-07,MS,"Fri Feb 7, 2014 | 2:23pm EST",Wells Fargo Advisors head Mack remakes her old domain,http://www.reuters.com//article/wellsfargo-revamp-idUSL2N0LC0WJ20140207?type=companyNews

50,"   By Nadia Damouni and Greg Roumeliotis | New York  New York Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC are in advanced talks to buy minority stakes in Kronos Inc that could value the human resources software company at around $4.5 billion, including debt, three people familiar with the matter said.Blackstone and GIC plan to collectively invest $750 million for just over 40 percent of the equity in Kronos, one of the sources said. A deal could be announced as early as this week, that person added, cautioning that some details were still being negotiated.Private equity firms Hellman & Friedman LLC and JMI Equity explored an outright sale of Kronos but rejected takeover bids as high as $4.6 billion earlier this month due to disagreements over valuation, people familiar with the matter said last week.By not giving up control of the company, Hellman & Friedman was willing to accept a lower valuation for Kronos because the new investors no longer had to pay a ""control"" premium, the sources said.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Kronos declined to comment while Hellman & Friedman, JMI Equity, Blackstone and GIC could not be immediately reached for comment. Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based Kronos provides workforce management for companies and organizations in more than 100 countries.Human resources technology is in strong demand among businesses, which are increasingly turning to cloud computing, which allows them to access data from remote servers that are faster and cheaper than traditional in-house infrastructure.Workday Inc (WDAY.N), a Silicon Valley startup that offers Web-based human resources software, had a blockbuster initial public offering in October 2012 and its shares have almost doubled in value the last 12 months amid strong earnings. Hellman & Friedman and JMI Equity, which took Kronos private for $1.8 billion in 2007, have taken advantage of Kronos' strong cash flow to draw more than $1.5 billion in dividends from the company.They committed $698 million as equity to the 2007 deal along with the company's management. Including the dividends they have taken out, the potential deal with Blackstone and GIC values Kronos at around 5 times their original investment, one of the sources said. Most recently in November, they had the company borrow to pay themselves a $490 million dividend, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.Kronos has a large and diversified base of enterprise clients and its recurring maintenance and subscription model has contributed to sustained growth in its revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Moody's commented in November.Kronos has EBITDA of around $350 million and is being advised by Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on the potential sale, people familiar with the matter said in December.Hellman & Friedman and smaller buyout firm JMI Equity also teamed up late last year to buy insurance software provider Applied Systems from Bain Capital LLC for $1.8 billion. In 2010, they sold insurance software firm Vertafore to TPG Capital LP for $1.4 billion.(Reporting by Nadia Damouni and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)",2014-02-20,MS,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 1:20am EST","Blackstone, GIC nearing Kronos minority stake deal: sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-kronos-blackstone-idUSBREA1J0B320140220?type=companyNews
51,"  * Clarity on cooperation with Rosneft in trading in summer* Q4 core earnings beat expectations* Expects gradual improvement in refining margins in 2014* Margins to be boosted by Libya, IranBy Stephen JewkesMILAN, Feb 21 Italian refiner Saras  said its business should get a boost if its partner Rosneft  goes through with plans to buy part of the oil-trading operations of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley.""It's an important development for Rosneft and a sign of their more proactive commercial approach. We'll have to wait till summer for clarity on how we'll move together,"" Saras Managing Director Dario Scaffardi said in a conference call on Friday. Saras, controlled by the Italian Moratti family, is partly owned by Rosneft, Russia's state-controlled oil giant, with which it has a joint venture for trading and processing crude oil and selling refined products.Last December, Rosneft agreed to buy much of Morgan Stanley's physical oil-trading business. Rosneft head Igor Sechin previously said the group was looking to raise its stake in Saras.Italy's No. 2 refiner, whose main Sarroch refinery in Sardinia has a capacity of 300,000 barrels-per-day (bpd), is counting on Rosneft to help diversify feedstocks and boost profitability. Earlier on Friday Saras said improvement in its refinery business helped its core earnings more than triple in the fourth quarter to 64.4 million euros from 17.6 million a year before. The result topped an analysts' consensus forecast provided by the company of 21 million euros.""These were much better than we expected,"" a Milan-based analyst said.Chairman Gian Marco Moratti said in the results statement the Saras expected a gradual improvement in refining margins this year as Libyan crude production recovers and sanctions against Iran are eased. The Italian refiner imported sweet Iranian crude before the U.S-led embargo was imposed. It was also a big buyer of Libyan crude before conflict interrupted supplies there.""We have done well at finding replacements with crudes from West Africa, the Caribbean area and North America,"" Scaffardi told analysts.A recovery in economic growth and demand for petrol products will also bolster refining margins, Saras said.European refining margins remain under pressure because of over-capacity and increased competition from the Middle East and Asia. Declining local demand and older, less-efficient plants in Europe has also held back growth.The company also announced it had delayed planned maintenance at the gasoline production unit of the Sarroch plant from the first quarter to the third and fourth quarters of this year.At 1635 GMT, Saras shares were up 1 percent, while the European oil and gas sector was up 0.7 percent.",2014-02-21,MS,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 12:09pm EST",UPDATE 2-Saras expects boost from Rosneft-Morgan Stanley deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/saras-results-idUSL6N0LQ3B520140221?type=companyNews
52,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. central bankers thought they should get more regulatory powers in return for providing cheap cash to Wall Street banks during the 2008 credit crisis, according to Federal Reserve transcripts released on Friday.Powerful investment banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) had access to a raft of measures to prop up markets during the 2008 credit meltdown, but the Federal Reserve had little say over them.""I am just a little worried about being taken advantage of here,"" Richard Fisher, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a March 2008 conference call of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).""The question is, what do we get in return, and how do we make sure that, since we are not the regulator of these dealers, there is indeed discipline?"" the transcripts show Fisher as saying.That concern foreshadowed later efforts to do away with the expectation that the fear of a financial meltdown would force governments to always stand behind banks in a crisis, something that Wall Street critics say can encourage reckless behavior.The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law prohibits taxpayer-funded bailouts of ""too-big-to-fail"" banks, but some politicians have pushed for further measures to ensure there is not a repeat of the crisis-era bailouts. The Fed, which is still dealing with fallout from the crisis and the 2007-2009 recession, released transcripts of all 2008 meetings of its FOMC on Friday after the typical five-year lag.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission oversaw the securities activities of the biggest investment banks in 2008, and only monitored the parent companies through a voluntary system known as the ""Consolidated Supervised Entities"" program.While Wall Street investment banks were not regulated by the Fed, they could participate in the central bank's emergency measures to provide them with more collateral and to prop up short-term lending and prevent a further spreading of panic. ""My concern is that the safety-and-soundness disciplines that we apply don't appear to be applied to these broker-dealers,"" the Dallas Fed's Fisher said at the March meeting.During that year, the independent investment banks all succumbed to the crisis in rapid succession.

The Fed, which is still dealing with fallout from the crisis and the 2007-2009 recession, released transcripts of all 2008 meetings of its FOMC on Friday after the typical five-year lag.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission oversaw the securities activities of the biggest investment banks in 2008, and only monitored the parent companies through a voluntary system known as the ""Consolidated Supervised Entities"" program.While Wall Street investment banks were not regulated by the Fed, they could participate in the central bank's emergency measures to provide them with more collateral and to prop up short-term lending and prevent a further spreading of panic.

55,"  * Q4 core earnings beat expectations* Expects gradual improvement in refining margins in 2014* Margins to be boosted by Libya, IranBy Stephen JewkesMILAN, Feb 21 Italy's Saras said on Friday its refining business should get a boost if its partner Rosneft goes through with plans to buy part of the oil-trading operations of Morgan Stanley. Saras, controlled by the Italian Moratti family, runs the Sarroch refinery in Sardinia. It is partly owned by Rosneft, Russia's state-controlled oil giant, with which it has a joint venture for trading and processing crude oil and selling refined products.Last December, Rosneft agreed to buy much of Morgan Stanley's physical oil-trading business. In November, Rosneft head Igor Sechin said the group was looking to raise its stake in Saras.In a statement on 2013 results, Saras said improvement in its refinery business helped its core earnings rise more than threefold in the fourth quarter, to 64.4 million euros from 17.6 million euros a year before. The result topped an analysts' consensus forecast provided by the company of 21 million euros. ""These were much better than we expected,"" a Milan-based analyst said.Chairman Gian Marco Moratti also said the company expected a gradual improvement in refining margins this year as Libyan crude production recovers and sanctions against Iran are eased. The Italian refiner imported sweet Iranian crude before the U.S-led embargo was imposed. It was also a big buyer of Libyan crude before conflict interrupted supplies there.A recovery in economic growth and demand for petrol products would also bolster refining margins, Moratti said.European refining margins remain under pressure because of over-capacity and increased competition from the Middle East and Asia. Declining local demand and older and less-efficient plant in Europe has also held back growth.At 1338 GMT, Saras shares were up 2.2 percent while the European oil and gas sector was up 0.67 percent.",2014-02-21,MS,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 10:05am EST",UPDATE 1 -Saras expects boost from Rosneft deal on Morgan Stanley ops,http://www.reuters.com//article/saras-results-idUSL6N0LQ2FZ20140221?type=companyNews
56,"   By Anna Louie Sussman  NEW YORK, Feb 24 () - TransMontaigne Partners LP has agreed to lease capacity at two Florida marine fuels terminals under a 2-year deal, ending its current agreement with Morgan Stanley, TransMontaigne announced on Wednesday.TransMontaigne did not name the new lessee, but industry participants said it was Singapore-based marine fuel supplier Chemoil Energy Ltd, which is majority-owned by commodities giant Glencore Xstrata. A Chemoil spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.The agreement with Morgan Stanley to lease these facilities will end on May 31, 2014, as the investment bank's trading arm reduces its physical footprint and moves to sell its stake in TransMontaigne, for which it was the biggest client.The agreement announced in a TransMontaigne statement on Monday covers tanks with an aggregate capacity of 1.35 million barrels at marine fuels terminals in Port Everglades and Fisher Island. The two-year deal will begin on June 1, 2014, and will have options for renewal, according to the statement. The terminals represent about 6 percent of the company's total tank capacity. Marine fuels, commonly known as ""bunker fuels,"" are used to power ships' engines, generators and auxiliary machinery.In July 2013, Chemoil expanded its U.S. operations by acquiring Colonial Group's bunkering business in the ports of Savannah, Charleston and Jacksonville, according to a report by the Savannah Morning News. The lease transfer was the second in as many months for Morgan Stanley, whose trading division, Morgan Stanley Capital Group (MSCG), owns 100 percent of TransMontaigne Inc, which controls the general partner of Denver-based TransMontaigne Partners LP.In late January, TransMontaigne agreed to lease capacity at two oil product terminals, known as the Razorback terminals, and a pipeline to Magellan Pipeline Company LP under a 10-year deal, also ending an agreement with Morgan Stanley. The bank announced in December that it was seeking to sell its TransMontaigne stake. In December, the bank agreed to sell its physical oil trading business -- but not TransMontaigne - to Russaia's Rosneft.In its 2012 annual report, TransMontaigne said Morgan Stanley Capital Group accounted for more than 60 percent of its revenues in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The revenues from the Florida bunker fuels tanks and the Razorback terminals accounted for around 14 percent of total revenue in 2012, according to the annual report.In 2012, TransMontaigne reported total revenue of $156.2 million.Officials from Morgan Stanley and TransMontaigne did not comment.",2014-02-24,MS,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 5:47pm EST",Glencore unit takes Transmontaigne tank lease from Morgan -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSL1N0LT1SH20140224?type=companyNews
57,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley has reached a $275 million proposed settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that would allow the Wall Street bank to move past a substantial legal overhang from the financial crisis.Morgan Stanley said in an annual filing on Tuesday that it has reached an ""agreement in principle"" with SEC enforcement staff that would not require it to admit any wrongdoing.The SEC has been investigating Morgan Stanley's role as a sponsor and underwriter of subprime mortgage-backed bonds that lost money soon after being issued in 2007. Its investigation is part of a broader probe of such deals across Wall Street in the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Morgan Stanley's settlement would follow similar deals reached between the agency and rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley also said it would pay $1.25 billion to settle a lawsuit by a U.S. housing regulator over mortgage-backed bonds.The SEC agreement is not final, and may not be approved by the commission, Morgan Stanley said. Other SEC settlements with banks that did not include an admission of wrongdoing have been lambasted by critics including U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who rejected one such settlement. Morgan Stanley still faces a host of litigation from private parties and government entities, much of which pertains to mortgage bonds and derivatives that were constructed in the run-up to the mortgage crisis. Its legal issues took up 11 pages of its 300-plus page 10-K filing, and dented earnings last year. Morgan Stanley's litigation costs soared to $1.95 billion in 2013 from $513 million the prior year, and $151 million in 2011, the company said in its filing. Last year, legal costs represented 16.7 percent of Morgan Stanley's operating expenses excluding compensation, up from 5.1 percent in 2012 and 1.5 percent in 2011.Additional legal reserves reduced the earnings per share Morgan Stanley reported in January by 5 cents.

Since then Morgan Stanley has continued its strong run in recent years on advising mergers and acquisitions in Asia Pacific, finishing 2013 as the top-ranked investment bank for such deals in the region according to Thomson Reuters data.Morgan Stanley was the fourth-ranked bank for equity capital markets deals in Asia-Pacific last year.

Strong joined Morgan Stanley in January 1993 in Chicago, spending 18 years there before the move to Asia.Strong notified the bank early last year of his desire to retire from Morgan Stanley in May 2014, according to the memo.",2014-02-28,MS,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 11:37pm EST",UPDATE 1-Morgan Stanley's Gokul Laroia to become Asia Pacific co-CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/morganstanley-laroia-idUSL3N0LX1AY20140228?type=companyNews

70,"   By Anna Louie Sussman | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 28 Commodity revenues fell nearly 40 percent at Morgan Stanley and remained flat at Goldman Sachs Group Inc last year, according to filings from the two biggest Wall Street commodities players that face a changing regulatory landscape.Morgan Stanley's commodity net revenues decreased by 38 percent from 2012, a second straight annual drop, in what the bank described in its annual report to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as ""challenging market-making conditions."" Commodities net revenues fell 20 percent in 2012 over 2011.The dwindling revenues follow tighter restrictions on banks trading with their own money and heightened public scrutiny of their role in the natural resources supply chain.Goldman Sachs said its commodity net revenues for 2013 were ""essentially unchanged"" from 2012. The bank had said in 2012 it saw ""significantly lower"" revenues over 2011.The bank reported $902 million in revenues from market-making activities in commodities, an 83 percent increase from the previous year. It said those figures did not accurately reflect how it runs its commodities business. None of the major Wall Street banks provided details on its commodities operations, but overall commodities revenues have waned in recent years.Total commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen by about two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10 banks notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to London-based analytics firm Coalition.In 2009, Goldman Sachs commodity unit J. Aron alone brought in $4.5 billion. By 2011, that had fallen to $1.6 billion. Morgan Stanley's revenues peaked at around $3 billion in 2008 but fell to around $1 billion by 2011, according to Reuters' calculations. Based on that figure, revenues would have come to around $600 million last year.Spokesmen for both banks declined to comment on Friday. IN IT TO WIN IT? Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG  and Barclays PLC have sold or shuttered some or all of their physical commodities operations, but Morgan and Goldman have indicated they still see opportunities.Goldman Sachs' chief financial officer reaffirmed in a January earnings call the bank's intent to remain in the commodities trading business, deeming it ""too important"" to clients to exit.Morgan Stanley owns several power plants in the U.S. and still trades power, gas and crude oil, among other commodities, although it sold the bulk of its physical crude oil trading operations to Russian oil giant Rosneft Ltd.The two banks may yet emerge from the U.S. regulatory upheaval better off than their peers, who face potentially tougher new rules, thanks to a longstanding legal exemption that regulators say limits their ability to restrict the banks' activities.",2014-03-01,MS,"Fri Feb 28, 2014 | 7:12pm EST",Morgan Stanley commods revenue fell 38 pct in 2013; Goldman flat,http://www.reuters.com//article/banks-commodities-revenues-idUSL1N0LX2NH20140301?type=companyNews

84,"  NEW YORK, March 10 Merrill Lynch, whose army of stockbrokers has shrunk almost 15 percent since it was bought by Bank of America Corp five years ago, replaced or transferred more than a dozen of its senior sales executives last week as it seeks to increase  productivity.A Merrill spokesman insisted that there is nothing unusual about the management changes that were announced internally by John Thiel, the head of the wealth management and private banking unit.""This time of year we normally see a combination of natural attrition, retirement and redeployment,"" he said, noting that Wall Street managers typically leave after collecting bonuses for the previous year.However, several recruiters and Merrill advisers said the long tenure of most of the executives who were shifted calls attention to the changing nature of branch management jobs and to a significant shift in the culture of the firm since the Bank of America takeover.Merrill Lynch has dominated U.S. wealth management through much of its 100-year history. Until recently, officials boasted that its executives were the only ones among the big U.S. firms who began as Merrill brokers and understand the rank-and-file. Thiel downplayed that lineage during a January interview with Reuters, saying the executive lineup could change.Merrill, and competitors such as Wells Fargo Advisors, UBS and Morgan Stanley, in recent years have modified their sales models, encouraging brokers to spend less time picking stocks and bonds for clients and more time guiding them to money managers and to bank colleagues for loans and other products. They also gave incentives to the brokers to work with clients who have at least $250,000.As a result, branch and regional managers are spending more time negotiating the bank bureaucracy and holding meetings on new strategies than on motivating sales and recruiting which is what drives their pay, said executive recruiters and advisers at the firm who requested anonymity.The most senior person to leave in the recent shift is Christopher Dupuy, one of 11 national market executives Thiel appointed to report directly to him after taking control of the wealth unit two-and-a-half years ago, according to an internal memo. DuPuy, who was in charge of the northwestern U.S. and was based in San Franciso, left voluntarily, said several well-placed Merrill sources. DuPuy could not be reached for comment.Thomas Fickinger, who had been in charge of recruiting, has replaced Dupuy and is moving with his family from the East Coast to San Francisco. As previously reported, Chandler Root, another of the 11 regional executives, was transferred last month from San Francisco to manage some branches in northern New Jersey and New York.He was replaced as Southwest region executive by Kim Ruth, who has no background in retail brokerage but has sold business and corporate loans and services as Bank of America's state president in Texas for the past 11 years.In the memo to brokers last week, Thiel lauded Ruth as ""an accomplished leader who during her 25-year career in financial services has demonstrated an intense client focus.""Some of the displaced sales executives were shifted to new posts within the company and some were pushed into early retirement, said several brokers and outside recruiters. One joined arch-competitor UBS Wealth Management Americas, a unit of UBS AG that is heavily populated with former Merrill Lynch executives and run by former Merrill wealth boss Robert McCann. The UBS migrant is William Cholawa, who once ran Merrill's New England region and most recently was a senior strategist in charge of ""initiative management."" A UBS spokesman said he will begin in May as a director of a branch complex in New England.Some of the management changes Merrill involve executives who designed the new strategies that the firm is adapting. Riley Etheridge, a top lieutentant to Thiel who oversees product and sales management strategies, is now also running recruiting and talent.Three of the four people who reported directly to Etheridge, including Cholawa, have changed roles or moved. Ted Durkin, who developed products for affluent clients, is now back managing brokers as head of several branches in Delaware and Pennsylvania.Dwight Mathis, who oversaw training for new advisers, has been moved to manage Merrill's branch in Pittsburgh and smaller outposts nearby. The firm earlier announced that Racquel Oden replaced him in the training post. Susan Cruz, who had been in charge of the Pittsburgh branch complex, and Carole Wentz, who oversaw 11 offices in the St. Louis metropolitan region and was once national sales manager, are taking positions that Merrill has not yet announced. Michael Lawrence,a complex director in New Mexico, is taking Wentz's post in St. Louis.Alane Siem and Mark Sederquist, who were respectively the heads of Merrill's complex of branches in Atlanta and in greater Orange County, California, are moving to Bank of America's Merrill Edge program. It services investors with less than $250,000 through online and phone advice, or through brokers in Bank of America branches.Several veteran complex directors retired or have left the firm without explanation. They include James Tighe in Minneapolis, William Pike in northern New England, Merril Pyes in Boston, Jesse Iglesias in Stamford, Conn, Jill Packard in New Haven, Conn and Frank Beyer in Delaware, according to the internal memo whose contents were confirmed by the Merrill spokesman.Some of the changes appear to be aimed at finding new managers who can keep top brokers from leaving. Since Merrill's sale to Bank of America, its broker count has declined by more than 2,000 to under 14,000.Merrill competitors, aware that retention packages given to top advisers and managers in the wake of the 2009 merger expire next year, are luring some advisers with packages that pay them for the money they leave behind.Merrill officials say much of the decline comes from low-producing brokers who were asked to leave, and note they have picked up senior advisers from competitors.They also say that Merrill's record under Bank of America speaks for itself. Though the brokerage force has shrunk, attrition last year among the top 40 percent of advisers was at historic lows and the firm generated record revenue. About 5,150 brokers brought in at least $1 million of fees and commissions compared with 3,450 who reached that level in 2009, the first year Merrill was owned by Bank of America.",2014-03-10,MS,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 6:56pm EDT",Merrill's Thiel jostles retail brokerage ranks,http://www.reuters.com//article/merrill-shakeup-idUSL2N0M70YC20140310?type=companyNews
85,"  * Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan to be global coordinators* IPO could value Com Hem at more than 20 bln SEK   (Adds detail, background, valuation detail, deals)STOCKHOLM/FRANKFURT, March 13 Private equity firm BC Partners has picked banks to lead a stock market listing of Swedish cable operator Com Hem which could value the firm at more than 20 billion crowns ($3.1 billion), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.A listing of Com Hem would come amid a flurry of M&A activity in the European cable sector and follows several succesful listings of private equity owned firms in Sweden and Denmark in the past several months.The people, who declined to be identified as the plans are not public, said Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan had been chosen as global coordinators, to lead an IPO before the summer holidays, with Rothschild acting as IPO advisor for BC Partners. More banks will be signed up as bookrunners, the people added.BC Partners and Com Hem declined to comment, as did JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Rothschild.The people said Com Hem could be worth up to around 22 billion Swedish crowns including debt. That would mean a valuation multiple of about 10 times 2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), similar to French cable firm Numericable and slightly lower than the 11 times that Liberty Global is paying for Dutch Ziggo The European cable sector trades on an enterprise value to 2013 EBITDA multiple of 9.4 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.Since late last year, the Stockholm stock exchange has chalked up three initial public offerings (IPOs) on its main list after a drought since the first half of 2011, all of which have performed significantly better than the broader market. In Denmark, outsourcing firm ISS closed up 14 percent on its first day of trading on Thursday compared to the price set in the IPO.Com Hem made EBITDA earnings of 2.2 billion crowns in 2013 on revenues of 4.4 billion and employs around 950 people.Almost 40 percent of Swedish households are connected to Com Hem's network, and it has more than 600,000 digital TV customers according to its website.BC Partners bought Com Hem in 2011 from private equity groups Carlyle and Providence for around $2.6 billion.

87,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The manager of one of the best performing large-cap growth stock funds over the past five years is a value investor at heart.Dennis Lynch, portfolio manager of the $1.3 billion Morgan Stanley Growth fund, sets out to find what he calls ""emerging franchises"".Those are businesses in the process of creating a brand or service that will resonate with customers and have a margin of safety from competition.It's an approach more akin to the Warren Buffet school of patient investing rather than simply buying the next hot stock.That's even if even if the companies in question, such as Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc are high-priced and technology-centered, the sort that are a far cry from the railroads and insurance companies Buffett typically likes.""We are trying to collect the companies we think are the most unique and the most underpriced,"" Lynch said.The strategy has worked well for Lynch's investors. His fund has returned 49 percent over the last 12 months, and an average of 29 percent a year over the last 5 years.That performance puts him 26 percentage points ahead of the benchmark S&P 500 index. It also lands him in the top 1 percent of the 1,778 large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar for 2013, and led Morningstar to name him the U.S. domestic stock fund manager of the year.Some of that out performance can be attributed to a decision to add Tesla Motors Inc to the portfolio in February 2013. It rallied more than 500 percent over the next 12 months, leading Lynch to cut approximately a quarter of his position.More often, though, Lynch focuses on companies that rely on the Internet to disrupt established industries and establish their own brands in the process. VISION Roughly a third of his portfolio, ranging from Twitter Inc to Priceline.com Inc and Groupon Inc, is invested in companies tied to the Internet. That compares with 8 percent of the Russell 1000 Growth index, according to Morningstar.When evaluating a stock, Lynch will look first at its free cash flow, and then begin building a case for where the company can be in the next five years.It's a process he learned while attending Columbia Business School, where investors like Warren Buffett and hedge fund manager John Griffin lectured in his classes.He typically only adds a handful of companies a year to his portfolio of 47 stocks, and doesn't set hard target prices to tell him when to sell.Lynch puts less emphasis on valuation metrics like price-to-earnings and more on trying to spot advantages that don't show up on a balance sheet. That's partly because he invests in large cap companies, the section of the market where it's the most difficult for an investor to gain an informational advantage.""We're looking for those cases where numbers don't tell the whole story because a company has a very significant competitive advantage,"" Lynch said. ""Even though there are a lot of numbers in this business it's less scientific than you think.""Case in point: Amazon, which Lynch first bought at between $30 and $40 a share after the dot.com crash 11 years ago.Investors at the time questioned Amazon's strategy of plowing most its profits back into the business and missed the fact it had the potential to up-end retailing, Lynch said.Amazon, which closed above $371 per share on Thursday, has a similar opportunity to expand its cloud-based services for businesses, Lynch said. DIVERSIFYING Though Lynch is not worried that Internet-related stocks are in any sort of bubble, he has been filling out his portfolio with companies that have no technology aspects as well.More recently, he's added to his positions in luxury fashion brand Christian Dior SA and infant formula maker Mead Johnston Nutrition Co, the company behind Enfamil.He likes Mead Johnson because hospital use and doctor endorsements of its formula gives it a unique position among childcare products and represents a recurring revenue stream that should grow as it expands into emerging markets.Mead Johnson's shares have slid 0.3 percent since the start of the year and trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, slightly above the market average.Given Lynch's habit of straying far from his benchmark, investors should be prepared for some periods of underperformance, noted Janet Yang, an analyst at Morningstar who follows the fund.But its track record suggests investors will be well-served over the long term, she added.Investors in the fund will pay an annual expense charge between 72 cents and 97 cents per $100 invested, a fee level in line with the average actively-managed stock fund.The fund pays a dividend yield of 0.3 percent.(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Sophie Hares)",2014-03-14,MS,"Fri Mar 14, 2014 | 2:16pm EDT",Focus on emerging franchises powers Morgan Stanley fund,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-column-fundview-idUSBREA2D18E20140314?type=companyNews

96,"  WASHINGTON/CHICAGO Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay $200,000 to settle civil charges it exceeded speculative position limits in soybean meal futures for two days while attempting to hedge a commodity index investment, U.S. regulators said on Monday.The fine, while small, highlights how tougher rules meant to apply tighter speculative trading limits in other raw material markets, such as oil and metals, risk curtailing banks' business in selling broad commodity baskets to investors, one of the most lucrative niches of the industry over the past decade.Morgan Stanley Capital Group's trading on the Chicago Board of Trade in January 2013 exceeded the all-months speculative position limit established by the regulator, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Its position ""consisted of net long positions held by its commodity index desk to hedge its financial exposure"" to the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index and to the holdings of the firm's other trading desks, according to the CFTC.A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment.Wall Street banks had benefited over the past decade from a surge of some $400 billion of investor capital into raw material markets, much of that plowed into basic passive, buy-and-hold index baskets. However, over the past few years institutional interest has waned, money has flowed out of the sector and many investors want more dynamic products. Meanwhile new trading rules also threaten to cast a pall over the business, with the CFTC making a second effort to apply position limits on a wide range of commodity markets.Position limits have long been used in agricultural markets to curb speculation, but Congress gave the CFTC far greater power to impose them after the financial crisis. The agency will now extend them to oil, natural gas and metals markets.In 2012, a judge knocked down a version of the new rule after Wall Street banks challenged it in court, fearing they would incur high costs because the banks needed to tally up the positions across hundreds of subsidiaries. In November, the agency, which oversees swaps and futures markets, issued a new version of the rule. The rule proposal has already attracted well over 100 comment letters by industry participants, and the agency is not expected to finalize the rule before its new Chairman Tim Massad takes over.Morgan Stanley had exceeded the limit on January 14, the agency said, and reduced its position on January 15, though it stayed above the limit. The position fell below the limit on January 16, the CFTC said. The extended position limits ""would expand the risk of and the vulnerability to such sorts of actions,"" said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston, about the fine against Morgan Stanley.""The CFTC has been very aggressive on position limits issues where it has the ability to do so, which is the ag commodities right now,"" Pirrong said.

98,"  (Adds analyst comment, no comment from Morgan Stanley)WASHINGTON/CHICAGO, March 24 Morgan Stanley  has agreed to pay $200,000 to settle civil charges it exceeded speculative position limits in soybean meal futures for two days while attempting to hedge a commodity index investment, U.S. regulators said on Monday.The fine, while small, highlights how tougher rules meant to apply tighter speculative trading limits in other raw material markets, such as oil and metals, risk curtailing banks' business in selling broad commodity baskets to investors, one of the most lucrative niches of the industry over the past decade.Morgan Stanley Capital Group's trading on the Chicago Board of Trade in January 2013 exceeded the all-months speculative position limit established by the regulator, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Its position ""consisted of net long positions held by its commodity index desk to hedge its financial exposure"" to the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index and to the holdings of the firm's other trading desks, according to the CFTC.A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment. Wall Street banks had benefited over the past decade from a surge of some $400 billion of investor capital into raw material markets, much of that plowed into basic passive, buy-and-hold index baskets. However, over the past few years institutional interest has waned, money has flowed out of the sector and many investors want more dynamic products.Meanwhile new trading rules also threaten to cast a pall over the business, with the CFTC making a second effort to apply position limits on a wide range of commodity markets.Position limits have long been used in agricultural markets to curb speculation, but Congress gave the CFTC far greater power to impose them after the financial crisis. The agency will now extend them to oil, natural gas and metals markets. In 2012, a judge knocked down a version of the new rule after Wall Street banks challenged it in court, fearing they would incur high costs because the banks needed to tally up the positions across hundreds of subsidiaries.In November, the agency, which oversees swaps and futures markets, issued a new version of the rule. The rule proposal has already attracted well over 100 comment letters by industry participants, and the agency is not expected to finalize the rule before its new Chairman Tim Massad takes over. Morgan Stanley had exceeded the limit on Jan. 14, the agency said, and reduced its position on Jan. 15, though it stayed above the limit. The position fell below the limit on Jan. 16, the CFTC said.The extended position limits ""would expand the risk of and the vulnerability to such sorts of actions,"" said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston, about the fine against Morgan Stanley.""The CFTC has been very aggressive on position limits issues where it has the ability to do so, which is the ag commodities right now,"" Pirrong said. The CFTC may be using enforcement actions to signal to Congress that the agency is serious about tackling speculative issues, he said.The CFTC has taken action 13 times since late 2008 on violations against speculative position limits, including the latest fine against Morgan Stanley, according to the agency.Commodity revenues fell nearly 40 percent at Morgan Stanley last year, a second straight annual drop. The dwindling revenues follow tighter restrictions on banks trading with their own money and heightened public scrutiny of their role in the natural resources supply chain.

103,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley shareholders will find out this week whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will allow the bank to start returning capital to shareholders in a meaningful way for the first time since the financial crisis.But even if the Wall Street bank gets the Fed's blessing to buy back more shares and potentially raise its dividend, it is unlikely to hit a shareholder return target Chief Executive James Gorman set out for this year, analysts and investors said.The target, called return on equity (ROE), measures how much profit a bank makes using shareholder funds. An ROE of at least 10 percent would show that Morgan Stanley can earn enough to pay for new capital and signal that the bank is past the restructuring it needed to make after the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley's annual return on equity has languished below 10 percent since 2006.If the bank cannot jump that hurdle in the near term, which could be done by boosting profits, buying back shares, or both, shareholders may get impatient and demand that management outline a bolder strategy to boost profits.""They should be generating double-digit ROEs, and if they aren't, what are they going to do about it?"" said Mike Mayo, a longtime bank analyst at CLSA. He raised a similar question at Morgan Stanley's annual meeting last year, prompting Gorman to say the bank would meet the 10 percent target some time in 2014.STRESS TEST PASSED Last week, the Fed said Morgan Stanley passed its annual stress test, a requirement of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation that examines how well big banks' balance sheets would hold up in hypothetical crises.As part of the test, banks submitted capital plans, including how much they would like to spend buying back stock and paying out dividends. On Wednesday, the Fed will say whether those plans have been approved, and how much each bank can spend.Morgan Stanley, the sixth largest U.S. bank by assets, has been paying only a nominal dividend since the financial crisis and has not had a meaningful stock buyback program since 2006. Gorman recently referred to Morgan Stanley's 5-cent quarterly dividend as ""distressed,"" even though he said the bank is in a position of financial strength. Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc pay lower quarterly dividends of a penny, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc pays 55 cents, JPMorgan Chase & Co pays 38 cents and Wells Fargo & Co pays 30 cents. All of those banks bought back more stock than Morgan Stanley last year in dollar terms.Morgan Stanley has paid little cash back to investors because it had a bigger priority: funding its purchase of the Smith Barney brokerage business from Citigroup, a deal executed over four and a half years that was finished in June and ultimately cost Morgan Stanley $11.7 billion.""We have been, for the last couple of years, quite conservative and deliberately so,"" Gorman said in a recent interview with Fox Business Network. But, he added, now that the bank has clearly recovered from the crisis, he wants capital returns to reflect that strength.Morgan Stanley declined to comment about its proposed buyback and dividend plans or the implications for ROE. Despite some concerns of ROE, the stock was among the best performers in the financial sector last year, up 64 percent in 2013, and shares have more than doubled since their post-crisis low of $12.36 in 2012. Shares are up 3.4 percent year-to-date, closing at $32.44 on Monday.Some investors and analysts say it is less important that Morgan Stanley hits Gorman's return-on-equity goal this year than that its returns are moving in the right direction.""They've had to get their balance sheet back in order, and now it's time to start sending some of that money toward shareholders,"" said Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager of the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, which owns Morgan Stanley shares. ""But they don't have 100 percent control when it comes to meeting their ROE targets. It gets back to the question of, 'What does the Fed have to say?'""WAITING FOR THE FED How much the Fed will allow Morgan Stanley to spend on buybacks will affect how fast it can hit the 10 percent target, which would be more than double the 4.3 percent ROE it delivered in 2013. Morgan Stanley's returns were weighed down by one-time litigation costs, an accounting charge and the cost of the Smith Barney purchase. This year's profits are expected to be helped by higher earnings from that business as well as a reduction of fixed-income trading assets that are costly under new regulations.Although analysts expect Morgan Stanley's profits to jump 62 percent this year, many still describe Gorman's 2014 goal as aggressive.It would require Morgan Stanley to exceed analysts' earnings expectations by a substantial amount, or buy back more stock than analysts expect the Fed to allow.Morgan Stanley started buying back stock last year for the first time since 2006. It announced a $500 million repurchase program in July, and used $350 million worth of that authorization before year-end.Even with those repurchases, Morgan Stanley's outstanding share count increased by 2 percent last year because of shares issued as part of compensation. By comparison, its chief rival Goldman Sachs has spent $21 billion repurchasing shares since 2010, reducing outstanding stock by 15 percent, and has increased its dividend twice.Analysts are estimating that Morgan Stanley will buy back about $700 million worth of stock this year on a net basis, on average, according to ISI Group. The bank would need to buy back nearly 20 times that amount to hit a 10 percent ROE target, based on the average analyst earnings estimate.Instead, analysts are forecasting a return-on-equity of 7.5 percent this year, on average, according to Thomson Reuters data. Next year, analysts estimate Morgan Stanley will reach an ROE of 8.6 percent, on average. Analysts do not expect the bank to hit 10 percent on a quarterly or annual basis in either year.(Editing by Dan Wilchins, Linda Stern and Peter Henderson)",2014-03-25,MS,"Tue Mar 25, 2014 | 1:25am EDT",Morgan Stanley investors await Fed's buyback blessing,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-morganstanley-fed-stresstest-analysis-idUSBREA2O08S20140325?type=companyNews
104,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Morgan Stanley's ratings  including its Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A/F1', support rating at '1',  support rating floor (SRF) at 'A' and viability rating (VR) at 'a-'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this  press release. The rating actions on Morgan Stanley have been taken in conjunction with a  periodic review of the Global Trading and Universal Banks, which comprise 12  large and globally active banking groups. Fitch's outlook for the sector is  stable on balance. Earnings pressure in securities businesses and continued  conduct and regulatory risks present in the GTUBs are offset by stronger balance  sheets as capitalisation and liquidity remain sound. Fitch forecasts stronger  GDP growth in most economies, which should contribute to a more balanced  operating environment, but the operating environment is likely to remain  challenging in 2014. Today's rating actions assume that Morgan Stanley will perform adequately under  the CCAR stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any potential  qualitative rejections for Morgan Stanley, or any of the other 29 banks subject  to regulatory stress testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a capital plan  request under CCAR would be viewed negatively, it is not expected to have any  rating implications for Morgan Stanley.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, SENIOR DEBT, SR and SRF  Morgan Stanley's Long- and Short-term IDRs, Support Rating (SR), Support Rating  Floor (SRF) and senior debt ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that there  remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government  ('AAA'/Outlook Stable) if required, and the Long-term IDR is at its SRF. This  expectation reflects the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks  especially given its strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming  less certain.  Specific to Morgan Stanley, our view of support likelihood is based mostly on  its systemic importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness given its  size and operations in global capital markets, growing deposit base and its  position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy.  In Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for G-SIFIs in the  U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress regulators have  made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA). The FDIC has  proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further initiatives are  demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state support for U.S.  banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior debt losses if its  banks run afoul of solvency assessments. Despite the likely removal of support  in the U.S., the Stable Outlook on Morgan Stanley's Long-term IDR reflects  Fitch's view, that Morgan Stanley's fundamental credit profile is improving and  that its viability rating is likely to improve over the next one to two years.  Therefore the upward momentum in the VR offsets the likely removal of sovereign  support in the U.S. which would result in Morgan Stanley's IDR and VR being  equalized.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SR AND SRF The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon.  Given the direction of the U.S. government's willingness to support banks in the  future, Fitch expects that Morgan Stanley's SR will be downgraded to '5' and the  SRF will be downgraded to 'No Floor' within one to two years, likely to be some  point in the late 2014 or in 1H15.  It is unlikely that a revision of Morgan Stanley's SRF to 'No Floor' will lead  to a downgrade of its Long-term IDR despite the fact that Morgan Stanley's IDR  is at its SRF because Fitch expects that there will be upward momentum in Morgan  Stanley's Viability Rating over the rating over the next one to two years.  Therefore, absent a material adverse change in market conditions or individual  company profile, Morgan Stanley's IDRs are unlikely to change when the support  rating floor is revised to 'No Floor'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VR Morgan Stanley's VR of 'a-' continues to be supported by the company's solid  liquidity position, improved risk management, and higher-than-average capital  position. The VR also reflects Morgan Stanley's continued execution of its  wealth management strategy based on its 100% ownership of Morgan Stanley Smith  Barney including measured deployment of bank deposits into appropriate  investments in lending products, improving margins and navigation of evolving  regulatory challenges. The upward momentum in the VR reflects Fitch's  expectation that Morgan Stanley will continue to effectively execute on its  Wealth Management strategy, further reduce risk weighted assets, and improve  ROEs to a level at or above its cost of capital. The VR remains constrained by  wholesale funding risks, challenging industry prospects given the impact of new  regulations and continued global economic uncertainty.  Overall, Morgan Stanley's performance (excluding legal expenses and other  one-time items) has improved as it continues to benefit from improved margins in  the wealth management platform and investment banking revenues, which partially  offset weaker fixed income and commodities net revenues. Pre-tax operating  margin for Wealth Management improved to 19% as of Dec. 31, 2013 (excluding a  one-time impairment charge), which is above the company's 2013 margin target of  18%. Fitch believes that if the company can successfully execute on its strategy  to deploy deposits into loans and securities with higher returns without  assuming outsized risks, then it will be able to achieve a targeted pre-tax  margin of 22% - 25% by 4Q'15 .  Morgan Stanley's earnings are becoming more balanced as the company continues to  expand its wealth management platform. This reduces the company's comparatively  higher reliance on capital market operations in relationship to many other  GTUBs, reflecting its focus on the institutional securities business. The  greater stability derived from its wealth management platform and the measured  growth of the bank contributes to the positive momentum in Morgan Stanley's VR.  That said, Morgan Stanley's future earnings will continue to be less diverse  than other larger universal banks.  Morgan Stanley's capital position is relatively strong and continues to improve.  Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is estimated to be approximately 10.5% at  4Q'13 (in line with the average of the U.S. GTUBs). Morgan Stanley reported that  as of Dec. 31, 2013, the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for the bank  exceeded the 6% threshold, while the holding company SLR was 4.2%, below the 5%  threshold. Fitch continues to believe that Morgan Stanley will be able to meet  the SLR thresholds prior to the required timeframe.  Liquidity continues to be maintained at conservative levels, which is viewed as  appropriate given Morgan Stanley's wholesale funding profile. Unencumbered  highly liquid securities and cash was a solid $202 billion or 24% of total  assets as of Dec. 31, 2013. Morgan Stanley estimated that is Basel III liquidity  coverage ratio remains well in excess of 100%.   Fitch believes that Morgan Stanley is more vulnerable to funding and rollover  risks than a number of GTUB peers as it is primarily wholesale funded. To reduce  wholesale funding risk, Morgan Stanley has reduced its reliance on unsecured  short-term to minimal levels with no reliance on commercial paper or 2a-7 funds  as of Dec. 31, 2013. Morgan Stanley has a strong governance policy on secured  funding, including maturity targets and limits set for each tier of collateral.  Although deposits are increasing at the subsidiary bank, they remain a  relatively moderate portion of the overall funding mix.  In February 2014, Morgan Stanley settled it pre-crisis residential  mortgage-backed securities lawsuit for $1.25 billion with the Federal Home  Housing Finance Agency. The settlement had no ratings impact on Morgan Stanley's  ratings. Morgan Stanley's pre-tax operating income was modestly affected by this  settlement.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR and SENIOR DEBT  Morgan Stanley's viability rating has a higher probability of being upgraded to  'a' from 'a-' upon further execution of its Wealth Management strategy,  including measured deployment of bank deposits into appropriate investments in  lending products, and improved returns on equity in excess of cost of capital.  Successful navigation of evolving regulatory challenges including the Volcker  Rule and Basel may also contribute to upward rating momentum as will maintenance  of strong capital and liquidity levels. Downward pressure on the VR could be driven by Morgan Stanley's inability to  execute on its Wealth Management strategy, resulting in sustained operating  weakness or returns on equity substantially below its cost of capital.  Additional potential negative drivers could include an inability to successfully  navigate evolving regulatory requirements such as the Volcker Rule or Basel,  material losses, a significant increase in leverage and risk weighted assets,  reduced capital ratios, deterioration in liquidity levels or outsized fines,  settlements or other charges.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT & OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES  Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Morgan Stanley and by  various issuing vehicles are all notched down from Morgan Stanley's VR in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Subordinated debt and  other hybrid capital ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of  Morgan Stanley.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Morgan Stanley's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the  company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit  from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. However, Morgan Stanley's  uninsured deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift because  they do not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the  deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States.  Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually  payable, they do not get the rating uplift.  The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by Morgan Stanley and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in Morgan Stanley's IDR.  RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY  Morgan Stanley's IDRs are equalized with those of its operating companies and  banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the  U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries, as well as the  use of the holding company to fund subsidiary operations.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY & AFFILIATED COMPANIES  The IDRs of Morgan Stanley's major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with Morgan Stanley's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core  to Morgan Stanley's business strategy and financial profile.  Morgan Stanley is a leading global bank with three business segments:  institutional securities, global wealth management, and asset management. In  September 2008, Morgan Stanley converted to a bank holding company (BHC)  regulated by the Federal Reserve. Morgan Stanley is currently the sixth largest  bank by assets in the U.S. and designated as a G-SIFI by the Financial Stability  Board.

105,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday fined Morgan Stanley $490,000 for violating rules that require futures brokers to protect clients by keeping their money segregated from other funds on the bank's books.Morgan Stanley's futures trading unit transferred some $16 million from a segregated client account in 2013, and it also mixed segregated funds and its own money during a six-month period in 2012.The unit, a so-called Futures Commission Merchant, a U.S. regulatory category that is subject to the CFTC's strict customer protection rules, simultaneously settled the violations with the CFTC. Client segregation issues were at the heart of two major collapses of futures brokers overseen by the CFTC, MF Global and Peregrine Financial, and the agency has since tightened its rules for the long-regulated industry.Peregrine founder Wasendorf begun serving a 50-year jail sentence last year for bilking $215 million from customers, and the CFTC has also charged former MF Global chief Jon Corzine - a former New Jersey governor and U.S. senator - for being a key factor in one of the country's 10 biggest bankruptcies. In the case of MF Global, some $1.6 billion went missing from client accounts, money the firm used to stop gaps in its business as investors quickly lost confidence. Morgan Stanley said no client money was lost as a result of the issues and that it cooperated fully with the CFTC.

In describing its rationale for Gorman's pay, the board cited those factors, as well as cost-cutting, a narrowing of Morgan Stanley's credit-default swap spreads -- indicating the bond market views the bank as less risky -- and the start of a stock repurchasing program for the first time since the financial crisis.This week, Morgan Stanley said it would build on that program after the Federal Reserve approved its plan to buy back $1 billion worth of more stock and raise its dividend.The bank still has work to do.

110,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Vladimir Eydelman, the former Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer Holdings broker arrested on insider trading charges last week, could expose some former clients and the firms to regulatory and legal actions, lawyers and securities industry veterans said.Eydelman, who was charged with fraud on March 19 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, allegedly made more than $5.6 million in illicit profit over three-and-a-half years for himself, friends and more than 50 clients, by trading stocks and options of companies involved in undisclosed merger deals and tender offers that were leaked by a law-firm employee.The cloak-and-dagger details of the insider operation - including how a middleman swallowed Post-It notes scribbled with ticker symbols to be traded - made headlines.Still, it's the more mundane details such as due diligence in hiring that could choke Oppenheimer (OPY.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) if regulators extend their investigations, lawyers said.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has said that examining procedures at brokerage firms for weeding out the bad apples is one of its priorities this year.Eydelman, 42, had a history of job-hopping, a record of customer complaints and an apparent burst of productivity in recent years, according to the lawsuits and FINRA filings.Though he settled down more recently to work at just two firms over the last 13 years - he was at Oppenheimer for almost ten years before moving to Morgan Stanley in September 2012 - the lawsuits abound with examples of areas where Eydelman apparently evaded compliance overseers.In one example, Eydelman - who had discretion to trade in many of his clients' accounts - told an informer that in order to obtain such discretion he had forged the name of one Oppenheimer customer, who later complained to the firm about account losses, according to the SEC complaint.""Eydelman left Oppenheimer shortly after the customer filed the complaints,"" the SEC said.FIRED Morgan Stanley fired Eydelman two days after he was arrested. Spokesman Jim Wiggins declined to discuss any other aspect of the case, including the firm's process in hiring and supervising him, or whether it would reimburse clients if they have to give up their gains.Two of the 12 insider-trading incidents cited in the suits occurred while Eydelman was at Morgan Stanley.The 42-year-old New Jersey resident had about 445 client accounts at Oppenheimer, and 262 at Morgan Stanley, according to the SEC.Oppenheimer is reviewing Eydelman's activities, including how he was supervised, for any signs of wrongdoing. ""Our review has not disclosed any information that would have brought these issues to the firm's attention,"" spokesman Stefan Prelog wrote in an email.The SEC suit noted some details that may have merited scrutiny. The Chicago Board Options Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, for example, separately questioned Oppenheimer about some 2010 trades Eydelman began making in Brinks Home Security shortly before Tyco International said it would buy Brinks. The trades netted more than $770,000 for Eydelman's accounts.Such details could put Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley at risk.""Civil charges against firms for failing to supervise their employees in a rash of recent insider trading cases are a possibility,"" David Rosenfeld, associate regional director of the SEC's New York regional office, told a group of lawyers two days after the complaints were filed.He declined to discuss the Eydelman case specifically.COMPLAINTS Several lawyers who read the complaints said they would have expected Morgan Stanley to have placed Eydelman on heightened supervision after former Oppenheimer clients filed a $2 million arbitration claim against him last August. It accuses him of trading excessively on margin in their accounts in ""highly speculative, volatile and unsuitable securities."" The arbitration remains open.Several lawyers who specialize in suing brokers said regulators could force Eydelman's customers to return illicit gains, even if they were unaware of the alleged scheme. ""It would be tough for them to argue that they can keep money from the fruits of nonpublic information,"" said Cary Lapidus, a former SEC enforcement attorney who now has a private practice in San Francisco.Eydelman is fighting the charges and is free on $1 million bail. His lawyer did not return numerous calls for comment.SKETCHY RECORD In the five years prior to joining Oppenheimer in 2001, Eydelman had worked at four small firms, according to his public disclosure form available on the FINRA website.He paid a $10,000 fine and returned $24,000 to clients while working at Morgan Wilshire Securities in Long Island, New York between 1998 and 2000.He also settled a 1996 complaint of churning - or trading excessively in client accounts to generate commissions - while working at the now-defunct Walsh Manning Securities with a $13,500 payment, according to his FINRA records.""Those aren't small claims,"" said Doug Black, who trained and recruited brokers in a 30-year career at UBS Wealth Management Americas and predecessor firms. Black now runs SpringReef Partners, which helps rich investors and nonprofit organizations choose financial advisers. The Justice Department's criminal lawsuit also highlights some conspicuous lifestyle factors - such as Eydelman's 2011 purchase of a $117,000 Maserati - that some lawyers say should have caught his employers' attention.The SEC lawsuit notes that his personal trading gains were supplemented by ""bonuses from his employers based on his performance ... driven in large part by the profits garnered through the insider trading scheme.""A former Morgan Stanley legal official said it was unrealistic to expect hiring managers to investigate specific trades by a prospect whose commissions are burgeoning.""Morgan Stanley would only see a guy building a book of business,"" he said.The Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to respond to comments of Black and the former employee.HANDS-OFF STYLE Black said the Eydelman case reflects a revenue-centered culture endemic at large brokerage firms, where managers who are compensated for recruiting brokers ask few questions when ""production"" is on the upswing.""You have this huge platform and branch system and you need scale to support it,"" Black said. ""Every empty seat is lost revenue.""David Tufts, the former manager of the Oppenheimer branch where Eydelman worked, told ""Research"" magazine in 2009 that the secret of his 30-year managerial success was his hands-off style.""Leave them alone and let them create the business they want to create,"" he said. ""If you lose someone doing a million bucks, it's going to take three brokers to replace them that first year.""Tufts, who no longer manages the branch, declined to discuss Eydelman.Other veterans said that attitude is changing fast, and will likely be accelerated by the charges against Eydelman.""The large banks are working to improve their due diligence in hiring,"" said Mark Shelton, who resigned as general counsel of UBS AG Americas and head of investigations at its parent bank this year to become a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

112,"   By Robert Smith  LONDON, April 2 (IFR) - Leveraged finance veteran Ian Gilday is departing Goldman Sachs to take up a role at rival bank Morgan Stanley, according to multiple market sources.Gilday was Goldman Sachs' former head of EMEA syndicate and leveraged capital markets, but assumed a new role at the bank last year as head of origination for collateralised loan obligations in the region. The sources did not know what role Gilday will assume at Morgan Stanley, but several said that it could be filling the hole left by Mark Walsh's departure.Mark Walsh left his role as co-head of European leveraged finance and acquisition finance at Morgan Stanley in August 2013 to take up a new position at Credit Suisse. Following his departure Matt Naber, who was co-head of leveraged finance and acquisition finance along with Walsh, became sole head of Morgan Stanley's European leveraged finance and acquisition finance team. Gilday joined Goldman in 2005. Prior to that he headed up the European leveraged capital markets team at Merrill Lynch.Gilday, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were not immediately available for comment.

113,"   By David Henry and Anna Louie Sussman | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Blythe Masters, one of Wall Street's most powerful women, is leaving JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM.N) after a 27-year career that began as an intern in London and concludes with the sale of the multibillion-dollar commodities business she built.Masters, who turned 45 in late March, will leave the bank in a few months after assisting with the sale of its physical energy and metals business to Swiss merchant Mercuria. Many observers had not expected her to remain with the business after its sale, although her future with JPMorgan was less clear.She will take ""time off"" and ""consider future opportunities,"" according to a memo bank executives sent to employees on Wednesday.Once a rising star within JPMorgan and credited with having helped create credit derivatives in the early 1990s, Masters' career took a much rockier turn in recent years as she got caught up in a regulatory inquiry and struggled to extract profits from the commodities operation.She began her career at JPMorgan as an intern in London before entering Cambridge University, where she studied economics. She joined the commodities desk in 1991 after graduating, and later moved to the bank's derivatives desk, where she was considered a derivatives wunderkind.She is known for having been part of the team that pioneered structured finance instruments which others on Wall Street took to excesses that fueled the U.S. housing bubble and set up the financial crisis of 2008. After serving for several years as chief financial officer of the investment bank, Masters took the reins of the commodities desk in 2006 as interim head.While the bank had been a sizeable player in commodities in the 1990s, with a global oil trading division led at the time by Masters' ex-husband, Danny Masters, it hadn't delved as deeply into the sector as investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and had scaled back after facing regulatory scrutiny in metals markets toward the turn of the century.That changed with the acquisition of Bear Stearns in March 2008, which gave the bank a large physical power and gas business for the first time. With Masters at the helm, JPMorgan would go on to buy parts of UBS's UBSN.VX commodity business after the Swiss bank decided to get out of the sector at the height of the financial crisis. That was followed by the jewel in the JPMorgan commodities crown, the purchase of physically-focused RBS Sempra in 2010.By August 2010, Masters was telling employees that Goldman and Morgan Stanley should be ""scared"" of JPMorgan's newly-expanded commodity operation, Bloomberg reported at the time.SECTOR TURNS  But more recently regulatory problems began to pile up. In 2013, the bank paid $410 million to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to settle allegations of power market manipulation in California.While Masters was not cited for any wrongdoing, her name is referenced in the regulator's order a number of times. The bank neither admitted nor denied any violations in the case.Meanwhile regulators were turning a sharper eye on all of Wall Street's involvement in the raw materials supply chain, with the Federal Reserve questioning whether commercial banks like JPMorgan should be allowed to trade physical commodities.Commodities trading, once considered a blockbuster billion-dollar business, was shrinking. Total commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen by about two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10 banks notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to a report by Coalition, a UK financial analytics firm.That is down from more than $14 billion at its peak in 2008, when the bumper returns earned by sector stalwarts Goldman and Morgan Stanley encouraged many other banks to expand into energy and metals trading.(Additional reporting by David Sheppard in London; Editing by James Dalgleish)",2014-04-02,MS,"Wed Apr 2, 2014 | 2:05pm EDT",JPMorgan global commodities unit head Masters to leave: memo,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-chase-masters-idUSBREA311QH20140402?type=companyNews
114,"   By Megan Davies | MOSCOW  MOSCOW JP Morgan Chase & Co is processing a payment from Russia's embassy in Kazakhstan to insurance agency Sogaz, easing tension after Moscow accused the U.S. bank of illegally blocking the transaction under the pretext of sanctions.Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the ""unacceptable, illegal and absurd"" act of blocking the payment would have consequences for the U.S. Embassy in Russia.The confrontation threatened to further strain ties between Washington and Moscow, locked in the worst standoff since the Cold War over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.""Following consultation with our regulators, we are processing this transaction,"" JPMorgan said in a statement.Last month, Washington imposed sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against several Russians close to President Vladimir Putin and against Rossiya Bank, which it said was the ""personal bank"" for the leader's inner circle.The destination for the embassy payment was insurance agency Sogaz, which is 48.5 percent owned by Abros, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Rossiya.Industry consultants in Moscow say financial institutions are unclear about how to apply the new rules in some situations, such as when dealing with subsidiaries of companies which have either been sanctioned or which have shareholders that have been punished. Several Western investors and their banks are facing quandaries over individual situations.Guidelines on the U.S. Treasury department's website from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control says that property which is more than 50 percent owned by a person on the sanctions blacklist is affected and advises acting ""with caution"" when ownership interests are less than 50 percent.""It is up to private companies and lawyers to figure out who is subject to sanctions,"" said one Moscow-based lawyer. ""Of course (a U.S. bank) is more scared of the American (authorities than the Russian ones)."" COSTLY Falling foul of U.S. authorities can be extremely costly.BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, in February set aside $1.1 billion for a possible fine for breaching U.S. sanctions on countries including Iran.Sogaz said in a statement last month that Abros had decreased its shareholding to 48.5 percent, but did not specify the shareholding level prior to the decrease. ""Sogaz doesn't have any shareholders holding more than 50 percent of the company shares directly or indirectly, so we see no reason for Sogaz to be included in the U.S. sanctions,"" a Sogaz representative said in emailed comment late on Wednesday.The confusion around sanctions caused Visa and Mastercard to briefly cut off services for clients at Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were affected by U.S. sanctions, before resuming them shortly after.Russia's accusation could damage relations the bank has with the Russian authorities. JPMorgan generated $55.6 million in investment banking fees in Russia last year, with a 7 percent market share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Worldwide, JPMorgan recorded $6.4 billion in investment banking fees last year, according to the company's annual report.JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and for its size it does relatively little lending in Russia. At year-end, its loans and trading positions at risk to Russia totaled $5.4 billion compared with the company's total assets of $2.4 trillion.JPMorgan is one of a number of Western banks operating in Russia. Others which have a presence here include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.(Additional reporting by Alexei Anishchuk; Editing by Maria Kiselyova, Elizabeth Piper and Angus MacSwan)",2014-04-03,MS,"Thu Apr 3, 2014 | 7:35am EDT","JP Morgan to process payment for Russian embassy, easing tension",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-russia-jpmorgan-chase-sanctions-idUSBREA320DN20140403?type=companyNews

HVB could also keep DAB, the people told the paper.DAB, Germany's oldest online broker with a market capitalisation of nearly 350 million euros ($479 million), is 81 percent owned by HVB, with the rest in free float.HVB said it would not comment on market rumours linked to DAB, whose share closed up 2.9 percent on Friday. ""In principle, we are continuously analysing our bank's share holdings, including strategic options such as sales and acquisitions,"" an HVB spokeswoman said.Morgan Stanley declined comment. DAB was not immediately available for comment. The online broker, which has around 621,000 customers, saw net profit fall by a third last year to around 12.3 million euros, hurt by the effects of low interest rates on net interest income, trading and investment.Other financial players are already well on their way to restructuring their positions in Germany's low margin and crowded banking sector.

118,"  LONDON, April 7 (IFR) - JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are to join Morgan Stanley  on the syndicate for Emaar Properties' upcoming IPO of its retail and malls business, bankers said.Last month, Dubai's biggest property firm hired Morgan Stanley to manage an 8-9 billion dirham (US$2.18-2.45 billion) listing of its shopping mall and retail unit, a deal that promises to be the largest ECM transaction in the region since 2008.Emaar has now appointed JP Morgan to the topline along with Morgan Stanley, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch will be one step below as joint bookrunner. The listing, which was first contemplated before Dubai's real estate and stock market collapsed in 2009, underscores the extent of the emirate's recovery over the past few years. Residential property prices increased by more than 20 percent last year and Dubai's main equity index - the best performing bourse in the world in 2013 - is up 18.8 percent so far this year. Emaar is 31 percent-owned by the Dubai government, which is set to earn a dividend of about US$750 million from the listing.

Kentfield was one of the few senior brokerage executives at Morgan Stanley who previously worked at Smith Barney, which Morgan Stanley began absorbing in 2009. It completed the purchase of Smith Barney last year.The four regional managers who are losing their positions - Jeff Adams, John Campbell, Kevin Forman and Matthew Maloney - ""will explore new leadership roles"" within the wealth management division.""We wish all of them much success,"" O'Connor wrote in the memo. The changes are effective at the end of May.O'Connor and the executives who are losing their positions were not available to comment, a spokeswoman said.Morgan Stanley has made a bigger bet on selling financial services and products to wealthy individuals than any major competitor. Since buying Smith Barney from Citigroup Inc, retail brokerage has dominated its bottom line in some quarters. The division contributed 47 percent of the investment bank's total revenue in last year's fourth quarter. As part of the integration, dozens of overlapping branches were eliminated along with branch management positions. In her memo, O'Connor said her spending priorities will be on support for brokers who are banding into teams and on naming more assistant ""complex"" managers to coordinate sales and supervision of branches located near each other.Greg Fleming, head of wealth management, named O'Connor to run sales for the division as part of a broad reorganization he announced in late February. Previously, O'Connor had run the firm's private banking group, which is charged with selling more loans and credit products to the brokerage unit's wealthy clients.O'Connor also has expanded the responsibilities of some other executives and named a few to new positions.Mandell Crawley, who heads business development to help advisers retain clients and recruit new ones, takes on additional duties running Morgan Stanley's training program and its rewards programs for successful advisers, according to the memo. Barry Goldstein will become chief operating officer of the wealth division, responsible for all business management activities and for developing recruiting and compensation programs for the firm's 16,456 brokers.Lisa Golia continues as chief administrative officer with responsibility for branch services and client communications, but also will work more actively with technology on development of brokers' workstations and platforms.Fleming last year said he was adding $500 million to Morgan Stanley's technology budget to answer brokers' concerns about poor integration of the Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley systems and better serve clients.""We will continue to invest in technology to drive service efficiencies in the branch,"" O'Connor wrote in the memo.Morgan Stanley is the second major U.S. brokerage firm in a month to shake up its sales structure.

Greece's biggest lender, which must plug a 2.18 billion euro ($3.03 billion) capital shortfall under the terms of the country's international bailout, has picked Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley as global coordinators for the equity offering, the bankers said.""A management board meeting has been called for tomorrow to discuss the plan, which will likely raise up to 2.5 billion euros,"" one of the bankers said. The offering is unlikely to include pre-emption rights for existing shareholders, the banker added.A senior National Bank executive had told Reuters at the weekend that the bank was considering an equity sale, sending its shares down 14 percent by 1008 GMT on Monday, the biggest faller on the FTSEurofirst 300 index. National Bank delined to comment, but it had previously said it would not resort to an equity issue to plug the capital gap and would instead focus on cost cuts and the sale of non-core assets.On Friday central bank chief George Provopoulos encouraged National Bank to follow the example of peers Piraeus Bank , Alpha Bank and Eurobank by seeking to tap capital markets.Provopoulos's statement came after Greece's bailed-out government returned to bond markets last week after a four-year exile, raising 3 billion euros in a sign of growing investor confidence in the country.Greece, which has been bailed out twice by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 2010, is likely to obtain further debt relief after its statistics agency ELSTAT confirmed on Monday that the government has met its 2013 budget targets.

125,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra  A year ago, soon after Morgan Stanley posted disappointing quarterly earnings, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told board members the bank was on the right track and investors who sold shares had made a mistake.On Thursday, Gorman proved himself right, by showing that his plan to lighten up trading risk and focus on wealth management is paying off. Morgan Stanley posted a 55 percent gain in first-quarter profit. The bank's revenue from fixed-income trading rose 9 percent from the same quarter a year ago, even as it reduced risky assets by tens of billions of dollars. Morgan Stanley also showed steady progress in using deposits from the wealth business to lend more.Gorman is working to give Morgan Stanley steadier earnings growth through increasing its reliance on businesses such as wealth management and underwriting, whose revenues are less likely to plunge. The shift, started under prior chief executive John Mack, came after the bank nearly failed during the financial crisis.Morgan Stanley's fortunes in the quarter sharply diverged from those of Goldman Sachs Group Inc which has made fewer strategic shifts since the financial crisis.Goldman posted an 11 percent decline in profit, and for the 13th time in the past 17 quarters, revenue from its fixed-income, currency and commodities trading business declined. Even with that decline, Goldman's businesses of trading for clients and investing on the bank's own behalf still accounted for 64 percent of the bank's revenue during the quarter.Goldman executives argue that those figures are misleading because its trading and investing businesses are tightly connected to investment banking and asset-management, where the bank outperformed. And because Goldman was strong enough to retain trading businesses that rivals have exited since the crisis, it can reap profits that they will miss as market activity improves.Still, many investors and analysts focused on challenges Goldman will face from higher capital requirements and restrictions on some trading activities that were its most profitable in the past.""Goldman's business looks very similar to what it did pre-financial crisis,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. ""For them, it's a matter of those businesses showing signs of life or recovering."" Ryan has an ""outperform"" rating on Morgan Stanley shares and a ""market perform"" on Goldman Sachs. He thinks Morgan Stanley shares can rise another 17 percent to $36.His view is not uncommon among analysts: 13 recommend Morgan Stanley as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" compared with six for Goldman Sachs; only one analyst recommends clients sell Morgan Stanley shares while three hold that view for Goldman, Starmine data show.Morgan Stanley shares closed up 2.9 percent on Thursday at $30.76, while Goldman rose 0.1 percent to $157.44.One reason analysts may like Morgan Stanley: its shares trade at less than the accounting value of the bank's assets minus liabilities, or book value. That is a cheaper valuation than Goldman's shares, which trade at a premium to book value.PERMANENT OR CYCLICAL PROBLEMS?

126,"  (Rewrites throughout on banks' diverging strategies; adds analyst and investor comments)By Lauren Tara LaCapraApril 17 A year ago, soon after Morgan Stanley  posted disappointing quarterly earnings, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told board members the bank was on the right track and investors who sold shares had made a mistake.On Thursday, Gorman proved himself right, by showing that his plan to lighten up trading risk and focus on wealth management is paying off. Morgan Stanley posted a 55 percent gain in first-quarter profit. The bank's revenue from fixed-income trading rose 9 percent from the same quarter a year ago, even as it reduced risky assets by tens of billions of dollars. Morgan Stanley also showed steady progress in using deposits from the wealth business to lend more.Gorman is working to give Morgan Stanley steadier earnings growth through increasing its reliance on businesses such as wealth management and underwriting, whose revenues are less likely to plunge. The shift, started under prior chief executive John Mack, came after the bank nearly failed during the financial crisis.Morgan Stanley's fortunes in the quarter sharply diverged from those of Goldman Sachs Group Inc which has made fewer strategic shifts since the financial crisis.Goldman posted an 11 percent decline in profit, and for the 13th time in the past 17 quarters, revenue from its fixed-income, currency and commodities trading business declined. Even with that decline, Goldman's businesses of trading for clients and investing on the bank's own behalf still accounted for 64 percent of the bank's revenue during the quarter.Goldman executives argue that those figures are misleading because its trading and investing businesses are tightly connected to investment banking and asset-management, where the bank outperformed. And because Goldman was strong enough to retain trading businesses that rivals have exited since the crisis, it can reap profits that they will miss as market activity improves.Still, many investors and analysts focused on challenges Goldman will face from higher capital requirements and restrictions on some trading activities that were its most profitable in the past.""Goldman's business looks very similar to what it did pre-financial crisis,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. ""For them, it's a matter of those businesses showing signs of life or recovering."" Ryan has an ""outperform"" rating on Morgan Stanley shares and a ""market perform"" on Goldman Sachs. He thinks Morgan Stanley shares can rise another 17 percent to $36.His view is not uncommon among analysts: 13 recommend Morgan Stanley as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" compared with six for Goldman Sachs; only one analyst recommends clients sell Morgan Stanley shares while three hold that view for Goldman, Starmine data show.Morgan Stanley shares closed up 2.9 percent on Thursday at $30.76, while Goldman rose 0.1 percent to $157.44.One reason analysts may like Morgan Stanley: its shares trade at less than the accounting value of the bank's assets minus liabilities, or book value. That is a cheaper valuation than Goldman's shares, which trade at a premium to book value. PERMANENT OR CYCLICAL PROBLEMS? Morgan Stanley's decision to retool itself while Goldman Sachs refrains from big changes reflect a debate happening across Wall Street, over whether industry profits are permanently depressed because of new regulations, or whether earnings will return once trading volumes and deal activity rebound.Before the financial crisis, Wall Street banks could generate a return on equity - a measure of how much profit a bank can wring from shareholders' money - of 30 percent or more.

127,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 17 (Fitch) Morgan Stanley reported strong first-quarter 2014  (1Q'14) operating results which benefited from improved fixed income and  commodities net revenues combined with lower non-compensation expenses. Morgan  Stanley continues to conservatively manage liquidity and funding and reported a  comparatively strong Basel III capital ratio. Morgan Stanley's core profitability improved significantly from the prior  quarter.  Fitch calculated that pre-tax operating profits (excluding  debt-valuation adjustment impact and other one-time charges) improved to  $2.2 billion at 1Q'14 from $1.4 billion at 4Q'13.  As a result, the pre-tax  operating return on assets (excluding DVA impact and other charges) improved to  1.1% from 0.7%. Non-compensation expenses decreased 43% to $2.3 billion as 4Q'13  results included $1.2 billion in one-time legal expenses.   Wealth management's pre-tax operating margin was 19% at 1Q'14 as compared with  20% (excluding a one-time impairment charge) at 4Q'13.  The lower margin was  driven by a $132 million decrease in net revenues.  Fitch continues to believe  that Morgan Stanley's targeted pre-tax operating margin of 22%-25% in 4Q'15 is  achievable if the company successfully executes on its strategy to deploy these  deposits into securities and loans with higher returns.  Institutional securities net revenues (excluding DVA impact) increased  significantly sequentially. Fixed income and commodities net revenues (excluding  DVA impact) increased to $1.7 billion at 1Q'14 from $694 million at 4Q'14 due to  strong performance in commodities, credit, and mortgage products.  Equity sales  and trading net revenues of $1.7 billion (excluding DVA impact) were up 13%  quarter over quarter due to strong client activity across all regions.   Investment banking experienced overall lower volumes resulting in net revenues  decreasing 17% to $1.1 billion at 1Q'14 from $1.4 billion at 4Q'13.  However, on  a year-over-year basis, investment banking benefitted from higher M&A activity,  and higher equity and debt underwritings.  The investment banking backlog  continues to be strong, and Morgan Stanley should continue to benefit from a  higher level of activity.  Liquidity continues to be managed conservatively. Morgan Stanley's global  liquidity reserve, which comprised unencumbered liquid securities and cash, was  a solid $203 billion, or 24% of total assets at 1Q'14. Value at risk (VaR) was  virtually unchanged from 4Q'13 at $50 million.  Morgan Stanley estimated that it's Tier I common ratio under the Basel III  advanced approach was approximately 11.6% at 1Q'14, comfortably above the 8.5%  minimum and 110bps higher than at 4Q'13. The company estimated that its  supplementary leverage ratio under the recent U.S. regulatory proposal for the  bank exceeded 6%. The holding company supplementary leverage ratio under the new  proposal was 4.2%, compared with 4.5% under the prior methodology.  Although  below the 5% threshold, Fitch continues to believe that Morgan Stanley will be  able to meet the supplementary leverage minimums ahead of the required  timeframe.  During 1Q'14, Morgan Stanley repurchased approximately $150 million shares  following its announcement in 2Q'13 of a $500 million share buyback.  As  recently disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to Morgan Stanley's  capital plan as part of the annual CCAR process. As a result, Morgan Stanley  announced an authorization to repurchase $1 billion of common equity through  1Q'15 and a $0.05 per share increase in quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share.

128,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley's big bet on wealth management is looking strong as fees, commissions and interest collected by its more than 16,000 brokers fueled a 13 percent rise in the business's first-quarter net income from a year earlier to $423 million, the company said Thursday.Chief Executive James Gorman, who devised the plan to buy Citigroup's Smith Barney and become the world's biggest stockbroker as measured by sales force, said issues related to integrating the firms over the past five years are now resolved. The stability and profitability of Morgan Stanley's wealth and asset management businesses, he added, made it possible to double the firm's dividend payment and install a $1 billion stock buyback program this year.""Growing earnings from wealth and investment management suggest an annual dividend of two or three times recent levels,"" he said on a conference call with analysts. Investors in the sixth largest bank can expect dividend and share buyback payouts in the future to just about track the profit Morgan Stanley makes in wealth management, subject to regulatory approval, he added.Like wealth management rivals such as Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo Corp's Wells Fargo Advisors, Morgan Stanley's brokers are basing more of their sales on fee-based accounts rather than transaction-based commissions and encouraging traditional brokerage customers to buy mortgages and other loans from their bank affiliate.Assets collected by brokers in the first quarter rose 24 percent from a year ago and 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013 to $19 billion. Total fee-based assets in client accounts reached a record $724 billion at the end of the quarter, helped by market gains as well as new assets. Wealth management in the first quarter comprised 40.6 percent of Morgan Stanley's total revenue and 30 percent of its pretax profit from continuing operations. [ID:nL3N0N92TZ] Wealth management's profit margins continue to outpace those of the company's other businesses. Its pretax profit margin hit 19 percent in the quarter, and the firm's chief financial officer said it is on target to reach 22 percent to 25 percent by the end of next year. Its return on equity from continuing operations was 14 percent in the first quarter versus 8.9 percent for the company as a whole.Big banks increasingly point to their growing wealth management businesses as stable counterparts to their riskier trading and capital-raising businesses. Bank of America's Merrill Lynch on Wednesday said assets managed in its wealth unit climbed 13 percent in the first quarter to $841.8 billion and total client balances in all brokerage and bank accounts jumped 7 percent to $2.4 trillion. Its net income inched up 1 percent to $729 million.Revenue in Morgan Stanley's wealth businesses, which caters to households with at least $250,000 to invest, trailed record results in last year's fourth-quarter, although asset management and other fees crept up 2 percent since the beginning of the year to $2.0 billion. Fee-based asset accounts at both Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch comprise 37 percent of total client assets and are growing, both firms said. Investment banking, trading and investment income in Morgan Stanley's wealth unit was hurt by fewer trading days in the January-March period and by a virtual famine in issuance of closed-end funds, an important product for U.S. retail investors, Ruth Porat, the company's chief financial officer, said on the conference call.She forecast that asset management fees in the second quarter are likely to grow because of higher market values, and also said compensation expenses should fall from seasonally elevated first-quarter levels when corporations pay higher social security and Medicare taxes for employees.The strongest potential for wealth management growth continues to lie in selling large mortgages and loans collateralized by investment portfolios to wealthy clients, executives said. ""We've got a great client base (and) we're under-penetrated with loan products,"" Porat told Reuters, repeating that lending is very profitable but that Morgan Stanley trails competitors such as Merrill and Wells Fargo in selling credit.Loans and commitments to lend in the first quarter rose 58 percent from a year ago and 12 percent from last year's fourth quarter to $33.1 billion. Net interest income, largely from sales of credit products, rose 30 percent from a year ago at Morgan Stanley Wealth to $539 billion.The company also is targeting its services primarily to the very wealthy. Seventy-seven percent of  its $1.9 billion of retail client assets come from households with $1 million or more to invest.Morgan Stanley's brokerage force edged up 1 percent from a year ago to 16,426 financial advisers, in contrast to the smaller group of 13,725 brokers at Merrill Lynch.

She said commodities revenues would still have been ""slightly"" higher excluding physical oil trading.Goldman, which has said it has no intention of backing away from the J Aron franchise it bought three decades ago, said ""significantly higher"" net revenue in natural resources trading compared with early 2013 had helped offset lower returns across the rest of FICC.Asked whether energy markets were the main driver, Schwartz said: ""That's where the primary volatility was.""The banks offered no further details, but market sources said they appeared to be among the biggest trading beneficiaries of the deep freeze that swept much of North America this winter,triggering the greatest price volatility in years for many regional fuel, electricity and natural gas markets.Aided by sophisticated models that process weather data in seconds, one popular spread trade was buying U.S. natural gas and selling in Europe, which enjoyed the warmest winter on record, trading sources said. They may have also benefited by holding fuel or natural gas in storage, releasing it to meet surges in demand. For instance, physical natural gas prices at the primary New York Transco hub in mid-January surged more than 20-fold to $120 per million British thermal units in one day.""The liquids side of it was getting to be very seriously constrained because of the cold snap ... if you have the storage and the inventory on hand, you clearly benefited from that,"" said Patrick Reames, Managing Partner and Commodity Technology Advisory, in Sugar Land, Texas.The banks do not provide any financial information about their commodity trading, but analysts reckon that Goldman and Morgan likely contributed around a third of the overall industry's estimated $4.5 billion in revenues last year.ZERO-SUM The banks were not alone in benefiting from the gyrations, which appeared to cast winners and losers regardless of their place in the market. The harsh weather delivered a series of unexpected jolts, including an unprecedented shortage of propane in the Midwest that caused prices to treble, a surge in ethanol prices to more than gasoline due to slower rail deliveries and an unusual turn by some East Coast generators to burn oil for power.One large utility operator in the U.S. Northeast was able to sell some excess natural gas to power generators at huge profits on the coldest days of the winter when prices in New York averaged over $30 per mmBtu, a source familiar with the trades said. Michigan-based utility DTE Energy (DTE.N) said it lost $3 million on energy trading in the last quarter of 2013.Cargill, one of the world's largest commodity traders, said its quarterly earnings fell 28 percent due to several market disruptions, including a trading loss in power markets that one industry publication put at over $100 million.While there has been no suggestion that big traders may have exacerbated the price spikes, adding to rising consumer energy costs, the strong results come at a delicate time for Wall Street's powerhouses as they seek to fend off tougher rules that could curtail their physical trading operations.The Federal Reserve is now reviewing public comments on whether it should push back banks' decade-long expansion into the raw materials supply chain over fears such risky trading could endanger the financial system - or that it might allow Wall Street too much sway over commodity prices. RIVALS WITHDRAW The upbeat revenue figures also offered signs of hope for a business line that's been under intensifying margin pressure in recent years due to restrictions on trading with banks' own money, rising capital requirements, and signs the so-called commodities super cycle may have peaked.Thursday's results may also illustrate how Goldman and Morgan Stanley are benefiting from rivals exiting or scaling back in the sector, including one-time top five firms like JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).""Right now it feels like we're starting to maybe see the beginnings of some marginal benefit of competitors exiting parts of our business that otherwise quite frankly they had charged in with excess,"" Schwartz said.The top 10 banks in commodities made $4.5 billion from natural resources trading in 2013, a report from UK analytics firm Coalition showed earlier this year.While significantly below the near $14 billion made by banks in commodities in 2008, it still represents a sizeable chunk of Wall Street's overall earnings.Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley reported an increase in commodities exposure known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) from the last quarter, with Goldman raising its VaR to $21 million, the highest in a year.Morgan Stanley increased its commodity VaR to $20 million from $18 million, despite preparing to sell its merchant oil trading business to Russian energy major Rosneft.Goldman's overall FICC revenue fell 11 percent to $2.85 billion from the same period last year.(Reporting by David Sheppard in London and Lauren Tara LaCapra, Scott DiSavino and Cezary Podkul in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2014-04-17,MS,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 1:24pm EDT","Amid frigid winter, Goldman, Morgan Stanley see commodity gains",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-goldman-morgan-commodity-idUSBREA3G12320140417?type=companyNews

Michigan-based utility DTE Energy said it lost $3 million on energy trading in the last quarter of 2013.Cargill, one of the world's largest commodity traders, said its quarterly earnings fell 28 percent due to several market disruptions, including a trading loss in power markets that one industry publication put at over $100 million.While there has been no suggestion that big traders may have exacerbated the price spikes, adding to rising consumer energy costs, the strong results come at a delicate time for Wall Street's powerhouses as they seek to fend off tougher rules that could curtail their physical trading operations.The Federal Reserve is now reviewing public comments on whether it should push back banks' decade-long expansion into the raw materials supply chain over fears such risky trading could endanger the financial system - or that it might allow Wall Street too much sway over commodity prices. RIVALS WITHDRAW The upbeat revenue figures also offered signs of hope for a business line that's been under intensifying margin pressure in recent years due to restrictions on trading with banks' own money, rising capital requirements, and signs the so-called commodities super cycle may have peaked.Thursday's results may also illustrate how Goldman and Morgan Stanley are benefiting from rivals exiting or scaling back in the sector, including one-time top five firms like JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank.""Right now it feels like we're starting to maybe see the beginnings of some marginal benefit of competitors exiting parts of our business that otherwise quite frankly they had charged in with excess,"" Schwartz said.The top 10 banks in commodities made $4.5 billion from natural resources trading in 2013, a report from UK analytics firm Coalition showed earlier this year.While significantly below the near $14 billion made by banks in commodities in 2008, it still represents a sizeable chunk of Wall Street's overall earnings.Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley reported an increase in commodities exposure known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) from the last quarter, with Goldman raising its VaR to $21 million, the highest in a year.Morgan Stanley increased its commodity VaR to $20 million from $18 million, despite preparing to sell its merchant oil trading business to Russian energy major Rosneft.Goldman's overall FICC revenue fell 11 percent to $2.85 billion from the same period last year.(Reporting by David Sheppard in London and Lauren Tara LaCapra, Scott DiSavino and Cezary Podkul in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2014-04-17,MS,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 1:22pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Amid frigid winter, Goldman, Morgan Stanley see commodity gains",http://www.reuters.com//article/commodities-goldman-morgan-stanley-idUSL6N0N93EN20140417?type=companyNews
132,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK, April 17  NEW YORK, April 17 Morgan Stanley's big bet on wealth management is looking strong as fees, commissions and interest collected by its more than 16,000 brokers fueled a 13 percent rise in the business's first-quarter net income from a year earlier to $423 million, the company said Thursday.Chief Executive James Gorman, whose purchase of Citigroup's  Smith Barney made it the world's biggest stockbroker as measured by sales force, said issues related to integrating the firms over the past five years are now resolved. The stability and profitability of the firm's wealth and asset management businesses, he added, made it possible for Morgan Stanley to double its dividend payment and install a $1 billion stock buyback program this year.""Growing earnings from wealth and investment management suggest an annual dividend of two or three times recent levels,"" he said on a conference call with analysts. Investors in the sixth largest bank can expect dividend and share buyback payouts in the future to just about track the profit Morgan Stanley makes in wealth management, subject to regulatory approval, he added.Like wealth management rivals such as Bank of America's  Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo Corp's Wells Fargo Advisors, Morgan Stanley's brokers are basing more of their sales on fee-based accounts rather than transaction-based commissions and encouraging traditional brokerage customers to buy mortgages and other loans from their bank affiliate.Assets collected by brokers in the first quarter rose 24 percent from a year ago and 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013 to $19 billion. Total fee-based assets in client accounts reached a record $724 billion at the end of the quarter, helped by market gains as well as new assets.Wealth management in the first quarter comprised 40.6 percent of Morgan Stanley's total revenue and 30 percent of its pretax profit from continuing operations. Wealth management's profit margins continue to outpace those of the company's other businesses. Its pretax profit margin hit 19 percent in the quarter, and the firm's chief financial officer said it is on target to reach 22 percent to 25 percent by the end of next year. Its return on equity from continuing operations was 14 percent in the first quarter versus 8.9 percent for the company as a whole.Big banks increasingly point to their growing wealth management businesses as stable counterparts to their riskier trading and capital-raising businesses. Bank of America's  Merrill Lynch on Wednesday said assets managed in its wealth unit climbed 13 percent in the first quarter to $841.8 billion and total client balances in all brokerage and bank accounts jumped 7 percent to $2.4 trillion. Its net income inched up 1 percent to $729 million. Revenue in Morgan Stanley's wealth businesses, which caters to households with at least $250,000 to invest, trailed record results in last year's fourth-quarter, although asset management and other fees crept up 2 percent since the beginning of the year to $2.0 billion. Fee-based asset accounts at both Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch comprise 37 percent of total client assets and are growing, both firms said.Investment banking, trading and investment income in Morgan Stanley's wealth unit was hurt by fewer trading days in the January-March period and by a virtual famine in issuance of closed-end funds, an important product for U.S. retail investors, Ruth Porat, the company's chief financial officer,  said on the conference call.She forecast that asset management fees in the second quarter are likely to grow because of higher market values, and also said compensation expenses should fall from seasonally elevated first-quarter levels when corporations pay higher social security and Medicare taxes for employees.The strongest potential for wealth management growth continues to lie in selling large mortgages and loans collateralized by investment portfolios to wealthy clients, executives said. ""We've got a great client base (and) we're under-penetrated with loan products,"" Porat told Reuters, repeating that lending is very profitable but that Morgan Stanley trails competitors such as Merrill and Wells Fargo in selling credit.Loans and commitments to lend in the first quarter rose 58 percent from a year ago and 12 percent from last year's fourth quarter to $33.1 billion. Net interest income, largely from sales of credit products, rose 30 percent from a year ago at Morgan Stanley Wealth to $539 billion.Morgan Stanley's brokerage force edged up 1 percent from a year ago to 16,426 financial advisers, in contrast to the smaller group of 13,725 brokers at Merrill Lynch. The Merrill advisers produce more than $1 billion of annual revenue based on first-quarter results while annualized fees and commissions for Morgan Stanley brokers are $881 million, up 4 percent from a year ago.

133,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | April 17  April 17 Investment banks Morgan Stanley  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, helped by gains in merger advisory and stock underwriting.The results underscored how businesses viewed as stodgy before the financial crisis are becoming critical drivers of earnings growth for investment banks now. Goldman's fixed-income trading revenue plunged during the first quarter, both for trades it did for customers and investments on its own account.But the bank's investment management and its stock underwriting and merger advisory businesses logged big gains.Morgan Stanley managed to boost revenue in its bond trading business, after posting a particularly weak first quarter in 2013. But excluding gains or losses from changes in the value of the bank's debt, the company's trading revenue fell during the quarter, while revenue from wealth management, investment management, stock and bond underwriting, and merger advisory all rose.Goldman shares were up 1.35 percent at $158.34 in morning trading, while shares of Morgan Stanley were up 4.2 percent at $31.15. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the last of the major Wall Street banks to report first quarter results, and most rivals' earnings have shown similar strength in businesses like underwriting and merger advisory.But for Goldman Sachs, trading is such a big part of its business that higher revenue in areas like merger advisory has less of an impact on the bottom line than for its rival Morgan Stanley.Goldman Sachs still gets more than 60 percent of its total revenue from trading including its investing and lending activities, while for Morgan Stanley that figure is less than 40 percent, and sometimes closer to half that percentage. Since the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has been emphasizing businesses like wealth management and merger advisory, which tend to generate more stable earnings and require less capital.Gorman's predecessor John Mack agreed in 2009 to buy Citigroup's Smith Barney retail brokerage business over time, a deal that closed in the middle of 2013. That deal was designed to make Morgan Stanley a safer company after it nearly collapsed during the financial crisis.Morgan Stanley posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $1.45 billion, or 74 cents per share, compared with $936 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected the bank to post earnings of 59 cents a share, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear how the estimates compare to the actual results, but several analysts said the bank beat consensus.Goldman Sachs' CEO Lloyd Blankfein, on the other hand, has made fewer strategic changes at the bank since the crisis.In the first quarter, the bank posted an 11 percent decline in earnings to common shareholders, to $1.95 billion, or $4.02 a share, from $2.19 billion, or $4.29 a share, in the same quarter last year.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.That decline came largely from its revenue in institutional client trading, which fell 13 percent to $4.45 billion, and investing and lending for its own account, which fell 26 percent to $1.53 billion.

134,"   By Carolyn Cohn and Natsuko Waki | LONDON, April 17  LONDON, April 17 The brave few who waded back into emerging markets in March reaped substantial rewards, but investors say it is too soon to tell whether the recent bounce will become a sustained rally.After three years of underperformance had left them at rock-bottom valuations, emerging markets enjoyed a surge in the early days of the northern spring.Sovereign debt spreads closed to their narrowest over U.S. Treasuries since May 2013 - just before then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted the Fed would scale back its monetary stimulus, frightening investors in risky assets.After falling 5 percent in 2013, emerging stocks  bounced 9 percent and moved into the black for 2014. Now they are beating developed-world stocks.Emerging market equity funds saw their biggest inflow in over a year last week, according to Boston-based fund tracker EPFR. Banks such as Barclays, Citi, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale started to recommend buying emerging markets by the beginning of this month.""Performance has been particularly good in the very short term,"" said Iain Stealey, who manages global bond strategies at JPMorgan Asset Management and has been adding emerging debt positions since the start of the year, though he also said that ""volatility is going to be quite high"".Not everyone took advantage of the rebound. The average allocation to emerging markets by international equity funds rose marginally in February, according to Lipper data - to 10.7 percent from 10.15 percent. Only four funds raised exposure to emerging markets by 2 percentage points or more over that time, Lipper's most recent data show.But a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch survey showed investors cut their extreme bets against emerging markets in April, suggesting many more investors have latched on to the trend.A net 2 percent of fund managers are underweight emerging markets, compared with a net 21 percent in March. The net reading is the difference between overweight and underweight positions. The survey also showed investors thought emerging markets to be the most undervalued in 13 years. (For GRAPHIC comparing emerging and developed market valuations, see http;//link.reuters.com/rut87v)One investor who profited was Loomis, Sayles & Co, which opened an emerging debt fund in February, its first U.S. mutual fund focused on developing economies.Emerging market funds had been going out of fashion, though, with only 10 new ones launched in the first three months of 2014, according to Lipper. In 2011, a strong year for the sector, 200 new emerging market funds launched.But Shaw Wagener, a portfolio manager at U.S. investor American Funds, opened an emerging growth and income fund only last month. ""It's a great time to launch a fund if you have a long-term focus in mind,"" he said. ""A lot of companies have cut back on capital expenditure, people are starting to manage more for profit and we may see earnings growth bottom out.""TURKEY TACTICS Others are implementing tactical and sophisticated trades to benefit from volatility in hotspots like Turkey, whose reliance on external capital has led to a sharp decline since last year.Andy Warwick, who manages a multi-portfolio fund at BlackRock, has made a number of long and short trades in Turkish equities - buying and selling in a matter of weeks - since September to benefit from volatility, before putting in place a long position in January. ""From a tactical point of view, Turkey looked very cheap and the central bank was tough in fighting the currency. It made markets more comfortable there's value there,"" Warwick said.""We continue to run that long position... It's about being tactical and (finding a way to) capture and embrace volatility.""Turkish stocks have risen more than 20 percent since late January as a surprise interest rate rise restored confidence in Turkey's financial system.A corporate bond rally in Brazil and India helped DoubleLine Capital's Emerging Markets Fixed Income Fund beat 90 percent of its peers this year, according to data from Morningstar.But investors say it is too soon to call a rally in emerging markets. Indeed, stocks and bonds weakened from their highs this week, and some investors said they were cutting positions again.The bounce did not reflect strength in the economies in emerging markets, investors said. Risks were seen particularly in emerging powerhouse China.""The recent rebound was two-thirds technical and one-third fundamental,"" said Patrice Lemonnier, head of emerging market equities at Amundi.""Technically it looks like a buy signal. The big fundamental caveat that doesn't favour that is China. Everybody knows it has to slow down. Whether the slowdown is going to be sudden is a big uncertainty.""

""We wish him the best of luck.""Ghaffari, who previously handled investments for billionaire George Soros and founded a fund firm later acquired by Morgan Stanley, was a high profile hire for Allen three and a half  years ago.

(link.reuters.com/hyp88v)The move comes as the U.S. Justice Department ramps up its investigations of Swiss banks that helped Americans dodge taxes leading to billions of dollars of missed revenues. As part of the program with the authorities, named category 2, banks compile information about how they set up Swiss accounts for U.S. clients and also how much was contained in the accounts, the Journal said, adding that the information must be reviewed by an independent examiner. The Justice Department is currently probing 14 Swiss banks over taxes after UBS AG UBSN.VX became the first major bank to settle over the charges. Two smaller Swiss banks have had to close shop as a result of the U.S. investigation.

French pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) has also been talking to buyers about selling $7 billion to $8 billion worth of mature products in the past few months, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week.Those drug portfolios would provide good acquisition opportunities for generic drugmakers and specialty pharmaceutical companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Actavis Plc ACT.N and Mylan Inc (MYL.O), people familiar with the matter and analysts said. Faced with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a major restructuring, with companies playing to their strengths by building up certain businesses and divesting others.Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which spun off its animal health and infant formula businesses in recent years, is also considering whether to divest the hundreds of off-patent drugs that are mostly sold in emerging markets. But Pfizer has said it would be unable to do so until 2017, after the company has better examined the unit's financial performance.Merck's plan to sell its established products is ""highly consistent"" with the company's refocusing strategy and could allow for more meaningful earnings growth, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note on Thursday.(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York; editing by Matthew Lewis)",2014-05-02,MS,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 4:36pm EDT",Exclusive: Abbott taps Morgan Stanley to sell mature products - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-abbott-sale-exclusive-idUSBREA410VJ20140502?type=companyNews
145,"  May 2 A major proxy advisory firm recommended shareholders vote against Goldman Sachs Group Inc's  executive compensation plan and added that Morgan Stanley  was also paying its top staff too much.Glass Lewis & Co issued the recommendations ahead of the banks' annual meetings where shareholders vote in a non-binding motion on executive pay.The criticism of executive compensation comes after a Wall Street Journal report that Coca-Cola Co is likely to revise its equity compensation plan for executives following pressure from top shareholder Warren Buffett.Glass Lewis said that the two banks were planning to pay too much, considering their performance was lagging their rivals - particularly in the case of Goldman Sachs. ""Overall, the company paid more than its peers, but performed moderately worse,"" the proxy advisory firm said in a paper prepared for investment funds who pay for its advice.Glass Lewis also recommended that shareholders vote against the reappointment of one director at each bank to show their displeasure. The advisory firm lowered its rating on Lloyd Blankfein-led Goldman to ""F"" from ""D"". Glass Lewis gave Morgan Stanley a ""D"" rating, saying that the company paid about the same as its peers while performing worse. It had an ""F"" rating previously.The proxy advisory firm recommended Goldman shareholders to vote against the reelection of the pay committee's chairman James Johnson.Morgan Stanley shareholders were also urged to vote against the re-election of director James Owens, citing the company's failure to provide sufficient disclosures regarding transactions with entities affiliated with its directors.

154,"  * Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs mandated - sources* IPO could be Europe's largest tech debut since 2000* Zalando hopes to benefit from buoyant equity marketsBy Arno Schuetze and Alexander HübnerFRANKFURT, May 7 Europe's largest online fashion retailer, Zalando, has picked banks to organise a possible stock market listing in the third quarter, potentially Europe's biggest technology offering since Germany's T-Online  debut in 2000, people familiar with the plans said.The flotation, which could value the company at more than $5 billion, is being organised by Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the sources said. Zalando on Wednesday reiterated it was constantly considering all options including an initial public offering (IPO) and declined to comment further. The banks declined to comment.Zalando has said in the past that an IPO was a possibility but not an immediate priority.It is hoping to take advantage of buoyant capital markets, which have encouraged Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba IPO-ALIB.N to launch its own IPO later this year, possibly the largest technology debut in history. Global initial public offerings have almost doubled in value in the first quarter of 2014, with Europe leading the way thanks to a nascent economic recovery that lifted investors' confidence and stock markets.Investors have, however, in recent weeks embarked on a sell-off of high-flying tech stocks like Twitter and Amazon, reviving doubts about soaring tech valuations. Zalando's biggest investor, Swedish firm Kinnevik , has said in the past its 36 percent stake in Zalando was worth 12.14 billion Swedish crowns ($1.87 billion), putting a value of 3.8 billion euros on the whole company.Berlin-based Zalando, whose rivals include Britain-based ASOS, started selling shoes in Germany five years ago and now ships 1,500 different brands to customers in 15 countries.Shares in ASOS have tumbled in recent weeks after it reported slowing sales growth and a 22 percent fall in first half profit that reflected a step-up in its investment programme.Kinnevik, which has said that a ""long-term approach"" to ownership was needed to guide a firm such as Zalando as it navigates through a relatively new and fast-changing industry, has seen its own shares tumble due to worries over its large exposure to Russia and slowing sales at Zalando.German magazine Bilanz reported earlier on Wednesday that Zalando has chosen to list on US bourse Nasdaq.

176,"  (Repeats to reach additional subscribers)By Natalie Harrison, Michelle Sierra and Lynn AdlerNEW YORK, June 4 (IFR/TRPLC) - Wall Street banks are bracing for a clampdown and even fines if regulators determine they have violated guidelines aimed at stamping out reckless underwriting on leveraged buyout debt.US regulators are looking at deals arranged between October 2013 and March 2014, when, according to data from Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp, more than 24 buyouts had leverage above the official six-times limit.Another 19 buyouts since March have also breached that limit, which was set by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FDIC and the Federal Reserve as the absolute maximum acceptable level.While the review is routine - an annual exercise dubbed the Shared National Credit (SNC) - banks fear regulators will be keen to make examples of any institutions flouting the new guidelines, which were set in place in March last year.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For list of buyouts click on:  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^""Banks were soundly warned in the last review that if they could not show that they were sticking to the guidelines, that they would be punished,"" said Paul Forrester, a partner at Mayer Brown.He and others believe that, in addition to the six times leverage ceiling, regulators will also scrutinise how many loans breaching the limit will be permissible on each bank's books.""The OCC has signaled that rare is closer to never, and we read that as one or maybe two,"" one senior debt capital markets banker told IFR, speaking on condition of anonymity.The OCC and Fed were not immediately available to comment.GREY AREAS  For the purposes of the review, regulators do not distinguish between left-lead arrangers and bookrunners, but market participants, including lawyers and bankers, believe the leading banks will bear the closest scrutiny - and the punishments.In any case, according to the TRLPC data, almost all of the major banks have been left-lead on at least four loans in excess of the six-times limit since October 2013.Although banks are normally wary of such deals, they make exceptions when buyout companies have exceptionally strong cash flows that enable them to pay down debt more easily - something that is also factored into the guidelines.Richard Farley, a leveraged finance partner in law firm Paul Hastings, said it was difficult to determine which banks are in violation of the guidelines, based on publicly available data.""Banks can underwrite all the deals they like over six-times leverage as long as they can show that at least half of the total debt, or all of the secured debt, can be paid down in (up to) seven years,"" Farley said. And that, many believe, is where banks may be able to convince regulators that they are abiding by the spirit, if not the letter, of the post-crisis regulatory regime.""For any deal underwritten in breach of any of the guidelines, banks will have an approval memo explaining how they have justified underwriting that deal,"" said another debt capital markets banker, who also declined to be named.CAT AND MOUSE Some banks complain that they are on an uneven playing field, as different institutions are regulated by different authorities.The OCC, for example, oversees US banks with deposits such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi, while the Fed monitors US bank holding companies such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as foreign institutions like Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Having different regulators only adds to the uncertainty for banks, which are trying to satisfy authorities while at the same time reaping the rewards of a booming leveraged loan and high-yield bond market.""Banks are in the business of making money,"" said Mayer Brown's Forrester.""If they make a credit judgment and the demand for deals is there, then they are going to respond to that demand.""Even so, some have stepped away from some of their biggest clients. Three longtime banks for private equity firm KKR snubbed a request for a US$725m buyout loan for Brickman over concerns it was too risky to pass muster with US regulators.And that, according to one buy-side source, was in spite of the firm's strong track record of leveraging up and then reducing debt quickly.""What we have seen is more banks dropping out of processes, because they worry that they are off-sides with the guidelines,"" said Jason Kyrwood, leveraged finance partner at Davis Polk.Others say banks are grappling with tactical decisions, such as trying to guess how big the fines could be - and weighing that up against the fees for underwriting such deals.The final decision from regulators is not expected until some time in summer, but banks are clearly expecting they will have to pay at least a little bit - and possibly a lot more - for their decisions.""Fines have to be regarded as a much more likely scenario this time round,"" Forrester said.

177,"   By Anna Louie Sussman  Morgan Stanley MS.N is selling its controlling stake in oil storage and transport company TransMontaigne Inc TMG.UL to NGL Energy Partners LP NGL.N for $200 million, essentially ending its long run as the biggest physical oil trader on Wall Street.The long-awaited deal comes months after the bank announced its intent to sell most of its global physical oil trading operations to Russian state-run oil major Rosneft ROSN.MM, including its 49 percent stake in shipping company Heidmar.It is the latest sign of how growing regulatory pressure is reshaping commodity markets.NGL Energy Partners, an up-and-coming master limited partnership (MLP) that last year bought the oil trading division of privately held Gavilon, said an additional amount would be paid for inventory transferred at closing. The refined products held by TransMontaigne Inc could be valued at up to $550 million, a person familiar with the matter said.The TransMontaigne MLP includes some 48 fuel terminals with nearly 24 million barrels of storage capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Florida, the Midwest and across the Southeast, including along the strategically important Colonial Pipeline, which ships gasoline and diesel from the Gulf to the East Coast. The bank's power, gas and metals business is unaffected, and the bank will continue to trade physical oil for its clients, Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake said.One of the first banks to build up a major oil trading desk over two decades ago, Morgan Stanley has been trying to sell or spin off its physical commodity business for more than a year as it faces mounting regulatory scrutiny of the risks of owning and trading physical commodities, as well as higher capital requirements.Building on major jet-fuel supply deals and strategic oil tank leases in the New York harbor, Morgan bought TransMontaigne in 2006, taking it deeper into the U.S. oil system years before the shale oil boom upended oil flows. Even after they give up their independent investment bank status after the financial crisis, a 1999 law permitted Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to remain in commodity activities engaged in before 1997.Political pressure has intensified in recent years due to fears of banks' exposure to potentially catastrophic losses in the physical business, as well as concerns about the extent of their influence over the commodity supply chain. Morgan Stanley launched a formal effort in December to sell its controlling stake in TransMontaigne. Morgan Stanley said the sale includes its general partner and limited partner interests in TransMontaigne Partners LP TLP.N.The deal, expected to close in the third quarter, is not material to the firm's overall results, Morgan Stanley said.

The region's complex was previously based in Richmond, Virginia, and  led by Kevin Williams. Williams will stay on as branch manager there. Anderson said the complex moved to Atlanta because the brokerage is hoping to tap into ""the money center in the southeast."" ""Our market share in the southeast is low relative to other territories,"" Anderson said.Moving the complex to Atlanta brings RBC's regional complex closer to recruiting and business resources, Anderson said, like the city's respected colleges and the headquarters for several international businesses.

184,"  (Recasts with Pakistan government confirmation, changes dateline)By Mehreen Zahra-MalikISLAMABAD, June 12 The Pakistani government has sold its 19.8 pct stake in United Bank Ltd for $387 million, the country's first capital market transaction in eight years.The deal is part of Pakistan's initiative to privatise 68 public companies, including 10 banks, that was announced earlier this year. The government sees the sell-off as a life saver for Pakistan's struggling economy, crippled by power shortages, corruption and militant violence. Successful privatisation is Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's top political and economic goal.""The first transaction under the privatisation commission has been overwhelmingly successful and with it Pakistan has re-entered the world equity market after eight long years,"" Privatisation Commission Chairman Mohammad Zubair told Reuters. Foreign buyers including Morgan Stanley, Wellington, Templeton and others bought 82 percent of the stake, he said.Pakistan hopes to raise up to $5 billion in privatisation revenue in the next two years to ease pressure on strained public finances, Zubair added. Observers fear that an assault on Sunday on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Pakistan's sprawling commercial hub of 18 million, would hamper efforts to attract foreign investors to revive economic growth.""This active participation in United Bank's privatisation by the world's leading equity funds is a reflection of Pakistan's extremely positive economic situation as perceived by these investors despite Sunday night's terror attacks in Karachi,"" Zubair said.The International Monetary Fund saved Pakistan from possible default by agreeing last September to lend it $6.7 billion over three years, making the loan conditional on economic reforms such as a longstanding promise to privatise loss-making state companies.

185,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley has hired a senior loan executive and his team from Deutsche Bank AG to cater to high net worth clients who want to buy or borrow against real estate, yachts, artwork and other luxury items.The Wall Street bank has hired Marcus Mitchell to head its tailored lending team, said Gregory Fleming, president of wealth management and investment management, at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit on Monday.Mitchell had overseen loan and deposit products at Deutsche Bank's wealth management arm in the Americas.A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment. Mitchell will bring several bankers to work with him in the tailored lending group, Fleming said, but declined to name other employees joining the firm. The group will report to Eric Heaton, who heads private banking.The appointment comes as Morgan Stanley works to build out its lending capabilities more broadly in wealth management. Its primary lending business there uses investment portfolios as collateral, but the bank is also trying to grow home loans and tailored lending. That business allows clients to borrow for or lend against less conventional items like art, aircrafts, boats, concentrated stock holdings and commercial real estate. A brochure on Morgan Stanley's web site says tailored lending clients can now borrow up to $25 million for up to two years on an unsecured line of credit. They can also borrow up to $50 million for up to 10 years using commercial real estate as collateral, or up to $200 million for up to 10 years using securities as collateral.The document says Morgan Stanley uses a network of third-party lenders to assist with lending against ""luxury items such as fine art, aircraft and recreational boats and yachts."" Tailored lending is a niche area for a relatively small group of wealth clients, but it can be lucrative for banks with big wealth management arms.Morgan Stanley is in the process of transferring roughly $140 billion in deposits from Citigroup Inc as part of its acquisition of the Smith Barney brokerage business from that bank. By the time it gets all of those deposits in 2015, it would like to lend out $75 billion worth, up from $37 billion at the end of 2013, according to a presentation by Chief Executive James Gorman last week.

188,"   By Soyoung Kim and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK, June 16  NEW YORK, June 16 Morgan Stanley, an adviser to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc in its $53 billion hostile bid for Allergan Inc, initially tried to get hired by Allergan and in its pitch called the unsolicited bidder a ""house of cards"", according to Allergan.The Botox maker released email exchanges with Morgan Stanley bankers on Monday, which reveal the bankers were pitching for a defense assignment from Allergan, offering advice as to how the company could successfully defend the unwanted suitor.""Executives from Morgan Stanley, the investment bank understood to have recently been retained by Valeant, have sent emails directly to Allergan's management team that suggest they share the concerns of Allergan...,"" the company said in a statement.In a May 13 email to Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards, Morgan Stanley's global head of M&A Robert Kindler said the company could be more aggressive in going after Valeant's business model and the value of its stock. David Horn, a managing director at Morgan Stanley's healthcare group, followed up with an email to Edwards on May 18.""Part of what Rob (Kindler) is suggesting (to Allergan) is to allow him to use his significant relationships with media and analysts to provide a clear and detailed articulation of why Valeant is a house of cards and your investors should not want to take their stock,"" Horn said.Representatives of Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Allergan declined to comment. Valeant could not be immediately reached for comment. Valeant and its ally Pershing Square Capital Management - Allergan's biggest shareholder - have offered to buy Allergan  for $53 billion in cash and shares. Allergan has rejected the offer and refused to negotiate, leading Pershing to move toward replacing most of Allergan's board at a special meeting.However, Valeant's Toronto-listed stock has fallen in recent weeks, with Allergan stepping up its attack on the rival's business model. Shares of Valeant have fallen nearly 7 percent in the last five days, while the S&P 500 has remained flat. Allergan has argued that Valeant shuns research and development and relies solely on acquisitions to drive growth, a model which it calls unsustainable. Allergan has compared Valeant to Tyco, the scandal-plagued company which built itself up through acquisitions and then collapsed.Valeant has defended itself, with Ackman arguing that the company's business model is more similar to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc than to Tyco.Allergan is working with Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and legal advisers Latham & Watkins, Richards, Layton & Finger and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Valeant, which has been working with Barclays Plc  and RBC Capital Markets for the past few months, has recently added Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser, people familiar with the matter said.

189,"  * Morgan Stanley, SEB to lead Stockholm listing of hotel operator Scandic* Scandic could be valued at more than EUR 1 bln including debt   (Adds detail, background)STOCKHOLM, June 16 Swedish private firm EQT  has picked Morgan Stanley and SEB to lead a stock market listing of hotel operator Scandic, two people familiar with the matter said.The sources declined to be identified because the plans are not yet public. EQT, which owns 78 percent of Scandic, declined to comment, as did Scandic and the banks.Reuters reported in April that EQT had invited banks to compete for roles in the initial public offering of the largest hotel operator in the Nordic region, which could value it at more than 1 billion euros, including debt and take place later this year. The Nordic IPO market has picked up pace in recent months, particularly in Sweden, which saw a two-and-a-half-year drought in its main market that lasted until November last year.EQT was one of the main stakeholders in the biggest offering in the Nordics since 2010 when Danish outsourcing firm ISS was listed in March, and also saw its bathroom firm Sanitec  carry out Sweden's biggest IPO for seven years in December. Both shares have strongly outperformed the wider market.For Morgan Stanley, Scandic represents another high-profile IPO mandate in the region after it helped take ship fuel firm OW Bunker to the Copenhagen bourse this year. Morgan Stanley is also one of three banks to lead the IPO of Swedish cable operator Com Hem IPO-COM.ST, whose shares are set to start trading in Stockholm on Tuesday. It has also been hired to lead the listing of debt collector Lindorff together with other banks, sources told Reuters in December.Scandic had revenue of 913 million euros in 2013 and earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and depreciation (EBITDA) of 80 million.Those figures will be boosted by its acquisition of Norway's Rica Hotels from the Rivelsrud family this year with 72 hotels, taking Scandic's total number of hotels to 223.

Morgan Stanley, the world's largest brokerage firm as measured by its more than 16,000 financial advisers, has until now limited them to tweeting scripted messages it prepared on the economy, general investment themes, wealth management concepts and some lifestyle topics. The company told advisers on Monday that if they take an online training course that can be completed in about 20 minutes and have at least 15 followers - a pittance by the standards of Twitter, where Justin Bieber has 52.6 million followers - they can create their own 140-character messages and retweet content from others. Morgan Stanley is the first of the big U.S. brokerages - the others are Wells Fargo & Co's Wells Fargo Advisors, Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and UBS AG's UBS Wealth Management Americas - to allow such leeway, said Valentina Chtchedrine, executive director for digital marketing strategy.The firm has allowed self-created messages on LinkedIn since July 2012, and has not run into any regulatory problems, she said.  To date, about 6,500 Morgan Stanley advisers are approved to use LinkedIn, with 1,300 of them also approved to tweet.Advisers used to instant gratification with their personal Twitter accounts will have to put up with delayed gratification in their professional lives. All messages and status updates are moderated by a supervisor, with a decision on approval generally coming within several hours, Chtchedrine said.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the securities industry's self-regulatory arm, has told firms they must keep records of all social media communication and that content must adhere to federal laws and rules limiting advertising and testimonials.  Brokers are not permitted to write about particular investments, offer forecasts or discuss more risky offerings such as commodities or structured products that require disclaimers.

197,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley (MS.N) wants to pay out a smaller portion of wealth management revenue to the retail brokers who generate it, the final and perhaps most difficult front in Chief Executive James Gorman's drive to reduce staff costs across the bank.For now, executives are considering changes at the margins: cutting pay for brokers who generate the least revenue for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, and slashing the money it sets aside to lure experienced new hires. Executives have been hashing out possibilities for the 2015 broker pay plan in recent weeks, but have not made any final decisions.""There are some functions you don't need to continue to put money into as the revenue line grows, as we become bigger, as we are more selective on recruiting and we have less attrition,"" Greg Fleming, president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in an interview last month.Reducing pay in the brokerage business is tough to do, because even mid-grade advisers are still in high demand and can easily leave for other banks, or strike out on their own, often taking some prize clients with them. Demand for talent is slacker in other businesses like trading.Many customers are fiercely loyal to their financial advisers. That is particularly the case if they credit the advisers with helping to make them wealthy.  Clients share personal information during marriages, divorces and family emergencies, and advisers can become almost like personal concierges to top clients - offering access to hot investments, coming up with loans for medical procedures, or wining and dining them at celebrity cocktail parties and sporting events. Executives at Morgan Stanley are trying to ensure they incentivize the brokers to do the right thing for customers and the firm. The bank is hoping to reduce the commissions brokers get to simply buy and sell securities, and to instead encourage them to offer more holistic financial advice. Gorman said at a conference last month that he wants to pay 55 percent or less of wealth management revenue to brokers, 5 percentage points down from the current 60 percent. Fleming is responsible for hitting that target. Reducing what is known as the ""compensation ratio"" by that much would save the firm $884 million in costs next year, based on a revenue projection from Bernstein Research – big savings for a bank with $28 billion in total annual costs.Fleming told Reuters he can get there not by cutting pay, but by growing revenue through products like loans, and by being more careful not to spend too much on bonuses for new advisers. Recruiting has become a substantial expense for big brokerages like Morgan Stanley in recent years, with multi-million-dollar sign-on bonuses routinely offered for advisers with large books of business. The bonuses can be so large that they make an adviser an unprofitable bet, even when spreading the cost over the years he or she spends generating revenue.""The recruiting costs are tremendous to bring experienced advisers over,"" said Robert Dicks, who heads Deloitte Consulting's Human Capital Financial Services practice in the U.S. ""Lowering that and having more success in developing new advisers into the business is key to bringing down the compensation ratio.""In the longer run, some Morgan Stanley executives wonder if the bank will have to cut compensation expenses for its 16,426 advisers even more.Although Gorman's wealth management target was the most aggressive cut to pay ratios in Morgan Stanley's three business units, the 55 percent ratio is still much higher than the 40 percent or less he outlined for institutional securities and investment management. ""Bank executives say, it's a high-cost, high-aggravation business and why can't we bring it under control?"" said Alan Johnson, a Wall Street pay consultant, referring to the challenge of managing the personalities and pay packages of thousands of individual advisers. ""They think about it every day - even just getting another 1 percent on billions of dollars' of revenue is a lot of money.""Privately, at least one Morgan Stanley executive said he believes the compensation ratio in wealth management should eventually fall far below the one Gorman outlined, although he acknowledged such a goal would be difficult to achieve unless the industry moved in lockstep to reduce pay all at once.Plenty of industry veterans are skeptical banks will be able to cut broker pay at all, given the competitive hiring environment, and how important the business has become for earnings. Wealth management now produces more than 40 percent of Morgan Stanley's annual revenue, and about 60 percent of its pretax profit.""It's not just tough, but impossible,"" said Mindy Diamond, a brokerage recruiter who runs Diamond Consultants in Chester, New Jersey. ""I can tell you unequivocally that if they do anything to meaningfully mess with comp, they would lose a good majority of advisers. I just don’t see it happening.""

203,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  A California appellate court has reinstated a nearly $5 million ruling against Morgan Stanley in a case initially filed by two brokers who said the company broke promises it made when recruiting them.The three-judge panel of California 4th District Court of Appeal this week unanimously agreed with lawyers for brokers John Paladino and Todd Vitale, who argued that a lower court was wrong to overturn a 2012 securities arbitration decision in the brokers' favor.""We disagree with ruling and are considering our options,"" a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said.Neither Paladino, Vitale nor their lawyer could be immediately reached for comment.Morgan Stanley had argued that one of the three Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitrators who heard the case did not disclose ties between some of his family members and the securities industry. Among those details: the arbitrator's daughter had previously worked in the brokerage industry and also had an account at Morgan Stanley at the time of the arbitration, according to court documents. A judge of the Superior Court of California in San Diego agreed with Morgan Stanley in 2012, reasoning that FINRA's arbitration rules required arbitrators to disclose those details, according to court documents.The appellate court acknowledged that the arbitrator failed to disclose those details, but ruled in an opinion on Monday that the information ""could not cause an objective observer to doubt the arbitrator's impartiality.""  Brokers must typically resolve legal disputes with their employers in FINRA's arbitration forum.  Arbitration rulings are generally binding, but courts can overturn them in some instances, such as when arbitrators are biased.""It's very rare that you can ever overturn a FINRA award,"" said Jeffrey Riffer, a securities lawyer in Los Angeles who was not involved in the case. But brokerages usually try when a large sum is at stake, Riffer said.Morgan Stanley recruited Paladino and Vitale from a UBS AG brokerage unit in 2008, according to the appeals court opinion. The two alleged that Morgan Stanley promised that Vitale would become a salaried sales manager within six months of joining the firm and a branch manager within a year. Paladino was to take over their combined clients when Vitale became salaried.  But Morgan Stanley did not make Vitale a salaried manager. Paladino, as a result, was never able to take over the clients.Vitale still works for Morgan Stanley in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Paladino left Morgan Stanley in late 2012, according to regulatory filings. He is now executive director of wealth management for Sterling Wealth Management Group in Carlsbad, California.

207,"  HONG KONG, July 7 Morgan Stanley said on Monday that its Asia private equity unit has raised $1.7 billion in its fourth Asia fund as it seeks investment opportunities in China and South Korea.The fund, Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia IV LP, has already made two investments from the new fund, and raised more capital than initially targeted, the Wall Street bank said in a statement.One of the key focus areas for Fund IV will be China. ""The last two years in China, we have seen the most attractive entry prices we have seen in the last 10 years,"" said Chin Chou, CEO of Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia (MSPEA).

208,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | July 8  July 8 Weeks after raising its bonus offers for top financial advisers, Ameriprise Financial Inc said it has hired one away from Morgan Stanley to join its Providence, Rhode Island, office.John Poulton joined Ameriprise on June 27 from Morgan Stanley where he managed $125 million in client assets.Ameriprise announced in June that it raised minimum signing bonuses for the top revenue-generating advisers to nearly $1.25 million from around $1 million.Prior to upping its offers, Ameriprise recruited 77 new advisers during the first quarter of this year, and the vast majority managed under $100 million in client assets, a spokesman said. It is unclear if Poulton received one of the recently raised bonuses, however he is the second Morgan Stanley broker in charge of more than $100 million in client assets to join Ameriprise in recent months.On May 9, Christopher Knust, who managed $147 million in client assets at Morgan Stanley, joined Ameriprise's office in Omaha, Nebraska. Poulton could not be reached for comment. Ameriprise announced the move last Thursday.Knust, who previously worked for Smith Barney before it was bought by Morgan Stanley, did not comment on offers. He said he moved to Ameriprise in part because he thinks the firm reinvests more in its business than Morgan Stanley. Knust acknowledged that Morgan Stanley's investment management business is the biggest in the field, with more than $725 billion in client assets, but said it had ""become more difficult"" to obtain reimbursement for some expenses.""There's a greater investment in the business at Ameriprise and that directly and indirectly benefits our clients because (financial advisers) can focus on the things that we want to focus on,"" Knust said.A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley confirmed Poulton and Knust left the firm, and said the brokerage continues to reinvest profit into its investment management business.

Labriola previously worked for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith in the late 1990s, before leaving in 2000 to work for Citigroup and then Morgan Stanley.Labriola's hiring comes after John Thiel, head of U.S. Wealth Management for Merrill Lynch, told Reuters the firm planned to restart hiring after years of steadily reducing its broker headcount. ""We want to grow,"" Thiel said at Reuters' Global Wealth Summit in mid-June, adding that the expansion will be ""very selective"" and ""thoughtful.""Merrill Lynch, once the largest U.S. securities firm as measured by its sales force, ended the first quarter with 13,725 financial advisers, a decrease of almost 15 percent since it was bought by Bank of America Corp during the financial crisis in January 2009. Morgan Stanley is the largest U.S. brokerage firm by sales force, with 16,426 advisers as of March 31. Wells Fargo & Co's  Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS AG's UBS Wealth Management Americas round out the nation's four largest securities brokerages.Top level advisers like Labriola, who manage more than $100 million in client assets or produce more than $1 million a year in revenue for their firms, are prize ""gets"" for these firms.(Reporting by Elizabeth Dilts; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-07-15,MS,"Tue Jul 15, 2014 | 12:41pm EDT","ON THE MOVE-Merrill Lynch hiring again, recruits top from Morgan Stanley adviser",http://www.reuters.com//article/bank-of-america-merrilllynch-jobs-idUSL2N0PQ19D20140715?type=companyNews
214,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley posted wealth management results for the second quarter just a hair's breadth short of a key profitability target it set for the end of 2015, but bank executives remained concerned about the high costs of recruiting brokers. The bank posted pretax profit of $767 million in its wealth division in the second quarter, 38.6 percent of its total profit and the highest since Morgan Stanley began a retail brokerage joint venture with Smith Barney five years ago.The profit represented 21 percent of net revenue in the wealth division, a margin that has risen from the single digits and was close to the bank's target of raising pretax profit margin to between 22 percent and 25 percent by the end of next year. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said he remained unhappy with the expensive recruiting wars that the company and its three large rivals were waging to lure top brokers from each other.""Long term, strategically, in an oligopoly you’d expect less movement of financial advisers between firms,"" he said, referring to rivals Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS Wealth Management Americas. ""That doesn’t translate yet, but we think it will.""Gorman raised eyebrows earlier this year by saying compensation costs at Morgan Stanley Wealth should fall to 55 percent of revenue from 60 percent. People inside and outside the firm speculated he would be the first executive to curtail sky-high signing bonuses or make major changes in the way brokers are paid. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the quickest way to slow down pay growth relative to revenue growth was for brokers sell more mortgages and loan products. There is ample room to grow in lending because few wealthy people know Morgan Stanley is a bank.What's more, she said, brokers receive lower pay for selling loans than they do for selling traditional products such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and managed investment accounts.Aside from compensation, other costs fell 9 percent to $762 million in the quarter versus a year earlier because Morgan Stanley is no longer spending millions to combine operations with those of Smith Barney. ""We completed the integration, and now we're really benefiting from the operating leverage,"" Porat told Reuters. TOTAL CLIENT ASSETS SOAR Morgan Stanley on Thursday reported that total second-quarter income more than doubled, helped by rising revenue in its retail brokerage business. Buying Smith Barney also has made Morgan Stanley the industry leader in selling packages of mutual funds and other ""managed account"" products that charge fees instead of commissions, Porat said. Asset management-related fees climbed 9 percent to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier, while commissions fell 10 percent to $511 million.Morgan Stanley, which began its joint venture with the Citigroup-owned Smith Barney in 2009, purchased the remaining stake that Citi held last year.Total client assets soared just above $2 trillion at June 30, a record number cited on Wednesday by Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management division. Both firms attributed the rise to market appreciation and brokers' focus on gathering assets from wealthy people.Morgan Stanley's 16,316 financial advisers collected $12.5 billion in fee-based assets from clients in the second quarter, up 25 percent from a year ago but down 34 percent from the first quarter.

216,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tanya Agrawal  Morgan Stanley's second-quarter income more than doubled, helped by rising revenue in its retail brokerage business as it won more assets to manage from clients, the investment bank said on Thursday.A onetime tax break and the ending of a joint venture with Citigroup in wealth management gave the bank its biggest income gains for the quarter. But even excluding those items, the bank posted better results in businesses including merger advisory, stock and bond underwriting and investment management. The results beat forecasts, and Morgan Stanley's shares edged 0.24 percent higher to $32.58 as the broader market fell. ""The businesses that are going well are firing on all cylinders,"" said John Thompson, chief executive of Vilas Capital Management, whose second largest holding is Morgan Stanley shares.Morgan Stanley has been reshaping its business after coming close to failing during the financial crisis. The second-largest stand-alone investment bank, long a powerhouse in areas like bond trading and commodities trading, has been increasing its reliance on its retail brokerage and investment management businesses. Its current CEO, James Gorman, previously headed the wealth management businesses. These businesses tend to generate more stable earnings and are less likely to unravel during market calamities. Investment management and retail brokerage accounted for about 30 percent to 40 percent of the bank's quarterly revenue in 2007, but the share grew to more than half in the second quarter of 2014. Retail clients' assets rose by $59 billion to $2 trillion in the second quarter, due in part to clients bringing money to the bank. Morgan Stanley managed to win those assets without expanding its broker force: it ended June with 16,316 financial advisers compared with 16,321 a year ago.Revenue from wealth management rose 5 percent to $3.72 billion from the year-ago quarter, and the bank's pretax margin from the business widened to 21 percent from 18.5 percent, close to its target of 22-25 percent by the end of 2015.Overall, net income for shareholders rose to $1.86 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the second quarter from $803 million, or 41 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.According to adjusted figures calculated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the company earned 60 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 55 cents. The quarter included a $609 million tax benefit. The bank also received 100 percent of the income from its wealth management business during the quarter, unlike the second quarter of 2013, when it shared that income with its joint venture partner, Citigroup. Morgan Stanley bought out Citigroup's remaining 35 percent stake in the wealth management business on June 28, 2013.Revenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity trading fell 12.3 percent to $1 billion as a lack of volatility discouraged trading during the quarter. Those results exclude accounting adjustments linked to the value of the company's debt.  That decline is about in line with the drops posted by rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, and No. 1 standalone investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Investors' concerns about the future of the bank's bond trading business have weighed on its valuation. Morgan Stanley shares trade at about their book value, or the net accounting value of the company's assets. When the bank's earnings start rising in the coming years, as equity markets rise, said Vilas Capital's Thompson, the bank's shares could trade at 1.5 to 2 times book value.Morgan Stanley, ranked No. 2 globally in mergers-and-acquisitions, benefited from a strong equities market in the quarter.

217,"   By Anna Louie Sussman  The quarterly earnings of Wall Street's biggest banks offer a glimpse into the scale of their commodity trading activity through a measure of trading risk called VaR.On Thursday, Morgan Stanley reported its commodity Value-at-Risk (VaR) fell to $19 million in the second quarter from $20 million in the first quarter and $24 million in the second quarter of 2013.VaR is the largest amount of money that the bank could lose on 95 percent of the trading days during the period.The bank has scaled back its commodities operation by selling the bulk of its physical crude oil operations. In early July, it announced the close of the sale of its ownership interests in TransMontaigne Partners L.P. to NGL Energy Partners LP.On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview that management does not believe that U.S. sanctions announced on Wednesday against Russian oil company Rosneft would affect a December deal for Rosneft to buy the majority of the bank's physical oil trading operations.Morgan Stanley's revenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity trading fell 12.3 percent to $1 billion as a lack of volatility discouraged trading during the second quarter. Typically, Wall Street banks group their commodities revenue under the fixed-income category and do not break out the sector, often leaving VaR as a key risk-reward indicator that can measure commodities exposure. The following is a table of VaR, in millions of dollars, for five major U.S. banks:                                     2014                     2013                                             Q2       Q1            Q4    Q3    Q2    Q1                       JPMorgan        9           11           15    13    13     15                     Goldman Sachs   21          21           18    17    19     21                     Morgan Stanley  19          20           18    20    24     20                      BoA-ML                                  12*    12    14     15                     Citigroup                   14           11    13    12     34          *Denotes an average VaR over 2013 (Reporting by Anna Louie Sussman; Editing by Paul Simao and Jan Paschal)",2014-07-17,MS,"Thu Jul 17, 2014 | 2:32pm EDT",Factbox - Wall St. and commodity risk: Morgan Stanley's VaR dips,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-banks-commodities-risks-idUSKBN0FM2GP20140717?type=companyNews

219,"  German car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL] can raise its bid for U.S.-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp TRW.N to as much as $13 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.ZF's lenders have said financing is available for a higher all-cash bid and the German company is exploring a proposal that values the TRW at between $110 and $112.50 per share, Bloomberg reported. (bloom.bg/1mkKR3S)ZF said last week that it was in early-stage buyout talks with the American auto parts supplier, but did not disclose any financial details. A Bloomberg report at the time said ZF valued TRW at $11 billion to $12 billion. Privately owned ZF is working with Citigroup Inc (C.N), and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and several European banks are also advising the company and financing the deal, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The German company can borrow as much as $16 billion, Bloomberg calculated, based on ZF's ability to borrow as much as four times its and TRW's combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Now that talks are public, the companies could reach an agreement in three to four weeks to prevent management disruption and allay concerns among automakers, Bloomberg said.TRW North America spokesman John Wilkerson and ZF North America spokesman Bryan Johnson declined to comment.

""We continue to do all the work necessary for closing by the end of the year, obviously subject to regulatory approval."" Her comments come a day after the U.S. government imposed its toughest sanctions yet on some of the key players in the Russian economy over what Washington says is Moscow's reluctance to curb violence in Ukraine. The move closed off medium- and long-term dollar funding to Rosneft, the country's second-largest gas producer Novatek and its third-largest bank, Gazprombank. The measures stopped short of freezing the companies' assets, restricting the short-term funding the companies need for day-to-day operations or stopping U.S. firms doing business with them.But they had raised some doubts about whether mounting political tensions with Moscow could complicate the bank's deal to sell the majority of its global physical oil trading operations to Russia's largest oil producer. The Wall Street bank agreed to the sale in December before Russia launched an incursion into Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.It recently submitted the transaction for review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), an inter-agency executive branch panel that examines foreign investment for potential threats to national security.

223,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK After more than a year of scaling back in commodities, Morgan Stanley is ready to expand.The Wall Street bank plans to hire about a dozen traders, sales staff and other professionals in the United States. It's building up commodities trading and financing businesses that can profit despite tougher regulations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.""The moves that we've made are in large part because we looked at these businesses through a new capital lens,"" said one executive involved in the business's strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""That's just the reality of life on Wall Street these days.""For example, Morgan Stanley is looking at making more loans to energy producers and sell more commodity-linked products to retail investors, the sources told Reuters.Commodities trading was big for Morgan Stanley before the financial crisis. Revenue from the business rose from $580 million in 2000 to $1.9 billion in 2007, according to estimates by Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz. Since then, commodities trading has come under pressure at big banks as funding costs have risen and regulators have clamped on their ability to make bets with their own money.Right now, Morgan Stanley has about 310 sales, trading and other ""front office"" professionals in its commodities business. The dozen or so people it is hiring will only partially offset the 100 employees it will lose when and if it sells its physical oil merchanting business to the Russian oil giant Rosneft. After the deal, Morgan Stanley will still act as an intermediary between clients and physical oil markets, but will be rid of its own network of storage and transportation assets.Morgan Stanley is selling its physical oil assets as the Federal Reserve is conducting a review of banks' involvement in commodities markets. To some regulators, physical commodities represent a big risk: an operational problem, like an oil spill on an offshore rig, could lead to huge reputational damage and crater the bank's stock, potentially destabilizing it and the broader financial system. It is not clear how much pressure the Fed will apply to banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc,. But Morgan Stanley decided that these units would not earn enough anyway, relative to the amount of capital the bank would have to put toward maintaining them under new rules, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. ""We're not looking at revenue for revenue's sake, we're looking at what's the most vibrant...business unto itself,"" Porat said.Other commodities businesses look more attractive now. Structured products, for example, which typically use derivatives to allow clients to bet on market movements or reduce their risk, are expected to be a growth area, the sources said. Renewable energy startups have also been using structured products to exchange tax incentives for financing. Morgan Stanley also sees opportunities to use the clients and deposits it has in its massive brokerage business to boost commodities revenue. Executives plan to sell more commodity-linked derivatives to wealthy investor clients, and also plan to use deposits at Morgan Stanley's bank to fund energy deals and loans to energy companies.HIRING MODE Managing directors in charge of different commodities businesses recently sent strategic business plans to Simon Greenshields in New York and Colin Bryce in London, who jointly run Morgan Stanley's commodity business globally, as well as Colm Kelleher, who runs the broader institutional securities business, two people familiar with the matter said.In those plans, the executives had to forecast revenue growth down to products and individual clients, and explain how each division planned to get there, the second source said. They also made hiring requests, most of which were approved.Morgan Stanley has expanded its Houston office -- which previously housed investment bankers -- to accommodate the growing staff in other businesses. After coming close to failing during the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley is now focused on cutting its risk. The bank said on Thursday that less than half of its revenue came from businesses like bond trading and stock underwriting, a far cry from the pre-crisis era, when the institutional securities unit could account for 70 percent of the bank's revenue in a quarter. Morgan Stanley's review of its commodities business comes as rivals including Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays PLC have pulled back from the sector. But the post-crisis changes have been starkest for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the top two commodities players on Wall Street since at least the 1990s. The physical businesses and the proprietary trading that went along with them contributed a substantial part of their earnings when markets were more robust.Lately, markets have not moved enough for customers to have much interest in using commodities derivatives to cut their risk-- light trading volumes have made trading businesses hard to sustain.

The Dutch company said last month that it would create the division by merging its light-emitting diodes (LEDs) business Lumileds and its automotive lighting businesses, which have combined sales of about $1.8 billion.Philips has said the business would be better placed to compete on a standalone basis for outside customers which currently regard the Philips group as a rival. Profit figures for the business have not been made public but one of the sources said that the margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over sales was roughly 20 percent.Peers like Cree (CREE.O) or Acuity (AYI.N) trade at 11.2 and 12.6 times their expected earnings respectively. Based on a similar multiple, the Philips unit could be valued at more than $4 billion in equity and debt.  Philips has already received interest from private equity players. The process, which is due to kick off after the summer, may or may not lead to a stake sale to financial investors, the people said, adding that all options are currently still on the table including a stock market listing.

238,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, July 29  NEW YORK, July 29 BP Plc , Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Morgan Stanley and other companies urged a U.S. judge to dismiss nationwide litigation claiming they conspired for 12 years to fix prices of Brent crude oil, a benchmark for the cost of gasoline and heating oil.In papers filed on Monday night in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the defendants said there was no evidence they colluded to manipulate spot prices or intended to do so, in violation of U.S. commodity and antitrust laws.They also said that because the alleged manipulation took place outside the United States and was governed by foreign law, U.S. courts had no authority to handle the case to begin with.""Threadbare"" and ""conclusory"" allegations made by the plaintiffs are ""wholly untethered to any defendant's conduct,"" the defendants said. ""The complaint thus fails to adequately allege price artificiality in any market.""The plaintiffs include futures and derivatives traders and firms who allege the manipulation resulted in unfavorable prices on the oil they traded.They sued after European Commission investigators in May 2013 raided offices of BP, Shell, the London bureau of pricing service Platts and others over suspected oil and biofuel price manipulation. The plaintiffs seek class-action status, compensatory damages and triple damages.David Kovel, a Kirby McInerney partner representing the plaintiffs, on Tuesday said his clients are reviewing and will respond to the defendants' filings.Brent crude is a North Sea oil benchmark used to price roughly two-thirds of the world's crude oil supplies. According to the complaint, the defendants deliberately submitted false prices, ""spoof"" orders and transactions with ""aberrant"" pricing to Platts, which is owned by McGraw Hill Financial Inc and used by traders around the world.The defendants were also accused of conducting ""wash sales"" that moved prices without exposing participants to market risk.Among the other defendants are Norway's Statoil ASA  ; Switzerland-based energy trading firm Vitol SA; a trading unit of Switzerland's Mercuria Energy Group Ltd; and Hess Energy Trading Co, a joint venture between Hess Corp  and two former Goldman Sachs partners. Part of their argument for dismissal is based on a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that emphasized a presumption against using U.S. law to police foreign conduct.""Brent crude oil is sourced from the North Sea and traded overseas, and Platts makes its reports from London,"" the defendants said. ""Plaintiffs' winding causal theory - starting in a foreign oil market, going through a foreign price reporting agency, and then ending in diverse futures and physical oil markets - does nothing to change that.""The plaintiffs said they conducted their trades on U.S. exchanges including the New York Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange, and incurred liability domestically.Platts is not a defendant.The case is In re: North Sea Brent Crude Oil Futures Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-md-02475.

242,"   By Taiga Uranaka | TOKYO  TOKYO Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) (8306.T) reported a far milder quarterly profit decline than its main banking rivals as aggressive overseas expansion dulled the impact of perennially weak loan demand at home.MUFG on Thursday said net profit slid 5.8 percent in April-June. Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG) (8316.T), however, suffered double-digit percentage falls, primarily because the value of shares the banks own grew at a slower rate than a year earlier.Japan's biggest lender by assets, which owns about one-fifth of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N), has been the more active of the three ""megabanks"" in overseas markets in recent years.

One element of Abenomics involved the central bank buying Japanese government bonds (JGBs), a measure aimed at ending a decade of deflation. Buying JGBs increased the supply of money and so brought down the cost of borrowing, simulating loan demand.

The bank has bet its future in large part on its wealth management business, which produces more stable revenue than the trading unit that nearly wiped out Morgan Stanley during the financial crisis. Providing unconventional loans is a reliable way to win customers, and keep them. Morgan Stanley is playing catch-up against rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, which offer loans collateralized by everything from art collections to cases of wine.Industry sources said they had never heard of a loan against a lottery ticket, though they cited other examples of atypical collateral that other banks have loaned against, including a client in Texas who borrowed against the future offspring of his prize bulls, and a client who borrowed against future ticket sales of a professional sports team he owned.    ""We've got 3 million clients, and they've got borrowing needs,"" Eric Heaton, who runs Morgan Stanley's private bank, said in an interview.Reuters attempted to track down the Lotto winner by the description provided by sources familiar with the matter but was unable to confirm his identity. Tailored loans are lucrative for the bank, which can help Morgan Stanley reach its profitability targets for wealth management. Morgan Stanley's pretax profit margin target is 22 percent to 25 percent by the end of next year, compared with a current level of 20.6 percent, assuming interest rates do not rise.To spearhead Morgan Stanley's efforts to build up what it calls ""tailored lending,"" the bank hired a team from Deutsche Bank led by Marcus Mitchell.

SMITH BARNEY   Morgan Stanley spent billions of dollars buying the Smith Barney retail brokerage business from Citigroup between 2009 and 2013, and adding it to its own wealth management unit. In public presentations, executives have continually trumpeted the reliable earnings that wealth management offers, as opposed to businesses like trading, where profit can oscillate wildly. Investment management and retail brokerage accounted for about 30 percent to 40 percent of the bank's quarterly revenue in 2007, a figure that grew to more than half in the second quarter of 2014.As its lending effort has gotten under way over the past year or two, Morgan Stanley has about $2 billion of tailored loans outstanding, which now account for about 5 percent of the total loans outstanding at its wealth management unit.Heaton and other executives who spoke to Reuters said they expect tailored lending to remain a relatively small sliver of the wealth management unit's loans. Mortgages in contrast account for about a third of loans at the unit. But tailored loans can be much more profitable-- for some, banks can earn 7.5 percentage points more than their funding costs, said one adviser at a rival firm, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Morgan Stanley said its profits are much lower on the loans. But even if the bank's margins on these loans are less than 7.5 percent, industry experts said they are likely much higher than margins on mortgages, which tend to be one percentage point or less. The wider margins on tailored loans come in part because the loans are so unique. Morgan Stanley mitigates its risk by making sure it has access to collateral that can be sold quickly to recoup the cost of the loan, or that loans have a guarantor with enough assets to repay. It hires appraisers to assess the value of assets it is lending against.Wealth management clients can borrow against one-of-a-kind assets like rare coins, but tailored loans can also be for assets like commercial real estate, which make up about a quarter of Morgan Stanley's tailored loan book.

Since 2009, Moats served as head of Morgan Stanley's Chicago Merc office, where he oversaw 170 financial advisers who produced $180 million in annual revenue, according to a Ziegler spokeswoman. Moats left Morgan Stanley in June, according to registration records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley confirmed Moats' departure and said Kevin Forman had replaced him as complex manager for the Chicago Merc office in May. Forman was previously Morgan Stanley's director of the Heartland Region in charge of several states in the U.S. Midwest, including Illinois.In April, Forman's position was eliminated in a restructuring plan launched by managing director Shelley O'Connor. The plan was meant to shrink the company's three geographic divisions in the United States to two and to trim the regions that report to the division heads to eight from 12 .

253,"   By Robert Smith  LONDON, Aug 7 (IFR) - Morgan Stanley has poached Jane Bushey from Deutsche Bank to head up its high-yield capital markets business in Europe, according to sources.Bushey, who was promoted to managing director earlier this year, was at Deutsche Bank for 14 years and has 12 years leveraged finance experience. She began her career in the bank's  New York office, but moved to London four years ago. Bushey will join Morgan Stanley in November after a period of gardening leave, and will report to Ian Gilday and Matt Naber, the co-heads of the European leveraged and acquisition finance team. Gilday is a recent addition to Morgan Stanley, having joined the bank last month. He was Goldman Sachs' former head of EMEA syndicate and leveraged capital markets, but prior to his move to Morgan Stanley took on a new role as head of origination for collateralised loan obligations in EMEA. Gilday filled the whole left by Mark Walsh's departure last year. Walsh left his role as co-head of European leveraged finance and acquisition finance at Morgan Stanley in August 2013 to take up a new position at Credit Suisse.

254,"  SYDNEY Aug 13 Australia's Victoria state said on Wednesday it has hired Morgan Stanley to sell the lease for the Port of Melbourne, the country's largest container and general cargo port, in a deal local media estimated may fetch A$6 billion ($5.57 billion).The country's governments are hoping to raise some A$130 billion by selling state-owned infrastructure in the next two years and Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, hopes to raise A$27 billion by selling assets.In May, Morgan Stanley sold New South Wales state's Port of Newcastle, the world's largest coal export terminal, to China's China Merchants [CNMGP.UL} and locally based Hastings Funds Management for A$1.75 billion, double the amount widely expected.Hiring Morgan Stanley was ""an important step in securing the best value for Victorians through a medium-term lease of the Port of Melbourne,"" state treasurer Michael O'Brien said in a statement without specifying how long the lease will be. ""It is absolutely critical that we receive the best quality commercial advice when considering a lease of this size and scale."" The state also hired corporate adviser Flagstaff Partners and law firm Minter Ellison to manage the deal. The advisers will conduct project management, due diligence, valuation and asset preparation for the sale, the statement said without giving a target valuation for the asset.The sale process will start in 2015, it added. Last year, NSW sold Port Botany and Port Kembla for A$5 billion. The Queensland state government has said it hopes to sell its Townsville and Gladstone ports if it wins an election in 2015.(1 US dollar = 1.0775 Australian dollar)   (Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-08-13,MS,"Wed Aug 13, 2014 | 1:53am EDT",Australia's Victoria state hires Morgan Stanley to sell port,http://www.reuters.com//article/privatisation-ports-australia-idUSL4N0QJ27V20140813?type=companyNews

""We're trying to change the image of pachinko as loud, smoke-ridden and male-dominated,"" said Tomoko Murouchi, a spokeswoman for one of the largest operators, Dynam Japan Holdings.Dynam, which has 371 pachinko parlors around Japan, is building new game centers with higher ceilings, smoke-free zones and ventilators, with dividers between machines for privacy.Rival Maruhan Corp, Japan's largest pachinko chain by money wagered, has tried opening buffets at parlors and promoting a new kind of pachinko, but has recently shifted focus back to existing players, said spokesman Kenjiro Shimoda.'COME ALONE AND FOCUS'  More than half of Dynam's customers are older than 50, with just 9 percent younger than 30.

Although women make up just 27 percent of players at Dynam's parlors, Marina Osada, a clerical worker, said she played pachinko three times a week, sometimes for the entire day when she was off work.""I still remember the day I hit a jackpot and saw a very rare ― the best ― scene from the anime 'Basilisk'. I was so happy,"" said Osada, 21, who looks for machines that feature her favorite anime.""Pachinko used to be just for men, but I like pachinko. I come alone, and just focus."" Pachinko revenues are falling as Japan’s population ages.Gross revenue has shrunk to 19 trillion yen ($185.75 billion) from 31 trillion over the past two decades, and the number of players halved between 2002 and 2012, research by investment bank Morgan Stanley shows.Part of the problem has been a 15-year economic slump just ending. Spending on all kinds of leisure has dropped by almost a third over the past 20 years, but the number of players per machine has roughly halved since 2000 to stand at just over two in 2012, Morgan Stanley estimates.Japan's moves to legalize casino resorts could force pachinko out of the gray zone where it has thrived for decades. It faces no gaming taxes, since it is not treated as gambling, which is illegal, but is viewed instead as an amusement.Pachinko began as a children’s toy in the 1920s, which gained popularity among adults after World War Two. Machines spew out winnings in the form of small metal balls. Most players opt to swap winnings for cash, with 87 percent of players at Dynam going this route.Maruhan and Dynam have fared better than the rest of the industry, which is dominated by family-owned firms. Maruhan’s annual revenue after payouts was about 80 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March, up about 16 percent from 2012.

Representatives for Shake Shack, Union Square Hospitality, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Shake Shack would likely be the most-followed IPO out of a string of casual dining chains that have gone public this year. They include El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc (LOCO.O), Zoe's Kitchen Inc (ZOES.N) and Papa Murphy's Holdings Inc (FRSH.O). Shake Shack is present in many U.S. states including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida and Massachusetts. It has also expanded internationally in cities such as London, Istanbul, Moscow and Dubai.The company does not franchise and says it has no plans to do so in the future. Shake Shack's chief executive is Randy Garutti, a Cornell University graduate who worked his way up at Union Square Hospitality from general manager at its restaurants to lead Shake Shack. Union Square Hospitality was founded by restaurateur Danny Meyer in 1985. It also runs other popular New York eateries, including Blue Smoke, Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe.Private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP agreed to acquire a 39.5 percent stake Union Square Hospitality in 2012 for an undisclosed amount.

268,"  (Refiles to add Aug 26 in dateline)By Suzanne BarlynAug 26 Charles Schwab Corp. has lost a $15 million arbitration case against Morgan Stanley, which it accused of improperly recruiting brokers from a Schwab San Francisco branch who left with confidential information.The ruling by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel in San Francisco, dated Monday, ends a two-year-long dispute.Schwab accused Morgan Stanley of maliciously organizing an ""actionable raid"" of the branch. Schwab also accused Morgan Stanley of inducing Schwab brokers to breach their contracts.Claims involving the practice of so-called ""raiding"" are typically made when a firm loses 30 percent to 40 percent of the production, the amount brokers generate in revenue during a year, from a branch office to another firm in one swoop or over a short period of time, according to lawyers. ""We strongly disagree with the panel's decision and are evaluating our legal options in this situation, a Schwab spokesman said. ""The claims in this case were compelling, including instances of taking proprietary information, manufacturing evidence, and operating a steady raid on staff and clients resulting in significant damage to Schwab.""A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment on the ruling and did not immediately respond to requests to comment on Schwab's statement. While the arbitrators denied Schwab's claims, they ordered Morgan Stanley to pay Schwab $72,000 in sanctions. The three-member panel, as is customary, did not provide reasons for the decision.The ruling did not identify the brokers who left Schwab.Schwab has a reputation in the securities industry for  taking legal action against brokers and the firms that hire them, said Thomas Lewis, a lawyer in Lawrenceville, New Jersey who advises brokers about moving between firms. The cases typically arise against brokers who take clients' contact information or send out announcements about their affiliation with new firms, said Lewis, who was not involved in the case. Schwab can use that strategy because it does not participate in an industry agreement intended to minimize legal disputes when brokers switch firms, known as the Protocol for Broker Recruiting, Lewis said.The agreement allows brokers to bring very limited information when switching firms, but only if both firms involved in the transition participate. Details typically include client names, telephone numbers and email addresses.Schwab, last month, filed a lawsuit in a Seattle federal court against former Schwab adviser Christopher Canorro and the firm he started in May, Basilica Wealth Management in Bainbridge Island, Washington. Canorro, whose firm employs two other former Schwab advisers, breached contracts with Schwab, in part, by taking confidential client information, Schwab said in its complaint.""Schwab's claim is a strategy of intimidation designed to protect its parochial business model at the expense of fair competition,"" said Clinton Marrs, Canorro's lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. ""There are no merits and we are confident that the court will agree.""

275,"   By Anshuman Daga, Soyoung Kim and Mike Stone | SINGAPORE/NEW YORK  SINGAPORE/NEW YORK Australia's Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) and Japan's Orix Corp (8591.T) are among a handful of companies exploring binding offers for the $5 billion aircraft portfolio being sold by Dublin-based lessor Awas, people familiar with the matter said.Macquarie's aircraft leasing subsidiary Macquarie AirFinance, and Orix Aviation, part of the Japanese financial group, are set to compete against other Asian parties bidding for the asset, including Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd (0001.HK), which has previously confirmed its interest.Other bidders include Hong Kong Aviation Capital, which is owned by China's HNA Group and Bohai Leasing Co. Ltd (000415.SZ), and SMBC Aviation Capital - part of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (8316.T), according to the people familiar with the matter.Awas [AWASA.UL], one of the world's biggest aircraft lessors and owned by British private equity firm Terra Firma, plans to seek second-round bids in late September with the hope of finalizing a deal by next month, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.The companies' interest underscores strong demand for aircraft assets from Asian buyers, at a time when the region has become the world's fastest-growing market as Asian airlines tap into the spending power of travelers.Representatives for Macquarie, Hong Kong Aviation Capital, Orix, SMBC Aviation Capital and Terra Firma all declined comment. Cheung Kong, controlled by Asian tycoon Li Ka-shing, said last month it had submitted a preliminary bid for the aircraft portfolio. Terra Firma has hired Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) to explore exit options for Awas, which has about 300 planes on lease to more than 100 airlines, including Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) and LATAM Airlines LAN.SN.The company is looking to sell newer aircraft for around $5 billion, while exploring an initial public offering for the remaining portfolio of older planes that could be worth about $8 billion, Reuters reported in July. Bidders are drawn to the sector's strong returns and that the investment is secured against an underlying mobile asset, people familiar with the process said. Access to cheap funding and the potential for huge industry growth in Asia has driven expansion plans of Asian companies. New airlines coming up to meet growth in emerging markets are increasingly looking to rent planes from the leasing industry, which is currently estimated to have aircraft portfolios worth $200 billion.Asian players have muscled into the aircraft leasing industry in recent years. Leasing arms of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), Bank of China (601988.SS), and China Development Bank [CHDB.UL] have already emerged as significant global players.Acquisitions by SMFG and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T) have helped these groups also gain a global footprint. In the process, they have taken on the world's two biggest lessors, GECAS, a unit of General Electric Co (GE.N), and International Lease Finance Corp, now part of AerCap (AER.N).Another Dublin-based aircraft leasing firm that has been exploring a sale, Avolon, has also attracted Asian interest. China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, teamed up with state-owned aerospace and defense company, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, are in talks to buy Avolon, Reuters previously reported. Terra Firma bought Awas from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in 2006 for $2.5 billion and a year later acquired rival Pegasus for $5.2 billion, merging the groups to create the world's third-largest plane lessor.For Terra Firma, which is run by British financier Guy Hands, Awas is one of its largest investments. CPPIB, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, also owns a significant minority stake.

280,"  FRANKFURT, Sept 5 New Zealand's packaging firm Reynolds has selected several private equity groups but no peers to participate in the second round of bidding for its Swiss subsidiary SIG Combibloc, several people familiar with the deal told Reuters.Reynolds, backed by New Zealand's richest man, Graeme Hart, is exploring a sale of the world's second-largest maker of drink cartons as it tries to trim debt it has accumulated through leveraged buyouts. It has mandated Goldman Sachs to organise the sale.A consortium comprising CVC and Onex, as well as buyout groups BC Partners, Bain and Partners Group are among those invited to management presentations after handing in bids above the 'cut-off price' of just under 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion), the sources said. Final bids are due next month.China's Greatview, one of the few strategic groups which had looked at the asset, is no longer taking part in the auction, one of the sources added. SIG, which Hart acquired for $2.3 billion in 2007, has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around $500 million and had been expected to fetch about 10 times that amount in a potential deal.Representatives for Reynolds, SIG and Greatview did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while CVC, Onex, BC Partners, Bain and Partners Group declined to comment. A sale of Switzerland-based SIG is part of Hart's efforts to reduce the $18 billion debt pile his packaging empire built up in an acquisition spree. Those deals included the $6 billion acquisition of Pactiv, the maker of Hefty trash bags, in 2010, and the $4.5 billion takeover of plastic container producer Graham Packaging in 2011.

The source declined to detail terms of the deal, such as the number of shares that could be sold or an indicative price range.Efforts to reach Atento for comment were unsuccessful. Bain bought Atento from Telefonica SA (TEF.MC), Europe's biggest telecommunications carrier, in 2012 for about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) including debt. Atento was founded in 1999 when Telefonica grouped its call center business in Spain and other Latin American countries into a separate unit.  In May, the company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions for a $300 million IPO, although that amount is commonly used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the offering could be different.

282,"   By Stephen Aldred | HONG KONG, Sept 8  HONG KONG, Sept 8 When stock researcher Anonymous Analytics accused China's Tianhe Chemicals  last week of doctoring the books ahead of a Hong Kong IPO, it was pitting itself against one of Asia's top private equity firms, Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia.The Morgan Stanley private equity unit put up $300 million for a minority stake in Tianhe in 2012 after spending over $2 million on third-party diligence work over a three-year period, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. Tianhe represents its biggest equity investment in Asia, while the bank itself was one of the underwriters of the IPO in June.Industry insiders say the amount is unusually high for diligence work.""Diligence of that level would usually involve deep checks on the company's financials, its production facilities and its customer base,"" said the source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.Anonymous Analytics, on the other hand, says it conducted all of its investigations using publicly available information, most of it posted online, combined with a few visits to the offices of Tianhe customers in Shanghai.But if the accusations by Anonymous turn out to be true, besides facing potential losses, the scale of the fraud will represent a huge loss of face for the Morgan Stanley firm, which manages mostly third party money such as U.S. pension funds, and has invested around $2.5 billion in over 50 investments in Asia.Although Tianhe's shares have been targeted by short-sellers for weeks, Anonymous said it had not gained from the transactions and had issued the report for the public good.It said last Monday that the Chinese industrial firm, which last had a market capitalisation of $8 billion, falsely reported on its tax statements and provided falsified documents to its auditor, Deloitte. The report also said Tianhe does not make the revenues it claims.Tianhe has denied the charges. The company requested a trading halt after its shares fell 5 percent on Tuesday, which is still in force.Morgan Stanley has not commented on Anonymous' allegations. Sources who have business relations with the Morgan Stanley private equity firm have told Reuters that it considers Tianhe to be the jewel in its crown and that the investment was agreed after two and a half years of negotiations with the company chairman.An industry insider said deep diligence on a company would extend to visits to customer's offices and face-to-face meetings. It could also involve the use of private investigators or external auditors to check the reputation and business history of the company's principals.""It depends how many subjects you look into, and how deep you go, but it's rare to get a diligence of this size,"" said the insider, who added that the usual cost for investigation of a company in China would be up to around $150,000.Anonymous Analytics did not respond to e-mailed questions requesting information about their spending.""It's strong on documents and documentation, but what it lacks is on the ground in mainland China; they didn't send someone to go visit factories or observe the factories, measure production levels, talk to customers, suppliers and competitors,"" said Jon Carnes, founder of Alfredlittle.com, one of the most successful short research houses targeting Chinese firms. PATCHY RECORD Carnes said he usually spends around $100,000-$200,000 researching a given company before deciding whether to target it with a report or not.And while Anonymous has a patchy record of success with its reports, Morgan Stanley's unit has never made a loss on a China investment in over 20 years of deals, a record that is the envy of peers who have suffered reputational and financial damage from claims of fraud at their China portfolio companies.Its past investments include Ping An Insurance Group  and Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd , which is seen as a textbook case of the profits that can be made by buying out overseas-listed China companies, then relisting them closer to home. Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia (MSPEA) is the largest institutional investor in Tianhe, with 8.6 percent of the company's stock, according to Thomson Reuters data, and the bank also has 27 percent of the MSPEA fund which invested in Tianhe.It has also effectively double dipped on the deal as a sponsor of Tianhe's $654 million Hong Kong IPO, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS. All three sponsors can be held liable under Hong Kong law if the IPO prospectus is proved to be fraudulent.Sources have told Reuters that MSPEA actively promoted the Tianhe investment when it was raising its fourth and biggest Asia fund of $1.7 billion.Homer Sun, MSPEA's chief investment officer and head of its China investments team, sits on the Tianhe board as a non-executive director, along with specialists whose background includes stints at Dupont, Conoco and Standard Oil.Morgan Stanley's Asia private equity unit has even invested in stocks targeted by shortsellers in the past.In 2012, at the height of a shortselling frenzy targeting U.S.-listed China companies, MSPEA invested $50 million in fertilizer company Yongye International, which had been accused of fraud by shortsellers.The Morgan Stanley investment saw Yongye's stock soar around 40 percent in one day. It subsequently fell back, but the accusations faded, and MSPEA later tried to buy out the company.Anonymous Analytics has published reports critical of other Chinese companies in the past, including Huabao International , Qihu 360 and Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings, though investors shrugged off allegations made against Qihu and Huabao.Sources could not be named as they were not authorised to speak to media.

Anonymous Analytics, on the other hand, says it conducted all of its investigations using publicly available information, most of it posted online, combined with a few visits to the offices of Tianhe customers in Shanghai.But if the accusations by Anonymous turn out to be true, besides facing potential losses, the scale of the fraud will represent a huge loss of face for the Morgan Stanley firm, which manages mostly third party money such as U.S. pension funds, and has invested around $2.5 billion in over 50 investments in Asia.Although Tianhe's shares have been targeted by short-sellers for weeks, Anonymous said it had not gained from the transactions and had issued the report for the public good.It said last Monday that the Chinese industrial firm, which last had a market capitalization of $8 billion, falsely reported on its tax statements and provided falsified documents to its auditor, Deloitte. The report also said Tianhe does not make the revenues it claims. Tianhe has denied the charges. The company requested a trading halt after its shares fell 5 percent on Tuesday, which is still in force.Morgan Stanley has not commented on Anonymous' allegations.Sources who have business relations with the Morgan Stanley private equity firm have told Reuters that it considers Tianhe to be the jewel in its crown and that the investment was agreed after two and a half years of negotiations with the company chairman.  An industry insider said deep diligence on a company would extend to visits to customer's offices and face-to-face meetings. It could also involve the use of private investigators or external auditors to check the reputation and business history of the company's principals.""It depends how many subjects you look into, and how deep you go, but it's rare to get a diligence of this size,"" said the insider, who added that the usual cost for investigation of a company in China would be up to around $150,000. Anonymous Analytics did not respond to e-mailed questions requesting information about their spending.""It's strong on documents and documentation, but what it lacks is on the ground in mainland China; they didn't send someone to go visit factories or observe the factories, measure production levels, talk to customers, suppliers and competitors,"" said Jon Carnes, founder of Alfredlittle.com, one of the most successful short research houses targeting Chinese firms. PATCHY RECORD Carnes said he usually spends around $100,000-$200,000 researching a given company before deciding whether to target it with a report or not. And while Anonymous has a patchy record of success with its reports, Morgan Stanley's unit has never made a loss on a China investment in over 20 years of deals, a record that is the envy of peers who have suffered reputational and financial damage from claims of fraud at their China portfolio companies. Its past investments include Ping An Insurance Group (601318.SS) and Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd (0460.HK), which is seen as a textbook case of the profits that can be made by buying out overseas-listed China companies, then relisting them closer to home. Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia (MSPEA) is the largest institutional investor in Tianhe, with 8.6 percent of the company's stock, according to Thomson Reuters data, and the bank also has 27 percent of the MSPEA fund which invested in Tianhe.It has also effectively double dipped on the deal as a sponsor of Tianhe's $654 million Hong Kong IPO, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and UBS UBSN.VX. All three sponsors can be held liable under Hong Kong law if the IPO prospectus is proved to be fraudulent. Sources have told Reuters that MSPEA actively promoted the Tianhe investment when it was raising its fourth and biggest Asia fund of $1.7 billion. Homer Sun, MSPEA's chief investment officer and head of its China investments team, sits on the Tianhe board as a non-executive director, along with specialists whose background includes stints at Dupont, Conoco and Standard Oil.Morgan Stanley's Asia private equity unit has even invested in stocks targeted by shortsellers in the past.In 2011, at the height of a shortselling frenzy targeting U.S.-listed China companies, MSPEA invested $50 million in fertilizer company Yongye International, which had been accused of fraud by shortsellers. The Morgan Stanley investment saw Yongye's stock soar around 40 percent in one day. It subsequently fell back, but the accusations faded. In July this year, MSPEA was part of a consortium that bought out the company.Anonymous Analytics has published reports critical of other Chinese companies in the past, including Huabao International (0336.HK), Qihu 360 QIHU.N and Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings (0682.HK), though investors shrugged off allegations made against Qihu and Huabao.Sources could not be named as they were not authorised to speak to media.(The story corrects para 24 to read 2011 (not 2012) and para 25 to say MSPEA was part of a consortium that bought Yongye this year.)

A JP Morgan spokeswoman confirmed that the broker had worked there but declined to comment on his departure. Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment on Risch's hire. The company does not always publicly announce new hires. However, Reuters records of Morgan Stanley's recent hires show several high-producing brokers joined Morgan Stanley in late August. Including Risch, the company hired seven brokers who managed a combined $1.9 billion and produced $9.5 million in annual revenue at their previous employers, according to Reuters records of Morgan Stanley hires.

287,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has agreed to pay $95 million to resolve a lawsuit accusing the Wall Street bank of misleading investors in mortgage-backed securities in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis.The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed Monday in New York federal court, follows years of litigation by investors over allegedly false and misleading statements over the soured securities.The deal stemmed from a lawsuit pursued by the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi (MissPERS) and the West Virginia Investment Management Board.The plaintiffs accused Morgan Stanley of violating U.S. securities law in packaging and selling mortgage backed securities in 13 offerings in 2006 and 16 offerings in 2007.In the years since the litigation began in 2008, the plaintiffs were dealt a series of setbacks by U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain who dismissed various claims due to  standing and timeliness. After a ruling in May that dismissed claims brought by some of the plaintiffs, Morgan Stanley said MissPERS had become the lone named plaintiff to have purchased securities in the only remaining offering at issue in the case.Morgan Stanley said Aug. 5 it had made agreements in principle to settle three class action lawsuits in New York, including the one detailed Monday. In relation to those agreements, it decided to boost its provisions for legal expenses by $53 million. Morgan Stanley did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

290,"   By Edward McAllister and Anna Louie Sussman | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley's unorthodox plan to export U.S. compressed natural gas could give the Wall Street bank quick access to emerging Caribbean markets - if it can find a way to ship the fuel in bulk after decades of other failed attempts.A Morgan Stanley subsidiary in May applied for a license to export CNG from Freeport in Texas, one of the only applications of its kind in the United States. The plan, at an initial cost of $200 million, is to load pressurized containers up to 40 feet in length filled with CNG onto ships for export.The potential is clear. Gas compression stations are cheaper, faster to build and face a less stringent regulatory process than multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants that use giant refrigerators to chill gas to a liquid for export. CNG from the United States could be cheaper for Caribbean consumers than domestic fuel oil or LNG. CNG has for decades been used to power garbage trucks and bus fleets in U.S. cities from New York to Los Angeles. Cleaner burning than gasoline and now cheaper thanks to a domestic drilling boom, its use in transport is on the rise in the United States. But for all CNG's popularity on land, shipping it overseas has proven problematic. The number of containers and ships required to ship meaningful volumes of CNG could make an export project cumbersome and even economically prohibitive in the long term, experts said. Short-haul CNG transport could make sense in specific circumstances, but for now LNG plants remain more feasible for exporting gas from the United States. ""The cost of avoiding the U.S. regulatory hurdles only make CNG at best a short-term play until some long-term and less- costly solutions are found - a spot market, if you like,"" said Gordon Pickering, director of energy at Navigant consultants. PREVIOUS EFFORTS  Columbia Natural Gas of Ohio experimented with CNG  shipments in the late 1960s before aborting the program because it was too expensive. Since then, private companies like Calgary-based Sea NG Corporation and Houston-based EnerSea Transport have been developing ways to ship CNG by tanker. A number of pilot programs are underway to ship small volumes of CNG.In June last year, Nova Scotia-based Emera applied for approval to ship CNG in containers from Florida to the Bahamas.The main problem for Morgan Stanley, and for CNG shipping in general, is the space the fuel takes up. While CNG is one hundred times more compact than natural gas, it is still six times less compact than LNG, limiting its effectiveness as a shipped fuel.Morgan Stanley, under the name of Wentworth Gas Marketing LLC, has applied to export just 166 million cubic feet of CNG per day, a tiny slice of the 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas produced each day in the United States. Wentworth is a Delaware company that shares a business address with Morgan Stanley Capital Group.     That means filling and loading between 330 and 550 specifically designed containers per day, according to Frank Haeberli, vice president of gas distribution at Hexagon Lincoln, one of the few firms that makes these kind of containers.While that is possible, compared with LNG it is an arduous process. One tanker of LNG can typically carry about 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas and can be loaded in less than a day.Potentially thousands of containers costing anywhere between $50,000 and $200,000 each will be needed, said one source familiar with Morgan Stanley's plans. Regular loadings would be required, as would constant supervision.""Who can handle all those containers of CNG? How are you going to move 200 of these things a day?"" said one shipping source said. ""I'm a fan of natural gas, but it just doesn't work. If it worked, we'd all be in it."" COST ADVANTAGE? Even so, nearby Caribbean countries with growing fuel needs have already expressed interest in importing some of the United States' abundant gas reserves as CNG to replace dirty, expensive fuel oil. Fuel oil at $20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) is more than five time more expensive that U.S. natural gas whose value has been depressed in recent years by ample supply.Shipping CNG from the U.S. to the Caribbean could be cheaper than both fuel oil and LNG, analysts said, although the price advantage could be cut by the cost of shipping. Ocean transport of  specially designed containers filled with natural gas could cost up to $3,500 per container, one shipping source said.Morgan Stanley declined to comment on supply deals in the works, but said in its May filing with the U.S. Department of Energy that it is targeting six countries in the Caribbean and Central America. One round trip in the Caribbean could take up to 15 days, one shipping source said.One advantage for Morgan Stanley over other smaller CNG players, however, is its balance sheet.""Money is the key,"" said Pat Malara, owner of Western Cascade, which makes LNG containers for transport on ships from the United States to Hawaii. ""The guys with the deepest pockets will be able to do it if they want.""

293,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley remains the world's biggest seller of managed accounts, in which customers pay a fee rather than trade-based commissions to have their assets managed, but it is phasing out a program that lets them choose among more than 300 actively managed mutual funds for their investments.As of July 1, the firm closed TRAK Fund Solution to new investors, saying they have better and more flexible opportunities in other fee-based programs that include the funds in TRAK. Existing customers can remain, but about 40 percent of their assets have moved since the company told its more than 17,000 brokers of the plan to shrink in May, said James Tracy, who runs Morgan Stanley's Consulting Group Wealth Advisory Solutions.""People are doing much more sophisticated things with their portfolios"" than investing only in mutual funds, he said.The move comes as major U.S. brokerage firms are tweaking their fast-growing managed account platforms to better unify pricing and reduce paperwork. Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch wealth management unit, for example, is merging more than five managed programs into a single Merrill One platform by the end of next year.Consolidation riles some brokers who have to explain the changes to clients, but the firms say improved managed account technology makes it easier for brokers to monitor client portfolios, reduce paperwork and spend more time servicing clients and meeting new prospects.  It also allows brokerage firms to standardize fees and discount limits across programs, whether customers invest on their own, give full discretion to a broker or use model portfolios created by a firm. Merrill One, for example, uses a single billing and fee process no matter how many management programs are used. Morgan Stanley expects to make some changes in its discounting and fee policies over the next two years, but will not announce anything until its budget process is complete by yearend, Tracy said.  TRAK Fund Solution was created in 1994 at Smith Barney, which Morgan Stanley purchased in full last year. Together with a companion program in which Morgan Stanley gets a management fee, TRAK had $34.7 billion of assets as of June 30, according to Cerulli Associates. The companion program remains open to new investors. Mutual fund advisory programs surpass all other types with $1 trillion of assets as of June 30. But they are more popular at discount brokerages and regional firms that focus on less affluent investors than do larger firms such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill.Those firms rank first and second respectively in total managed assets with a combined market share of 35 percent, or $1.3 trillion, but are ninth and tenth in mutual fund-only assets, according to Cerulli.  The biggest managed fund sponsors are Fidelity Investments, Ameriprise Financial and Edward Jones, with a 39 percent share among them.

297,"  (Adds details from Morgan Stanley)Sept 16 Magnum Hunter Resources Corp  said on Tuesday it will sell a stake in a natural gas gathering unit in U.S. Marcellus and Utica shale fields to the infrastructure investment unit of Morgan Stanley, giving the two co-ownership in the business valued at $1 billion.In addition, Morgan Stanley Infrastructure will also buy about 41 percent in Eureka Hunter from a unit of ArcLight Capital Partners LLC, a U.S. private equity company, for an unspecified amount.The U.S. shale boom has yielded multiple opportunities in natural gas for the bank. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley's commodities arm, which is unrelated to the infrastructure business, filed to build a compressed natural gas (CNG) export plant.Morgan Stanley Infrastructure, the U.S. bank's infrastructure investing arm, will pay Magnum Hunter, a U.S. oil and gas company, $65 million for a 6.5 percent stake in the Eureka Hunter gas gathering business.After the two separate transactions, Magnum Hunter and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure together would hold an equity interest of about 98 percent in Eureka Hunter. ""We have found a new equity partner ... which will allow this tremendous asset to grow and prosper in preparation for an anticipated MLP offering sometime next year,"" Gary Evans, Magnum Hunter's chief executive officer, said in a statement, referring to a master limited partnership.Morgan Stanley Infrastructure is part of Morgan Stanley Merchant Banking & Real Estate Investing, which is a division of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, an asset management business with $396 billion in assets, as of June 30, 2014.Morgan Stanley Infrastructure said in another statement it will partner with Eureka Hunter management and Magnum Hunter to expand operations, grow the customer base, and secure additional build-out opportunities. The Eureka Hunter gas gathering system uses a network of pipelines to transport dry and wet gas from wellheads to long-haul pipelines and processing plants.The system currently has more than 100 miles of pipeline in Ohio and West Virginia with interconnections to multiple processing plants and interstate pipelines. There are also more than 50 additional miles of additional pipeline under construction, most of which is scheduled for completion in 2014. In May, Morgan Stanley applied to the U.S. Department of Energy to build, own and operate a compression and container loading facility near Freeport, Texas, which will have capacity to ship 60 billion cubic feet a year of compressed natural gas.Under a wholly-owned subsidiary, Wentworth Gas Marketing LLC, the bank plans to ship compressed natural gas to countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements, including the Dominican Republic, Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica, according to the filing.The plant would be supplied by an intrastate Texas pipeline.Wentworth Gas Marketing and another company, Wentworth Compression LLC, are both wholly owned by Wentworth Holdings LLC, which is indirectly owned by Morgan Stanley. Wentworth is held and run by Morgan Stanley Capital Group, the Purchase, New York-based commodities arm of the bank.A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Our primary focus over the coming months will be to accelerate this momentum,"" the telecoms firm said in a statement. ""We have discussed this decision with our key shareholders. These shareholders expressed their clear preference to continue participating in the upside from the significant network investment made in recent years, which has only recently begun to manifest itself in the company's financial results.""Chief Financial Officer Richard Moat, part of a new management team appointed two years ago, said last month that while eircom had yet to see the positive impact of encouraging economic data flowing through to its numbers, they soon would. Data on Thursday showed Ireland's economy grew a whopping 7.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, the fastest growth rate in the euro zone, as employment jumped, exports rebounded and consumers began to spend again.The Irish telecoms company has had a chequered history with flotations.Its foray into privatisation in 1999 saw shares collapse after an initial public offering marketed as a one-way bet to the Irish public. It was bought out two years later by a  consortium led by former Irish media tycoon Tony O'Reilly. It built up its unsustainable debts during a series of changes of ownership and briefly refloated in 2004, again lasting two years before delisting as Ireland's credit-fuelled boom ran out of steam and a financial crisis enveloped it.After filing for creditor protection to restructure 3.75 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of debt in 2012, eircom was taken over by its senior lenders - including 24-percent shareholder, U.S. buyout firm Blackstone.The examinership - akin to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in the United States and administration in Britain - was the largest in Irish corporate history and saw nearly all of the company's junior debt wiped out.($1 = 0.7790 Euros)   (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by David Clarke)",2014-09-19,MS,"Fri Sep 19, 2014 | 1:01pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Ireland's eircom decides against public listing for now,http://www.reuters.com//article/eircom-ipo-idUSL6N0RK49820140919?type=companyNews

305,"  Morgan Stanley (MS.N) needs to further restructure its fixed-income, commodity and currency (FICC) business to generate return on equity of more than 10 percent, brokerage J.P. Morgan Cazenove said.The bank has been shrinking the business to ward off threats from new capital rules, a reduction in risk-taking by clients and changes to the way derivatives are traded.Revenue from FICC fell 12.3 percent to $1 billion in the latest quarter. In contrast, revenue from wealth management rose 5 percent to $3.72 billion. Analyst Kian Abouhossein said Morgan Stanley's FICC division does not have the scale to generate adequate return on equity and downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight.""    ""Every dollar of freed up capital is more valuable to shareholders than being tied up in the low returns fixed income business."" Abouhossein said in a note to clients.Morgan Stanley has been reshaping its business after coming close to failing during the financial crisis. The investment bank has been increasingly relying on its retail brokerage and investment management businesses, which tend to generate more stable earnings and are less likely to unravel during market calamities. Morgan Stanley's shares were down less than 1 percent at $34.76 in afternoon trade on Wednesday. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had gained about 11 percent this year.

Rosneft declined official comment.Rosneft agreed to buy the unit in December. Since then, the United States and the European Union have slapped wide-ranging sanctions on Russia's energy and military sectors to punish Moscow for its incursion into Ukraine.

Rosneft itself was added to the list in July.Rosneft has enough cash to buy the Morgan Stanley unit, which sources said carries a price tag of between $300 million to $400 million.

320,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Greg Roumeliotis  Morgan Stanley is embracing the financial reforms intended to curb its animal spirits to generate bigger profits.Unlike most of its rivals, Morgan Stanley has been building its private equity business using structures that are subject to the Volcker rule, which restricts the amount of money a bank and its employees can contribute to such funds. This, in turn, limits their profit-sharing and, some would argue, their alignment with investors' interests.For Morgan Stanley, the sixth biggest U.S. bank by assets, putting less capital into private equity funds makes sense, people familiar with the bank's strategy said. Under Chief Executive James Gorman, 56, managing clients' wealth has replaced businesses like bond trading and principal investing as the prime supplier of profits. Collecting steady fees without risking much money is more aligned with Gorman's goals than investing alongside clients with the potential of bigger rewards.""The private equity business is the best business model in financial services, hands down,"" said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co, who covers banks and private equity firms. ""People think of it as a risky business but it's not really. Come hell or high water, you're going to collect your base management fee.""This year, Morgan Stanley has been tapping its network of institutional and individual investors to raise several new funds. In addition to a $1.7 billion Asia-focused private equity fund the bank closed in July, it's also trying to raise $4 billion for a global infrastructure fund, $2.5 billion for a global real estate fund, and $1 billion for a credit fund, according to people familiar with the matter.Reuters has learned the bank is also considering raising another global private equity fund whose target size has not yet been determined, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It would be the first such private equity fund Morgan Stanley has raised since 2008.Kotowski reckons that if a bank contributes just 3 percent of the capital in a private equity fund and the fund's returns are zero, the banks still earns a pre-tax return-on-equity of 24 percent because of management fees. At a 10-percent return, the bank would generate a return-on-equity of 69 percent, and at 25 percent it would generate return-on-equity of 136 percent, thanks to added performance fees. Return-on-equity is a measure of how much profit the bank can wring from its balance sheet for shareholders.""As the return goes to zero you're still solidly profitable but you have nice upside when things work out,"" Kotowski said. ""It's great work if you can get it.""Morgan Stanley declined to comment on its private equity plans.VOLCKER RULE  Attracting institutional investors has become more difficult because the Volcker rule caps U.S. banks' and their staff's investments in private equity funds at 3 percent. That has made some big investors less inclined to invest in funds housed within banks, because they prefer managers that have more ""skin in the game.""The rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, has led many of Morgan Stanley's U.S. competitors to exit private equity funds or raise money outside of a fund structure.Even as it stuck with the private equity business, Morgan Stanley had to make changes to mitigate the rule's effect. For example, the bank now shares more of the performance fees it receives with its staff, Reuters first reported in 2012.  Building the business will help the bank attain a firm-wide return-on-equity target of at least 10 percent that Gorman has set. That goal has been difficult to meet because of new capital requirements that are punitive to a big book of fixed-income assets Morgan Stanley is now winding down.Last year, Morgan Stanley's return on average common equity was 5 percent, excluding an accounting oddity known as debt valuation adjustments. In the first six months of this year it's risen to 9.5 percent. Investment management had the highest return-on-equity of any business, at 17.7 percent, and the bank is aiming to bring that up to 20 percent.Merchant banking and real estate investing - Morgan Stanley's formal name for the business that includes private equity funds - accounts for about 10 percent of the $396 billion in assets under management in Morgan Stanley's investment-management business.Most of those funds were raised before the financial crisis, and before Morgan Stanley had acquired the Smith Barney business from Citigroup Inc, making it the world's largest wealth management platform by brokerage force.Individual investor money has historically accounted for between 8 percent and 30 percent of funds Morgan Stanley has raised, according to a person familiar with the matter. The portion could go higher, but it is unlikely that a private equity fund will have more than half of its dollars coming from individuals, this person said.To be sure, Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit has an ""open architecture"" platform – meaning its brokers and private bankers are prohibited from prodding clients to buy Morgan Stanley products over others. Still, the business touches scores of millionaires and family offices across the U.S., giving it an in-house network of potential investors that is unparalleled in private equity fund-raising. CLOSEST RIVAL Morgan Stanley's business plan differs from its closest rival, Goldman Sachs, whose strategy still largely centers on putting capital to work in trades, loans and investments. Goldman executives have said they are committed to the same trading businesses that Morgan Stanley is de-emphasizing, and that they have no plans to scale back.Goldman has a fairly consistent track record of putting capital to work in lucrative ways – including its mortgage bets leading up to and out of the financial crisis, its presence as a market-maker in early 2009 when most competitors were still reeling from the crisis and its lucrative principal investments including its role in the buyout of discount retailer Dollar General Inc. Its top management comes from the trading business and its risk-management division is known to have greater sway internally than its traders.Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, was known for having a muddled strategy under chaotic management teams before Gorman took over, and for playing catch-up to Goldman in the approach to the financial crisis. Under Gorman, who fortified his career in Merrill Lynch's retail brokerage, the bank has been working to de-risk its businesses and focus on steadier revenue streams.Goldman has kept the fund model for some of its private funds under Volcker, such as a new infrastructure fund it is considering raising, Reuters reported last week.Yet in other areas, it has raised money from investors to perform individual deals outside of a fund structure, through a business development company called Liberty Harbor, or by using individual investor accounts. It is also using its own balance sheet to do private equity deals and then syndicate some of the equity to investors. FINDING NEW MONEY Morgan Stanley's merchant banking and real estate investing business delivered $559 million worth of net revenue in the first six months of this year, up 12 percent from $498 million in the same period of 2013.The business is tiny relative to Morgan Stanley's overall income statement, representing just 3 percent of total revenue.The investment management division it sits inside of is the smallest of Morgan Stanley's three major business units. It brings in about one-fifth of the revenue that institutional securities or wealth management does. It also delivers the highest returns and profit margins, and is the only one that already meets Gorman's expense target. Its main task now is to grow.Gregory Fleming, 51, who heads both investment management and wealth management for Morgan Stanley, has set a target of $500 billion in assets.""The most important benchmark in an investment management business I say again and again, (is) performance,"" Fleming said at a conference in February. ""If you perform, existing clients will give you more money to manage and you will bring in new clients across merchant banking and real estate.""Performance is on Morgan Stanley's side as it goes about raising new funds.According to Preqin, a market research firm, four of its five funds in the private equity area are in the top 25 percent of performers; the fifth is in the second quartile. Its overall performance is behind just four other private equity firms globally.Morgan Stanley's most recent global private equity fund has posted gross returns of 27 percent, according to a person familiar with its performance.

321,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Greg Roumeliotis  Oct 9 Morgan Stanley is embracing the financial reforms intended to curb its animal spirits to generate bigger profits.Unlike most of its rivals, Morgan Stanley has been building its private equity business using structures that are subject to the Volcker rule, which restricts the amount of money a bank and its employees can contribute to such funds. This, in turn, limits their profit-sharing and, some would argue, their alignment with investors' interests.For Morgan Stanley, the sixth biggest U.S. bank by assets, putting less capital into private equity funds makes sense, people familiar with the bank's strategy said. Under Chief Executive James Gorman, 56, managing clients' wealth has replaced businesses like bond trading and principal investing as the prime supplier of profits. Collecting steady fees without risking much money is more aligned with Gorman's goals than investing alongside clients with the potential of bigger rewards.""The private equity business is the best business model in financial services, hands down,"" said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co, who covers banks and private equity firms. ""People think of it as a risky business but it's not really. Come hell or high water, you're going to collect your base management fee.""This year, Morgan Stanley has been tapping its network of institutional and individual investors to raise several new funds. In addition to a $1.7 billion Asia-focused private equity fund the bank closed in July, it's also trying to raise $4 billion for a global infrastructure fund, $2.5 billion for a global real estate fund, and $1 billion for a credit fund, according to people familiar with the matter.Reuters has learned the bank is also considering raising another global private equity fund whose target size has not yet been determined, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It would be the first such private equity fund Morgan Stanley has raised since 2008.Kotowski reckons that if a bank contributes just 3 percent of the capital in a private equity fund and the fund's returns are zero, the banks still earns a pre-tax return-on-equity of 24 percent because of management fees. At a 10-percent return, the bank would generate a return-on-equity of 69 percent, and at 25 percent it would generate return-on-equity of 136 percent, thanks to added performance fees. Return-on-equity is a measure of how much profit the bank can wring from its balance sheet for shareholders.""As the return goes to zero you're still solidly profitable but you have nice upside when things work out,"" Kotowski said. ""It's great work if you can get it.""Morgan Stanley declined to comment on its private equity plans.VOLCKER RULE Attracting institutional investors has become more difficult because the Volcker rule caps U.S. banks' and their staff's investments in private equity funds at 3 percent. That has made some big investors less inclined to invest in funds housed within banks, because they prefer managers that have more ""skin in the game.""The rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, has led many of Morgan Stanley's U.S. competitors to exit private equity funds or raise money outside of a fund structure. Even as it stuck with the private equity business, Morgan Stanley had to make changes to mitigate the rule's effect. For example, the bank now shares more of the performance fees it receives with its staff, Reuters first reported in 2012.Building the business will help the bank attain a firm-wide return-on-equity target of at least 10 percent that Gorman has set.That goal has been difficult to meet because of new capital requirements that are punitive to a big book of fixed-income assets Morgan Stanley is now winding down.Last year, Morgan Stanley's return on average common equity was 5 percent, excluding an accounting oddity known as debt valuation adjustments. In the first six months of this year it's risen to 9.5 percent. Investment management had the highest return-on-equity of any business, at 17.7 percent, and the bank is aiming to bring that up to 20 percent.Merchant banking and real estate investing - Morgan Stanley's formal name for the business that includes private equity funds - accounts for about 10 percent of the $396 billion in assets under management in Morgan Stanley's investment-management business.Most of those funds were raised before the financial crisis, and before Morgan Stanley had acquired the Smith Barney business from Citigroup Inc, making it the world's largest wealth management platform by brokerage force. Individual investor money has historically accounted for between 8 percent and 30 percent of funds Morgan Stanley has raised, according to a person familiar with the matter. The portion could go higher, but it is unlikely that a private equity fund will have more than half of its dollars coming from individuals, this person said.To be sure, Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit has an ""open architecture"" platform - meaning its brokers and private bankers are prohibited from prodding clients to buy Morgan Stanley products over others. Still, the business touches scores of millionaires and family offices across the U.S., giving it an in-house network of potential investors that is unparalleled in private equity fund-raising.CLOSEST RIVAL Morgan Stanley's business plan differs from its closest rival, Goldman Sachs, whose strategy still largely centers on putting capital to work in trades, loans and investments. Goldman executives have said they are committed to the same trading businesses that Morgan Stanley is de-emphasizing, and that they have no plans to scale back.Goldman has a fairly consistent track record of putting capital to work in lucrative ways - including its mortgage bets leading up to and out of the financial crisis, its presence as a market-maker in early 2009 when most competitors were still reeling from the crisis and its lucrative principal investments including its role in the buyout of discount retailer Dollar General Inc. Its top management comes from the trading business and its risk-management division is known to have greater sway internally than its traders.Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, was known for having a muddled strategy under chaotic management teams before Gorman took over, and for playing catch-up to Goldman in the approach to the financial crisis. Under Gorman, who fortified his career in Merrill Lynch's retail brokerage, the bank has been working to de-risk its businesses and focus on steadier revenue streams. Goldman has kept the fund model for some of its private funds under Volcker, such as a new infrastructure fund it is considering raising, Reuters reported last week.Yet in other areas, it has raised money from investors to perform individual deals outside of a fund structure, through a business development company called Liberty Harbor, or by using individual investor accounts. It is also using its own balance sheet to do private equity deals and then syndicate some of the equity to investors.FINDING NEW MONEY Morgan Stanley's merchant banking and real estate investing business delivered $559 million worth of net revenue in the first six months of this year, up 12 percent from $498 million in the same period of 2013.The business is tiny relative to Morgan Stanley's overall income statement, representing just 3 percent of total revenue.The investment management division it sits inside of is the smallest of Morgan Stanley's three major business units. It brings in about one-fifth of the revenue that institutional securities or wealth management does. It also delivers the highest returns and profit margins, and is the only one that already meets Gorman's expense target. Its main task now is to grow.Gregory Fleming, 51, who heads both investment management and wealth management for Morgan Stanley, has set a target of $500 billion in assets.""The most important benchmark in an investment management business I say again and again, (is) performance,"" Fleming said at a conference in February. ""If you perform, existing clients will give you more money to manage and you will bring in new clients across merchant banking and real estate.""Performance is on Morgan Stanley's side as it goes about raising new funds.According to Preqin, a market research firm, four of its five funds in the private equity area are in the top 25 percent of performers; the fifth is in the second quartile. Its overall performance is behind just four other private equity firms globally.Morgan Stanley's most recent global private equity fund has posted gross returns of 27 percent, according to a person familiar with its performance. Similarly, its mezzanine credit fund has gross returns of 20 percent since inception, which is much better than the average fund, this person said.(Reporting by Lauren LaCapra and Gregory Roumeliotis.

327,"   By Jennifer Ablan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Greg Peters, the asset strategist who sounded an early alarm about the financial crisis and is now at Prudential Investment Management, said on Wednesday that the market downdraft and volatility may accelerate central bank aggressiveness, particularly in Europe and Japan. Peters, who helps manage over $533 billion in assets as senior portfolio manager at Prudential Fixed Income, a unit of Prudential Investment, told Reuters that the current environment is a ""perverse positive"" as it takes the Federal Reserve ""out of the picture in terms of pushing out rates hikes or retarding the pace of hikes.""   Against that backdrop, Peters said Prudential is buying high-yield ""junk"" bonds as he thinks the market is oversold. ""I am very constructive on risk,"" he said.  The spread on the S&P U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond Index stood at 500 basis points over Treasuries, as of Tuesday's close. Riskier high-yield bond funds attracted $1.3 billion in new cash in the week ended Oct. 8, marking their biggest inflows in seven weeks after hefty outflows of $2.3 billion the prior week.   ""We are keeping our duration in the portfolio for now,"" said Peters, who was chief global asset strategist at Morgan Stanley when he made his call about the financial crisis. ""We believe that the market will continue to price out rate hikes in the front end, so the yield curve steepens."" Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to interest rate fluctuations. Investors opt for longer duration bonds when rates are expected to remain low or drop further, with shorter duration bonds the choice in the opposite situation. ""I do think the volatility continues - it is October - but feel like spreads are attractive in here,"" Peters added.

328,"   By Frank Tang | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 16 The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) said on Thursday it appointed Morgan Stanley as a market maker, underscoring the  ambitions of some banks to expand into precious metals trading while others exit due to stringent regulations.LBMA said it named Morgan Stanley & Co International Plc, a unit of U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley, as a spot and options market-making member effective Thursday.Currently, LBMA has 13 market makers which serve in either one, two or all three of the spot, options and forwards markets. They make markets by quoting two-way prices in both gold and silver products to other market makers. Just three weeks ago, LBMA named Citigroup as a spot market-making member. With the exception of Morgan Stanley and Citi, other global banks have mostly reduced exposure to gold and silver trading, driven by increased scrutiny of precious metals 'fixes' by European and U.S. watchdogs in the wake of benchmark manipulation in other financial markets.In August, the LBMA began a new silver benchmarking process that is electronic, auction-based and auditable. The process is operated jointly by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which provides the platform and algorithm, and administrator Thomson Reuters. The LBMA in September formally started the process to find a new administrator for the century-old mechanism that will halt the telephone call that four institutions entered twice a day in favor of an electronic solution.On Thursday, the London Metal Exchange, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, said it will take charge of London's platinum and palladium pricing, also known as ""fixes,"" from Dec. 1.

329,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 17 (Fitch) Morgan Stanley (rated 'A/F1') reported solid third  quarter 2014 (3Q'14) results, driven by continued expansion of the wealth  management platform and modest outperformance, relative to Fitch Ratings'  expectations, with respect to trading activities. Furthermore, the company's  results were not significantly impacted by litigation expenses and the slowdown  in mortgage originations that affected its larger U.S. peers.  The solid performance across the firm's businesses continues to support  potential upward momentum to Morgan Stanley's 'a-' Viability Rating. The impact on Morgan Stanley and its peers from the recent increase in  volatility remains to be seen in 4Q'14. A healthy pick-up in client activity  would likely drive revenues higher, while a material sell-off in the markets  could reduce client confidence to transact, amplify potential trading losses and  impact profitability. Morgan Stanley's core profitability improved from the prior quarter.  Adjusted  pre-tax operating profits, as calculated by Fitch and excluding the impact of  debt-valuation adjustment (DVA), increased to $2 billion at 3Q'14, up 10% from  the prior quarter.  Adjusted pre-tax operating return on assets was 1.1% at  3Q'14 as compared with 0.9% for 2Q'14. Expenses were virtually unchanged from  the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley reported adjusted return on average equity of  8.0% (excluding DVA and a $237 million tax benefit), up from 7.5% for 2Q'14.  Return on equity, while improved, remains challenged relative to certain peers  and historical averages.   Wealth Management pre-tax operating margin continued to improve to 22% from 21%  at 2Q'14, due primarily to an increase in net revenues. Asset management fees  increased 5% sequentially, driven by net inflows and market appreciation, but  were partially offset by lower transactional fees, which decreased by 8% due to  lower trading revenues. Wealth Management client assets were unchanged at $2  trillion.  Institutional net revenues (excluding DVA impact) increased 3% to $4.3 billion  at 3Q'14. FICC adjusted net revenues were virtually unchanged from the prior  quarter despite 3Q'14 being a seasonally weaker period.  While foreign exchange  benefitted from improved market conditions and higher volatility, commodities  were significantly lower, reflecting Morgan Stanley's product mix, difficult  market conditions and lower client activity. Equity sales and trading adjusted  net revenues remained unchanged at $1.8 billion  as a result of higher client  activity across products.   Investment banking net revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 6% from a strong  2Q'14. The decrease in advisory revenues was driven by lower revenues in EMEA  and Asia Pacific. Modestly lower equity underwriting revenues reflected lower  Americas and EMEA volumes, which was partially offset by higher volumes in Asia.  The decrease in fixed income underwriting was driven by a decline investment  grade and high yield bond issuances, which was partially offset by higher loan  volumes. On a year-over-year basis, investment banking benefitted from a higher  level of completed M&A and IPO volumes.   Morgan Stanley's global liquidity reserve, which includes unencumbered liquid  securities and cash, was a solid $190 billion or 23% of total assets at 3Q'14.  Morgan Stanley has consistently maintained liquidity at conservative levels.  Value at Risk (VaR) was $42 million, down from $48 million at 2Q'14, due to  lower commodities risk, and interest rate and credit spread risk.  Morgan Stanley estimated that its fully-phased-in Tier I common ratio under the  Basel III advanced approach was 12.6% at Sept. 30, 2014. The firm estimated that  its supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for the holding company was approximately  4.9%, up from 4.6% at 2Q'14, slightly below the 5% threshold. The increase was  due to retained earnings, reduced balance sheet and the issuance of preferred  stock during the quarter.  Fitch continues to believe that Morgan Stanley will  be able to meet the holding company SLR minimum threshold ahead of the required  timeframe.  As part of its share repurchase program, Morgan Stanley repurchased  approximately $195 million shares during 3Q'14.  Fitch views this level of share  repurchase activity is manageable given current capital levels.

332,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which has spent three years throwing out bad apples from its fixed income trading portfolio, now wants to put the freed up money into businesses that bear healthier fruit.It is reinvesting capital previously held against unprofitable trades into areas like municipal bonds, credit and securitization, where it sees opportunities for boosting profit, senior executives at the bank said on Friday.This step represents a turning point in the bank's efforts to shrink to the point where it can make money again in bond trading. New regulations put in place after the financial crisis have made the business more expensive for big banks, forcing them, for example, to use shareholder money to finance their trades instead of cheaper debt. As trading becomes more expensive, many banks have to be choosier about which trades to do.""We've been very focused on 'what is the return on equity in the business?'"" Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview on Friday, referring to a measure of profitability.The bank's risk-weighted fixed-income trading assets have shrunk to $190 billion, close to its target of $180 billion by the end of next year, giving Morgan Stanley more room to reinvest in the business again, the executives said.  At this stage, Morgan Stanley's bond trading business sits in a gray zone - not as big as JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N), nor as profitable as Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N).The bank's executives have sometimes been inconsistent in their statements about where the business is headed.In 2010 and 2011, management said the bank was committed to growing revenue in a range of fixed-income trading businesses, and pledged to increase market share by 2 percentage points. One focus was growing trading in interest-rate driven products like Treasuries, a business that generally requires a big balance sheet to be successful. The bank quietly scrapped that plan as regulations evolved, and after the person it had hired from Goldman Sachs to expand that business was unsuccessful and left.Morgan Stanley executives later told analysts that the fixed-income trading unit just needed to reach an average quarterly revenue of $1.75 billion to be profitable. But more recently, executives have said that goal is no longer relevant because they are just focused on improving returns. In the third quarter, Morgan Stanley produced $1 billion in adjusted fixed-income trading revenue, beating analysts' average forecast of $885 million. Analysts and investors said the results show that size does not matter for fixed-income trading overall, but does in areas that a bank excels in.""You don't have to be the biggest in FICC; you have to be the biggest in what you do in FICC,"" said KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, referring to an acronym commonly used for the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities business. ""That goes all the way back to corporate strategy 101. Let's figure out what we do well and do that and stop trying to be all things to everybody.""

336,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Top Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executives are determined to keep compensation costs under control. And that means even when the bank's revenue spikes higher, bankers' bonuses won't.On Thursday, Goldman reported a 25 percent increase in quarterly revenue, but the money it set aside for compensation and benefits rose only 18 percent from the same period a year earlier. The amount of money it has set aside for compensation is more or less unchanged, as is the average compensation per employee, at around $320,000 for the first nine months of the year.Sources familiar with the matter inside Goldman Sachs described the restraint as a sign of the shifting mentality about bonuses at the bank: it wants to tightly control compensation, even if it has good quarters with big revenue gains. That translates to bigger profits for the bank, and more money for shareholders.Compensation experts say similar changes are happening across Wall Street. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which is Goldman's chief investment banking rival, has set a maximum target for compensation as a percentage of revenue in each of its business lines. Its progress in curbing compensation may be a key part of its third-quarter results, which are due out on Friday.""There is a desire to share more with shareholders, and that means holding the line on compensation expense,"" said Rose Marie Orens, a pay consultant for financial firms at Compensation Advisory Partners. ""Just because revenue is up 20 percent, that doesn't mean bonuses will necessarily be up 20 percent."" It wasn't always that way. In the third quarter of 2007, for example, when the financial crisis was in its preliminary stages, Goldman Sachs's revenue rose 63 percent from the same quarter a year earlier. But its compensation expense rose 67 percent.The bank has taken myriad steps to cut compensation costs. It has let dozens of high-earning partners walk out the door to make room for more junior employees who earn less. It has also moved as many jobs as it can to cities like Bangalore in India, and Salt Lake City and Dallas in the U.S, where wages are lower than in places like New York or London.CAPITAL RULES  Before the crisis, Goldman often boasted an annualized return-on-equity - a measure of how effectively the bank wrings profit from shareholder money - of 30 percent or higher. More recently those figures have been between 10 and 12 percent. Other banks, including Morgan Stanley, are still struggling to get returns above 10 percent, the minimum that analysts say is required to meet their cost of capital.Those returns have been hurt by new capital rules that make it more expensive to keep risky assets on balance sheets. Weak trading volumes have also kept a lid on revenue growth. A study in July from consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics estimated that new rules cost the six biggest U.S. banks some $70.17 billion in 2013, about double banks' regulatory and capital costs in 2007, just before the financial crisis.Some of Goldman's peers have tried to boost returns by getting rid of assets that can force the bank to hold more capital under new regulations, and exiting some types of trading, but Goldman has stuck with those businesses. Instead, it is trying to drive returns higher by cutting costs and hoping it can capture more trading revenue and increase its ability to charge more for its services. As the bank boosts profits, it can afford to buy back more shares, which boosts its return on equity. It can also raise dividends, a step it has taken four times since 2012, an unusual move for a bank that had previously shown little interest in the size of its dividend payments.Several stock analysts who cover Goldman Sachs commented on its compensation move on Thursday, saying it was a big reason the bank's earnings were better than expected. JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein said Goldman's adjusted compensation ratio was 7 percentage points lower than he had estimated it would be. ""Fourth-quarter results will tell, but we would be surprised if it (the ratio) were not down again for the fourth year in a row,"" said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.One employee on a Goldman trading desk who spoke with Reuters noted the gap between its revenue increase and compensation increase, taking it as a sign that, even if the fourth quarter produces great results, bonuses for this year's work might be disappointing.""People now understand you're not going to double your compensation every year,"" said Brian Byck, a recruiter who works with traders and sales staff at Odyssey Search Partners.",2014-10-17,MS,"Fri Oct 17, 2014 | 9:10am EDT",Goldman curbs bankers' compensation even as revenue surges,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-goldman-results-pay-idUSKCN0I60AD20141017?type=companyNews

347,"  MELBOURNE India's Adani has appointed Morgan Stanley to advise on the possible sale of a stake in its Abbot Point coal port in Australia, as it looks to raise funds to help finance a A$7 billion ($6.2 billion) mine, rail and port project.Adani spokesman Andrew Porter confirmed the company has hired Morgan Stanley to help it on a potential partial sale of Abbot Point, a 50 million tonnes-a-year coal terminal on the east coast of Australia that it bought for $2 billion in 2011.Funds raised from the stake sale would be used to help finance Adani's planned expansion of the port, Porter said.Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley advised the Australian state of New South Wales on the sale of the Port of Newcastle, the world's largest coal export terminal, which fetched A$1.75 billion, double the amount that had been widely expected.Adani's comments came after the Wall Street Journal reported that while Morgan Stanley was advising on the port sale, the bank was among four major U.S. investment banks that had told a U.S.-based green group, Rainforest Action Network, that they would not help fund the port's expansion.The east coast port expansion to handle two rival coal projects planned by Adani and India's GVK with Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart has sparked an outcry from green groups and tourist operators opposed to coal projects and port dredging near the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef. The $17 billion worth of projects in the undeveloped Galilee Basin have been at the center of a campaign by anti-coal activists pressing institutional investors and big banks to shun coal investments to help combat climate change.""Stopping Abbot Point is a top priority for us, because this single project is the key to whether one of the largest stores of carbon on the planet, the Galilee Basin, stays in the ground where it belongs, or is sold on the global market and released into our atmosphere,"" said Amanda Starbuck, a director at San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network. Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday it was not necessarily opposed to the Abbot Point expansion, but it typically does not provide financing for any projects in Australia.""In the case of the various Galilee Basin coal, rail and port developments, we have not looked at these projects in any detail nor have we assessed or opined on the environmental considerations surrounding them,"" Morgan Stanley's Australian spokesman Hugh Fraser said.""We are simply not in the business of providing greenfield project financing in Australia and therefore, as we have stated, we will not lend to, or invest in, these projects."" Adani is expected to tap Australia's big four banks and others to help fund its Carmichael project in Queensland state, which most analysts say would be hard to justify at current coal prices, hovering at five-year lows.(This version of the story was refiled to fix name of green group in fifth paragraph) (Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Himani Sarkar)",2014-10-28,MS,"Tue Oct 28, 2014 | 12:10am EDT",Adani taps Morgan Stanley to help sell Australia port stake,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-adani-ent-australia-port-idUSKBN0IH04920141028?type=companyNews
348,"  STUTTGART Germany German prosecutors dropped a two-year investigation into possible breach of trust by a former regional politician and an ex-Morgan Stanley (MS.N) banker over a state's purchase of a stake worth 4.7 billion euros ($6 billion) in utility EnBW (EBKG.DE).""It was not possible to demonstrate culpable behavior by the suspects,"" Stuttgart public prosecutors' office said in a statement on Wednesday.In late 2010, the then premier of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Stefan Mappus, hammered out the deal within weeks for the state to buy a 45 percent stake in EnBW from French energy company EDF (EDF.PA).The head of Morgan Stanley's German unit and one of the country's top bankers, Dirk Notheis, advised Mappus on the acquisition. An independent adviser working for the prosecutors later said the state had overpaid by some 780 million euros. German newspapers later published emails which they said were sent by Notheis to Mappus, in which Notheis casually referred to Chancellor Angela Merkel as ""Mutti"" - German for ""mummy"" - and sometimes appeared to be giving orders to Mappus.The emails, which could not be independently verified by Reuters, unleashed a wave of criticism in Germany by appearing to highlight the cozy relationship between bankers and politicians at a time when many Germans were up in arms about the role banks played in the global financial crisis. Both men denied any wrongdoing and said any allegations of breach of trust were baseless.Stuttgart prosecutors said the case for the breach of trust accusation rested largely on differing assumptions about the value of the stake made by independent experts and could not form the basis for a prosecution.

An independent adviser working for the prosecutors later said the state had overpaid by some 780 million euros. German newspapers later published emails which they said were sent by Notheis to Mappus, in which Notheis casually referred to Chancellor Angela Merkel as ""Mutti"" - German for ""mummy"" - and sometimes appeared to be giving orders to Mappus. The emails, which could not be independently verified by Reuters, unleashed a wave of criticism in Germany by appearing to highlight the cosy relationship between bankers and politicians at a time when many Germans were up in arms about the role banks played in the global financial crisis.Both men denied any wrongdoing and said any allegations of breach of trust were baseless. Stuttgart prosecutors said the case for the breach of trust accusation rested largely on differing assumptions about the value of the stake made by independent experts and could not form the basis for a prosecution.(1 US dollar = 0.7848 euro)   (Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Jonathan Gould; Editing by Thomas Atkins and Pravin Char)",2014-10-29,MS,"Wed Oct 29, 2014 | 8:49am EDT",German prosecutors drop probe of ex-Morgan Stanley banker,http://www.reuters.com//article/germany-prosecutors-banker-idUSL5N0SO31220141029?type=companyNews

352,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK During Morgan Stanley's public earnings call earlier this month, Chief Executive James Gorman made a remark that hit his commodities staff like a bombshell: the bank plans to further ""optimize"" its business of owning and trading stuff like oil, natural gas, electricity and metals.So this past Monday, when co-head of the commodities business Simon Greenshields held a meeting for senior staff, he was met with a barrage of questions from colleagues who hadn't been told about the plans either before or after the call, people familiar with the situation said. They wanted to know what Gorman meant by ""optimize.""Greenshields dodged questions about management's plans and told participants to take the comments at ""face value,"" instead highlighting areas where the business is growing. After several minutes of discussion, Greenshields ended the meeting, the sources said.Whatever Gorman meant by ""optimize,"" the commodities staff interpreted it as ""not good for my career at Morgan Stanley."" According to KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, who rates Morgan Stanley a ""market perform,"" optimize means ""cutting people or exiting products altogether that are unprofitable.""Greenshields did not respond to requests for comment.""As we have previously stated, Morgan Stanley is committed to a commodities business that services the supply and risk management needs of our clients across the oil, power and gas, and metal sectors, in line with the evolving market and regulatory environment,"" spokesman Mark Lake said.Gorman's remarks and the reaction from employees come amid a rocky period for the commodities business on Wall Street. Banks that own, transport and store hard commodities have come under intense regulatory scrutiny and political pressure to exit those businesses.But unlike arch rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which regards commodities as a core trading activity, Morgan Stanley is busy trying to jettison big chunks of the business. Morgan Stanley has already sold Transmontaigne, an oil terminals and pipeline operator. It has also been trying for almost a year to sell another physical oil business to Russian oil giant Rosneft, but that deal is now threatened by U.S. sanctions. The bank plans to pursue alternatives if the deal doesn't close by year-end. In the meantime, though, the pullback has left dozens of commodities employees in limbo - and on edge.As Morgan Stanley was setting up plans to sell the physical oil business to Rosneft, it offered those employees retention bonuses that can be redeemed if they stay at the company through March 2015. That bonus has kept some people there through the turmoil, but some 100 front-office workers are unsure of where they will be working in a few months, now that the Rosneft deal is on ice. Some are looking for opportunities to leave Morgan Stanley sooner, even if that means they forego the bonus.The jostling among disgruntled bankers and traders is making Morgan Stanley's retreat from some parts of commodities trading look increasingly haphazard to people both inside and outside the bank. One senior executive at a rival bank said it is impossible to successfully run a business full of high-powered, well-paid people who are uncertain about their future there. From the outside, this person said, Morgan Stanley's strategy is befuddling.From Morgan Stanley's point of view, though, there is little option but to slim down the business further, since it is not earning an adequate return on capital for shareholders, said Kleinhanzl at KBW.""It is a necessary business decision, given the return-on-equity in the business,"" he said. ""It creates some near-term uncertainty, but longer-term I don't view it as a core business of the company.""PULLBACK FROM COMMODITIES  Morgan Stanley's recent difficulties in commodities trading come in stark contrast to its history as one of two premier Wall Street banks involved with the business, along with Goldman Sachs.Although the banks do not disclose income from commodities trading specifically, analysts estimate that the business delivered billions of dollars in revenue to Morgan Stanley in better years, particularly in 2007. But more recently, it has struggled under the weight of new regulations and shifting business strategy. In 2012, Morgan Stanley's commodities business reported the worst results since 1995. It has been uneven since then, according to executive comments on quarterly earnings calls.  Goldman has faced some of the same challenges, ranging from weak client activity and a regulation preventing banks from gambling in markets with their own money, to politicians urging the bank to sell its metal warehousing business, which it agreed to do this year.Yet Goldman executives have said many times that they are committed to the business, and won't exit it unless a new regulation or law requires them to. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has called commodity trading ""a core, strategic business"" for Goldman, and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz have made similar comments.Goldman may eventually have to change its stance: the Fed is examining whether it is appropriate for banks to be involved with physical commodities, and an influential Senate panel plans to hold a public hearing on the issue, which it has been investigating for over a year. But the public display of bravado has given Goldman's commodities employees more confidence in their role at the bank, at least for the near term.Meanwhile, Gorman has been trying to shift Morgan Stanley away from businesses that deliver volatile profits and draw regulatory scrutiny, to more stable ones that avoid the limelight. A big part of his plan to boost return-on-equity to at least 10 percent from a current level in the single-digits comes from getting rid of commodities assets that tie up too much capital, and reinvesting that money into more profitable pursuits, like commodities lending and derivatives.       CONFUSION REIGNS Some insiders say there is widespread confusion and disenchantment about the strategy.At the same time Morgan Stanley has been pursuing the sale to Rosneft, for example, it was also laying the groundwork for a new physical trading operation that would send compressed natural gas to underserved areas in the Caribbean. Some people inside Morgan Stanley wondered why the project, called Wentworth Holdings LLC, was launched at all, given the Federal Reserve's concerns about banks owning those types of assets. After a Reuters report on Aug. 29 revealed those plans, the Fed contacted Morgan Stanley with questions about the business, prompting Gorman to order its sale.Greenshields began talking to potential buyers, as did two employees who were overseeing the Wentworth project day-to-day. Private equity firm Blackstone Group may be interested in buying or investing in the business, the sources said. A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment.Some sources said Greenshields and the two employees - Ryan Comerford and Alberto Chiesara - want to use the sale as an exit plan. While Comerford and Chiesara have the connections needed to build and run the business, Greenshields wants to ensure that he is also included in any exit plan, those people said.Comerford did not respond to requests for comment, and Chiesara declined to comment.

355,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 3 Bank of America Corp's  Merrill Lynch unit lost two teams of veteran advisers in late September and October, even as the firm announced it was hiring.Bank of America said it hired 155 financial advisers in the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, bringing its ""Thundering Herd,"" as the firm's adviser force is called, to 14,000.Miami-based brokers Eugene Montoya, Francisco de la Camara, Mario Baro and Kevin Montoya, nearly all of whom had spent several decades at Merrill, left for Wells Fargo Advisors  on Sept. 30, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed. Also, broker Raymond L. George left Merrill Lynch for Morgan Stanley, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said. His departure came shortly after the Miami group left. George, who had been with Merrill for about 23 years, joined Morgan Stanley's office in Garden City, New York, according to records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. A Merrill spokeswoman confirmed that both the Miami group and George left the firm. However, neither she nor the Morgan Stanley spokeswoman commented on George's production at Merrill.Eugene Montoya, de la Camara and Baro collectively managed at least $390 million in assets at Merrill, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed. She could not provide information on Kevin Montoya's assets under management. The Miami group, which serves international high net worth clients primarily from Latin America, joined Wells Fargo as the St. Louis-based firm works to expand its relationships with international clients, a source at the Miami Wells Fargo office said.Bank of America has been de-emphasizing global wealth management in recent years, selling its International Wealth Management business outside the United States to Julius Baer Group in 2013.

359,"   By Olivia Oran and Liana B. Baker  SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK Nov 5 Ted Tobiason, Deutsche Bank's head of equity capital markets in technology and the only investment banker at the German bank allowed to muse on Twitter, is leaving for Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter.Based in San Francisco, Tobiason works on tech software and Internet IPOs in Silicon Valley. His new role at Morgan Stanley is not yet clear. Tobiason, a managing director, had been at Deutsche Bank since 2006 after joining from Bank of America.

363,"  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley, the world's largest brokerage firm, fired the first shot in Wall Street's pay formula wars by telling brokers more of their pay will be deferred in 2015 than in the past.The firm's 16,000-plus brokers, who this week were mailed their 2014 bonus totals but have not yet been told of the 2015 formula, will have from 1.5 percent to 15.5 percent of their cash and stock bonuses deferred, said a source familiar with the plan. ""In most cases, it's a very modest increase in deferrals, but without it there would be a great deal of distortion at certain revenue and length-of-service levels that the bonuses are tied to,"" the source said.Brokers who produce $1.1 million to $1.65 million of revenue, slightly above average, will have 10 percent of their bonus deferred, the source said. One-fourth will continue to be paid in stock collected after four years and 75 percent in cash that vests over eight years.Figuring out the exact change may not be easy. Broker pay manuals often run more than 50 pages and change annually based on firms' goals, such as raising the number of accounts with at least $500,000 in them.  The guides are nevertheless studied carefully by brokers and headhunters to determine where the most comfortable deals reside. Since Morgan Stanley's initial change involves making brokers wait longer to collect their pay, rival firms are likely to adopt similar plans, said Ron Eddie, president of recruiting firm Millennium Career Advisors in San Diego. The change for next year was disclosed to branch managers earlier this week and aims to give a clearer view of what brokers will give up in deferred pay if they leave for a rival firm. Brokers next year will receive a ""unified grid"" that combines their annual pay with the bonuses and the total deferral amount. ""The deferrals will not be a big money saver for the firm, but hopefully you tie people to the ship a little longer,"" the source said.   Morgan Stanley's standard grid will continue to have 10 levels of payouts tied to total production. Brokers bringing in up to $250,000 receive 28 percent of the amount.

369,"  The billion-dollar commodity trading businesses of two of the industry's biggest players were  laid bare in an exhaustive report on Wednesday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee On Investigations, including new details of their revenues in recent years.Morgan Stanley's oil trading desk, the largest of the five divisions within its commodities business, recorded net revenue of $676 million in 2012, half as much as 2008, according to a submission cited in the committee's 400-page report. The bank, like others on Wall Street, does not break down its desk-level earnings to investors or the public.And Goldman Sachs saw its global commodity net revenues drop to around $1 billion in 2012, less than a third as much as its 2008 peak, according to a September 2013 presentation to its board of directors cited in the report. Goldman provides some broad data on its commodity earnings in routine filings but has said in the past that the data does not accurately reflect the way it runs its business. According to the Goldman report, physical trading represented between 6 percent and 17 percent of Goldman's 2012 franchise revenues, down from the 15 percent to 20 percent cited in a 2011 board report. While the figures are broadly in line with estimates reported previously by Reuters and other media, they offer the most definitive view yet of the declining revenues of Wall Street's two largest and most longstanding commodity traders. The report did not include similar data for JPMorgan Chase & Co, the third bank whose business it analyzed. The bank sold its physical commodities division this year.

The note was obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.An internal investigation, which Chief Executive Maria das Graças Foster kicked off as federal prosecutors found evidence of a criminal scheme operating within the company for years, should lead to asset writedowns ranging from 5 billion reais to 21 billion reais, Montanari said. He added a dividend cut could have an impact on the company's common shares (PETR3.SA). The report underscores the headwinds facing Petrobras, which once was the crown jewel of Brazil's economy but in recent years became a symbol of the country's fall from grace. Preferred shares of Petrobras (PETR4.SA) rose for the first day in five on Wednesday, advancing 1.5 percent to 12.66 reais. Petrobras delayed the release of third-quarter results last week on accusations that the company systematically overpaid for assets and work by contractors. The excess funds might have been funneled to political parties including President Dilma Rousseff's ruling Workers' Party, prosecutors said. If federal and company probes extend for longer than expected and further evidence of wrongdoing is presented, Petrobras could face restricted access to funding that could force the company to ramp up debt or look for an equity issuance, the note added.  ""We believe that while investigations are ongoing, the company might face difficulties - and higher costs - in its traditional early-year debt issuance,"" the note said. ""In addition, if there is a material delay in the release of annual audited financials, the company would be at risk of outstanding bonds acceleration."" In that case, a solution could be a share offering that ""could be very dilutive,"" Montanari noted. Investors in Petrobras are increasingly concerned that the world's most-indebted major oil company may technically slip into default on about $12 billion worth of global bonds if it fails to report unaudited earnings by year-end.($1 = 2.5821 Brazilian reais) (Editing by W Simon)",2014-11-19,MS,"Wed Nov 19, 2014 | 10:57am EST",Morgan Stanley sees Petrobras scandal write-offs of up to $8.1 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-brazil-petrobras-morganstanley-idUSKCN0J31E820141119?type=companyNews

376,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Morgan Stanley's  ratings including its Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A/F1', support rating at  '1', support rating floor (SRF) at 'A' and viability rating (VR) at 'a-'. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of  this rating action commentary. The rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. On balance, Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable. The 12  banks have continued to strengthen their balance sheets in 9M14. Capitalisation  has improved materially over the past two years and liquidity remains sound.  This strengthening balances continued pressure on earnings, particularly in  securities businesses, and remaining material but unpredictable exposure to  conduct and regulatory risks.  Fitch forecasts weak growth in the eurozone during 2015 while growth in the US  and UK is expected to be somewhat stronger, which should help the GTUBs with a  significant presence in these regions. Spikes in market volatility, most  recently in October 2014, show that uncertainty remains over how expectations of  rising interest rates in the US will affect financial markets. Our expectation  is that rises in interest rates will be gradual and would follow improved  prospects for the economy, which should help business volumes. Sharp and  unexpected hikes in US interest rates would likely result in increased market  volatility and, consequently, additional pressure on banks' earnings, although  we believe that the GTUBs' risk appetite has declined.  Lower risk appetite should help the banks avoid material losses on trading  positions but an adverse operating environment could result in a change of our  outlook if earnings prospects suffer materially. For eurozone-focused banks, a  prolonged deflationary scenario would put pressure on earnings and could result  in a changed outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, SENIOR DEBT, SR and SRF Morgan Stanley's Long- and Short-term IDRs, Support Rating (SR), Support Rating  Floor (SRF) and senior debt ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that there  remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government (rated  'AAA'/Outlook Stable by Fitch) if required, and the Long-term IDR is at its SRF.  This expectation reflects the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks  especially given its strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming  less certain. Specific to Morgan Stanley, Fitch's view of support likelihood is based mostly  on its systemic importance in the U.S., global interconnectedness given its size  and operations in global capital markets, growing deposit base and its position  as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy. Morgan Stanley's  IDRs and senior debt ratings benefit from support because Morgan Stanley's VR is  below its SRF. However, the momentum is gaining pace to resolve even the most complex banking  groups without significantly disrupting the financial markets and without  requiring state support. In Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce  support for G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and  progress regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority  (OLA). The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and  further initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to  eliminate state support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the  likelihood of senior debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments.  Despite the likely removal of support in the U.S., the Stable Outlook for Morgan  Stanley's Long-term IDR reflects Fitch's view, that Morgan Stanley's fundamental  credit profile is improving and that its viability rating is likely to improve  over the next 6-9 months.  Therefore the upward momentum in the VR offsets the  likely removal of sovereign support in the U.S. which would result in Morgan  Stanley's IDR and VR being equalized. Morgan Stanley has announced that the sale of its physical commodities business  to Rosneft will likely not close.  Should this occur, this does not have ratings  implications, it is a drag on the firm's capital and potentially for increased  earnings volatility. Fitch will monitor the approach Morgan Stanley takes to  divest this business. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SR AND SRF The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). A key hurdle that remains is whether sufficient contingent capital  exists at the holding company to recapitalize without requiring government  assistance. Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise Morgan  Stanley's SR to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' likely during the first half of  2015. It is unlikely that a revision of Morgan Stanley's SRF to 'No Floor' will lead  to a downgrade of its Long-term IDR, despite the fact that Morgan Stanley's IDR  is at its SRF, because Fitch expects that there will be upward momentum in  Morgan Stanley's Viability Rating over the rating over the next year. Therefore,  absent a material adverse change in market conditions or individual company  profile, Morgan Stanley's IDRs are unlikely to change when the support rating  floor is revised to 'No Floor'. KEY RATING DRIVERS - VR Morgan Stanley's VR of 'a-' continues to be supported by the company's solid  liquidity position, improved risk management, and higher-than-average capital  position. The VR also reflects Morgan Stanley's continued execution of its  wealth management strategy based on its 100% ownership of Morgan Stanley Smith  Barney including measured deployment of bank deposits into appropriate  investments in lending products, improving margins and navigation of evolving  regulatory challenges. The upward momentum in the VR reflects Fitch's  expectation that Morgan Stanley will continue to effectively execute on its  Wealth Management strategy, further reduce risk weighted assets, and improve  ROEs to a level at or above its cost of capital. The VR remains constrained by  wholesale funding risks, challenging industry prospects given the impact of new  regulations and continued global economic uncertainty. Overall, Morgan Stanley's performance (excluding one-time items) has improved as  it continues to benefit from improved margins in the wealth management platform  and investment banking revenues, which partially offset weaker fixed income and  commodities net revenues. Furthermore, the company's results were not  significantly impacted by litigation expenses and the slowdown in mortgage  origination that affected it larger U.S. peers. Pre-tax operating margin for  Wealth Management improved to 21% for the first nine months of 2014. Fitch  believes that if the company can successfully execute on its strategy to deploy  deposits into loans and securities with higher returns without assuming outsized  risks, then it will be able to achieve a targeted pre-tax margin of 22% - 25% by  4Q'15.  Morgan Stanley's earnings are becoming more balanced as the company continues to  expand its wealth management platform. This reduces the company's comparatively  higher reliance on capital market operations in relationship to many other  GTUBs, reflecting its focus on the institutional securities business. The  greater stability derived from its wealth management platform and the measured  growth of the bank contributes to the positive momentum in Morgan Stanley's VR.  That said, Morgan Stanley's future earnings will continue to be less diverse  than other larger universal banks. Morgan Stanley's capital position is relatively strong and continues to improve.  At 3Q'14, fully-phased in Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III advanced approach  is estimated to be 12.7% (in line with the average of the U.S. GTUBs). Morgan  Stanley reported that as of 3Q'14, the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for  the holding company SLR was 4.9%, slightly below the 5% threshold. Fitch  continues to believe that Morgan Stanley will be able to meet the SLR threshold  prior to the required timeframe. Liquidity continues to be maintained at conservative levels, which is viewed as  appropriate given Morgan Stanley's wholesale funding profile. At 3Q'14,  unencumbered highly liquid securities and cash was a solid $190 billion or 23%  of total assets. Morgan Stanley estimated that is Basel III liquidity coverage  ratio remains well in excess of 100%.  Fitch believes that Morgan Stanley is more vulnerable to funding and rollover  risks than a number of GTUB peers as it is primarily wholesale funded. To reduce  wholesale funding risk, Morgan Stanley has reduced its reliance on unsecured  short-term to minimal levels with no reliance on commercial paper or 2a-7 funds  as of 2Q'14. Morgan Stanley has a strong governance policy on secured funding,  including maturity targets and limits set for each tier of collateral. Although  deposits are increasing at the subsidiary bank, they remain a relatively  moderate portion of the overall funding mix. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR and SENIOR DEBT Morgan Stanley's viability rating has a higher probability of being upgraded to  'a' from 'a-' upon further execution of its Wealth Management strategy,  including measured deployment of bank deposits into appropriate investments in  lending products, and improved returns on equity in excess of cost of capital.  Successful navigation of evolving regulatory challenges including the Volcker  Rule and Basel may also contribute to upward rating momentum as will maintenance  of strong capital and liquidity levels. Downward pressure on the VR could be driven by Morgan Stanley's inability to  execute on its Wealth Management strategy, resulting in sustained operating  weakness or returns on equity substantially below its cost of capital.  Additional potential negative drivers could include an inability to successfully  navigate evolving regulatory requirements such as the Volcker Rule or Basel,  material losses, a significant increase in leverage and risk weighted assets,  reduced capital ratios, deterioration in liquidity levels or outsized fines,  settlements or other charges. RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT and OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES  Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Morgan Stanley and by  various issuing vehicles are all notched down from Morgan Stanley's VR in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  nonperformance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Subordinated debt and  other hybrid capital ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of  Morgan Stanley. RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Morgan Stanley's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the  company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit  from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. However, Morgan Stanley's  uninsured deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift because  they do not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the  deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States.  Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually  payable, they do not get the rating uplift. The ratings of long and short-term  deposits issued by Morgan Stanley and its subsidiaries are primarily sensitive  to any change in Morgan Stanley's IDR. RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY AND OPERATING SUBSIDIARY Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. This may result  in a possible downgrade of Morgan Stanley's holding company rating, an upgrade  of operating company ratings, or no changes to ratings if Fitch's views the  long-term debt requirement assigned to Morgan Stanley as providing an  insufficient amount of bail-in capital at the operating company level.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY and AFFILIATED COMPANIES The IDRs of Morgan Stanley's major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with Morgan Stanley's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core  to Morgan Stanley's business strategy and financial profile. Morgan Stanley is a leading global bank with three business segments:  institutional securities, global wealth management, and asset management. In  September 2008, Morgan Stanley converted to a bank holding company (BHC)  regulated by the Federal Reserve. Morgan Stanley is currently the sixth largest  bank by assets in the U.S. and designated as a G-SIFI by the Financial Stability  Board.

382,"   By Antony Currie | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Morgan Stanley's  latest fiddle on pay should help boss James Gorman inch closer to his earnings target. The investment bank is deferring fewer annual bonuses. The plan was a handy way to help slash costs in leaner days not long ago. Reversing the policy will remove expenses that had been baked into future years. That should boost returns.Forcing dealmakers to wait for up to 80 percent of their annual incentive payouts served two purposes. First, the way deferrals are accounted for meant Morgan Stanley could postpone booking some of each year's bill. Second, it positioned Gorman and the bank as leaders on reforming a culture of excessive bonuses.The Morgan Stanley chief executive had been hoping rivals might follow his lead. In an interview at the start of 2012, he even told employees to ""just leave"" if they were unhappy. The usual sheep-like mentality on Wall Street didn't take hold in this instance, though. Instead, fears grew inside Morgan Stanley that its bankers might be poached.Postponing pay invites another problem, too. Any institution that does so must eventually account for it in full. Stock-based bonuses can be particularly punitive over time. Morgan Stanley's shares are up 135 percent since the start of 2012 and have nearly doubled since the start of last year. That's on a par with other banks, but the higher deferral rate adds to the cost of issuing shares. The revised policy, in which only half of bonuses will be postponed, won't affect previous stock awards, but will reduce the effect of future grants. And Morgan Stanley is also accelerating earlier deferred cash awards. The total cost of the changes is an estimated $1.2 billion.There's potentially good news for shareholders, though. By taking the financial hit in one shot this quarter, it should slash the pay tab for a couple years, even after allowing for the higher cost of booking new awards. The change could save some $400 million in 2015, according to UBS. That would add 0.6 percentage points to Morgan Stanley's return on equity. It's an accounting sleight of hand, but might get Gorman to his 10 percent target quicker. For him, that would be an accelerated bonus. CONTEXT NEWS  -  Morgan Stanley said on Dec. 5 that it would accelerate paying out some deferred cash bonuses from recent years. The firm also will reduce the deferral rate on future bonus payments to 50 percent from 80 percent.- The bank expects the move to add about $1.2 billion to its compensation and benefits expenses for the fourth quarter and the year.- In an email to employees obtained by Reuters, Morgan Stanley chief executive wrote: ""Now that our business strategy is in place and the firm's performance has stabilized, it is time to bring our deferral policy to an appropriate long-term level, in line with the rest of the industry.""- SEC filing: 1.usa.gov/1wTvFG7   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

388,"   By Vladimir Soldatkin | MOSCOW  MOSCOW The ambitions of Kremlin-controlled oil champion Rosneft to boost its global reach have been reined in by U.S. authorities, which torpedoed its acquisition of a Morgan Stanley oil trading business.Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a long-standing ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Monday that the deal was terminated because of the refusal by U.S. regulators to grant clearance.""Having invested substantial efforts in the deal, the parties regret that it could not be completed,"" said Rosneft, in which BP holds a 20 percent stake.Morgan Stanley also said that the deal was terminated and that it will now consider a variety of options.The collapse of the deal, valued by sources at between $300 million and $400 million, is yet another blow for Rosneft after its partners, including ExxonMobil, withdrew from projects to develop Arctic offshore oil deposits following the introduction of Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. The Morgan Stanley deal was agreed in December 2013, when Sechin said that it would spearhead the company's growth in the international oil and products markets.Since then, however, the West's sanctions and a plummeting oil price has prompted Rosneft to seek state support from Russia's National Wealth Fund (NWF).The strained relations with the West have already forced German chemicals group BASF and Russia's Gazprom to halt a gas assets swap planned for this year. Sources told Reuters in September that Rosneft might abandon the Morgan Stanley deal because sanctions had hurt its ability to finance the operations. The fall in its share price and the ruble's collapse have left Rosneft with a market capitalization of $31 billion, against $45 billion of debt that was mainly incurred with last year's purchase of oil producer TNK-BP. Rosneft shares rose as much as 7 percent in Moscow trading, with investors encouraged by the end of the company's spending spree. The shares finished the day with a gain of 2.5 percent, against a 0.8 percent decline for the broader market.""Of course, it's not bad that Rosneft has stopped, at least here. If one has to buy something in such a difficult situation, one would not only have to ask for help from NWF but also from the riches of the entire motherland,"" Kapital portfolio manager Vadim Bit-Avragim said.Earlier in the day, the company said it had met a $7 billion loan repayment, partially easing fears among investors that Western sanctions could prompt mass defaults.

The strategy of both funds is the same: making new loans and buying existing debt of companies in North America and Western Europe that have earnings of $15 million or more before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.""There's a core need in the middle market where companies can't access junior capital in the liquid markets and need a private market alternative and that's what we provide,"" said D'Alessandro, who oversees a team of 11.The new fund has already invested $144 million in four companies. Investments typically range from $20 million to $65 million in size. After buying Smith Barney from Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley has a much larger base of wealthy individual clients, but does not seem to have relied on them more heavily for fund raising.More than twice as much institutional money was raised for the latest fund in dollar terms compared to the first. D'Alessandro would not disclose the split between institutional and individual investor money in percentage terms. Morgan Stanley's wealth and investment management businesses operate separately and its financial advisers are not allowed to advocate investments in Morgan Stanley funds over others.The credit fund is the latest sign of Morgan Stanley building out its fund businesses despite a new regulatory restriction called the Volcker rule, which limits how much money the bank and its own employees can invest in such funds.The capital commitment in the new fund from Morgan Stanley and affiliates is 3 percent, which is the Volcker rule's limit. Morgan Stanley's strategy is unusual compared to rivals who have either exited private equity or are investing outside of fund structures.Morgan Stanley has also been raising a $4 billion global infrastructure fund, a $2.5 billion global real estate fund and a global private equity fund of unknown size.

411,"  LONDON Jan 13 Royal Bank of Scotland  and Barclays may have to pay some of the biggest bills from an estimated $52 billion in fines and other litigation costs facing Europe's banks in the next two years, Morgan Stanley analysts said.U.S. and European banks have paid $230 billion in litigation costs since 2009 and could pay out another $70 billion by the end of 2016, mostly from the 20 largest European banks, they said in a research note on Tuesday.European banks have paid out about $104 billion so far and the $52 billion they still have to pay, much of it related to foreign exchange trading and U.S. mortgage mis-selling, could restrain how much they pay in dividends, the analysts said.The fines and compensation in the last five years are related to practices that include alleged manipulation of benchmark interest rates and mis-selling of mortgages in the United States and insurance in Britain.Regulators fined six banks $4.3 billion in November after traders tried to manipulate foreign exchange markets. ""FX settlements underscore (the) need to prove culture and business models are transformed before returns and payouts can rise,"" analyst Huw van Steenis said in a note.RBS, majority owned by the UK government, will have to pay another $10.6 billion on top of the $12.6 billion already paid or provisioned for, Morgan Stanley estimated. The analysts predicted Barclays could have to pay another $8.3 billion, HSBC $7.7 billion, Lloyds $6.1 billion and Germany's Deutsche Bank $5.1 billion.They estimated that future litigation costs for European banks would include $7.5 billion related to alleged foreign exchange rigging, $6.5 billion from interest rate benchmarks Libor and Euribor and $9.4 billion related to U.S. mortgages. U.S. banks are more advanced in their litigation payouts, the analysts said. Five major U.S. banks have paid out $128 billion and are forecast to incur another $18 billion.JPMorgan analysts this week also said British banks faced additional litigation provisions. They forecast the big four banks faced 15.1 billion pounds ($22.8 billion) of extra provisions for litigation in the next two years, to add to 11.6 billion pounds of reserves they already have set aside for such payouts.($1 = 0.6615 pounds)   (Reporting by Steve Slater.

412,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Jonathan Leff | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley appointed two new executives on Wednesday to run one of Wall Street's last big commodity trading operations following the unexpected departure of the previous co-heads.Nancy King and Peter Sherk, insiders who have worked in the bank's commodities group for more than a decade, have taken on day-to-day responsibility for the business, effective immediately, according to a memo sent by Colm Kelleher, president of institutional securities.They replace Simon Greenshields, who has left the bank after 31 years, and Colin Bryce, who is moving to a senior advisory role. They jointly ran the group since 2008, a period in which revenues reached record highs of more than $2 billion, then fell by more than half as activity slumped.The leadership change took some close observers by surprise. It followed months of what inside sources have described as internal confusion about the fate of commodities trading at Morgan Stanley. For the past two years, the bank has been in the process of selling businesses that own and operate physical commodity assets like oil terminals and pipelines, under pressure from regulators and lawmakers. Chief Executive James Gorman has signaled plans to further ""optimize"" the physical business and focus instead on trading, hedging and financing for clients.The sales process has not run smoothly. A deal to sell its physical oil trading business to Russia's Rosneft fell through after a year, leaving its fate uncertain.In August, Reuters reported that Morgan Stanley was also pursuing a plan to export compressed natural gas to the Caribbean. The project, known as Wentworth, drew scrutiny from the Federal Reserve and Gorman demanded that the business be sold or shut down. Kelleher said Greenshields, 58, informed him that he planned to leave Morgan Stanley after 31 years with the bank. Two sources familiar with the matter said Greenshields has plans to join another business, but it is not clear which one.  Neither Greenshields nor Bryce could be reached for comment on Wednesday.KEEP IT PHYSICAL Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Greenshields wanted to exit the bank with Wentworth and continue pursuing a career in commodities without restrictions.New trading and capital regulations, diminished market volatility and dwindling investor interest in commodities have prompted several banks to shut their commodity trading operations over the past year or two. Greenshields, who ran Morgan Stanley's lucrative power trading operation for years, has been a vocal advocate of banks retaining their full presence in physical commodities markets.""The public benefits of permitting financial institutions to engage in wholesale physical commodities activities are real and significant,"" he said in testimony before Congress in November following a highly critical Senate subcommittee report on Wall Street's involvement with physical commodities.STICKING IT OUT  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, long the most lucrative commodity dealers on Wall Street, have largely stuck it out long enough to cash in on 2014, a year in which energy market volatility fueled windfall profits.However both have been forced to cut back in some areas as the Federal Reserve weighs new rules. The Fed seeks to limit operational risks such as an oil spill by a bank-owned business, that it fears could pose risks to the financial system.Goldman sold a metals warehousing business called Metro that came under criticism, and Morgan Stanley sold an oil storage business to Transmontaigne. There is no indication that Morgan Stanley has sold Wentworth despite interest from private equity and other potential buyers, one person familiar with the matter said. In the meantime, the economics behind that project have become ""marginal"" with the steep slump in oil prices, the person said.King, the new co-head, has been with Morgan Stanley since 1986, starting as an oil and natural gas trader and moving up to senior roles including chief risk officer of the commodities business and most recently head of the oil liquid flow business.Her counterpart Sherk joined the bank in 1999 as a natural gas trader and has been head of North America power and gas trading and origination since 2008.

414,"   By Beth Pinsker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Most experts expect U.S. interest rates to rise in 2015, but no one knows when and by how much.Rate increases rarely happen with great velocity, though. The last time the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate, which banks use to lend money overnight, was in June 2006. It brought the rate to 5.25 percent - after 17 increases. By 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis, the federal funds rate was down to zero, where it has stayed.  A jump in interest rates in 2015 could have a big financial impact, however, especially if you are looking to buy a home, have credit card debt or own bonds. Here is what to expect:CONSUMER LOANS Rates for consumer loans, which include mortgages and automobiles, are bouncing around 3.75 percent, a quarter percentage point above historic lows reached in May 2013. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com, expects a series of rate hikes in the year ahead. ""This is going to be a very volatile year,"" says McBride. Overall, however, the net change will probably be within 1 percentage point.For a car buyer, a change from 4 percent to 5 percent would be almost imperceptible. The average auto loan is $27,000, and borrowing that much over five years would mean a difference of just $12 a month. Home loans are another story, so plan accordingly. Over 30 years, that 1 percentage point difference in interest rates on a $100,000 mortgage would mean you would pay about $22,000 more, according to an example provided by Quicken.  CREDIT CARDS Consumers looking to roll over credit card debt to a zero percent balance transfer should act fast, because offers have never been more generous. ""We don't expect offers to get better,"" says Odysseas Papadimitriou, chief executive officer of CardHub.com, which rates credit card offers. Duration of deals is at an all-time high, at an average of 11 months, and the average balance transfer fee is only 3 percent. These deals could disappear if the Fed raises rates significantly or a tanking economy causes default rates to surge, Papadimitriou adds. Consumers tend to focus on the length of the balance transfer deal, which can be up to 24 months, but Papadimitriou says you must also consider the monthly payments, annual and transfer fees and the interest rate after the introductory period ends. To learn how much you will save each month, use an online calculator like Cardhub's. It will tell you, for instance, that if you have average credit card debt of $7,000 and are paying the average rate of 14 percent, you would save enough to pay off your debt two months faster if you transferred it to a zero-percent card with no fee.  Most bank's websites also provide some suggestions. For example, the Citizens Bank Platinum MasterCard offers a zero-percent balance transfer for 15 months with no balance transfer or annual fees.  SAVING RATES If you are a saver looking for higher yields, life is not about to get rosier in 2015. ""Rates are brutal,"" says Morgan Quinn, feature writer for  GOBankingRates.com. The yield on the typical savings account is less than 1 percent. Good news in this category amounts to rates tipping over 1 percent on some CDs and savings accounts with high balances.  Interest rates on savings accounts probably will not head toward 3 percent until 2020, according to GOBankingRates latest report. In the meantime, the highest rate Quinn was able to find was 1.4 percent at EverBank for ""yield-pledge"" checking with a $1,500 minimum opening deposit and an ongoing balance of between $50,000 and $100,000. BONDS The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 1.89 on Monday, its lowest since May 2013. If interest rates go up, ""it will be a tough year for bond investors,"" Bankrate's McBride says. You can mitigate this risk with individual bonds by simply holding them to maturity, he says. But if you invest in bond funds, either directly or through target-date or managed funds in your retirement accounts, the value will probably decline. That is not all bad news if you just stay the course. McBride's advice: ""Buckle your seat belt and hold on.""(In paragraphs 18 and 20, corrects the capitalization in the name GOBankingRates to have a capital O.)

415,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former Morgan Stanley stockbroker accused of a three-man insider trading scheme in which one of his co-conspirators allegedly wrote stock tips on napkins before eating them has agreed to plead guilty, according to a court filing.Vladimir Eydelman has reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in New Jersey, U.S. Magistrate Judge Cathy Waldor said in an order filed on Thursday granting a 60-day continuance to allow time to schedule his plea.Eydelman was charged with the $5.6 million scheme alongside two other men: Frank Tamayo, a Brooklyn, New York, mortgage broker, and Steven Metro, then a managing clerk at New York law firm Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett.According to prosecutors, Metro passed tips about the firm’s clients to Tamayo, a friend and former law school classmate, at bars or coffee shops, where Metro would write down the ticker symbols of stocks to be purchased on napkins or sticky notes.Tamayo would then meet Eydelman in Grand Central station in Manhattan, show him the stock symbols and then “chew the paper or napkin” in order to destroy the evidence, the government said. Eydelman used the inside information to trade for himself, his family, his customers and Tamayo, prosecutors said. Tamayo, who is cooperating with authorities, pleaded guilty in September.It was not clear whether Eydelman would also cooperate with prosecutors, and the charges to which he expects to plead guilty are not known. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the plea agreement; a spokesman for New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman declined comment.The fraud allegedly started in 2009, when Metro told Tamayo that Liberty Media Corp might invest in Sirius XM Radio [SXRI.UL], then on the verge of bankruptcy. Tamayo then told Eydelman a “source” had told him about the bailout and advised him to buy Sirius stock, prosecutors said.Tamayo began recording conversations with his co-defendants in early 2014, authorities said.

422,"   By Tanya Agrawal and Lauren Tara LaCapra  Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley said it would pay a smaller portion of revenue in bonuses to its bankers and traders this year even in a better revenue environment.The bank reported a drop in fourth-quarter adjusted earnings, missing estimates, as it deferred fewer bonus payouts and unexpected market swings hit its division that trades bonds, currencies and commodities.In the past, Morgan Stanley has deferred up to 80 percent of its bonuses.But it said last month it would pay more up front because it was on a stronger financial footing and in a better position to bring its practices into line with rivals.Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday it would pay 39 percent or less of revenue from its institutional securities business to employees in 2015. Chief Executive James Gorman said in June the ratio would be 40 percent or less.The bank's shares were down 1.7 percent in morning trading.Compensation expenses rose to $5.1 billion from $4.0 billion, with about 41 percent of revenue from the bank's institutional securities business going into bonuses. While not strictly comparable, arch rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc paid out 36.8 percent.Gorman said he was not concerned about losing talent because of the lower payout ratio.""We get a very attractive employee base coming to this firm and frankly it's just not an issue,"" he said on a call. Choppy markets caused by factors ranging from plunging oil prices to political upheaval in Greece, sent investors scurrying last month, slashing the trading revenue of U.S. banks.Morgan Stanley had a ""very challenging"" quarter in commodities because of the decline in oil prices, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told Reuters.Excluding special items, revenue from trading fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities (FICC) fell 13.7 percent to $599 million. Goldman's FICC revenue fell 19 percent.Morgan Stanley has been shrinking its presence in the bond market as tougher capital requirements take hold, and the bank has said it is now more focused on returns than revenue. But its adjusted average return-on-equity fell to 4.5 percent in the quarter, below the 10 percent minimum Gorman wants. Revenue from the bank's increasingly important wealth management business rose 2.4 percent to $3.80 billion. But the pretax profit margin of 19 percent including adjustments was below the 20 percent Gorman has set as a minimum.Advisory revenue increased 8.2 percent to $488 million, while legal expenses fell to $284 million from $1.4 billion.Overall, earnings attributable to common shareholders rose to $920 million, or 47 cents per share, from $36 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.Adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share, as calculated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, missed the average analyst estimate of 48 cents.

423,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley plans to spend more money on share buybacks and dividends in 2015, executives said, in a step that could help the bank reach a key profitability target this year.The bank needs approval from the U.S. Federal Reserve before it can put more money toward shareholder rewards. Morgan Stanley has submitted a capital plan for 2015, but executives said on Tuesday that they are wary of detailing specifics until they receive a green light from the Fed.""What we look for is steady increases in capital returns over time - no discontinuous move - and our approach continues to focus on both share repurchase and dividends,"" Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. ""But, beyond that, we'll wait till we hear from the Federal Reserve.""Last year, Morgan Stanley received permission to double its quarterly dividend to 10 cents per common share and set aside $1 billion for buybacks through the first quarter of 2015. Altogether, it asked the Fed for permission to pay out 30 percent of its earnings through dividends and buybacks.An investor and several brokerage analysts who spoke to Reuters estimate that the bank will use about half of its profit to buy back shares and pay dividends. That would equate to about $2.85 billion, based on the average analyst estimate for Morgan Stanley's 2015 net income. Shareholders have waited years for Morgan Stanley to increase its payouts to catch up with big bank rivals that are already spending more than half of their earnings to investors, on average, according to Credit Suisse analysts.There are signs that Morgan Stanley is more confident about its progress in fixing itself. In December, the bank said it was paying employees more of their bonuses upfront, and deferring less, because it was on solid enough financial footing to do so.But the bank still has work to do to get its financial house in order. Its return on equity, a measure of how effectively it earns money using shareholder capital, was just 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter, excluding an accounting adjustment. The return on equity lags Goldman Sachs Group Inc's and JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s, as well as Morgan Stanley's own target of 10 percent. Gorman reiterated that target on Tuesday, but said it was too dependent on market factors outside of his control to give a timeframe to reach it. He only promised it would take less than five years.Morgan Stanley can improve return on equity by boosting profits or reducing shareholder equity through stock buybacks. Investors expect the bank to do both.

426,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 20 (Fitch) Morgan Stanley's (MS) stated fourth quarter earnings  of $1.08 billion were down relative to the sequential quarter and comparatively  flat relative to the year-ago quarter, according to Fitch Ratings. There were a  number of items in the quarter which impacted results including a tax benefit  for $1.4 billion and a DVA charge of $223 million which positively impact  results and $1.1 billion of accelerated compensation expenses and $468 million  charge related to the implementation of a Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA)  related to uncollateralized derivatives both of which negatively impacted  results. Fitch calculated pre-tax profits, which exclude CVA/DVA adjustments, this  quarter's FVA charge, and various other minor gains/losses amounted to $110  million, or a 0.06% pre-tax adjusted return on ending assets (ROA).  Fitch notes  that this calculation is on a pre-tax basis includes the company's compensation  charge, but not the somewhat offsetting tax benefit.  For sensitivity purposes,  excluding the compensation charge yields pre-tax earnings of $1.5 billion, or an  adjusted pre-tax ROA of 0.75%. Overall, Fitch considers the company's results to be comparatively weaker than  some larger peers this quarter amid the challenging revenue environment for MS's  institutional securities (IS) businesses. Within IS advisory revenues remained good relative to both the sequential and  year-ago quarters, though both equity and fixed income underwriting revenues  were down leading to overall lower investment banking revenue relative to third  quarter 2014 (3Q'14) and 4Q'13.  Both equity and fixed income & commodities  (FICC) revenue were down relative to the sequential quarter.  Relative to the  year-ago quarter equities revenue was higher, but FICC was still lower although  this was partially impacted by the FVA charge noted above. Despite what Fitch views as some weakness in the IS business, the agency notes  that MS's wealth management business continues to comparatively improve and  become a larger component of the company's overall revenue mix. Additionally,  the pre-tax margin in MS's wealth management business remained satisfactory at  19% in 4Q'14, though still below the wealth management profit margin of some  larger peers and MS's stated targets.  That said, Fitch continues to view MS's  revenue and business mix change positively from a credit perspective, and notes  that it could lead to some upwards momentum in the company's Viability Rating  (VR) over time. MS's transitionally phased-in Basel 3 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the advanced approaches was 14.2% at 4Q'14, down just modestly from 14.4% in the  sequential quarter, but up from 12.8% in the year-ago quarter.  As the company  continues to move towards fully phased-in Basel 3 CET1 capital ratios Fitch  would expect continued risk-weighted asset (RWA) optimization to support the  company's capital position over time. Fitch continues to note that MS's liquidity position remains good.  The  company's deposits grew to $134 billion in 4Q'14, up 7% from the sequential  quarter, and 19% from the year-ago quarter.  The company's long-term debt  outstanding remained relatively constant at $152 billion.  Additionally, MS's  Global liquidity reserve remained good, and modestly ticked up to $193 billion  at 4Q'14.

That compares to a prior target, outlined by Chief Executive James Gorman in June, of 40 percent or less, depending on revenue.""Most important, it's 39 percent in a flat revenue environment as distinct from previously looking for more revenue,"" Porat in an interview.

435,"  * Songbird capitulates after bid wins at least 86 pct backing* Bidders welcome statement, urge shareholders to accept terms* Songbird says still believes 350p/shr offer undervalues estate* Songbird shares up 7.5 pct   (Adds QIA-Brookfield statement, advisors, updates shares)By Paul SandleLONDON, Jan 28 A Qatari-led consortium looked set to win its long-running battle to buy Songbird Estates Plc  on Wednesday after the owner of London's Canary Wharf business district dropped its opposition to the $4 billion offer.Songbird said it still thought the price undervalued its properties but with no rival bid forthcoming and holders of 86 percent of the shares backing the deal, it said minority investors should accept.The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and its bid partner launched a 350 pence-per-share offer direct to Songbird shareholders in December, hoping to add a financial district rivaling the City of London to landmarks already in its portfolio such as the Shard skyscraper and Harrods department store.Canary Wharf's steel and glass towers, home to banks such as HSBC, Citi and JP Morgan, embody the change in London's economy in the second half of the 20th century as industry dwindled and financial services grew. The redevelopment of the former West India Docks, which traded in everything from tobacco to bananas, was championed in the 1980s by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who saw the need for more space for a financial sector booming after her ""big bang"" reforms.The QIA already owned 29 percent of Songbird, which in turn owns 70 percent of Canary Wharf Group. Its partner in the deal, U.S. investor Brookfield Property Partners, has 22 percent of Canary Wharf Group.QIA and Brookfield welcomed Songbird's announcement and urged other shareholders to accept the offer.The complicated structure featuring a layer of shareholders in Songbird and another in Canary Wharf tended to leave Songbird trading at a discount to the value of its property and helped make it a takeover target, analysts said. GROWTH POTENTIAL Songbird said earlier this month the offer was an 8 percent discount to its net asset value of 381p at the end of November and put no value on its growth potential.Shares in the group, which had been trading about 10 percent below the offer price due to scepticism it would go through, were up 7.5 percent at 345.5p by 1300 GMT. Songbird had already said that if one or more of the other three large shareholders, New York-based investor Simon Glick, China Investment Corp and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, were to accept, the offer would become unconditional. Combined they own just over 50 percent.Since the offer looked like a foregone conclusion after all three major investors indicated they would approve, minority shareholders could be left holding stock in a group no longer listed and therefore difficult to value, Songbird said.Songbird, backed by investment bank Morgan Stanley, had won control of Canary Wharf in 2004 with a 1.7 billion pound cash offer. It saw commercial property values in London rise for three years until the global financial crisis.Canary Wharf had already been through boom and bust; Britain was in recession when its flagship One Canada Square skyscraper opened in 1991, resulting in the bankruptcy of developer Olympia & York (O&Y).George Iacobescu, a 69-year Romanian-born engineer, oversaw the original development for O&Y and continues to lead Canary Wharf Group. He is in line for a 3.5 million pound windfall from the takeover.The company is preparing to start work on two major developments: a 60-storey tower with the first residential property on the estate and a 20-acre waterside site with 3,100 homes and office buildings.QIA was advised by Barclays, Citigroup and HSBC, while Rothschild, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Cazenove worked for Songbird.Shareholders have until Thursday to accept the offer.

446,"   By Jennifer Ablan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pimco said on Tuesday that it has hired Joachim Fels, formerly managing director and chief economist at Morgan Stanley, as the world's biggest bond manager continues to bolster its ranks after a leadership shake-up over the last year.Fels will join as a managing director and global economic advisor, the Newport Beach, Calif.-headquartered Pacific Investment Management Co said in a statement.He will be based in Newport Beach, reporting to Daniel Ivascyn, Pimco's group chief investment officer. Ivascyn said in a statement: ""Joachim is a highly regarded global economic expert who will bring tremendous insights and make significant contributions to Pimco's investment process.""During his 19 years with Morgan Stanley, Fels also held positions including chief international economist, chief global fixed income economist and co-head of European economics.  Over the past year, Pimco, which saw $150 billion of cash withdrawals from Pimco's U.S. open-end mutual funds, has made some notable hires after management turmoil spooked investors, including the shock resignation of Bill Gross in September from the company he helped co-found. Gross' exit came only eight months after his top deputy, Mohamed El-Erian, quit amid acrimony.

454,"   By John Geddie | LONDON  LONDON Feb 12 Another round of Greek debt relief could make the country's bonds a safer investment than those of several other euro zone countries, a major U.S bank has told its clients.Morgan Stanley, a market-maker in Greek bonds, said in an online video that if Athens is given the same leeway from European creditors that it received in the past, its debt-to-GDP ratio of 175 percent would carry the ""credit risk"" of a country with a ratio of just 88 percent.Seven countries in the euro zone have debt ratios above this, according to Eurostat: Portugal (128 percent), Ireland (123 percent), Italy (128 percent), Belgium (105 percent), Cyprus (102 percent), Spain and France (both 92 percent).""The credit risk of the 320 billion euros of debt in Greece, may in fact be lower than in some other euro zone countries,"" said Paolo Batori, the bank's global head of emerging market fixed income strategy told Reuters. With around 90 percent of Greece's debt owed to public bodies including its euro zone partners, the bloc's EFSF bailout fund and the International Monetary Fund, the make-up of Greece's debt is unique in the single currency club.Batori argues that a major part of its debt - a 107 billion euro bailout loan from the EFSF - should not even be counted as debt because it bears no interest for the next eight years and is not due to be paid back for 30 years. The Greek government is lobbying for further debt relief, with new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said to be targeting 53 billion euros of bilateral loans from other European countries.Batori said that if these loans were restructured to look like the EFSF loans, then they could also be discounted, making Greece's debts look very manageable. ""When you look at the specific characteristics of the components of the debt, some parts contribute to Greek credit risk less than what the market is thinking, or what a traditional approach implies,"" said Batori.Sustainability - the country's ability to pay interest and repay the debt at maturity - is key to assessing the risk attached to investing in these bonds, he added.Morgan Stanley, one of Greece's 22 primary dealer banks, is not alone in calling for a rethink of Greece's debts.Japonica Partners, a U.S. investment firm, maintains that under different accounting standards, Greece's net debt is just 18 percent of GDP.

460,"  (Corrects 10th paragraph to read ""anti-austerity parties"", not governments)* Despite firewalls, Grexit would hit euro, bonds and stocks* Investors to seek safe havens if Greece left euro zone* Wariness to political contagion new factor since 2012* Some see post-Grexit falls as potential buying opportunityBy John GeddieLONDON, Feb 19 For all the firewalls Europe put in place over the last three years, the actions investors say they would take if Greece left the euro currency bloc suggest the ensuing panic would rumble through financial markets.The imminent launch of a bond-buying scheme from the European Central Bank has so far quelled the anxiety that in 2012, when Greece last looked set for the exit, prompted a steady stream of money out of the euro zone.But this could quickly change if the current stand-off between the new anti-austerity government in Athens and its international creditors shifts the balance of probability towards Grexit.Investors say the euro would take a hammering as foreign funds sought shelter in U.S. and British assets, euro zone stocks would fall, and borrowing costs in the bloc's low-rated countries would soar as those obliged to stick with Europe tried to stem losses by buying German government bonds.""A lot of international investors would use it as an opportunity to just sell to the ECB and leave the euro area, similar to what we have seen before,"" said Patrick O'Donnell of Aberdeen Asset Management, a fund with over 400 billion euros under management.Before talks on Friday which could be the last chance for Greece to grab a financial lifeline before its bailout expires on Feb. 28, Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said no one could calculate the possible contagion from a Greek exit. U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley had a stab this week, advising clients how to limit losses in such an event - ranging from staking bets on the euro weakening and U.S. and British bond yields falling, and insuring banking stocks against default.But there is little evidence as yet of investors protecting themselves against a Grexit threat.The latest Reuters polls show only 25 percent of economists think Grexit will happen this year, far less than the 90 percent chance Citigroup attached to such an outcome at the height of the debt crisis in 2012.Markets, outside Greece, have barely stirred even with anti-austerity parties in the likes of Spain and Ireland also rising to prominence.Aberdeen's O'Donnell remains heavily invested in the bloc's low-rated peripheral bonds, waiting for the ECB to buoy prices further when it launches quantitative easing in March.Gareth Colesmith, a portfolio manager at Insight Investment, said that without the prospect of the ECB's scheme, borrowing costs in the bloc's other weak links - Portugal, Italy and Spain - would already be a lot higher. This is was what happened in 2012, as investors became convinced that Greece leaving would create a domino effect eventually resulting in a break-up of the union and a return to pre-euro currencies.Since then, the ECB has pledged to do whatever it takes to save the euro, Europe's financial system has been through a comprehensive health check, and the ECB has unveiled QE, which many see as a road-map towards debt mutualisation.But, says Insight's Colesmith, it may not be enough.""If the shift of investor sentiment is sufficiently large, it will only cushion the blow rather than prevent it.""International funds could pull investments out of the euro area, exacerbating a fall in the currency that could see it tumble towards parity with the U.S. dollar. Hedge funds may then start to prey on countries most likely to follow Greece out the door. Portugal, the only other country to have junk-rated debt, is an obvious candidate.POLITICAL CONTAGION Unlike in 2012, potential political contagion could also become a factor in investment decisions.Spain too could be targeted with the Podemos party - a hard-left ally of Greece's Syriza - leading the polls before elections in December.""It would be very much a case of picking off the weakest members of the herd,"" said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.For some investors, a post-Grexit selloff could have a silver lining. Julien-Pierre Nouen, chief economist at Lazard Frères Gestion in Paris, said that with European growth improving, signs of banks lending again and QE in prospect, the firm remains overweight euro zone equities.""We would be buyers on any market weakness. If the market falls by 10 percent we would certainly be buyers,"" he saidMoney managers that have to remain invested in the bloc, would initially turn to the safest assets if the bloc fractured.Many would buy German government bonds - an uninviting prospect when easy central bank policy has driven yields on much of this debt below zero, effectively meaning investors are paying for the privilege of lending.""It is really a question of fear versus greed a lot of the time in financial markets and, if fear takes over, bonds will be bought even at these levels,"" said Mark Dowding, a portfolio manager at London-based fund Bluebay.

462,"  NEW YORK Feb 23 Dynasty Financial Partners, the high-end service provider started by former Smith Barney brokers that supports around 30 independent financial adviser firms, said that two St. Louis-based financial advisers left Morgan Stanley to join their platform on Monday.Scott Highmark, 41, and Larry Shikles, 51, resigned from Morgan Stanley on Friday, and opened their new offices about 10 minutes closer to mid-town St. Louis on Monday, Highmark told Reuters.The two learned about Dynasty from their former colleagues at Smith Barney, where Highmark and Shikles used to work before Morgan Stanley bought the firm from Citigroup in early 2009.Todd Thomson, Dynasty's chairman, previously served as the head of Smith Barney, and Shirl Penney, Dynasty's founder and president, was formerly the head of business development for Smith Barney. Penney founded Dynasty in late 2010 to provide advisers who left major Wall Street brokerages to start independent businesses with transition support, technology, research and custodial support.With Highmark and Shikles, Dynasty now has 27 independent adviser firms on its platform that manage a combined $23 billion in client assets. Highmark and Shikles managed around $800 million in client assets at Morgan Stanley serving primarily multi-generation family business clients and corporate executives. Advisers who change firms typically take 70 percent or more of their clients with them within the first six months of launching their new business.Joining Highmark and Shikles from Morgan Stanley are Jim Steiner, Missy Brown, Barbi Charleville, Shannon Fowler, Darlene Smith and Gail Wild.Prior to joining Morgan Stanley in 2013, Steiner was a professional sports agent. Highmark, who played basketball for his alma mater St. Louis University, said they plan on offering family office services for sports clients in the future.

475,"  (Recasts to focus on settlement talks detailed by source)By Karen Freifeld and Lauren Tara LaCapraNEW YORK, March 2 Morgan Stanley is in discussions with New York's attorney general to settle accusations that the Wall Street bank mishandled subprime mortgage deals before the 2008 financial crisis, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.Any settlement would be separate from a $2.6 billion agreement Morgan Stanley reached last month with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.Morgan Stanley said in a regulatory filing on Monday that the New York Attorney General's office indicated on Jan. 13 that it plans to file a lawsuit over alleged misrepresentations and omissions of material information in about 30 subprime securitizations. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office indicated to Morgan Stanley that the potential lawsuit would be brought under the Martin Act, a New York law that gives extraordinary powers to an attorney general regarding financial fraud. The accusations pertain to Morgan Stanley's due diligence, underwriting and valuation of loans in about 30 securitizations, as well as the properties securing them, the bank said.Morgan Stanley disagrees with the allegations and has presented defenses to the attorney general, the bank said in its annual 10-K regulatory filing. Liz DeBold, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, declined comment.Morgan Stanley has added $2.8 billion to its legal reserves to cover outstanding matters since its earnings report in January. That amount includes the $2.6 billion agreement it reached last week to settle legacy mortgage-bond claims. Due to that settlement, Morgan Stanley revised the 2014 earnings it reported on Jan. 20 downward to $3.15 billion, or $1.60 per share, from $5.82 billion, or $2.95 per share.Overall, Morgan Stanley said its legal expenses last year rose to $3.41 billion from $1.95 billion in 2013.Shares of Morgan Stanley were up 0.8 percent at $36.06 in morning trading.

476,"  FRANKFURT Philips' (PHG.AS) sale of the majority of its lighting components business is nearing an end as buyout groups are lining up final bids, three sources said on Monday. A consortium of private equity firms CVC [CVC.UL] and KKR (KKR.N) as well as investor Bain Capital were expected to hand in offers by a Monday deadline valuing the business at roughly 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion), the sources said.The medical electronics-to-coffee machines group, which started making light bulbs 123 years ago, is splitting off its lighting business, whose earnings have been squeezed in a price war with Chinese makers of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). It has vowed to focus on higher-margin activities. Separately and ahead of a potential spin-off, it has combined its so called Lumileds and its car lights division into a stand-alone company and has mandated Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to find a buyer for the business, which has 1.4 billion euros in sales.  Philips has said the lighting components business would be better placed to compete on a standalone basis for outside customers, which currently regard Philips as a rival. It intends to hold onto a minority stake, however, as about a fifth of Lumileds's sales of 500 million euros are made to the parent.Profit figures for the business have not been made public but sources have said in the past its core earnings or EBITDA are about 290 million euros.  Peers such as Hella (HLE.DE), Cree (CREE.O) and Acuity (AYI.N) trade in a range of 6.1 to 13.4 times expected earnings.  Philips and the buyout groups declined to comment.

478,"  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley, the biggest U.S. brokerage firm with more than 16,000 financial advisers, elevated Sara Furber to a new position as head of corporate and institutional wealth management and wealth management strategy, the company said in an internal memo on Tuesday.Furber, who has been chief operating officer of the wealth division, will run ""institutional"" businesses within the retail brokerage group, including the division's stock plan and retirement plan and government entities and corporate cash businesses, the memo said. She also will oversee the Graystone unit that works with endowments and family offices as well as oversee Morgan Stanley Wealth's digital platforms and its Client Advisory Center for less affluent customers, the memo said. The realignment comes in the wake of the departure of long-time executive Doug Ketterer that was announced last Thursday, according to the memo, which was written by Morgan Stanley Wealth head Greg Fleming. Ketterer was head of strategy and client management.  Morgan Stanley named Adam Kudelka to replace Furber as chief operating office of the wealth unit. Kudelka, who runs the human resources area, will be replaced by Larry Frers, who oversees human resources for brokers and managers in the ""field,"" Morgan Stanley's system of more than 600 branches. Furber's appointment puts two women near the top of the management structure at Morgan Stanley Wealth. Shelley O'Connor, who has been head of field management since February 2014, adds Ketterer's responsibilities for international wealth management, global sports and entertainment and the client development group, according to the memo. O'Connor also now has sole responsibility for Morgan Stanley's private wealth management unit, which serves clients who keep about $10 million or more with the company.

482,"   By Freya Berry and Andrés González | LONDON/MADRID  LONDON/MADRID Three bidding groups have entered the second round in the race for Spanish natural gas distributor Madrilena Red de Gas, majority owned by Morgan Stanley (MS.N), three sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Canada's CPP is bidding alongside German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for the asset, estimated to be worth between 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and 1.8 billion including some 500 million euros of debt.Canada's PSP and European fund manager Arcus have also teamed up to make an offer, while a third group comprises Chinese state fund Gingko Tree and Dutch pension fund PGGM, the sources said. Madrilena Red de Gas, Morgan Stanley, Allianz and ADIA declined to comment. Arcus, CPP, Gingko Tree, PSP and PGGM were not immediately available to comment.  Citi (C.N) is selling the asset, which is majority owned by Morgan Stanley's infrastructure arm. Citi declined to comment. The U.S. bank has also toyed with a stock market flotation for the company, but has decided it could get a better price through a sale, one of the people said.  Madrilena Red de Gas has some 5,350 kilometers of pipelines and had core earnings (EBITDA) of 149.2 million euros in 2014. Last July Spain introduced major reforms in the gas sector aimed at cutting gas transport and distribution fees, and ensuring stability in a system that has struggled with both excess supply and capacity. Madrilena originally comprised of gas supply and distribution activities. It was bought from Gas Natural (GAS.MC) by Galp Energia (GALP.LS) and Morgan Stanley in 2010 for a total of 800 million euros, after regulators forced a sale.  Galp Energia took on the supply businesses, while Morgan Stanley bought the distribution assets.

489,"  * Citigroup, Morgan Stanley up after the bell following Fed review* Shake Shack shares fall after the bell on results* Indexes down: Dow 0.2 pct, S&P 500 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct   (Updates close with dollar details; Bank of America, Shake Shack down after the bell, Citigroup up)By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK, March 11 U.S. stocks ended lower for a second straight session on Wednesday as worries grew about the timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike and dollar strength further dampened the outlook for U.S. earnings.The move followed the S&P 500's biggest one-day decline in two months in the previous session, which surpassed a selloff of similar magnitude on Friday. The S&P 500 is now off 3.6 percent from its March 2 record closing high and is down 0.9 percent for the year so far.Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report, which solidified views the Fed could raise rates as early as June, was largely behind the recent jitters. ""It's all about rates. I think many are holding onto the view that if the Fed raises rates, stocks stop in their tracks and reverse, and the bull market ends,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.55 points, or 0.16 percent, to 17,635.39, the S&P 500 lost 3.92 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,040.24 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 9.85 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,849.94.The dollar extended its gains against the euro, following the start of the European Central Bank's 1.1 trillion euro bond-buying program. The euro fell 1.5 percent to trade near $1.05 for the first time in 12 years and the single currency  is down 12 percent against the greenback since January. The dollar's sharp rise has added to worries the currency will continue to weigh on U.S. multinationals' earnings.""The dollar continues to strengthen. That's a double-edged kind of development in that it will lead to more investor interest in the United States, but on the other hand, it hampers the ability of U.S. multinationals to compete overseas,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston.S&P 500 earnings are now expected to decline 2.7 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. Shares of Tyson Foods were down 5.6 percent at $37.55 and Pilgrims Pride Corp dropped 4.4 percent. The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in Arkansas.After the bell, shares of major banks were active following the Fed's review of their capital plans. Shares of Bank of America were down about 1 percent after the Fed approved its capital plans but directed the bank to address process weaknesses.Shares of Citigroup jumped 3.1 percent to $53.95 while Morgan Stanley gained 3.1 percent to $36.02.Also after the close, Shake Shack fell 6.5 percent to $43.85 following the release of its results.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,769 to 1,275; on the Nasdaq, 1,546 issues rose and 1,172 fell.About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

495,"   By Gleb Gorodyankin and Dmitry Zhdannikov | MOSCOW/LONDON  MOSCOW/LONDON Trading house Trafigura is set to become the largest exporter of oil from Russian state-owned energy major Rosneft under a deal it is negotiating with the sanctions-hit company, industry sources told Reuters.From April, Trafigura will start handling more than a dozen tankers or 1 million tonnes a month (240,000 barrels per day) of oil from Rosneft, over a tenth of Russia's overall oil exports, three trading sources familiar with the development told Reuters.Rosneft and Trafigura declined to comment.Since coming under U.S. and EU sanctions last year imposed over Russia's role in Ukraine, Rosneft has been working hard to raise short-term financing, still not forbidden by sanctions, in exchange for oil exports, to help it meet debt repayments.The sanctions also blocked its ambition to expand into global oil trading, by killing off a deal to buy U.S. bank Morgan Stanley's oil trading division at the end of 2014.The squeeze on Rosneft has been compounded by a collapse in oil prices and the rapid devaluation of the rouble -- a crisis the central bank said Rosneft contributed to when it borrowed a large sum through the local bond market in the run-up to the repayment of a $7 billion loan to Western banks in December.Swiss-based Trafigura has been trading oil with Rosneft under a two-year old deal but volumes rarely amounted to more than two tankers a month -- dwarfed by deals with rival Glencore and Vitol as well as oil majors such as Eni, Total and Royal Dutch Shell.It was not immediately clear whether the new deal would involve any short-term financing between Trafigura and Rosneft, or whether it would extend beyond oil trading.     In February, Trafigura surprised rivals by unexpectedly obtaining extra cargoes from Rosneft in exchange for short-term financing just ahead of another $7 billion debt repayment.  Rosneft has now passed the peak of debt servicing but needs dozens of billions of dollars to fund field expansion and its refinery modernisation program.OIL MAJORS TO LOSE VOLUMES  Rosneft sells its crude at six-month tenders and under longer-term pre-finance deals -- a $10 billion five-year loan with Glencore and Vitol dating back to 2012 and a separate $1.5 billion, 2013 loan with Trafigura. Sanctions have banned long-term financing of Rosneft from 2014 -- a measure that has forced Western companies to pull out of such deals -- but financing for a period of up to 30 days is allowed.Trading sources from rival companies said signs of the upcoming deal between Trafigura and Rosneft were evident from how Rosneft's traditional six-month tender to sell oil from in April-September 2015 unfolded.Rosneft has postponed the announcement of the tender results, has significantly cut volumes on offer and has asked buyers to agree to a 'zero optionality '-- a market term meaning it can nominate no cargoes to a winner in a given month if it decides to place volumes elsewhere. Overall maximum volumes on offer for April-September have been cut by around 2.5 million tonnes versus the previous six-month tender.That brought market players to a conclusion that Rosneft is working on a separate deal with Trafigura.""The results from Rosneft were due on Feb. 27 but they have launched it into a fourth round,"" one trader said, referring to an unprecedented decision by Rosneft to ask bidders to improve offers for a fourth time during the same six month tender.Traders said that under preliminary results, Shell and Gunvor had won the rights to export between zero and three-four cargoes a month from the port of Primorsk in April-September, with BP or possibly Total preliminary chosen to export one cargo a month from the Baltic.Shell is believed to have won the rights to export Aframax cargoes in the Mediterranean, China's Unipec wont the right to export Suezmax cargoes from the same port. and Trafigura will market all cargoes of Kazakh CPC Blend crude belonging to Rosneft.If preliminary tender results were confirmed oil majors Eni, Total and  Shell would be among the biggest losers of Russian oil volumes.

505,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley bid adieu to another senior executive who was thought to be on a list of potential successors to Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, but a new generation of CEO candidates is rising inside the bank.On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley announced that Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 57, would be leaving at the end of April to head back to Silicon Valley where she has professional and personal roots, to become CFO of Google Inc.    Porat's departure did not surprise other executives inside the bank, who pointed to her age - a year older than Gorman - and the belief that he may not leave for five more years.Soon after Gorman took over in 2010, there were at least four contenders for his seat: Porat, Colm Kelleher and Paul Taubman, who jointly ran investment banking and trading, and Greg Fleming, whom Gorman brought in to run asset management, later adding wealth management to his responsibilities.Two of those, Porat and Taubman, are gone or soon to be gone. The other two, Fleming, 52, and Kelleher, 57, may be too old to be CEO when Gorman retires, management experts and Morgan Stanley insiders said. Fleming has been approached for other CEO spots, and may tire of waiting to head up Morgan Stanley.""You just can't anticipate that people who are high potential and seasoned are going to wait, so it is critical to have at least two generations of candidates that are being developed,"" said Jane Stevenson, who runs the CEO succession practice for executive search firm Korn Ferry. Kelleher and Fleming are involved with long-term succession planning within their respective businesses, and aware that neither may be the next CEO of Morgan Stanley, a person familiar with the matter said. They still play important roles because if the unexpected happens - if Gorman becomes ill or gets injured or cannot continue in his role for some reason - either would be qualified to take his place immediately.One main player in the organization is Ted Pick, the 46-year-old global head of equities and research, whose business has blossomed and made up for lost revenue from a declining focus on fixed-income trading. Sources inside Morgan Stanley widely expect him to move into bigger roles.    Gorman has also made several moves to beef up the ranks of possible successors, people familiar with the matter said.

506,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK, March 24  NEW YORK, March 24 Morgan Stanley bid adieu to another senior executive who was thought to be on a list of potential successors to Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, but a new generation of CEO candidates is rising inside the bank.On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley announced that Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 57, would be leaving at the end of April to head back to Silicon Valley where she has professional and personal roots, to become CFO of Google Inc.Porat's departure did not surprise other executives inside the bank, who pointed to her age - a year older than Gorman - and the belief that he may not leave for five more years.Soon after Gorman took over in 2010, there were at least four contenders for his seat: Porat, Colm Kelleher and Paul Taubman, who jointly ran investment banking and trading, and Greg Fleming, whom Gorman brought in to run asset management, later adding wealth management to his responsibilities.Two of those, Porat and Taubman, are gone or soon to be gone. The other two, Fleming, 52, and Kelleher, 57, may be too old to be CEO when Gorman retires, management experts and Morgan Stanley insiders said. Fleming has been approached for other CEO spots, and may tire of waiting to head up Morgan Stanley. ""You just can't anticipate that people who are high potential and seasoned are going to wait, so it is critical to have at least two generations of candidates that are being developed,"" said Jane Stevenson, who runs the CEO succession practice for executive search firm Korn Ferry.Kelleher and Fleming are involved with long-term succession planning within their respective businesses, and aware that neither may be the next CEO of Morgan Stanley, a person familiar with the matter said. They still play important roles because if the unexpected happens - if Gorman becomes ill or gets injured or cannot continue in his role for some reason - either would be qualified to take his place immediately.One main player in the organization is Ted Pick, the 46-year-old global head of equities and research, whose business has blossomed and made up for lost revenue from a declining focus on fixed-income trading. Sources inside Morgan Stanley widely expect him to move into bigger roles. (link: reut.rs/113jq8v) Gorman has also made several moves to beef up the ranks of possible successors, people familiar with the matter said.On Tuesday, Gorman named Porat's replacement: Jonathan Pruzan, 46, an investment banker who co-heads Morgan Stanley's financial institutions group.The bank also announced executive changes last week.

The bank cut its expenses, excluding compensation, to 29 percent of its revenue last year, down from 34 percent in 2012.Google's costs have jumped as the company embarked on an increasing number of ambitious projects. Last year, the company's revenue grew 19 percent, while total expenses rose 23.4 percent, a trend that alarmed some analysts. ""You want someone to come in there and push back against the free spenders,"" said Colin Gillis, an equity research analyst at BGC Partners, a brokerage, adding that investors hope Porat will be that person.Google's shares rose as much as 2.5 percent on Tuesday after Porat's appointment was announced by both companies. She will start her new job on May 26. Porat is the latest among a string of Wall Street executives to leave an industry that is increasingly regulated to move into the more free-wheeling technology sector, where fortunes can be built fast but businesses can also become irrelevant overnight.Total compensation to Google's departing CFO was twice as much as Porat's for the three years through 2013 - $62.2 million vs $29.6 million, according to public filings by the companies. Google has not disclosed how much it expects to pay Porat.She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987, and led Morgan Stanley's investment banking business for tech companies during the Internet boom, working with Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc, among others.Some analysts took her appointment as a sign Google acquisitions could pick up. Porat ran the investment banking business for financial companies including banks, and during the financial crisis she became Morgan Stanley's point person with regulators and other government officials in Washington. Porat, 57, was considered a potential candidate to become chief executive whenever current CEO James Gorman steps down.But several high-level Morgan Stanley sources who have spoken to Reuters about succession planning over the past two years said she was not seen as a top contender. Instead, they pointed to two other executives – Gregory Fleming, 52, who runs wealth management and asset management, and Colm Kelleher, 57, who runs investment banking and trading – as more likely contenders.  Some observers saw gender bias at play, given her qualifications and Wall Street's history as a male-dominated industry. At an event last year, Porat criticized the lack of female leadership in corporate America as ""an embarrassment.""""If a woman 'leans in,' but is leaning against a door that is nailed shut, no amount of leaning will bust down the door,"" she said. ""So I think we must hold our organizations accountable where they control the doors by demanding clarity and transparency around succession planning.""Critics have also accused Silicon Valley's culture of being hostile to women. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, is suing her firm for discrimination. The trial heads into final arguments on Tuesday. WALL STREET IS LESS FUN  Porat joins an array of bankers, analysts, and other executives that have left Wall Street as strict post-crisis regulations have made the business safer and stodgier. Some of these executives have headed into the technology sector, including Anthony Noto, once an investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, who last year became CFO at Twitter Inc. In 2010, Mary Meeker, a widely followed tech analyst at Morgan Stanley, left the bank to join Kleiner Perkins.Porat has ties to Silicon Valley, having spent much of her childhood in California and attended Stanford University, where she serves on the board of trustees. She has spent time building her connections with Washington. During the financial crisis, she led the Morgan Stanley teams advising the U.S. Treasury on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank on American International Group Inc.Those ties to Washington could have translated into a government post - she was widely reported to have been a candidate to be the Treasury deputy secretary, but said she was not interested.Porat will replace Patrick Pichette at Google, who said on March 10 that he planned to retire.At Morgan Stanley, Jonathan Pruzan, co-head of the bank's global financial institutions group in investment banking, will become CFO.

511,"  * Russia's Rosneft to sell Trafigura up to 1.6 mln T in April* Trafigura's April volumes of Russian oil second only to China* Rosneft's own trading ambitions blocked by sanctions* Trafigura to receive 38 pct of Rosneft's exportsBy Gleb Gorodyankin and Dmitry ZhdannikovMOSCOW/LONDON, March 27 Trafigura is emerging as the new king of Russian oil trading, expanding its deal with sanctions-hit Rosneft to export $500 million worth of crude in April from the Baltic, the Mediterranean and Pacific ports, market sources said.The move comes as European Union and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia last year over its role in Ukraine have severely restricted financing options for Russian companies, forcing Rosneft to seek alternative ways to meet debt repayments.The squeeze on Rosneft has been compounded by a collapse in oil prices and the rapid devaluation of the rouble, while the sanctions also blocked its ambition to expand into global oil trading by killing off a deal to buy U.S. bank Morgan Stanley's  oil trading division at the end of 2014.That opened the door for the likes of Trafigura, and in February market sources said the Swiss company had helped Rosneft to raise short-term financing, not forbidden by sanctions. Both Rosneft and Trafigura declined to comment on the new deal and it remains unclear what other benefits the Russian company might reap and whether Trafigura's April volumes will transform into a longer-term arrangement and extend beyond oil trading.Signs of a deal being prepared began to emerge in February, when Rosneft allocated five tankers to Trafigura rather than the usual two.Talk of a bigger deal gathered pace in March, when rival traders and oil majors said they expected Trafigura to export 10 cargoes of Urals, amounting to 1 million tonnes of oil. Their estimates were based on lower allocations to Trafigura's rivals.But the final volumes, details of which emerged this week, were almost 50 percent bigger than expected, giving Trafigura 1.6 million tonnes of oil worth more than $500 million. SECOND ONLY TO CHINA That is more than a tenth of Russian exports by sea and 38 percent of Rosneft's seaborne exports -- volume that will make the Trafigura the second-largest buyer of Russian oil behind China, which is buying about 2 million tonnes.""That is really beyond all expectations,"" said one trader with a rival company. ""Trafigura is the new king of Russian oil. For now."" The geographical split of the contract also took many market players by surprise.In addition to 10 cargoes of Urals and up to seven of CPC Blend from Russia's European Baltic and Black Sea ports, Trafigura will also receive two cargoes of prized light ESPO crude from the Pacific, rising to four in May, traders said and loading programmes showed.Before February, Trafigura had been trading oil with Rosneft under a two-year-old deal with volumes rarely amounting to more than two tankers a month -- dwarfed by deals with Glencore  and Vitol, as well as oil majors such as Eni, Total and Royal Dutch Shell.Rosneft sells its crude at six-month tenders and under longer-term pre-finance deals -- a $10 billion five-year loan with Glencore and Vitol dating back to 2012 and a separate $1.5 billion loan with Trafigura in 2013.Vitol and Glencore have kept their usual volumes in April while additional allocations to Trafigura came at the expense of oil majors Eni, Total and Shell.""We will have to buy from the spot market now,"" a trader at one of the companies said.He added that while buying from the spot market might not be a bad option because spot supplies are sometimes cheaper, it nevertheless reduces the company's ability to make precise predictions of flows coming in to its refining system.

512,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley has agreed to sell a compressed natural gas business that came under regulatory scrutiny shortly after its launch last year, according to a document obtained by Reuters and three people familiar with the matter.The bank will transfer the gas business, Wentworth, to a newly formed company called Pentagon Energy LLC. Two Morgan Stanley managers who were involved with Wentworth, Alberto Chiesara and Ryan Comerford, are leaving to join the new company as principals, according to those sources.Simon Greenshields, who had been co-head of Morgan Stanley's commodities business until January and was earlier said to be seeking to leave the bank through a Wentworth sale, is not joining Pentagon Energy.  The sources did not disclose any financial terms of the deal. Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the matter.Pentagon's plan is to take advantage of low natural gas prices in North America by exporting the commodity via container ships to under-served markets in the Caribbean and Central America.The countries Pentagon is targeting, such as the Dominican Republic, lack access to natural gas and use more expensive oil instead for their power plants. Yet the business may now be less lucrative than at the time of its launch, when crude oil traded at four to five times the cost of natural gas when measured in comparable thermal units. Today, following a long slide, crude trades at around three times the cost of U.S. gas, according to Reuters data.Reuters first revealed Morgan Stanley's plan last August after Wentworth filed an application with the U.S. Department of Energy to build, own and operate compression and container loading facility in Texas.  The plan soon drew attention from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has been examining banks' physical commodity operations, and contacted Morgan Stanley with questions about Wentworth. After the Fed reached out to Morgan Stanley, Chief Executive James Gorman told staff that the business had to be divested, casting doubt about its future. Lawmakers have put more pressure on Wall Street to exit physical commodities trading, with a Senate subcommittee releasing a highly critical report in November.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc have come under most intense scrutiny because of their historic dominance in commodities trading, and because of a 1999 legal clause that gives them more leeway to retain such operations.Morgan Stanley has been more aggressive about selling businesses that own, store or transport physical commodities than Goldman has, although its management has said that the bank plans to continue to act as a market maker for clients involved in physical commodities. It is unclear whether Morgan Stanley has an agreement to provide financing for the natural gas businesses being sold to Pentagon Energy.Chiesara, who was an executive director at Morgan Stanley, and Comerford, who was a managing director, left the bank earlier this month, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Comerford was previously head of the bank's natural gas trading and origination business, a position that Jay Rubenstein took over on Jan. 1.Chiesara and Comerford will be joining Alvaro Campins and Luis Gutierrez as principals of newly formed Pentagon Energy. Campins and Gutierrez come from Pentacles Energy, which describes itself on its web site as a crude oil and gas production company in Tennessee.Pentagon Energy, which is based in Coral Gables, Florida, is acquiring interests in Wentworth Compression LLC, Wentworth Gas Marketing LLC and Wentworth Holdings LLC from a Morgan Stanley subsidiary called MSDW Power Development Corp.

He is eligible to receive another $6.5 million over the next three years if he meets certain performance targets, up from the $6 million in long-term incentive awards the board outlined for Gorman the prior year.Using another calculation set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission which includes restricted awards from prior years and perks, Gorman received $23.3 million in 2014, up from $14.4 million the prior year.The board sets executive compensation with the guidance of an external compensation advisory firm. It bases Gorman's pay on how well Morgan Stanley achieved objectives from shareholder returns to cost cutting.The board decided Gorman had exceeded expectations, but not ""substantially"" so. Even if he had simply met expectations, his compensation would have risen by $3 million compared with what the board was prepared to pay in 2013 for middling performance, according to the two proxies. Colm Kelleher, one of two top business executives under Gorman who oversees trading and investment banking, received a special $2 million bonus last year. The award reflects ""his continued contributions and commitment to the company,"" according to the proxy, as well as the global nature of his role, which involves extensive travel to interact with regulators and clients globally.It was the first time such a bonus was awarded, and no other senior executive received a similar award, including Gregory Fleming, who has an equivalent role overseeing wealth and asset management. Kelleher also received a baseline compensation last year of $11.2 million and a long-term incentive package of $4.8 million, as did Fleming.Kelleher was previously based in New York, and still maintains a home there as well as in London. He received $317,127 in perks last year, including $205,887 in housing costs and $75,611 for tax preparation services related to his expatriate status.Fleming has not accepted perks from Morgan Stanley since joining the company in 2010. Separately in the proxy, Morgan Stanley also nominated former Wellington Management CEO Perry Traquina as a new director to its board. The bank said two directors, Howard Davies and Robert Kidder, will not be standing for re-election.

Even if he had simply met expectations, his compensation would have risen by $3 million compared with what the board was prepared to pay in 2013 for middling performance, according to the two proxies. Colm Kelleher, one of two top business executives under Gorman who oversees trading and investment banking, received a special $2 million bonus last year. The award reflects ""his continued contributions and commitment to the company,"" according to the proxy, as well as the global nature of his role, which involves extensive travel to interact with regulators and clients globally.It was the first time such a bonus was awarded, and no other senior executive received a similar award, including Gregory Fleming, who has an equivalent role overseeing wealth and asset management. Kelleher also received a baseline compensation last year of $11.2 million and a long-term incentive package of $4.8 million, as did Fleming.Kelleher was previously based in New York, and still maintains a home there as well as in London. He received $317,127 in perks last year, including $205,887 in housing costs and $75,611 for tax preparation services related to his expatriate status.Fleming has not accepted perks from Morgan Stanley since joining the company in 2010.Separately in the proxy, Morgan Stanley also nominated former Wellington Management CEO Perry Traquina as a new director to its board. The bank said two directors, Howard Davies and Robert Kidder, will not be standing for re-election. Davies is leaving to become chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.

526,"  LONDON, April 13 The U.S. bank Morgan Stanley has forecast that the euro will sink below parity with the dollar before the end of this year, and election fever will drive down the pound to $1.39 by June.The forecasts for the euro's fall, after a month that has drawn the first expressions of doubt from major bank analysts about the pace and durability of the dollar's rise, are among the most aggressive yet issued, and predict the single currency will be worth just 98 cents by the fourth quarter.They stem chiefly from expectations of continued euro weakness as the European Central Bank pumps billions more in newly-created money into the financial system, rather than a bullish view on the dollar.""The anticipated reacceleration of the U.S. economy should keep the dollar strong,"" the bank said in a note laying out its spring forecasts. ""Yet, over the next couple of quarters, the pace of these gains will be muted relative to the brisk advances observed in the last three. Yield differentials will keep EUR under pressure, although JPY will surprise with its relative strength.""Previously Morgan Stanley had forecast the euro at $1.05 in Q4. On sterling, under increasing pressure against the dollar ahead of parliamentary elections in May, the bank predicted a slide from around $1.46 on Monday to $1.39 by the end of June. ""Under our base case scenario of the next UK government being led by one of the major parties, we would expect renewed fiscal austerity, which will lead to a slower growth picture in the UK,"" the bank said, also pointing to the risks of a referendum on Britain's EU membership after the election.Reuters polling of major bank strategists shows the euro falling just 2-3 cents against the dollar over the next year to reach $1.03 in March of 2016.(Writing by Patrick Graham; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",2015-04-13,MS,"Mon Apr 13, 2015 | 5:41am EDT",Morgan Stanley says dollar parity beckons for euro by Q4,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-forex-euro-idUSL5N0XA0Z420150413?type=companyNews

528,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK, April 14  NEW YORK, April 14 Wells Fargo Corp  showed again in the first quarter why it and other big banks want their financial advisers to sell fee-based products.Profit in the ""Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement"" sector of the San Francisco-based bank rose 18 percent from the previous year's first quarter to a record $561 million, more than double the sector's 8 percent revenue growth to $3.7 billion, Wells Fargo said on Tuesday.Like other bank-owned brokerage firms, Wells encourages its financial advisers to sell ""managed accounts,"" where a fee is charged for allocating client money among mutual funds, investment managers and other sources. Managed account assets at the Wells Fargo Advisors brokerage business grew 12 percent, or $46 billion, to $435 billion in the three months ending March 31. In the year-earlier quarter such assets were up 13 percent. Banks promote fee-based accounts because they provide more profitable and consistent revenue than traditional commission accounts that ebb and flow with market sentiment.Wells' wealth management results bode well for other large bank-owned brokerages such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley that are reporting quarterly results later this week. Although Wells' brokerage force fell by 53 advisers from a year earlier, to 15,134, it prospered in another area dear to bank-owned brokerages, cross-marketing loans to traditional brokerage clients. Average loan balances rose 13.9 percent in the first quarter to $56.9 billion, as brokers and private bankers sold clients' jumbo mortgages and loans collateralized by securities portfolios, Wells said. The lending surge escalated the sector's net interest income by 12.1 percent to $861 million.In another sign of cross-marketing success, wealth sector clients used 10.44 Wells Fargo products or services per household as of the end of February, the most of Wells' three businesses. In 2014, Wells' bank branches referred more than $1 billion of business a month to the wealth unit, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsbury said in a conference call. Expenses in the wealth sector rose 4 percent to $2.83 billion, the highest in at least five quarters, reflecting costs for increased trading volume.The wealth sector remains Wells' smallest business. Its $561 million of quarterly profit compares with $1.8 billion from investment banking and trading activities in its Wholesale Banking sector and to $3.7 billion reaped from branch banking and credit card activities in its Community Banking sector during the first quarter.(Editing by Ted Botha)",2015-04-14,MS,"Tue Apr 14, 2015 | 3:38pm EDT","Wells Fargo's Wealth profit driven by loans, managed accounts",http://www.reuters.com//article/wells-fargo-results-brokerage-idUSL2N0XB0R420150414?type=companyNews

It also placed No. 1 in a global industry ranking calculated by Coalition, a firm that compiles statistics on the banking industry.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are perennial rivals in a range of Wall Street businesses ranging from merger advice to private banking. Goldman tends to excel in businesses like trading and principal investments, while Morgan Stanley has shifted its focus onto wealth management and other businesses that do not risk its own balance sheet.Thus, Morgan Stanley's recent gains in equities trading has become a point of pride for the bank, which tends to lag Goldman in profit overall. However, the $2.3 billion in stock-trading revenue Goldman reported in its first-quarter results on Thursday looks hard to beat, analysts said.    Goldman's 46 percent year-over-year jump far surpassed the 9 percent rise in comparable revenue at JPMorgan, the 4 percent rise at Citigroup Inc and 2 percent decline at Bank of America Corp. Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on Monday, would have to report a 36 percent gain to match Goldman's results. 'BIG UP MOVE' Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said there was particular strength in stock options and other equity derivatives, which perform well when markets move in surprising directions, as well as some large block trades performed for clients. Europe was a bright spot as the euro currency fell and stock markets rallied on actions by the European Central Bank. ""When you have a big up move in European equity markets like you did with (the stimulus program), obviously that is an opportunity for clients to get involved,"" he said on a conference call with analysts.Executives and analysts in the equities market who spoke with Reuters on Thursday said they are curious to see whether Morgan Stanley's crown will fall next week.Both companies' shares were down less than 1 percent on Thursday, although Goldman's are up about 3 percent so far this year, while Morgan Stanley's are down nearly 4 percent.While the bank has a strong presence in Japan due to its joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, it is unclear whether its European equities operation is as strong as Goldman's, particularly in derivatives. Analysts also cautioned that while Goldman had a good quarter, broader challenges still exist. Heightened competition, increased electronic trading and tighter regulation have been hurting stock trading profits on Wall Street since before the financial crisis.Structural changes to the business mean that some revenue has ""simply disappeared,"" said George Kuznetsov, the head of research and analytics at Coalition. Global investment banks delivered roughly $87 billion in equities trading revenue at their peak in 2007, he said.

In 2007, so-called ""bulge bracket"" firms touted 78 percent market share in U.S. stock trading. That figures dropped to 64 percent by 2014.    ""It's hard to make money because the margins are so slim,"" said Kevin McPartland, who heads Greenwich Associates' market structure and technology practice.

542,"   By Anjuli Davies and Jamie McGeever | LONDON  LONDON Trading revenue from the world's biggest banks showed signs of recovery in the first quarter as financial market volatility boosted dealing room profits after years of attrition.Though income has been only modestly higher than the same period last year, the numbers have prompted cautious optimism from analysts holding out hope for a return to trading returns last seen before the 2007/08 financial crisis.Earnings so far from the five leading U.S. banks and Credit Suisse in Europe show that revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) almost doubled from the previous quarter to $17.1 billion.Quarter-on-quarter improvement was to be expected, given that the first three months of the year are typically the strongest for investment banks as cash is put to work. However, analysts have been encouraged by FICC numbers that were flat year on year. FICC accounts for about half investment banks' revenues.Total revenue at the U.S. quintet and Credit Suisse from FICC, equities and investment banking fees was $34.98 billion, up a modest 5.9 percent from the same period last year, according to Christopher Wheeler, U.S. banks analyst at Atlantic Equities.""FICC is showing some signs of life but that is because rates are back, commodities are back and there's been more volatility surrounding events like the Swiss franc cap. This is positive given the dull FICC markets in recent years,"" Wheeler said.The first quarter has been notable for the Swiss National Bank's removal of its cap on the Swiss franc, the European Central Bank's trillion-euro bond-buying quantitative easing (QE) program, speculation over U.S. interest rates and a rollercoaster ride for oil prices. VOLATILITY BOOST This has created the type of price fluctuation and market volatility that traders thrive on, offsetting the seemingly perennial downward pressures on trading revenue from tighter regulation, dwindling liquidity and increased automation in financial market trading.FICC revenue at the top 10 global banks has risen year on year only once since 2009 and is down about 50 percent overall since then, data from industry analytics firm Coalition shows.  In that light, this year's first-quarter stagnation has been greeted by some as a welcome development.""With higher volatility and continued support from euro zone QE, we believe that the investment banking earnings cycle is at a turning point,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. The big winners have been Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, with revenue up 15 percent and 10 percent respectively year on year, while Citi registered a fall of 11 percent, Atlantic Equities analyst Wheeler said. Credit Suisse, the first big European bank to report first-quarter results on Tuesday, posted FICC revenue up 8 percent year on year. Barclays, HSBC and UBS will all report by May 6.Revenue from other banking activities also showed signs of life. Equities income was up 23 percent while advisory and capital markets revenue gained 11 percent, a Reuters analysis of results at the big five U.S. banks shows.Global M&A deals this year had topped $1 trillion by April 8, the earliest the threshold has been reached since 2007, according to financial data provider Dealogic.""Low rates have translated into a surge in mergers and an increase in currency trading, both big money makers for investment banks,"" BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Strategist Russ Koesterich said.""We see the favorable environment for this sector continuing and would remain overweight in large, global financial firms.""

545,"   By Denny Thomas and Elzio Barreto | HONG KONG  HONG KONG UBS UBSN.VX, Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] and French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) are among half a dozen preliminary bidders to buy up to a 10 percent stake in state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC) for at least $3 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.China's biggest bank by outlets, PSBC has about 40,000 branches, and a strategic partnership could help foreign banks sell insurance and banking products to China's vast population.PSBC is preparing for an initial public offering next year, which could raise around $25 billion - the record for an IPO set last year by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) - China Daily reported in February. The pre-IPO stake sale is a stepping stone that would set a valuation benchmark for that offering.The Chinese government is open to selling a bigger stake in PSBC and prefers to sell to strategic, rather than financial, investors, said one of the individuals, who couldn't be named as the process is confidential. China has previously introduced strategic partners into its large state-owned banks before massive IPOs to bolster investor confidence and improve management best practice - though these have tended to turn into financial investments, with European, U.S. and Asian stakeholders selling up for a large profit.The planned sale comes as Chinese bank shares have jumped by almost a quarter this year on strong demand from mainland investors, and despite China's slowing economy and the mounting bad debts of mainland banks. A Chinese banking sector sub-index .HSHFI is up 23 percent year-to-date.  BNP Paribas, Temasek and UBS declined to comment. Calls to PSBC's general office were not answered. Reuters could not ascertain the names of other preliminary bidders.ABOVE BOOK VALUE  The stake could be sold slightly above PSBC's book value, which is at a slight discount to the price-to-book value of 1.26 of China's big banks, according to Thomson Reuters data.PSBC, wholly-owned by China Post Group Corp, the state-owned postal service, has about 470 million clients, about equal to the combined populations of the United States and Russia. Its total assets topped 5.58 trillion yuan ($892 billion) at the end of 2013, according to its website. It is particularly strong in taking in deposits in rural areas.Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (601398.SS) (1398.HK), the country's largest bank by assets, by comparison has 17,460 branches and 465 million retail customers. Global financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Bank of America (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N) and UBS all acquired stakes in Chinese banks and insurers in the mid-2000s, but have since exited or reduced their stakes. While the relationships were profitable, involved some cooperation and helped Chinese lenders become some of the world's biggest banks, few products or strategic benefits emerged.Goldman sold out of ICBC in 2013, ending a 7-year investment and earning more than $10 billion in gross proceeds, making a near four time return on its original stake. Bank of America exited its China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) (601939.SS) investment in the same year, reaping $16.4 billion after a series of sales - a return of more than five times its initial investment.Preliminary bids for the PSBC stake were due last week, and the parties will undertake detailed due diligence before making final offers.China International Capital Corp (CICC) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are arranging the pre-IPO sale, the sources said.

564,"   By Jonathan Leff | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Castleton Commodities International will buy Morgan Stanley's physical oil business, the largest and oldest on Wall Street, vaulting the Connecticut-based merchant into the big leagues of global crude and fuel traders.In a long-awaited deal that appears to mark the end of the Wall Street bank's more than three-decade history as a major player in physical oil markets, Castleton will gain several dozen oil tank storage leases, physical oil supply and purchase contracts, and a team of about a hundred traders.Neither Morgan Stanley nor Castleton released terms of the transaction, but analysts estimated the deal to be valued at slightly more than $1 billion. This principally represents the value of oil inventories in storage or transit. The deal will not be material for Morgan Stanley, the bank said.Castleton, a Connecticut-based trading group now owned by a private equity group of hedge fund and trading veterans, will have more scale and scope to compete in the massive global oil market.The deal ""aligns well with our goal of becoming a top-tier, global multi-commodity merchant,"" said CCI's Chief Executive and President William C. Reed II, a former Enron and hedge fund trader who has been running the firm since 2008.Morgan's Global Oil Merchanting unit has traded around 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and oil products over the past five years, and has 45 oil storage leases for some 30 million barrels, mainly in the United States and Europe, CCI said.About a hundred front-office staff, including traders and shippers, are expected to move to CCI with the transaction, according to a person familiar with the deal. In total, as many as 200 employees may transfer to CCI, a second person said. The bank's Tom Simpson and Fabrizio Zichichi will lead CCI's global oil trading business, the firm said. While Morgan Stanley will maintain its client-facing oil trading business, including both physical and paper transactions, the sale concludes the bank's years-long effort to divest a physical trading division that had come under intense regulatory scrutiny and suffered waning profitability.The bank still plans to sell its stake in oil tanker group Heidmar, which was not part of the deal, a source said.GOING BIG ON OIL  For Castleton oil has been a weaker spot relative to the group's large books in power, natural gas and gas liquids markets. Its predecessor firm sold a portfolio of midstream gas liquid assets for $2 billion.Castleton, which was originally founded nearly two decades ago as the energy trading division of French commodities merchant Louis Dreyfus, has already doubled in size to more than 650 staff since it was bought in 2012 by a private equity group including famed hedge fund managers Glenn Dubin and Paul Tudor Jones, as well as Paul Fribourg, the head of Continental Grain.With the Morgan Stanley team, the group's global headcount is expected to top 900, according to a person familiar with the company. While still small compared to rivals like Vitol and Trafigura, which employ thousands of people to run large infrastructure subsidiaries or projects, it is a sizeable sum for a relatively asset-light company, rivals say. END OF AN ERA Assuming the deal clears regulatory approval, which is expected in the second half of the year, it will be the third time lucky for Morgan Stanley, which has been trying to sell the division for years as the Federal Reserve stepped up pressure on Wall Street to get out of the physical commodities business.Early talks with Qatar failed to clinch a deal, while a preliminary agreement in late 2013 to sell to Russian oil giant Rosneft fell apart as Washington stepped up sanctions on Moscow.Wall Street's largest and most enduring oil trading desk rose to fame in the early 1990s as a trader named Olav Refvik secured a host of leases on storage tanks at a key import hub, earning him the moniker ""King of New York Harbor."" Refvik and several other senior founding executives left several years ago.A Senate investigations report published last year revealed that while Morgan Stanley used to charter about 100 oil tankers a month, by 2014 the number had declined to 10-15 a month.

""There is now meaningful momentum behind current cost and capex (capital expenditure) savings programs in the industry,"" Morgan Stanley said.

Lloyds was rescued during the 2007-9 financial crisis at a cost of 20 billion pounds to taxpayers, leaving Britain with a 41 percent stake.UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which manages the shareholding, began selling Lloyds shares to institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers in September 2013.Finance Minister George Osborne has said the government plans to sell at least another 9 billion pounds worth of the shares over the next year, including a sale at a discount to private retail investors. ""These sales have only been made possible by our long term economic plan, and we are determined to build on this success, and to continue to return Lloyds to the private sector and reduce our national debt,"" Osborne said on Tuesday.The latest sale was through a ""pre-arranged trading plan"", which UKFI appointed U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley to undertake. The government's stake has been cut from 24.9 percent through the plan, which was launched last December, raising over 2.5 billion pounds for taxpayers.Britain's remaining stake in Lloyds is valued at about 12 billion pounds, based on current share prices. Osborne is expected to press ahead with a plan to sell Lloyds shares to private investors later this year and the government could sell around 4 billion pounds worth of stock through a retail offer, sources said.The government has said the retail offer would be sold at a 5 percent discount to market value. Investors would be able to buy between 250 pounds and 10,000 pounds worth of Lloyds shares, with priority going to orders of up to 1,000 pounds.The government is also considering a sale of its shares in Royal Bank of Scotland later this year and could begin selling the shares at a loss, sources told Reuters last week.It is currently sitting on a loss of more than 13 billion pounds on its RBS investment.(1 = 0.6422 pounds)   (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Keith Weir)",2015-05-12,MS,"Tue May 12, 2015 | 4:25am EDT","UPDATE 2-UK sells more Lloyds shares, has raised over 10 bln pounds",http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-lloyds-banking-idUSL5N0Y314C20150512?type=companyNews

576,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday refused to let thousands of Detroit homeowners sue Morgan Stanley as a group for allegedly pushing a subprime lender into making risky loans they could not afford.U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni said her decision was likely ""a death knell"" for the lawsuit and that an appeal may be appropriate, but that the plaintiffs' claims were too varied to be addressed in a single class action.The complaint was originally filed in October 2012 by the American Civil Liberties Union, in what that group called the first U.S. lawsuit accusing an investment bank of discrimination for having packaged subprime mortgage loans into securities.Homeowners accused Morgan Stanley of violating the federal Fair Housing Act by pushing now-defunct New Century Financial Corp into issuing shoddy mortgages, so that the Wall Street bank could make more money by packaging them into securities. ""The subprime mortgage crisis undoubtedly damaged our economy and may have - as plaintiffs contend - exacerbated preexisting racial disparities in socioeconomic status,"" Caproni wrote in a 50-page decision.""While the court is not unsympathetic to plaintiffs' claims, the harmfulness of the terms that plaintiffs claim that Morgan Stanley caused New Century to include in loans and the role that Morgan Stanley played in causing the terms of specific plaintiffs' loans differ considerably,"" she added. ""Accordingly, plaintiffs' proposed class is unworkable.""Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a similar request. Many other U.S. lawsuits have targeted mortgage lenders themselves for allegedly steering minority borrowers into onerous home loans, leading to more foreclosures.The Detroit plaintiffs had sought class-action status for all blacks who lived in that area from 2004 and 2007 and received New Century loans that carried an increased risk of default. Caproni said the variations among prospective class members ""would require mini-trials as to many, maybe hundreds, of groups of borrowers,"" making certification of one class inappropriate.The case is Adkins et al v.

582,"   By Denny Thomas | HONG KONG  HONG KONG A $1.2 billion share sale by Fosun International Ltd (0656.HK) this month was likely only the start of a love affair with equity deals, bankers say, as the Chinese conglomerate seeks to cut reliance on debt to fund its huge acquisition ambitions.Led by tycoon Guo Guangchang who models himself on Warren Buffet, Fosun has launched about $31 billion in M&A since its founding in 1992, according to Thomson Reuters data. It has many more deals in its sights as it shifts its focus to insurance and investment and away from manufacturing, but its gearing has grown to uncomfortable levels.Fosun is expected to trim some of the many corporate stakes it holds and may sell more of its own equity, emboldened as the Chinese stock market and its own shares have more than doubled over the past year, bankers said.That represents a turnaround from its largely debt-funded M&A strategy - the $1.2 billion Hong Kong share sale this month was its biggest to date and only its second since listing in 2007. It could also provide a fee windfall for investment banks.""Generally speaking, we will keep our debt structure under control...(and) diversify our sources of capital,"" Guo told reporters after Fosun's shareholders meeting in Hong Kong on Thursday.Fosun had total debt of 104 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) at the end of last year, up 70 percent from 2012 and not too far off its $19.2 billion market value.  ""They have been pretty disciplined in tapping equity markets since listing, but as their acquisition pipeline grows, they are likely to be more judicious about how they finance deals,"" a senior Hong Kong-based equity capital market banker said. SPECULATIVE GRADE Moody's Investors Service warned this month that failure by Fosun to raise sufficient equity or speed up asset sales may put its speculative grade credit rating in danger of a downgrade. The credit agency estimates Fosun has unpaid M&A costs of around $4.8 billion, while sources have said Fosun is looking at least $7 billion in fresh acquisitions. These include Portuguese lender Novo Banco valued at about 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) and Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Australian real estate unit worth about $2.3 billion.Assuming a 50 percent debt-to-equity funding mix, Fosun may need to raise $6 billion through sales of its own shares or by selling other holdings if it wants to keep its gearing in check and fund the $7 billion in deals under consideration, according to Reuters calculations.Its net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.29 is the second-highest among global insurance and investment companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.""It's a problem and I was worried,"" Max Li, a professional investor who owns one million Fosun shares and participated in the recent share offering, said at the sidelines of the shareholder meeting. ""But Fosun's investment strategy is good and I believe in Guo and his team's decisions."" Despite numerous acquisitions in the past decade, its reliance on debt funding has meant the Shanghai-based firm has paid just $140 million in fees to investment banks, according to Thomson Reuters data. More than half of that came from equity deals, which are the most lucrative source of fees for investment banks in Asia, suggesting that any pick up in share sales will be a boon for banks.Morgan Stanley currently tops the investment bank league table earning $25.9 million, followed by UBS UBSG.VX and China's CICC, according Thomson Reuters Freeman Consulting estimates.Fosun has listed six stakes in other firms as for sale and has many more it could also unload or trim. Those listed include a holding in New China Life Insurance Co Ltd (1336.HK) currently worth some $270 million and shares in Zhongshan Public Utilities (000685.SZ) worth $555 million.

588,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has ambitions to become a full-service bank for its wealth management clients, and has begun offering credit cards, debit cards and an array of cash-management products and services, two senior executives said on Tuesday.""We basically want to do with our existing clients whatever they might be able to do with a retail bank,"" Greg Fleming, president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in New York at the Reuters Wealth Management Summit. ""Really everything that the client is focused on from a financial services standpoint, we want them to do it with Morgan Stanley.""Fleming's comments built on what the bank's new chief financial officer, Jonathan Pruzan, had said at a conference earlier in the day. The new banking products are just the latest step in Morgan Stanley's effort to make wealth clients more reliant on financial advisers - not just for investments, but for loans and other financial needs.Morgan Stanley's purchase of the Smith Barney business from Citigroup Inc (C.N) brought along a slew of deposits, which will ultimately reach more than $200 billion. As a result, the bank has been building its lending apparatus for years to put that money to the most profitable use. Most of its loan book is securities-based, meaning clients borrow against their investment portfolio housed inside Morgan Stanley. But it has also ramped up mortgage lending and tailored loans for high-net-worth individuals, and hired hundreds of private bankers to work with advisers in making more loans.The more products and services a client uses with a financial institution, the less likely they are to leave, and the more money the institution can earn from them. Adding basic services like checking accounts and debit cards can create more customer loyalty, while offering cash management services like money market funds or certificates of deposit can deliver more income for Morgan Stanley. ""What we're looking for is to have the financial adviser sit at the center of the relationship with the client,"" said Fleming.

Euro zone leaders will attend an emergency summit on Monday, hoping to thrash out a plan with Athens to provide Greece with funds to prevent it defaulting on its debt. If Greece does default on its debts, it could require capital controls that might lead to its exit from the euro zone or even the European Union itself.

592,"  (Adds details)MELBOURNE, June 23 Morgan Stanley slashed its nickel price forecasts for the second half of the year on Tuesday as a softer global growth outlook curbs demand from stainless steel producers, making it the third bank this week to downgrade prospects for the metal.Nickel prices have been particularly hard hit among commodities, as 70 percent of refined metal goes into the stainless steel sector where producers often sell down stocks aggressively on signs of worsening economic growth, it said.An industry debate in 2014 about bullish supply side risks from Indonesian export ban was passing, with the market focus now on buckling stainless steel demand growth, it said.However, further downside appeared limited, given prices were well down the cost curve for nickel producers, it said.The bank cut its third quarter 2015 nickel price forecast by 12 pct to $13,228 a tonne and its fourth quarter outlook by 10 pct to $13,448 a tonne. LME nickel traded at $12,625 a tonne on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley expects nickel demand to grow at 1 percent this year.Citi said in a note that week that weak nickel prices since last year have effectively removed any incentive for stainless steel consumers to rebuild inventories.""We now see little prospect of a sustainable nickel price or stainless stocking upturn ahead of the July/August holiday period,"" it said. JP Morgan on Monday noted ""underwhelming second quarter stainless steel demand,"" and said that it was ""more comfortable with $10,000 nickel"" than it was with prices at $17,000 a tonne.Weak demand has thrown cold water over any hopes for a repeat of a 50 percent rally in nickel to more than $21,000 in May last year after Indonesia banned ore exports in January. Traders had bet that China would be forced to consume more nickel, as nickel pig iron, a cheaper feedstock made primarily from Indonesian ore, dried up.But the Philippines ramped up exports to fill the gap, and now Indonesia's nascent NPI industry has already begun exports.Shipments began in April from China's Tsingshan NPI refinery, while Morgan Stanley expects Indonesia to produce 22,000 tonnes of NPI this year and 31,000 tonnes in 2016. This is still small, compared to more than 500,000 tonnes at China's NPI output peak.The bank also cut its platinum and hard coking coal forecasts and raised its aluminium forecast for the fourth quarter.

593,"   By James Regan | SYDNEY  SYDNEY Adani Mining said on Wednesday it was rejigging the budget on the A$10 billion ($7.72 billion) Carmichael coal mine project in Australia as it faces delays in government approvals.Adani intends to ship most of the coal from the mine to India for use in generating household power in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal to connect all of India to the electricity grid during his tenure.In announcing the setback, Adani also confirmed a media report it had asked independent contracting firms employed on the project to halt work around the mine.A report in the Guardian Australia said it had asked its four engineering contractors to stop operating, raising speculation that the Indian company might scrap the project altogether. ""This is only temporary,"" an Adani spokeswoman, Kate Haddan said, adding a target to commence coal mining in 2017 stood for now.       Adani in a statement said the project's current budget based on previous anticipated approval timelines and milestones were no longer achievable due to delays in receiving various approvals from the Queensland state government. ""As a result of changes to a range of approvals over that time, it’s necessary to synchronise our budget, project timelines and spending to meet those changes,"" it said.Adani has signed up buyers for about 70 percent of the 40 million tonnes coal the Carmichael project is due to produce in its first phase.Adani's project mainly hinges on environmental approval to deepen a port on the fringe of Australia' Great Barrier Reef in order to ship the coal, a proposal generating opposition worldwide.  An earlier plan to dump 3 million cubic metres of soil dredged at the port of Abbot Point into the sea about 25 km (15 miles) from the Great Barrier Reef was rejected.The Australian federal government must approve the actual channel dredging and the state needs to clear Adani's solution for storing the spoil.A draft U.N. ruling has recommended against listing the Great Barrier Reef as ""in danger"" but indicated it remains on its watchlist ahead of a final ruling due by the end of this month as it monitors plans for dredging. Eleven of the world’s biggest private investment banks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase, have publicly ruled out providing financing to Adani, citing environmental concerns over the reef and fossil fuel development.The Queensland Department of State Development, which is charged with approving the storage procedure, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Australia's minister for industry and science, Ian Macfarlane, recently said he was confident Adani would build the  mine because India was looking for a stable supplier of coal.($1 = 1.2957 Australian dollars) (Editing by Michael Perry)",2015-06-24,MS,"Wed Jun 24, 2015 | 6:05am EDT",Adani rejigs Australia coal mine budget due to delays,http://www.reuters.com//article/adani-ent-carmichael-idUSKBN0P32JM20150624?type=companyNews

Keen to build Taiwan into a wealth management hub in Asia, regulators have made it easier for bonds to be issued by foreign companies and Chinese banks and raised the limit for insurance firms to invest overseas.Taiwan's yuan-denominated ""Formosa bonds,"" which are sold by Chinese banks here and the equivalent of Hong Kong's ""Dim Sum bonds,"" have also been growing thanks to the improved business ties with China.Trade ties across the Taiwan Strait have gathered steam since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008. For example, Taiwan is now the world's second-biggest offshore yuan market after Hong Kong, with more than 300 billion yuan in deposits. The FSC is planning to launch an EFT (exchange-traded fund) on a Formosa bond index next year, said the top financial regulator, without elaborating.China Development Bank, the mainland's biggest development bank, will sell Formosa Bonds in the second half of 2015, a source told Reuters last month.When being asked if the FSC would approve that, Tseng said ""We welcome them (China Development Bank).""Currently, Bank of China and other big mainland banks have sold Formosa bonds, using their offshore branches.The top financial regulator expects new issues of U.S. dollar-denominated and yuan bonds to increase by $5 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2015, compared with the current outstanding level of around $40 billion.

607,"   By Melanie Burton and James Regan | MELBOURNE/SYDNEY  MELBOURNE/SYDNEY A 30 percent slump in nickel prices this year has piled pressure on small Australian miners, forcing some of them to delay new projects and expansions as they wait for the market to recover.Poseidon Nickel became the latest miner to succumb when it said on Thursday it would put its Lake Johnston mine on care and maintenance - a sign casualties were mounting amid near record metal stockpiles and weak demand from key consumer China.Exchange stockpiles of the metal used to make stainless steel nearly doubled in the 18 months to June, pressuring benchmark prices to six-year lows of $10,430 per tonne last week, down 32 percent since the start 2015. ""When you've got 70 percent of an industry at break-even or loss making you're going to see people defer projects and shut down,"" said UBS analyst Daniel Morgan in Sydney.""I think you'll see a steady stream of these type of announcements for the next several months,"" he added.Panoramic Resources blamed the low metal prices for its decision this week to curtail development of its Jury-Metcalfe lode, saying ""significantly higher"" prices were needed for it to ramp up output as planned in December. It also warned of possible job losses. Mincor has said it could start cutting output by November unless nickel prices improved.Australian's Macquarie has slashed its nickel price view, cutting it by 13 percent for 2015, after similar moves by other investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, Citi, ANZ and JP Morgan.Macquarie, however, expects prices to recover later this year, a view echoed by UBS, as demand from China's mills picks up and exchange stocks extend a decline that began last month. ""With future deficits (and higher pricing) projected, producer optimism remains, but the question is whether balance sheets will force closure before the upside comes,"" Macquarie said in a research note.As of now, low prices have hit valuations for nickel mines.Global mining and commodity trader Glencore recently sold a nickel mine inherited through its Xstrata takeover to Australian nickel producer Western Areas. The Cosmos nickel mine in Western Australia was sold for A$24.5 million ($18.14 million), a fraction of the A$3.1 billion Xstrata had spent in 2008 to acquire the Cosmos and Sinclair mines as part of its takeover of Jubilee Mines. Nickel blunders run rampant in Australia.Back in 2007, BHP Billiton spent $6 billion building the Ravensthorpe mine, but within a year, nickel prices crashed, forcing the miner to shut Ravensthorpe and take a $5.16 billion bad investment impairment. It finally sold Ravensthorpe to Canada's First Quantum for $340 million in 2009.

Goldman had come out on top in the two preceding quarters.Strength in equities trading was driven by derivatives and prime brokerage, which offers services to hedge funds and other professional investors, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said on a conference call.Pruzan, who replaced Ruth Porat in March after she left for a similar role at Google Inc (GOOGL.O), also said the bank had received ""positive feedback"" from clients on a Moody's upgrade of the bank's credit ratings in May.Moody's said the upgrade - the only two-notch increase among the 13 global banks it assessed - was based on the bank's increased business diversification, prospects for improved profitability and lower earnings volatility.On an adjusted basis, Morgan Stanley's revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodities rose 25 percent to $1.27 billion in the three months ended June 30. [IDn:nBw1FshNLa] Fixed-income trading dragged on the earnings of other big Wall Street banks during the quarter as concerns ranging from the Greek debt crisis to the timing of a long-awaited U.S. interest rate hike kept traders on the sidelines.Morgan Stanley's institutional securities business - which includes both bond and equity trading - accounted for 52.2 percent of overall revenue in the quarter, up from 49 percent a year earlier.Revenue from equities trading accounted for about 24 percent of total adjusted revenue, while bond trading accounted for about 13 percent.In 2006, bond trading accounted for more than 28 percent of revenue while equities trading accounted for about 19 percent.  Morgan Stanley's shares were up 0.4 percent at $40.35 in early afternoon trading after hitting $40.94, their highest since the financial crisis. WEALTH MANAGEMENT MARGIN RISES The bank's wealth management business achieved a pretax margin of 23 percent, up from 22 percent in the first quarter and 21 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Gorman has set a target of 22-25 percent for the business this year.Net revenue in the wealth management division increased 4.7 percent to $3.88 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of total revenue, down from 43 percent in the same quarter of 2014.Morgan Stanley has bet big on wealth management, completing the purchase of Citigroup Inc's (C.N) stake in their wealth management joint venture in 2013. Total adjusted net revenue rose 12.2 percent to $9.56 billion, helped by a 56 percent rise in revenue from Asia, which overtook EMEA as the bank's second-biggest market.Morgan Stanley said net income fell to $1.67 billion, or 85 cents per share, from $1.82 billion, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the bank earned 79 cents per share - beating the average analyst estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Still, the adjusted average return-on-equity of 9.1 percent remained below the 10 percent minimum set by Gorman.Revenue from investment banking, which includes advising on takeovers and underwriting equity and bond issues, fell 1 percent to $1.61 billion.Morgan Stanley ranked second globally after Goldman Sachs  in advising on deals in the first half of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.The five big Wall Street banks - excluding Wells Fargo Corp (WFC.N), which does not have a large investment banking business - reported total net earnings of $24.1 billion in the quarter, up $6.7 billion from the same quarter last year.

[IDn:nBw1FshNLa]Fixed-income trading dragged on the earnings of other big Wall Street banks during the quarter as concerns ranging from the Greek debt crisis to the timing of a long-awaited U.S. interest rate hike kept traders on the sidelines.Morgan Stanley's institutional securities business - which includes both bond and equity trading - accounted for 52.2 percent of overall revenue in the quarter, up from 49 percent a year earlier.Revenue from equities trading accounted for about 24 percent of total adjusted revenue, while bond trading accounted for about 13 percent. In 2006, bond trading accounted for more than 28 percent of revenue while equities trading accounted for about 19 percent.Morgan Stanley's shares were up 0.4 percent at $40.35 in early afternoon trading after hitting $40.94, their highest since the financial crisis.WEALTH MANAGEMENT MARGIN RISES  The bank's wealth management business achieved a pretax margin of 23 percent, up from 22 percent in the first quarter and 21 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Gorman has set a target of 22-25 percent for the business this year.Net revenue in the wealth management division increased 4.7 percent to $3.88 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of total revenue, down from 43 percent in the same quarter of 2014.Morgan Stanley has bet big on wealth management, completing the purchase of Citigroup Inc's stake in their wealth management joint venture in 2013.Total adjusted net revenue rose 12.2 percent to $9.56 billion, helped by a 56 percent rise in revenue from Asia, which overtook EMEA as the bank's second-biggest market.Morgan Stanley said net income fell to $1.67 billion, or 85 cents per share, from $1.82 billion, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the bank earned 79 cents per share - beating the average analyst estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Still, the adjusted average return-on-equity of 9.1 percent remained below the 10 percent minimum set by Gorman.Revenue from investment banking, which includes advising on takeovers and underwriting equity and bond issues, fell 1 percent to $1.61 billion.Morgan Stanley ranked second globally after Goldman Sachs  in advising on deals in the first half of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.The five big Wall Street banks - excluding Wells Fargo Corp , which does not have a large investment banking business - reported total net earnings of $24.1 billion in the quarter, up $6.7 billion from the same quarter last year.

615,"  (For more Reuters Special Reports, double-click on )By Lauren Tara LaCapraNEW YORK, July 22 John McCormick has been on a mission for the past five years: to bring hedge funds to the masses.That may seem like a tough sell. Traditional hedge funds, those lightly regulated investment pools open exclusively to large institutions and rich individuals, have been duds lately, trailing the U.S. stock market's performance every year since 2009 by an average of 10 percentage points, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc data.But already, McCormick, a senior managing director at Blackstone Group LP, has been wildly successful. He has done so as a tireless evangelist for what are called liquid alternative investments, or ""liquid alts."" Like hedge funds, they invest in everything from simple stocks and bonds to all sorts of complex derivatives and other ""alternative"" assets. The main difference is that liquid alts are packaged as mutual funds and marketed to retail investors who can't invest in traditional hedge funds.""Any investor who wants access to alternative strategies should have access to them,"" as long as they are suitable for the investor and properly explained, McCormick said in an interview.Apparently investors agree. Though critics complain about high fees, opaque strategies and other factors that they say make liquid alts inappropriate for small investors, these products have become one of the fastest-growing types of mutual fund.Liquid alt assets under management in the U.S. and Europe have surged to about $440 billion, according to Preqin, a research firm specializing in alternative investments. In 2008, analysts estimate, the figure was less than $100 billion. Blackstone and its chief rival in this market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, manage half of all liquid alternative assets sold by big brokerage firms, according to Dover Financial Research.The appeal is not outsize returns: Liquid alts have delivered even less than hedge funds in recent years.The reason for their popularity, McCormick said, lies in the 2008 financial crisis and the damage it inflicted on many small investors' portfolios. ""You have baby boomers nearing retirement who experienced a scary event in 2008,"" he said. ""People who thought they had diversification and didn't really have it."" The long lists of assets liquid alt funds hold are designed to provide that diversification, he said.Now, McCormick is among the scores of fund marketers pushing to get liquid alts on the menu of options for U.S. workers' employer-sponsored, tax-deferred 401(k) retirement savings plans - a pool of money that totals $4.4 trillion. To date, these accounts have offered little-to-no exposure to alternative assets like hedge funds, private equity and real estate.""DIFFICULT CALL"" It hasn't been easy. The trustees who approve what's offered in 401(k) plans have so far rejected liquid alternatives as a viable option for workers who manage their own retirement savings.Liquid alts certainly offer diversification, said Gregg Thorsen, a Southwest Airlines Co executive who helps put together plans for $8 billion to $10 billion in employee retirement money. But, he said, ""the question is really around the best way to offer the benefit of that diversification in  a retirement plan with a diverse participant base, with wide-ranging communication needs and varying education on investments."" And with the higher fees of these funds, he said, ""the decision becomes an even more difficult call.""For an idea of what goes into some of these products, consider the Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, a $177 million liquid alt fund launched by Columbia Management in collaboration with Blackstone in January. Among the assets it or its underlying funds hold: common stocks; preferred stocks; corporate bonds; foreign and domestic government bonds; bonds issued by agencies run by governments; real-estate investment trusts; exchange-traded funds; exchange-traded notes; residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities; asset-backed securities; credit-default swaps; collateralized bond obligations; collateralized loan obligations; currency swaps; futures; total return swaps; money market funds; and other liquid alternative funds, including one that in turn invests in other hedge funds.All that diversity hasn't yielded much to cheer about. From its launch in late January to mid-July, the Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund generated negative returns of about 2 percent, compared with a positive 2 percent for a Morningstar index of comparable funds and a 5 percent gain for the S&P 500 Index.""We believe that alternative investments can complement a client's traditional equity and bond allocations by offering the potential for diversification, stability and positive expected returns over a complete market cycle,"" said Carlos Melville, Columbia's chief spokesman.The fund isn't uniquely lackluster. In the five years ended in April, alternative mutual funds in North America delivered an average annual return, after fees, of 5.8 percent, while similar funds in Europe returned 3.4 percent, both below the average 7.6 percent for hedge funds, according to Preqin. On the same basis, the S&P 500 Index returned 11.9 percent, and 14.3 percent including reinvested dividends.For those results, investors in liquid alt funds pay a lot. Liquid alternative funds charge an annual management fee of 1.76 percent, on average, compared with 1.22 percent for actively managed mutual funds, according to Morningstar. Simple instruments, like index funds, charge annual fees that are a small fraction of 1 percent. Many liquid alternative funds also charge sales commissions that go to intermediaries like brokers.The more complicated the fund, the higher the fees. The Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, for instance, charges an initial sales fee of up to 5.75 percent and annual operating fees of 2.68 to 3.83 percent, depending on the share class. Some investors are also charged a redemption fee for selling the fund within 18 months.PAYING THE PRICE  McCormick said higher fees reflect the added value of ""a layer of professional management."" He added: ""Sometimes articles are written to say liquid alts are taking advantage of retail investors because they charge such high fees. The reality is, it's much less expensive than what you pay for hedge fund exposure."" Hedge fund managers have historically charged investors a 2 percent annual fee and taken 20 percent of investment gains.Blackstone does not concern itself with marketing liquid alt funds directly to investors. That's done by what McCormick calls ""gatekeepers,"" firms like Fidelity Investments, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch that have signed marketing deals with Blackstone. It's their job to explain the products to investors and help them decide whether the funds are a good fit.Regulators are looking at the business to make sure that happens. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, an industry-funded group, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been examining sales and marketing of liquid alts to ensure that funds are not distorting elements of their investment strategies or policies. And the SEC has been looking into funds' disclosure of illiquid assets - which can be up to 15 percent of the fund in the United States.One worry is that in a broad market downturn, liquid alts may not be so liquid after all. When investors rush en masse to cash out of a mutual fund, the fund's managers have to sell assets to raise cash. But when markets are falling, unusual assets like those held in liquid alts can be hard to sell, forcing down prices even farther. That's what happened in the financial crisis, when mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and related derivatives were rendered virtually worthless.The SEC plans to draft a rule or recommendation for managers of liquid alt funds on their use of derivatives, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.On July 15, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin announced he was beginning an investigation into the sales practices of registered investment advisers in connection with alternative mutual funds. These funds, Galvin said, ""can be accidents waiting to happen when they are sold to investors who do not understand the risks and downside associated with the product.""Paul Jacobs, chief investment officer of Palisades Hudson Financial Group, which has $1.3 billion in assets under management, has analyzed dozens of liquid alt funds. Many of them, he said, ""used a black-box strategy, meaning it's hard to either get a good explanation of the strategy or to understand the strategy even if you do get an explanation.""He's found only one he thinks is worth investing in: the Merger Fund, one of the oldest liquid alternative funds, managed since 1989 by Westchester Capital Funds. Its returns - an average annual 6.6 percent since inception through Dec. 31 -  ""are not very sexy,"" Jacobs said, but he understands what's in it and how it will perform. IT'S ALL ABOUT DIVERSITY McCormick and other proponents of liquid alts say the critics are missing the point. ""It's not about promising outsized returns and getting people excited that way,"" he said. ""It's about diversification"" to protect against a broad, protracted downturn in financial markets.As Goldman Sachs Asset Management says on its website: ""Elevated stock market valuations and the prospect of rising interest rates may mean lower returns in traditional portfolios. However, alternative investments have historically delivered attractive relative rates of return in challenging equity and fixed income environments.""It's hard to put that to the test, though, since most liquid alt funds available today were launched since the current bull market began in March 2009. Ultimately, McCormick and other liquid alt proponents argue, it's up to the investor to decide whether the benefits of the funds are worth the fees and risks.A graduate of Vassar College and Yale Law School, McCormick worked as a McKinsey & Co consultant and a corporate lawyer before he joined Blackstone in 2005. Now 47-years-old, he credits much of his success in building Blackstone's liquid alts business to teamwork with colleague Brett Condron, 38, who joined Blackstone from Putnam Investments in 2010, as well as others at the firm who green-lighted his endeavor and helped create the guts of the products.Together, they were able to persuade hedge fund managers to develop liquid alts with Blackstone and sign up brokers to sell them.The financial crisis made the job easier. Until then, premier hedge fund managers tended to shun retail investors. During and after the crisis, hedge fund performance flagged, big investors started pulling back, and fee income shrank. McCormick was then able to convince big name firms like Two Sigma Investments and Wellington Management that it was worthwhile to manage money for Main Street.""The investor base for hedge funds has continued to evolve, and individual investors could represent the next big wave of demand,"" said Nobel Gulati, chief executive officer at Two Sigma Advisers LLC, part of the firm that manages money for institutional investors.With established fund managers on board, it was easier to get big brokerage and financial services firms to market the funds. Executives at outfits like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Fidelity knew that many retail investors wanted to get into hedge funds but couldn't because they either didn't qualify as accredited investors under SEC rules or couldn't afford the large minimum investments. Liquid alts would meet that demand. By and large, sales forces need little convincing beyond the prospect of a sales commission.The next goal - getting the funds into retirement savings plans - is a challenge, and not just because of subpar performance and high fees. Plan sponsors are held to a much higher standard than financial advisers. This so-called fiduciary standard means they must ensure that products offered are truly in investors' best interests.Matt Smith, who manages the Bank of Montreal's retirement-services business, noted that many fiduciaries want to see a three-year track record, but most liquid alt funds haven't been around that long.He said plan sponsors might be open to including liquid alts as part of a portfolio - say, packaged into a target-date fund. But they are wary of offering them as standalone options in which workers who aren't financially sophisticated can put all their money.McCormick counters that most institutional investors, including some pension funds, own far more alternative assets than individual investors do.Still, McCormick's boss, Tom Hill, who runs alternatives at Blackstone, said at the company's investor day last year that the firm faces significant ""hurdles"" to getting liquid alternatives into 401(k) plans. Blackstone, he said, hadn't ""cracked the code yet.""

616,"   By Mike Stone  Private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg & Co LLC is exploring a sale or initial public offering of government services provider PAE, which could value it at up to $1 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. Buyout firms, as well defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), are looking to sell their low-margin government services businesses because company valuations are recovering as government spending, which took a nosedive following the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, begins to stabilize.PAE is receiving financial advice from Houlihan Lokey on its potential sale, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is advising it on a potential initial public offering, the people said this week.  The sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak about the talks. Representatives for PAE and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment. Representatives for Lindsay Goldberg and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    Arlington, Virginia-based PAE provides the U.S government and other countries with support in aviation, logistics and training, around the world. Its clients include the U.S. Department of State mission in Iraq in its Baghdad Embassy Compound and the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah. Lockheed Martin sold PAE to New York-based Lindsay Goldberg in 2011 for around $350 million, Reuters reported at the time. On Monday, Lockheed announced it would seek to exit some of the services businesses it had retained.Founded in 1955, PAE has attempted in recent years to move into more sophisticated segments of government services through acquisitions. In January, PAE acquired a unit of US Investigations Services LLC which offers litigation support and biometric capture as well as construction surveillance and security consulting.  PAE says it currently employs 15,000 people in over 60 countries.

622,"   By James Regan | SYDNEY, July 29  SYDNEY, July 29 Australian nickel miner Mincor Resources said on Wednesday it will reduce production by up to 56 percent over the six months to end-December due to persistent low nickel prices that have left its operating levels unsustainable.""While near and medium term nickel price forecasts remain positive, it is clear that Mincor's mining operations cannot be sustained at spot prices without substantial changes,"" the company said in a statement.Mincor shares fell as much as 11 percent on the Australian Securities Exchange to their lowest since Aug. 8, 2013.The company also unveiled a April-June quarter operating loss of  A$1.51 million ($1.11 million) versus an A$1.30 million surplus the previous quarter.This week, London Metal Exchange three-month nickel  traded at around $11,350 a tonne, not far above a six-year low hit on July 8. Other nickel miners have also been rethinking output amid the weak pricing.Canada's Sherritt International Corp on Tuesday reduced its 2015 nickel production target to 78,000-82,000 tonnes, down from a previous estimate of 80,000-86,000 tonnes. Nickel miners had hoped that an Indonesian ban on exports of nickel ore would lead to a rise in demand in China for the steel-making alloy from other parts of the world, but Philippine suppliers appear to have taken up the shortfall.Macquarie Bank has slashed its nickel price outlook, cutting it by 13 percent for 2015 after similar moves by other investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, Citi, ANZ and JP Morgan.Macquarie, however, expects prices to recover later this year - a view echoed by UBS - as demand from Chinese mills picks up. Mincor will reduce output to between 2,000 and 3,000 tonnes of nickel-in-ore in the first half of fiscal 2015, which ends on Dec. 31, though output could  be ramped up rapidly to higher levels if market conditions improve, it said.Production in the same period of fiscal 2014 was 4,599 tonnes of nickel in ore.($1 = 1.3626 Australian dollars)   (Editing by Tom Hogue)",2015-07-29,MS,"Tue Jul 28, 2015 | 11:21pm EDT",Australia's Mincor slashes nickel output amid prices near 6-yr lows,http://www.reuters.com//article/australia-mincor-resources-nickel-idUSL3N1091GX20150729?type=companyNews
623,"  LONDON, July 30 Corporate earnings have been shrinking in emerging markets for four years, the longest recession in the history of the MSCI emerging index, and the declines are deepening, research from Morgan Stanley showed on Thursday.August marks four years since earnings-per-share (EPS) peaked in emerging markets and it has since fallen by 25 percent, Morgan Stanley calculates. The longest prior earnings recession in the asset class was after the 1997 Asian crisis and  lasted two years, it added.Emerging stocks on the MSCI, the most widely used equity benchmark, are in their fifth year of underperformance versus developed peers amid slower growth, weak reforms and the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates. More recently, they have been pressured by a Chinese equity rout.So far this year the index is down 6 percent. Morgan Stanley said the picture looked worse than 2008-09 when EPS fell 62 percent from peak-to-trough but started recovering in 18 months, as developing countries' balance sheets and external positions were stronger than now and central banks were able to cut interest rates.""The key negative remains the ongoing earnings recession which is worsening and broadening under the pressures of productivity growth, reform shortfalls, China's ongoing hard landing, generalised commodity price weakness and U.S. dollar strength,"" the bank added. ""We do not see any sign of an inflexion point near term in these formidable EPS headwinds.""Morgan Stanley said aside from Taiwan, eleven of the twelve largest emerging countries and all ten sectors were now in earnings recession, with the biggest EPS falls in Brazil and Russia at 72 percent and 61 percent respectively. Both countries are in economic recession as China, their main commodity importer, is expected to post its worst growth in a quarter century. Chinese earnings went into recession in October 2014, since when EPS has fallen by 5 percent, Morgan Stanley added.EPS declines have been biggest at 86 percent in the materials sector, while industrials and energy EPS is down more than 50 percent over the four years, the data showed.Another headwind was the rising dollar because ""for EM, a strong dollar and weak EM currencies have a negative impact on earnings in dollar terms via the translation effect,"" the note added.

640,"   By Michelle Chen | HONG KONG  HONG KONG A spike higher in the offshore yuan following suspected rare intervention by Chinese state banks is expected to be short-lived, especially with a looming U.S. interest rate rise likely to add to the attraction of owning dollars.But those betting on a further depreciation in the yuan are likely to have only limited room to push the offshore rate down relative to the onshore rate without drawing the ire of the Chinese central bank and the risk of further state intervention, market sources said.""The central bank will not stand aside if depreciation expectation is formed again and more intervention may happen,"" said a Hong Kong-based currency trader, who declined to be identified.The offshore yuan CNH=D3 shot up by more than 1 percent on Thursday on suspected intervention that was seen by traders as a gesture by authorities to shake out speculators betting against the yuan.Authorities have spent the country's foreign exchange reserves heavily to hold the yuan steady onshore since a surprise devaluation in August prompted fears the Chinese economy was in worse shape than previously thought and that the yuan therefore could fall further. Thursday's spike narrowed the offshore yuan's discount against the onshore rate to 0.38 percent from 1.56 percent on Wednesday and forced traders with short positions to cover. Traders suspect the sudden move was prompted by buying by state banks at the behest of the central bank.""The Chinese central bank's purpose was to narrow the gap between the offshore and onshore rates, but I don't see any fundamental that supports yuan appreciation against the dollar going forward,"" said Penny Chen, a fixed-income fund manager at Manulife Asset Management in Taiwan.Since the Aug 11 devaluation, several investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS, have revised down their forecasts for the yuan's performance this year. The Chinese currency will remain under pressure as long as U.S. interest rates are set to rise, analysts said. U.S. market rates have already risen in anticipation the Federal Reserve will raise its policy rate by the end of this year for the first time since 2006.In contrast, the Chinese central bank has cut lending rates five times since last November and analysts expect further easing of monetary policy to support China's economy.The interest rate differential will be reflected more in the offshore market, where China's central bank has less influence, analysts said.    The offshore yuan was quoted at 6.4150 per dollar late on Friday in Asia, compared with an onshore rate of 6.3740 - a gap of 410 pips. It was 200 pips earlier in the day, but traders said the gap widened after London offshore markets kicked into action. Some traders believe the central bank will not allow the gap to widen to 500 pips for fear that would strengthen expectations of further yuan depreciation.Still, the central bank has less influence in the offshore market, which is more driven by market forces, and so leaves more room for the yuan to fall, said Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International in Hong Kong.    ""The gap between CNH (offshore) and CNY (onshore) will be widened to 500-600 pips again in the coming months,"" Liao said.Liao expected the onshore and offshore rates to fall to 6.45 and to more than 6.5 per dollar, respectively, by the end of the year if the Fed increases its benchmark rates.

643,"  (Reworks story, adds background on fixed income trading)By Richa Naidu and Olivia OranSept 17 Investment bank Jefferies said quarterly adjusted net earnings fell by nearly half after concerns over the slowing Chinese economy and the Greek debt crisis cut into trading volume and forced a writedown of assets.New York-based Jefferies Group, a unit of Leucadia National Corp, posts results a month before most bigger Wall Street firms, and often give a sense of what is in store for its bigger rivals.But analysts said banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc  and Morgan Stanley will not likely suffer trading drops that have nearly as big an impact on the bottom line as those at Jefferies.Jefferies posted negative $18.2 million in bond trading revenue after writedowns in the three months ended Aug. 31, and adjusted net earnings fell to $46.8 million.A year ago, it reported earnings of $89.5 million and bond trading revenue of $195 million. Adjusted results excluded its struggling Bache commodities and financial derivatives unit, most of which has been sold to Societe Generale.The bigger banks have less exposure in areas like the distressed debt of energy companies - where Jefferies has lost more than $90 million in the last nine months from 25 positions, analysts said.""It's quite likely that Jefferies may not be completely representative of the results from more diversified banks,"" said Morningstar analyst Michael Wong.Net earnings totaled $2.48 million, including Bache, which has its roots in one of the world's oldest commodities futures brokers, Prudential Bache. In the same quarter a year earlier, net earnings were $83.87 million. Total adjusted net revenue tumbled 27 percent to $583.2 million, excluding Bache.BOND TRADING PRESSURE  A number of bank CEOs said this week they expect trading revenue to be down in the third quarter.Bank of America Corp CEO Brian Moynihan said on Wednesday that trading revenue may fall 5 percent to 6 percent during the quarter because of weakness in its fixed income business.Citigroup Inc CFO John Gerspach said third- quarter trading revenue could decline by a similar amount.Bond trading has been under pressure since the financial crisis as new rules discourage banks from trading off their own balance sheet and regulators demand that banks boost capital.Some banks like UBS AG have gotten out of fixed income entirely while others like Morgan Stanley have shifted to less-volatile businesses like wealth management.During the second quarter, bond trading revenue at every major bank, with the exception of Morgan Stanley, declined from the same period last year.

653,"  (Adds paragraph 12 to reflect Deutsche Bank declined to comment)By Olivia Oran and Dan WilchinsNEW YORK Oct 6 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are winning back the trading business of hedge fund clients that they lost to European rivals during the financial crisis, as new capital rules spur banks like Deutsche Bank to scale down their businesses.The two U.S. banks together now have about 37 percent of the market for trading with hedge funds and financing positions, known as ""prime brokerage,"" up about 6 percentage points from the end of last year, according to research firm Preqin.The market share gains are fueling stock trading profits at JPMorgan Chase & Co. as well as at Goldman and Morgan Stanley, and could be a bright spot when the companies post results later this month.Prime brokerage is one of the few areas on Wall Street where revenue and prices are rising, even though competition is receding, executives in the business and analysts told Reuters.""With the foreign banks backing away, it's become a greener pasture for some of the U.S. prime businesses,"" said Larry Tabb, founder of financial markets advisory firm Tabb Group.It's a business which the U.S. banks are marketing aggressively. Steve Boyd, founder of hedge fund Armistice Capital, originally used just Zurich-based UBS AG as a prime broker when he started the fund in 2012. Last year, a Morgan Stanley representative told him the bank wanted his business.""We weren't even looking for a second prime yet,"" Boyd said. ""They told us they were interested in investing in a relationship with us, and didn't just want to work with us when it was highly profitable for them."" Armistice ended up giving some of its business to Morgan Stanley.European banks are falling behind because of new global rules, known as Basel III, designed to make banks safer. Those rules limit the amount of debt that banks can take on to fund their assets, and specify the minimum amount of equity, or capital, that banks must use.Prime brokerage for stocks, bonds, and related derivatives demands high amounts of capital, by one measure, forcing Europeans banks that are close to the lower limits of capital to scale down their businesses. Preqin data show that since 2013, Deutsche Bank's market share has fallen by a percentage point to 7 percent, with the losses happening mainly in 2014. Credit Suisse's new chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, is planning to slash its prime brokerage business, according to a Swiss newspaper report in September. [ID: nL5N11J06U] In April, Credit Suisse's co-head of investment banking, Tim O'Hara, had said the bank is fully committed to the business.Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are in the middle of global strategic reviews.A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.The gains at the U.S. banks underscore how being faster to comply with new rules can result in greater revenue gains.Analysts said that even if the prime brokerage business itself is often low margin, it can be a crucial source of stock trading revenue. Coalition estimates that prime brokerage accounted for 35 percent of all equities revenue in 2014, up from 31 percent the year before and 25 percent in 2009.  Morgan Stanley, for example, posted an 28 percent increase in stock trading revenue in the second quarter thanks in part to equity prime brokerage. For Goldman Sachs, stock trading revenue rose 63 percent in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, also helped by prime brokerage. Goldman chief financial officer Harvey Schwartz said that the bank has been benefiting from higher pricing, though it was not the primary driver of performance.For the ten biggest global investment and universal banks, prime brokerage revenue in 2014 grew to about $14.2 billion, according to research firm Coalition, up 11 percent from the year before.A REVERSAL U.S. banks have been able to boost revenue in part by raising prices. One prime brokerage executive at a European bank estimated that financing a stock trade could be as much as five times more expensive than it had been. Many executives across Wall Street stressed that without charging more, the business cannot be profitable for them anymore, because prime brokerage demands so much capital. Prices for services can vary widely even from one customer to another at the same bank, depending on such things as how big the fund is and how much business it does with the bank. Many banks are pressing customers to either do more trading with them or find a new prime broker. For hedge funds, that is translating to more of them working with fewer prime brokers: in 2012, 54.6 percent of newly launched hedge funds worked with one prime broker. In 2015, that figure had risen to 71.2 percent, according to industry data tracker Eurekahedge. [ID: nL5N10W0YC]A rebound in the hedge fund industry has also helped to boost prime brokerage revenue for the banking industry. Total global hedge fund capital rose for the 11th consecutive quarter during the second quarter to $2.97 trillion.In 2008 during the crisis, hedge fund capital fell to as low as $1.4 trillion. Those were dark times for banks globally, particularly in the United States. After JPMorgan rescued Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers started wobbling and ultimately failed, hedge funds began pulling money out of U.S. banks.Preqin's data does not go back to before the financial crisis, but Global Custodian magazine said 44 percent of hedge funds reduced balances with Goldman Sachs and 70 percent pulled back from Morgan Stanley.Some customers turned to banks perceived as having the explicit backing of their home governments, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, and those viewed as having strong credit like JPMorgan.European banks are suffering because of Basel III capital rules known as ""leverage rules"" that don't give banks a break for having less risky assets. In prime brokerage businesses, banks finance customers' trades, which tend to be relatively low-risk loans. But the size of the positions can be relatively large, forcing banks to use high amounts of capital to fund the assets.The Basel III global leverage rules are expected to be finalized next year. The current preliminary Basel minimum is 3 percent, a figure that is expected to be higher for the final rules that become mandatory in the beginning of 2018.  The U.S. set its own rules last year that are more severe than the expected global minimum requirements. U.S. banks have built capital to meet those rules, and now have more than enough, allowing them to take more risk, executives said.Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which both must have a 5 percent minimum leverage ratio for their holding companies under U.S. rules, have a 9.6 percent and 7.9 percent ratio, respectively, according to regulatory filings as of June 30.  Other jurisdictions are requiring levels above the Basel minimums too-Swiss banks are required to have at least a 6 percent leverage ratio.Individual nations' may calculate leverage differently from one another and from the Basel Committee of global banking supervisors, which sets the Basel capital rules. Under those rules, Credit Suisse has a 3.7 percent ratio, but under Swiss rules, it has a 4.3 ratio, meaning it will have to build capital. Deutsche Bank's leverage ratio is 3.6 percent under Basel rules.(Reporting by Olivia Oran and Dan Wilchins in New York; editing by John Pickering)",2015-10-06,MS,"Tue Oct 6, 2015 | 2:03pm EDT","INSIGHT-Goldman, Morgan Stanley win back hedge fund trading business",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-banks-hedgefunds-idUSL1N1261Q120151006?type=companyNews

Prime brokerage for stocks, bonds, and related derivatives demands high amounts of capital, by one measure, forcing Europeans banks that are close to the lower limits of capital to scale down their businesses. Preqin data show that since 2013, Deutsche Bank's market share has fallen by a percentage point to 7 percent, with the losses happening mainly in 2014.     Credit Suisse's new chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, is planning to slash its prime brokerage business, according to a Swiss newspaper report in September. In April, Credit Suisse's co-head of investment banking, Tim O'Hara, had said the bank is fully committed to the business.      Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are in the middle of global strategic reviews.A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.The gains at the U.S. banks underscore how being faster to comply with new rules can result in greater revenue gains.     Analysts said that even if the prime brokerage business itself is often low margin, it can be a crucial source of stock trading revenue. Coalition estimates that prime brokerage accounted for 35 percent of all equities revenue in 2014, up from 31 percent the year before and 25 percent in 2009. Morgan Stanley, for example, posted an 28 percent increase in stock trading revenue in the second quarter thanks in part to equity prime brokerage.     For Goldman Sachs, stock trading revenue rose 63 percent in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, also helped by prime brokerage. Goldman chief financial officer Harvey Schwartz said that the bank has been benefiting from higher pricing, though it was not the primary driver of performance.      For the ten biggest global investment and universal banks, prime brokerage revenue in 2014 grew to about $14.2 billion, according to research firm Coalition, up 11 percent from the year before. A REVERSAL     U.S. banks have been able to boost revenue in part by raising prices. One prime brokerage executive at a European bank estimated that financing a stock trade could be as much as five times more expensive than it had been. Many executives across Wall Street stressed that without charging more, the business cannot be profitable for them anymore, because prime brokerage demands so much capital. Prices for services can vary widely even from one customer to another at the same bank, depending on such things as how big the fund is and how much business it does with the bank.     Many banks are pressing customers to either do more trading with them or find a new prime broker. For hedge funds, that is translating to more of them working with fewer prime brokers: in 2012, 54.6 percent of newly launched hedge funds worked with one prime broker. In 2015, that figure had risen to 71.2 percent, according to industry data tracker Eurekahedge. A rebound in the hedge fund industry has also helped to boost prime brokerage revenue for the banking industry. Total global hedge fund capital rose for the 11th consecutive quarter during the second quarter to $2.97 trillion.      In 2008 during the crisis, hedge fund capital fell to as low as $1.4 trillion. Those were dark times for banks globally, particularly in the United States. After JPMorgan rescued Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers started wobbling and ultimately failed, hedge funds began pulling money out of U.S. banks.     Preqin's data does not go back to before the financial crisis, but Global Custodian magazine said 44 percent of hedge funds reduced balances with Goldman Sachs and 70 percent pulled back from Morgan Stanley.    Some customers turned to banks perceived as having the explicit backing of their home governments, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, and those viewed as having strong credit like JPMorgan.     European banks are suffering because of Basel III capital rules known as ""leverage rules"" that don't give banks a break for having less risky assets. In prime brokerage businesses, banks finance customers' trades, which tend to be relatively low-risk loans. But the size of the positions can be relatively large, forcing banks to use high amounts of capital to fund the assets.The Basel III global leverage rules are expected to be finalized next year. The current preliminary Basel minimum is 3 percent, a figure that is expected to be higher for the final rules that become mandatory in the beginning of 2018. The U.S. set its own rules last year that are more severe than the expected global minimum requirements. U.S. banks have built capital to meet those rules, and now have more than enough, allowing them to take more risk, executives said.     Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which both must have a 5 percent minimum leverage ratio for their holding companies under U.S. rules, have a 9.6 percent and 7.9 percent ratio, respectively, according to regulatory filings as of June 30. Other jurisdictions are requiring levels above the Basel minimums too - Swiss banks would be required to have at least a 6 percent leverage ratio under a law passed by the nation's lower house of parliament, but not yet by the upper house.Individual nations' may calculate leverage differently from one another and from the Basel Committee of global banking supervisors, which sets the Basel capital rules. Under those rules, Credit Suisse has a 3.7 percent ratio, but under Swiss rules, it has a 4.3 ratio, meaning it will have to build capital. Deutsche Bank's leverage ratio is 3.6 percent under Basel rules.

655,"  (Corrects 25th paragraph to show Swiss leverage law has not been passed by the upper house)By Olivia Oran and Dan WilchinsNEW YORK Oct 6 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are winning back the trading business of hedge fund clients that they lost to European rivals during the financial crisis, as new capital rules spur banks like Deutsche Bank to scale down their businesses.The two U.S. banks together now have about 37 percent of the market for trading with hedge funds and financing positions, known as ""prime brokerage,"" up about 6 percentage points from the end of last year, according to research firm Preqin.The market share gains are fueling stock trading profits at JPMorgan Chase & Co. as well as at Goldman and Morgan Stanley, and could be a bright spot when the companies post results later this month.Prime brokerage is one of the few areas on Wall Street where revenue and prices are rising, even though competition is receding, executives in the business and analysts told Reuters.""With the foreign banks backing away, it's become a greener pasture for some of the U.S. prime businesses,"" said Larry Tabb, founder of financial markets advisory firm Tabb Group.It's a business which the U.S. banks are marketing aggressively. Steve Boyd, founder of hedge fund Armistice Capital, originally used just Zurich-based UBS AG as a prime broker when he started the fund in 2012. Last year, a Morgan Stanley representative told him the bank wanted his business.""We weren't even looking for a second prime yet,"" Boyd said.

657,"   By Ole Mikkelsen | COPENHAGEN  COPENHAGEN Danish transport and logistics group DSV (DSV.CO) is buying UTi Worldwide (UTIW.O) in a deal that values the U.S.-based rival at $1.35 billion, saying the deal offered to give it greater global reach as well as opportunities for synergies and cost savings.Shares in DSV, which had held abortive takeover talks with UTi last year, rose as much as 6.7 percent to a record 270.4 Danish crowns. UTi stock had dropped 66 percent since the collapse of the previous deal talks.DSV's offer, which has been accepted by UTi, is $7.10 in cash per each UTi share, a premium of about 50 percent to the target's closing price on Oct. 8, and a premium of around 34 percent to the 30-day volume-weighted average closing price.""The price is actually relatively cheap for such a large bloc of business,"" said analyst Frans Hoyer at Jyske Bank, noting it was pitched at 0.34 times the company's last full-year  reported sales of $3.9 billion.DSV, founded by 10 truckers in 1976, has long said it wanted to growth its business and a consolidation of the fragmented industry was needed. It said the deal was expected to increase DSV's annual revenue by approximately 50 percent, creating one of the world's strongest transport and logistics networks. ""We complement each other perfectly, both in terms of business activities and geography,"" DSV Chairman Kurt Larsen said. UTi Chairman Roger MacFarlane said he strongly recommended  shareholders accept the offer.But analysts also noted UTi's recent performance as a challenge for DSV. The company on Sept. 3 reported a bigger than expected second-quarter loss of $0.70 per share and a 16.5 percent drop in revenue to $913.9 million. ""There is a big potential in this for DSV but there is also great risk,"" analyst Jacob Pedersen at Sydbank said. ""UTI is not making any money today, so DSV really needs to get the big broom out and clean up in the company”.DSV said the transaction is conditional on approval of the UTi shareholders, the largest of which are funds controlled by P2 Capital Partners LLC, holding approximately 10.8 percent of the shares. P2 has already come out in favor of the deal.Deutsche Post-controlled DHL Logistics is the world's largest player in the sector, followed by Swiss-based Kuehne & Nagel KNIN.VX, Germany's DB Schenker and U.S.-based C. H. Robinson. Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO), ING ING.AS and Nordea (NDA.ST) have committed to financing the transaction.

661,"  NEW YORK Oct 19 The $7.7 billion that poured into managed accounts at Morgan Stanley last quarter was a highlight of its wealth management business, the company said Monday, but one of the architects of the program is no longer with the bank.Roger Paradiso, chief investment officer and managing director of the company's Unified Management Account (UMA) business, left this month ""to pursue other interests,"" a Morgan Stanley spokesman said.Paradiso, who joined Morgan Stanley in 2009 when it purchased Smith Barney, his former employer, did not respond to requests for comment. He continues to serve as treasurer of the Managed Money Institute (MMI), a trade group for companies that sell products through brokerage firms and financial advisers.Besides running the fast-growing UMA business, Paradiso coordinated investment strategies for all managed money products with the Wealth Management division's global investment committee. Mike Wilson and Lisa Shalett, heads of the committee, now coordinate the strategies directly and Chad Graves runs the UMA product, the spokesman said. Managed accounts are a fast-growing and profitable business that charges retail brokerage clients fees that generally range from 1.25 percent to 3.0 percent annually to have their money managed through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds or individual investment managers.The managed account market will grow to $6.7 trillion in assets under management by 2017, an 18 percent compound annual growth rate since 2013, according to data provider Cerulli Associates. Morgan Stanley is the securities industry's largest managed account provider due to its takeover of Citigroup's Smith Barney, whose Consulting Group unit pioneered managed account products.UMAs consolidate money sent to various managers into one account to simplify record-keeping and reporting, and are the fastest-growing sector of managed accounts. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has cited the profitability and ""annuitized"" revenue from managed accounts as a major reason for pursuing Smith Barney. Morgan Stanley clients kept $102.9 billion in UMAs as of the end of the second quarter, according to MMI.Paradiso's departure coincides with a broader shakeup. Early this month, Gorman appointed capital markets veteran Dan Simkowitz head of asset management. It had been run by Greg Fleming, who remains president of wealth management.Jim Tracy, a Smith Barney alumnus who ran managed accounts, stepped down in June to become a wealth management vice chairman, often considered an honorary title. Jed Finn and Jason Moore, each of whom joined Morgan Stanley in 2011, now run  managed money products.

662,"   By Richa Naidu and Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on Monday warned that there was little hope for a quick turnaround in its key trading business given the persistence of global growth concerns that helped pummel the bank's third quarter earnings. Chief Executive James Gorman was put on the defensive after a 42 percent slide in bond trading, one of its worst performances since the financial crisis, and a drop in its private-equity business sent net income skidding.   ""We're by no means complacent about this,"" Gorman told analysts after the forecast-lagging results. ""We want to make sure this isn’t a long-term trend and we’ll take whatever steps we need to take.""Gorman said recent management changes, such as the promotion of global equities head Ted Pick to oversee all of trading, would allow better coordination between the firm's bond and equities desks.Pick, who previously helped to turn around Morgan Stanley’s equities business into the top franchise on Wall Street, has his work cut out for him. While factors such as doubts about Federal Reserve rate policy and China's economic slowdown have wreaked havoc on many banks' trading results, Morgan Stanley's bond trading performance was the worst on Wall Street, outpacing a 33 percent drop at arch rival Goldman Sachs (GS.N).  The impact of trading on the bank's bottom line comes despite Morgan Stanley's efforts to insulate itself from market gyrations by focusing more on wealth management.Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan offered little hope the trading environment would improve anytime soon.""So far in the quarter, some of the key drivers that will likely drive client activity are mixed,"" Pruzan said on a call with analysts. ""Drivers of near-term uncertainty, including the Fed, China, commodities and global growth, have not diminished."" Aside from trading, the bank also saw weakness in its investment management unit, as revenue fell about 59 percent due to losses at the bank's private equity business in Asia.    The business - a smaller part of the bank that it has been trying to refocus on - includes asset management, alternatives and merchant banking.    In early October, the bank shifted Dan Simkowitz from his role as co-head of global capital markets to a new position heading the group.    The move followed a broader shuffling of key wealth management and securities executives this year as part of a firm-wide effort to get those two businesses to work more closely.Revenue from investment banking, a traditional strength, fell 15.3 percent to $1.31 billion as a drop in revenues from equity and debt underwriting overshadowed a strong M&A market. The bank's shares tumbled as much as 6.9 percent in morning trading on Monday - the biggest percentage drop since November 2012 - wiping out about $4.6 billion in market value.Financial markets have been on tenterhooks for months, trying to gauge when the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.   Morgan Stanley said adjusted revenue in its business that sells and trades fixed-income securities and commodities (FIC) fell 42 percent to $583 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Overall profit attributable to shareholders fell 42.4 percent. PROFIT AND REVENUE MISS     Earnings applicable to common shareholders fell to $939 million, or 48 cents per share, from $1.63 billion, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for legal reserves and valuation of debt, the bank earned 42 cents per share.    Analysts on average had expected earnings of 62 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding accounting adjustments, net revenue was $7.33 billion, missing the average estimate of $8.54 billion.    ""We don't think this quarter says anything negative about Morgan Stanley's safety and soundness, but it looks like one they'd like to forget ASAP,"" Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said.     Revenue in the bank's increasingly important wealth management business fell 3.5 percent to $3.64 billion, but accounted for 46.9 percent of revenue, compared with 42.4 percent in the year-ago quarter. The pre-tax margin in the wealth business expanded to 23 percent from 21 percent, within Gorman's target for year-end. The weakness in investment banking came even as Morgan Stanley ranked second globally in mergers advisory volumes in the first nine months of the year, after Goldman, according to Thomson Reuters data.    Pruzan said the bank had seen a strong start to deal activity in the fourth quarter.    Revenue from equity underwriting, however, slid 46 percent to $250 million, reflecting market turbulence that discouraged many companies from going public. As of Oct. 9, U.S. IPO activity this year was down 42 percent compared with the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.    Morgan Stanley said it had spent 18.4 percent less on employee compensation in the quarter, the lowest since the second quarter of 2010.    Weak trading revenues are likely to mean Wall Street bankers and traders will get smaller bonuses this year.

666,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) multiyear effort to build up its wealth management arm's lending business began to pay off on Monday as the unit emerged as one of the few bright spots in the bank's generally bleak quarterly earnings. The New York-based bank said profit in its wealth management group rose 6 percent, helped by a 25 percent increase in net interest income, a measure of lending income. That growth stood in stark contrast with slides in bond trading, investment banking and investment management.The net interest income increase stemmed from growth in the bank's loan book, which rose 33 percent during the third quarter from the same period last year. In the last several years, Morgan Stanley has hired hundreds of bankers, underwriters, and back-office staff to help it write more mortgages and specialized loans. It has revamped its compensation structure to encourage its brokers to make loans, and has marketed its offerings more aggressively with clients.The effort is one part of Morgan Stanley's broad campaign to make itself safer after coming uncomfortably close to failing during the financial crisis. The bank spent billions of dollars buying the Smith Barney retail brokerage business from Citigroup (C.N) between 2009 and 2013, and combining it with its own wealth management unit.  Morgan Stanley's efforts to ramp up lending underscores how since the financial crisis, investment banks have made themselves more and more like universal banks by increasing their retail and commercial banking activities. Even Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which is clinging to its traditional investment banking focus, has agreed to acquire GE Capital's (GE.N) online deposit business. Morgan Stanley's executives often trumpet the relatively stable earnings that wealth management offers, as opposed to a business like trading, where revenue can plunge in any given quarter. In the third quarter, for example, excluding accounting adjustments linked to the values of the bank's own debt, bond trading revenue fell 42 percent to $583 million.  Lending, which comprises mortgages as well as securities-based lending in which clients can borrow against their own portfolios, is a key part of that shift. At Morgan Stanley, interest income from loans in wealth management was about a fifth of total revenue for the unit, and it helped lift the business's pre-tax profit margin to 23 percent, up 2 percentage points from the same quarter last year.     Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with KBW, said Morgan Stanley may see an increase in earnings through its loan strategy, but cautioned that it is not devoid of risk. ""There is upside, but it has to be done in a manner that is prudent,"" he said.    Morgan Stanley has said the average credit score for its mortgage customers is around 750, well into the ""prime"" borrower category, and the bank has had just one credit loss out of over 20,000 individual loans, CEO James Gorman said on the company's earnings call.  The bank's loan book has considerably more room to grow, executives told Reuters. Morgan Stanley loans out around 55 percent of its deposits, well below the roughly 80 percent that large commercial banks lend. Just 1.8 percent of its clients had a mortgage with the bank, and just 14 percent have a securities-based or tailored loans.  The bank ended the quarter with $139 billion in deposits, up from $132 billion in the second quarter.

668,"  * Q3 profit falls 42.4 pct* FIC revenue drops 42 pct* Wealth management revenue slips 3.5 pct* Shares fall as much as 6.9 pct   (Recasts top)By Richa Naidu and Olivia OranOct 19  Morgan Stanley on Monday warned that there was little hope for a quick turnaround in its key trading business given the persistence of global growth concerns that helped pummel the bank's third quarter earnings.Chief Executive James Gorman was put on the defensive after a 42 percent slide in bond trading, one of its worst performances since the financial crisis, and a drop in its private-equity business sent net income skidding.""We're by no means complacent about this,"" Gorman told analysts after the forecast-lagging results. ""We want to make sure this isn't a long-term trend and we'll take whatever steps we need to take.""Gorman said recent management changes, such as the promotion of global equities head Ted Pick to oversee all of trading, would allow better coordination between the firm's bond and equities desks.Pick, who previously helped to turn around Morgan Stanley's equities business into the top franchise on Wall Street, has his work cut out for him.While factors such as doubts about Federal Reserve rate policy and China's economic slowdown have wreaked havoc on many banks' trading results, Morgan Stanley's bond trading performance was the worst on Wall Street, outpacing a 33 percent drop at arch rival Goldman Sachs.The impact of trading on the bank's bottom line comes despite Morgan Stanley's efforts to insulate itself from market gyrations by focusing more on wealth management. Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan offered little hope the trading environment would improve anytime soon.""So far in the quarter, some of the key drivers that will likely drive client activity are mixed,"" Pruzan said on a call with analysts. ""Drivers of near-term uncertainty, including the Fed, China, commodities and global growth, have not diminished.""Aside from trading, the bank also saw weakness in its investment management unit, as revenue fell about 59 percent due to losses at the bank's private equity business in Asia.The business - a smaller part of the bank that it has been trying to refocus on - includes asset management, alternatives and merchant banking.In early October, the bank shifted Dan Simkowitz from his role as co-head of global capital markets to a new position heading the group.The move followed a broader shuffling of key wealth management and securities executives this year as part of a firm-wide effort to get those two businesses to work more closely. Revenue from investment banking, a traditional strength, fell 15.3 percent to $1.31 billion as a drop in revenues from equity and debt underwriting overshadowed a strong M&A market.The bank's shares tumbled as much as 6.9 percent in morning trading on Monday - the biggest percentage drop since November 2012 - wiping out about $4.6 billion in market value.Financial markets have been on tenterhooks for months, trying to gauge when the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.Morgan Stanley said adjusted revenue in its business that sells and trades fixed-income securities and commodities (FIC) fell 42 percent to $583 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Overall profit attributable to shareholders fell 42.4 percent.PROFIT AND REVENUE MISS  Earnings applicable to common shareholders fell to $939 million, or 48 cents per share, from $1.63 billion, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for legal reserves and valuation of debt, the bank earned 42 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 62 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding accounting adjustments, net revenue was $7.33 billion, missing the average estimate of $8.54 billion.""We don't think this quarter says anything negative about Morgan Stanley's safety and soundness, but it looks like one they'd like to forget ASAP,"" Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said.Revenue in the bank's increasingly important wealth management business fell 3.5 percent to $3.64 billion, but accounted for 46.9 percent of revenue, compared with 42.4 percent in the year-ago quarter.The pre-tax margin in the wealth business expanded to 23 percent from 21 percent, within Gorman's target for year-end.The weakness in investment banking came even as Morgan Stanley ranked second globally in mergers advisory volumes in the first nine months of the year, after Goldman, according to Thomson Reuters data.Pruzan said the bank had seen a strong start to deal activity in the fourth quarter.Revenue from equity underwriting, however, slid 46 percent to $250 million, reflecting market turbulence that discouraged many companies from going public. As of Oct. 9, U.S. IPO activity this year was down 42 percent compared with the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.Morgan Stanley said it had spent 18.4 percent less on employee compensation in the quarter, the lowest since the second quarter of 2010.Weak trading revenues are likely to mean Wall Street bankers and traders will get smaller bonuses this year.(Reporting by Richa Naidu and Sudarshan Varadhan in Bengaluru and Olivia Oran in New York; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Christian Plumb)",2015-10-19,MS,"Mon Oct 19, 2015 | 2:47pm EDT",UPDATE 6-Morgan Stanley's trading rout sets grim tone for Q4,http://www.reuters.com//article/morganstanley-results-idUSL3N12J4K020151019?type=companyNews

The bank's shares were last down 6 percent. The results stoked worries over the state of other big world banks, while the S&P energy index was last down over 2 percent amid the slide in oil prices.""After three weeks of market gains, any disappointing earnings this morning could indicate that we could be in for some profit-taking,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  ended slightly higher, while Japanese  and Shanghai shares both ended lower.China's economy, the world's second biggest, grew at the slowest pace in six years in the third quarter, data showed on Monday, making it increasingly likely that Beijing will cut interest rates to spur activity. While monthly Chinese industrial output numbers were poor and the quarterly growth figure was the weakest since the 2008 financial crisis, the 6.9 percent reading just beat a forecast for 6.8 percent.OIL DROPS The reaction in the oil market was negative, with Brent crude down nearly 3 percent and U.S. crude down more than 2 percent, on concerns over slowing growth in China, the world's largest energy consumer. Data also showed that Chinese oil demand fell slightly in September, meaning the country's year-to-date growth was running behind the International Energy Agency's forecast.The MSCI world equity index, which tracks 46 key global markets, was last down 0.41 percent, while the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.21 percent, at 1,438.49.The Dow Jones industrial average was last down 0.19 percent, at 17,182.67. The S&P 500 was down 0.36 percent, at 2,025.74. The Nasdaq Composite was off 11.32 points, or 0.23 percent, at 4,875.37.Brent crude was last down $1.38 at $49.08 a barrel. U.S. crude was last down $1.14 at $46.12 per barrel.The euro retreated to a 10-day low against the dollar of $1.1306 as investors focused on a European Central Bank meeting later in the week that could pave the way for further stimulus to boost inflation in the euro zone.""Any dovish shift in the ECB's language will be seen as increasing the odds of more stimulus and likely send the euro broadly lower,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.40 percent at 94.918.U.S. 30-year Treasury yields rose to a nearly one-week high of 2.91 percent, while spot gold prices  were last down 0.44 percent at $1,171.75 an ounce.

670,"  NEW YORK Fees and commissions collected last quarter by Morgan Stanley's almost 16,000 brokers were nothing to write home about, but Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on Monday they were enough to justify his strategy of creating the world's biggest brokerage firm.Pretax profit in the wealth management business inched up 3 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to $824 million, outshining a 14 percent decline to $688 million at the company's trading and investment management division and a loss of $9 million in its investment management division.Gorman, who joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 when its retail profit margin returns were in single digits, said he remains committed to  wealth management as a strategic offset to more-volatile businesses.""We delivered a 23 percent (pretax profit margin) return on lower revenue in wealth management, which was exactly what we said we'd do,"" he said in a conference call with analysts. In a difficult trading quarter, wealth management contributed almost 47 percent of Morgan Stanley's total revenue, up from about 43 percent a year earlier. Retail investors backed away from trading last quarter, worried about volatile markets and tumbling stock prices that shaved 7 percent from the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Mutual funds and other companies also delayed introducing new products for brokers to sell, nudging commissions down 28.5 percent to $652 million at Morgan Stanley. Fee-based accounts, generally a stable revenue source because clients pay a percent of assets they keep at the firm regardless of trades they make, also lost momentum. Total client assets of $1.9 billion were down 5 percent from the second quarter. New fee-based client assets fell 45 percent over the same period to $7.7 billion, while average revenue per broker declined 6 percent from the second quarter to $922 million. Morgan Stanley is riding out turbulence in its business with tight expense control, Gorman said. Wealth management compensation expenses fell to 56 percent of revenue from 57 percent in the second quarter and 58 percent a year ago. Despite headlines about big firms paying exorbitant recruiting bonuses, Morgan Stanley's broker count of 15,807 is down 355 from a year ago. But that is still 36 advisers more than it had June 30, a sign it is retaining more veteran brokers than earlier this year and elevating trainees to full-time positions, said Jonathan Pruzan, chief financial officer.

671,"   By Olivia Oran  Oct 20 A novel U.S. natural gas venture launched by former Morgan Stanley trading executives has secured its first major deal, allowing it to capitalize on seasonal supply shortages in pockets of the Northeast.A large oil and gas company has agreed to buy as much as 90 billion cubic feet of compressed natural gas over five years, the new company, Pentagon Energy, said in a statement. The gas will be shipped by truck from a CNG station in the heart of the Marcellus shale gas field to power plants across the Northeast. Pentagon declined to name the buyer of the gas.The project, involving the nation's largest gas compressing station and specially designed trucks for hauling it up to hundreds of miles, is meant to capitalize on the abrupt supply shortages and price spikes that can arise in the region due to a lack of pipeline capacity to meet peak winter demand.Pentagon plans to build several more so-called mother stations that will provide CNG to locations that ""experience gas shortages or lack the infrastructure to receive gas."" Coral Gables, Florida-based Pentagon was formed earlier this year from the acquisition of Wentworth, Morgan Stanley's compressed natural gas business. The bank came under pressure from regulators to exit its physical commodities businesses, including Wentworth.  Morgan Stanley also sold its physical oil business to Castleton Commodities International in May.Alberto Chiesara, who was an executive director in Morgan Stanley's commodities group, and Ryan Comeford, who was a managing director, left the bank to join Pentagon following the Wentworth sale. The Marcellus CNG facility will be able to compress up to 2.5 billion cubic feet per month, equivalent to about 1.5 percent of peak power plant gas demand in the Northeast.Natural gas production in the United States, and in particular the Marcellus shale in the Northeast, has swelled in recent years as hydraulic fracturing opens up decades' worth of resources. But some consumers in the region are still unable to take advantage due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure, which is expanding relatively slowly because of regulatory hurdles of building new lines in densely populated areas.As a result, natural gas prices in some areas can spike abruptly during the winter as supplies run short, sometimes forcing power plants to switch to costlier fuels or import more expensive liquefied natural gas from abroad.(Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",2015-10-21,MS,"Tue Oct 20, 2015 | 9:00pm EDT",Natgas venture by ex-Morgan Stanley traders seals first deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/pentagonenergy-gas-idUSL1N12K2AQ20151021?type=companyNews
672,"  LONDON Oct 22 China allocates an estimated 10 percent of its $3.5 trillion  foreign exchange reserves to sterling, double the holdings of other emerging market central banks in the British currency, an analysis by Morgan Stanley shows.Analysts Evan Brown and Charles Rubenfeld said China may choose to keep more reserves denominated in sterling in the coming years, perhaps at the expense of the dollar, as it seeks to beef up ties with London, the world's biggest centre for currency trade.""There is no clear reason for this GBP overweight, though it may be because of financial linkages due to growing the China-UK relationship and London being a global financial centre,"" they said in the note. On Tuesday, during a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China renewed an existing sterling/renminbi currency swap line for a further three years and said its maximum value would be increased to 35 billion yuan.Britain was the top destination for Chinese money in 2014, with $5.1 billion in investment, according to law firm Baker & McKenzie, and during Xi's visit deals worth around $62 billion were clinched. Late last month, China started reporting data on its official foreign exchange reserves to the International Monetary Fund in an effort to provide more transparency in its push to have the yuan recognised as a reserve currency. A decision on whether to include the yuan in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights currency basket is likely in November.Data from the IMF on Sept. 30 showed total foreign-exchange reserves globally were $11.5 trillion in the second quarter, up from $11.4 trillion in the previous quarter. The dollar's share fell in the second quarter to 63.7 percent while the euro's share was steady at 20.7 percent.

675,"   By Junko Fujita | TOKYO  TOKYO Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) said on Wednesday its quarterly net profit fell 12 percent as Japan's top investment bank was hurt by volatility in global markets caused by China's economic slowdown and worries about U.S. interest rates rising.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, which shows the impact of the volatility more clearly, its net profit tumbled 32 percent and net revenue slid 21 percent as Japanese investors shunned funds and the stock market and low interest rates hit foreign bond sales.The results, which come after similarly weak quarterly performances from top Wall Street investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), show Nomura's goal to build a business model that relies less on the market has made a little progress. Nomura's July-September net profit was 46.6 billion yen ($387.14 million), compared with 52.9 billion yen in the previous year. The profit compared with a mean estimate of 11.3 billion yen from three analysts, according to Thomson Reuters data. A loss of 34.5 billion yen that Nomura booked after it settled a lawsuit with Italian bank Monte dei Paschi (BMPS.MI) over a derivatives trade lowered the quarterly profit. But its tax expenses declined by about 54 billion yen in the quarter after it booked deferred tax assets.Net revenue at Nomura's three core business segments - retail, asset management and wholesale - fell on a quarter-on-quarter basis and they either fell or grew just marginally on a year-on-year basis.To defend itself from market volatilities, Chief Executive Koji Nagai has been pushing to increase revenue from managing clients' long-term assets and lessen the practice of relying on commission from trading stocks and bonds.  Nomura's recurring revenue, or commissions from managing investment trusts and discretionary investments, was flat on a quarter-on-quarter basis at an annualized 78.3 billion yen.A bright spot was Nomura's investment banking operations, where revenues were up 18 percent quarter-on-quarter to 34.2 billion yen.  Nomura was involved in the two biggest equity deals in Japan during the latest quarter - sales of Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) ""Model AA"" class shares and Sony Corp's (6758.T) shares and convertible bonds, which together absorbed more than 800 billion yen from the market.Nomura was ranked No.1 underwriter for equity deals for the nine months through September in Japan, according to Thomson Reuters data.

677,"   By Brendan Pierson  In a trial starting on Monday, Morgan Stanley will confront a Russian billionaire's claims that it illegally short-sold a company based on inside information at the height of the financial crisis.The lawsuit against the global financial services firm is being brought in Manhattan federal court by Veleron BV, a Dutch company created as an investment vehicle by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who is also the founder of United Company Rusal Plc, one of the world's largest aluminum companies.Veleron claims Morgan Stanley obtained inside information through a relationship it had with the company's lender.The dispute arose from Deripaska's 2007 investment through Veleron in Canadian auto parts maker Magna International. That investment was financed with a $1.2 billion loan from BNP Paribas, with Veleron's Magna shares as collateral. Though Morgan Stanley was not directly involved in that loan, it entered into a swap agreement with BNP Paribas under which it assumed some of the risk of the loan in exchange for fixed payments.On September 29, 2008, with Magna's stock falling amid the global financial crisis, BNP made a $93 million margin call to Veleron. Morgan Stanley subsequently learned from BNP that Veleron would likely not meet the margin call and would have to liquidate its Magna stock. That information was forwarded from Morgan Stanley's global capital markets group to one of its traders, Kerim Tuna, who traded mostly for Morgan Stanley's own account.Tuna immediately began short-selling Magna stock, according to court papers. Morgan Stanley stood to lose $6.6 million because of Veleron's default, but thanks to Tuna's short-selling, it was able to offset $4.6 million of that. The lawsuit claims Morgan Stanley's actions constituted insider trading because Morgan Stanley used its knowledge of Veleron's impending default for its own benefit days before it became public. The lawsuit claims that the short-selling drove down the price of Magna stock. It seeks more than $10 million in damages.But Morgan Stanley claims it has no duty to Veleron that could give rise to an insider trading claim, and that it was simply hedging against exposure to risk.It sought summary judgment dismissing the case, but U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in July that it should go to a jury.Jury selection and opening arguments are expected Monday.

Eatroff will report to Comcast Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh, a former top executive from JPMorgan Chase & Co  and private equity firm Carlyle Group LP. Eatroff replaces Alexander Evans, who is joining former Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis at a new strategic venture in partnership with Comcast focused on investing in growth-oriented companies.He also succeeds Bob Pick, who is retiring at the end of the year. In October, Eatroff's M&A co-head Jim Head left Morgan Stanley to join Byron Trott's investment and financial advisory firm BDT Capital Partners LLC.Morgan Stanley ranks No. 2, both in the United States and globally, in the M&A advisory league tables, and this week advised on several high profile deals including Shire PLC's  $5.9 billion acquisition of rare disease company Dyax Corp, Visa Inc's acquisition of former subsidiary Visa Europe for $23 billion and TreeHouse Food Inc's  acquisition of ConAgra Foods Inc's private brands division for $2.7 billion.

That investment was financed with a $1.2 billion loan from BNP Paribas, with Veleron's Magna shares as collateral.Morgan Stanley agreed to act as BNP's agent to sell off Veleron's Magna stock if Veleron defaulted. It also entered into a credit default swap with BNP, assuming some of the risk of the loan in exchange for fixed payments.On Sept. 29, 2008, amid the global financial crisis, BNP made a $93 million margin call to Veleron. Morgan Stanley learned the next morning from BNP that Veleron could fail to meet the margin call, triggering a sell-off of its Magna stock.""None of this information was public,"" Marks said. ""None of it was something that ordinary investors would know about.""

691,"   By Jemima Kelly | LONDON  LONDON British growth would plunge to 1 percent and stocks would underperform by as much as 20 percent if voters opted to leave the European Union, U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley said in a report on Wednesday.  The bank puts the chances of ""Brexit"" at 35 percent, with its base case a ""close call"" that would still see significant market uncertainty and volatility in the lead-up to the referendum but ultimately a vote to stay in the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's EU ties and then hold a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member. Most observers believe the ballot will come next year, with Morgan Stanley betting on autumn 2016. Economic growth would sink to just 1 percent the following year on the heightened uncertainty, and stocks would lag their European and global peers by 10-20 percent in the event of a vote for Brexit. The UK economy grew at an annual pace of 2.6 percent in the second quarter this year, one of the fastest rates of growth in the developed world. ""We would expect radical uncertainty about the future of the trading relationship with Europe, and enhanced domestic political risks,"" Morgan Stanley said.Proponents of leaving the European Union argue that the grouping, far from stimulating Britain's trade, restrains it. An exit would allow Britain to trade more easily with the rest of the world while maintaining European links through an association agreement with the EU. The bank said the ""referendum shock"" of Brexit would see less foreign investment in Britain and a slowdown in consumption, leading the Bank of England to refrain from raising interest rates for a year.Sterling would see a further 5 percent decline against the dollar GBP=D4, falling to $1.39 by the end of 2016, down from its current $1.54.Sterling's weakness would help fuel a short-term run up in inflation above 2 percent. Inflation in Britain is currently zero. Even in Morgan Stanley's base-case, Brexit fears should favor international large-cap stocks, at the expense of smaller, more exposed British and European companies.

698,"   By Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley, better known for underwriting bonds than for retail banking, plans to offer savings accounts and certificates of deposits next year to wring more profit from its wealth management clients, executives told Reuters.   The bank has offered checking accounts and credit cards for years, but it is launching more consumer banking products and giving brokers bonuses if clients use them.The goal is to win more of the assets that customers keep at rivals such as JPMorgan Chase & Co or Bank of America Corp.  Right now, just 1 percent of Morgan Stanley's more than 3.5 million wealth management clients actively use its retail banking products. ""You shouldn't have to deal with two or three financial institutions,"" said Eric Heaton, president of Morgan Stanley U.S Banks, in an interview with Reuters. ""Just deal with us.""  Morgan Stanley has no plans to build retail bank branches, and will instead rely on its 16,000 brokers to sell the new products.The effort may leave it looking a little more like a conventional bank, a move that regulators have been encouraging since the crisis. Its chief rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, took a similar step in August, when it agreed to buy General Electric  Capital Bank's online deposit business. The move is also likely to boost the bottom line - clients who actively use Morgan Stanley's banking products hold on average 7 percent more assets at the firm than those who don't. The annual fees that customers pay are often based on a percentage of the client's assets at the firm.     That fee income tends to be relatively stable over time compared with many investment banking businesses. The importance of stable results was driven home for the bank's investors last month when it released third quarter earnings that showed revenue in its bond trading business plunging 42 percent, excluding an accounting adjustment that investors often ignore, while revenue in its wealth unit, which includes brokerage fees, interest income, and other items, fell just 3.5 percent.Morgan Stanley's fee income and commissions have been falling since the beginning of 2014, which the bank has made up for by generating more revenue from areas including lending.After multi-billion dollar trading losses brought Morgan Stanley uncomfortably close to failure during the financial crisis, the bank agreed to buy Citigroup's Smith Barney business in pieces starting in 2009, turning its retail brokerage business from being an afterthought into the source of about half the bank's revenue.     Goldman, by contrast, remains much more heavily reliant on bond trading, stock underwriting, and other traditional investment banking businesses to drive its bottom line. Investors seem to be siding with Goldman Sachs now - its shares trade at about 1.15 times their book value, an accounting measure of their net value, while Morgan Stanley's trade at about their book value.   LOFTY GOAL In addition to fee income, banking products offer more deposit funding for Morgan Stanley, which regulators view positively. During a financial crisis depositors are less likely than corporate bond investors and other lenders to flee when trouble is brewing in markets or at a bank. When rates rise, deposit funding is often cheaper than other forms of borrowing. Morgan Stanley now has around $139 billion of deposits in its bank unit and is aiming to get up to $200 billion in the next several years. To help its effort, it has assembled a team of card and payment executives, many of who led similar businesses at Merrill Lynch. Tom Duffy, who heads banking services within wealth management, says his product development team has more than doubled to around 34 since he joined the bank in 2011.Morgan Stanley's overall deposits, at around $147 billion, fund a much smaller portion of its balance sheet than most other banks - its deposits equal about 18 percent of assets, compared with more than 50 percent for both JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.       Winning more client assets may not be easy, analysts noted.  ""It's a lofty goal to be the primary bank for every one of their wealth management clients,"" said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI. But even if the bank wins just a sliver of business from customers, Morgan Stanley will be better off, he said.  Some financial advisers also question whether they will be able to push their clients, who may prefer to conduct their everyday banking at a traditional bank branch, into changing their daily behavior.   ""Five or six years ago, the whole banking effort at Morgan Stanley was very embryonic - we were playing catch up in the space,"" said Greg Fleming, Morgan Stanley's president of wealth management. ""We've been gearing up for this over the last few years and building out our technology, which is why this is more of a 2016 initiative.""The technology Fleming referred to includes on-line banking and mobile banking software. Boosting retail banking products will help to expand wealth management's profit margins. Last quarter, the pre-tax margin in the wealth business rose to 23 percent, at the lower end of the bank's long-term goals, and in line with Bank of America's wealth unit over the same period. In addition to adding executives to Duffy's product development team, Morgan Stanley hired eight cash management specialists and sent them to 60 wealth management offices around the country earlier this year to train financial advisors and their support staff about the firm's different cash management products.   It has also built up customer service teams of more than 50 representatives in Salt Lake City and Columbus, Ohio, and who answer clients' questions about everyday banking.   This isn't the first time Morgan Stanley has dealt with retail products. In the late 1990s, it merged with Dean Witter, Discover & Company, giving it a retail brokerage and a credit card business. The bank spun off Discover in 2007.   But Morgan Stanley never had a complete retail bank, which hurt it between 2009 and 2013, when it bought the Smith Barney retail brokerage unit from Citigroup. It lost some top advisers during that period because it could not offer as many banking products as Citigroup.    It began ramping up its lending business, and views its latest push into retail banking products as the next step in its bringing its business more in line with Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, for example.   It still has ground to gain. Interest income at Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit in the third quarter was $777 million, compared with $1.38 billion at Bank of America's global wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch wealth management, U.S. Trust and related businesses.

700,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term Issuer  Default Ratings (IDR) on Sears Holdings Corporation (Holdings) and its various  subsidiary entities (collectively, Sears) at 'CC'.  A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS EBITDA Remains Materially Negative: Fitch expects Sears' EBITDA to be in the  negative $600 million range in 2015 and potentially worse in 2016. Fitch expects  a revenue decline of around 20% in 2015 due to estimated domestic comparable  store sales (comps) of negative 10% and ongoing store closings. Fitch expects  comps to be in the negative mid-single digit range in 2016 and 2017 with top  line decline potentially in the high single digit range as Sears continues to  close stores. Significant Cash Burn: Sears' interest expense, capex and pension plan  contributions are expected to total $750 million-$800 million annually between  2015 and 2017. Netting this amount from Fitch's EBITDA expectation - and  assuming $200 million-$300 million in net working capital benefit - leads to  cash burn (CFO after capex and pension contributions) of $1 billion to $1.1  billion in 2015. Cash burn could potentially worsen in 2016, assuming EBITDA  losses approach $800 million to $1 billion.  Shrinking Assets Fund Operations: Sears injected $3.1 billion in liquidity  through August 2015 with $429 million from real estate joint ventures related to  31 stores with General Growth Properties, Simon Properties, and The Macerich  Company (collectively 'joint venture') and $2.7 billion from the sale-leaseback  transaction with Seritage Growth Properties (in which it sold 235 owned  properties and its 50% interest in the joint venture). This is on top of the  $6.8 billion (which includes expense and working capital reductions and debt  financing activities) between 2012 and 2014 to fund ongoing operations given  material declines in internally generated cash flow. Further Asset Sales and/or Debt Funding Required Beyond 2015: Based on current  EBITDA expectations, Fitch expects Sears to end 2015 with about $1.8 billion to  $2 billion in liquidity. This assumes no additional asset sales above the $3.1  billion injected through August or debt issuance. As a result, Sears is likely  to require an additional $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in annual liquidity in  2016 and 2017 via further real estate transactions and/or higher borrowings,  plus another $0.5 billion to fund annual seasonal working capital needs.  Below are potential sources of liquidity:  Fitch estimates that Sears still owns approximately 275 (excludes 125 of Sears  full line mall stores that are in a bankruptcy remote vehicle and approximately  22 specialty stores) unencumbered Kmart discount and Sears full line mall  stores. If the unencumbered real estate was valued at a similar price per square  foot as the 235 properties sold under the Seritage transaction, Fitch estimates  Sears could get an additional $2.6 billion in proceeds. However, the remaining  portfolio could be of lower value if they are in smaller markets or declining  malls and there could be restrictions on the sale of some of these properties.  In addition there could be value in below market leases but the potential  proceeds are difficult to estimate.  The company could also separate its Sears Auto Center business.  Finally, Sears' ability to issue incremental debt secured by receivables and  inventory, which governs the borrowing base that determines the borrowing  capacity on its existing credit facility (after netting out the first lien term  loan and second lien secured notes, is limited given the significant reduction  over the past few years in working capital.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects domestic comps of around negative 10% in 2015 and negative  mid-single digit range in 2016 and 2017. --EBITDA is expected to be approximately negative $600 million in 2015 and  potentially worse in 2016 at $800 million to $1 billion. --Fitch expects cash burn to be approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion in 2015  based on negative EBITDA and $750 million-$800 million total in interest  expense, capex, and pension expense and $200 million-$300 million in net working  capital benefit. --Total liquidity is expected to be about $1.8 billion to $2 billion at the end  of 2015. Sears is likely to require an additional $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion  in annual liquidity in 2016 and 2017 via further real estate transactions and/or  higher borrowings, plus another $0.5 billion to fund seasonal working capital  needs. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative Rating Action: A negative rating action could result if Sears is unable  to inject the needed liquidity to fund ongoing operations.  Positive Rating Action: A positive rating action could result from a sustained  improvement in comps and EBITDA to a level where the company is covering its  fixed obligations. This is not anticipated at this time. LIQUIDITY Sears had total cash of approximately $1.8 billion and availability under its  credit facility of $1.2 billion as of Aug. 1, 2015, prior to the pay down of  $936 million of second lien notes due October 2018. The borrowing availability  of $1.2 billion on the undrawn $3.275 billion domestic credit facility reflected  $657 million of letters of credit outstanding, the effect of the springing  fixed-charge coverage ratio covenant that caps borrowing to 90% of the line cap,  and another $1.1 billion that was not available due to the borrowing base  limitation. Total liquidity is expected to be about $1.8 billion to $2 billion  at the end of 2015. Sears addressed the maturity of its $3.275 billion secured credit facility,  which was due to mature on April 8, 2016 by extending $1.971 billion out of the  total $3.275 billion to July 2020. The remainder will expire in April 2016. The  company does not have any other near-term maturities. Recovery Considerations for Issue-Specific Ratings In accordance with Fitch's Recovery Rating (RR) methodology, Fitch has assigned  RRs based on the company's 'CC' Issuer Default Rating (IDR). Fitch's recovery  analysis assumes a liquidation value under a distressed scenario of  approximately $6.5 billion (low seasonal inventory) to $7 billion (peak seasonal  inventory) on domestic inventory, receivables, and property, plant and  equipment.  The $3.275 billion domestic senior secured credit facility, under which Sears  Roebuck Acceptance Corp. (SRAC) and Kmart are the borrowers, is rated  'CCC+/RR1', indicating outstanding (90%-100%) recovery prospects in a distressed  scenario. Holdings provides a downstream guarantee to both SRAC and Kmart  borrowings, and there are cross-guarantees between SRAC and Kmart. The facility  is also guaranteed by direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of  Holdings, which own assets that collateralize the facility.  The facility is secured primarily by domestic inventory, which is expected to  range from an estimated $4.5 billion in January 2016 to about $5.5 to $5.8  billion around peak levels in the next 12 months, and pharmacy and credit card  receivables, which are estimated to be $0.3 billion-$0.4 billion. The credit  agreement imposes various requirements, including (but not limited to) the  following provisions: if availability under the credit facility is beneath a  certain threshold, the fixed-charge ratio as of the last day of any fiscal  quarter should not be less than 1.0x; a cash dominion requirement if excess  availability on the revolver falls below designated levels; and limitations on  its ability to make restricted payments, including dividends and share  repurchases.  The $983 million first lien senior secured term loan due June 2018 is also rated  'CCC+/RR1', as it is secured by a first lien on the same collateral and  guaranteed by the same subsidiaries of the company that guarantee the revolving  facility. Under the guarantee and collateral agreement, the revolving lenders  will have priority of payment from the collateral over the $1 billion first lien  term loan lenders. The remaining $302 million second lien notes due October 2018 at Holdings, which  have a second lien on the same collateral package as the credit facility and $1  billion term loan, have been upgraded to 'CCC+/RR1' from 'CCC/RR2' given the  significant paydown of these notes and Fitch's expectation that Sears will not  be able to issue incremental debt secured by receivables and inventory given the  significant decline in borrowing base.  The notes contain provisions that require Holdings to maintain minimum  collateral coverage for total debt secured by the collateral securing the notes  (failing which, Holdings has to offer to buy notes sufficient to cure the  deficiency at 101%) that provide downside protection. The second lien notes have  an unsecured claim on the company's unencumbered real estate assets, given the  notes are guaranteed by substantially all the domestic subsidiaries that  guarantee the credit facility.  The senior unsecured notes at SRAC are rated 'CC/RR4', indicating average  recovery prospects (31%-50%). The recovery on these notes are derived from the  valuation on the company's unencumbered real estate assets held at Sears,  Roebuck and Co, which provides a downstream guarantee of SRAC's senior notes and  also agrees to maintain SRAC's fixed-charge coverage at a minimum of 1.1x.  However, should a material portion of the owned real estate be used to raise  additional liquidity, it could adversely affect the ratings on the unsecured  notes. Recovery to the senior unsecured notes also takes into account potential  sizable claims under operating lease obligations and the company's underfunded  pension plan.  The 8% $625 million unsecured notes due 2019 at Holdings are rated 'C/RR6',  given poor recovery prospects (0%-10%). FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows:  Sears Holdings Corporation (Holdings) --Long-term IDR at 'CC';  --$302 million second-lien secured notes upgraded to 'CCC+/RR1' from 'CCC/RR2'; --$625 million unsecured notes 'C/RR6'.

701,"   By Anjuli Davies, Pamela Barbaglia and Olivia Oran | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK Warren Buffett's favored banker, Byron Trott, is planning to expand his investment and financial advisory firm BDT Capital Partners in Europe with a London office to attract billionaire clients, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Chicago-based BDT, founded in 2009 by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) investment banking vice chairman Trott, 56, manages investment funds of more than $8 billion, and also advises family and founder-led businesses on M&A deals, corporate governance and succession planning issues. Trott, who works with wealthy families in Europe such as Italy's Agnelli family, plans to submit a request to operate to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, one of the sources said, adding that it might take up to six months to get the regulator's blessing and begin operations in Britain.A spokeswoman from BDT declined to comment on the firm’s growth plans. A spokeswoman for the FCA declined to comment. Assuming it receives authorization, required of any firm that wants to carry out regulated financial activities in the UK, London will serve as a strategic hub for Europe. The move is part of BDT's expansion which includes the launch of a New York base to cater to Wall Street's wealthy clans, the source said.BDT has worked with wealthy families in the United States  including the heirs of the Mars Inc fortune and the Walton family of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). BDT's main focus in Europe is to help billionaires look for better ways of earning a return than simply handing their cash to family offices or fund managers, by advising them on M&A deals and other investments, one source said. BILLIONAIRES WITH BUSINESS  Trott has said that BDT works exclusively with ""billionaires with businesses"", according to an interview in Fortune magazine in December 2014.During the financial crisis, Trott proved his friendship with one such billionaire - Warren Buffett - when he persuaded him to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs. It was Trott who brought Buffett into Mars Inc's $23 billion acquisition of Wm. Wrigley Jr. & Co in 2008, a deal in which Buffett invested about $6.5 billion.Last year the number of billionaires in Europe overtook North America, with a third of the world's richest now residing on the continent, according to The Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census.  BDT & Company International was incorporated in Britain on Aug. 10, according to a filing in Companies House. In Europe, BDT has already advised on some high profile transactions. Together with Morgan Stanley (MS.N), it advised Exor SpA, the investment vehicle of Italy's Agnelli family, on its $6.9 billion acquisition of reinsurer PartnerRe. After the PartnerRe deal was agreed in August, Trott hired Morgan Stanley co-head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, James Head, who left the U.S. investment bank in October.Head will be based in New York helping Trott establish BDT's brand further among Wall Street clients, two sources said. BDT also co-invested and advised German investor Joh A Benckiser (JAB) in 2013 on the acquisition of Dutch coffee company Douwe Egberts which later merged with Mondelez's coffee business to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts. Trott is looking for a senior and seasoned dealmaker who has strong relationships with high net worth individuals across Western Europe, to lead the London office, according to another source. Trott's boutique will need to position itself in a crowded market alongside the likes of Robey Warshaw, the tiny Mayfair advisory firm which has landed the two biggest merger deals of the year, clinching key roles for UK brewer SABMiller and oil and gas firm BG.       BDT is planning to expand at the same time as former Morgan Stanley rainmaker Paul Taubman is looking to aggressively hire at his own boutique firm PJT Partners (PJT.N). Earlier this year PJT hired several senior European dealmakers for its own office in London.BDT is ranked 66th in the M&A league tables so far this year, having advised on three deals worth $14.2 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with 108th position at the same time last year.

711,"   By Fiona Lau and Denny Thomas | HONG KONG  HONG KONG American International Group (AIG.N) (AIG) is selling a stake in PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd (2328.HK) worth up to $1 billion to institutional investors through a block deal, cutting its shareholding in the Chinese state-owned insurer for the second time this year.The U.S. insurer acquired a stake in PICC Property and Casualty as a cornerstone investor in 2003, ahead of the Chinese insurer's flotation. The deal launched on Monday comes after AIG raised $500 million by selling down its PICC P&C stake in March.The planned sale also comes as AIG faces pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn to split the company into three..AIG is offering between 355 million and 365 million PICC P&C shares in a range of HK$16.08-HK$16.38 each, a term sheet of the deal showed. The basic offer is worth about $750 million, with a $250 million up-size option taking the total deal value to $1 billion, the terms showed. The price range represents a discount of 4.3-6.1 percent to PICC Property's last traded price. AIG traces its roots to 1919 when Cornelius Vander Starr established a general insurance business in Shanghai. Following the global financial crisis, AIG sold part of its Asian life insurance business AIA Group Ltd (1299.HK) through a $20.1 billion Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in 2010 to help repay the U.S. government bail-out. Over a period of time, AIG fully exited from AIA. But in 2013, AIG invested about $500 million in People Insurance Group of China Co Ltd (1339.HK) IPO, reaffirming its commitment to the Asia Pacific region. Prior to Monday's sell-down, AIG held 1.2 billion PICC P&C shares, or about 26.4 percent stake of the company, making it the Chinese insurer's biggest shareholder.An AIG spokesman declined to comment. Citigroup (C.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are managing the sale, the terms showed.

716,"   By Olivia Oran and Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley this week cut staff covering short-term credit and regional broker-dealers, after a quarter in which the bank posted a 42 percent drop in bond trading, several sources told Reuters.    The sources blamed the shakeup at the No. 6 U.S. bank by assets on tougher capital rules, mounting competition from faster and cheaper trading on electronic systems and expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates next week for the first time in nearly a decade.    The decision to downsize followed one of Morgan Stanley's slowest quarters for bond trading since the global credit crunch.The bank has been focused on improving profitability within fixed income and has been scaling back businesses that miss those metrics, the sources said. Morgan Stanley's short-term credit desk, including its commercial paper business, has seen extensive cutbacks, they  said.  Morgan Stanley has also significantly reduced the number of bond sales people who cover smaller, regional broker-dealers, they added, although the bank will continue to cover these types of clients. A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs.Traders and fund managers interviewed by Reuters said Morgan Stanley's move is hardly a surprise as tougher capital rules, domestic and abroad, have made it less profitable to trade Treasuries, agency debt, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. These rules, intended to curb excessive risk-taking, have also raised the cost for Morgan Stanley and other top Wall Street firms to borrow in the short-term, wholesale funding markets including the repurchase agreement (repo) market.With the Fed widely expected to hike rates next week, the daily cost for trading will likely go up further. In addition, the proliferation of electronic systems and high-frequency trading firms has eroded Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street dealers' dominance in market-making the bond market.This year, electronic trading platforms are on track to capture 20 percent of U.S. investment-grade bond trading volume, a 25 percent rise from year earlier, according to research firm Greenwich Associates.As competition from anonymous systems has grown, the need to pitch blocks of bonds on the phone or emails to clients has decreased.

717,"   By Olivia Oran and Pratima Desai  Amrik Sandhu, a senior executive in Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) commodities group in Europe, left the bank this week, according to two people familiar with the matter.     Sandhu, who had responsibility for a group which sells commodities products to retail and wholesale investors, left at a time that Morgan Stanley has been cutting 25 percent of its fixed income business.     Morgan Stanley reported a 42 percent decline in adjusted bond trading revenue in the third quarter, one of its worst since the financial crisis.     A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the departure. The people asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.     Sandhu joined Morgan Stanley from Bank of America (BAC.N) in 2011 where he served as global head of metals in London.      Morgan Stanley is also pulling out of most of its base metals trading business as part of the culling in fixed income, people familiar with the matter said this week.     Sharp falls in global commodity prices and greater regulatory scrutiny has prompted several banks to exit the space in recent years. Earlier this year Castleton Commodities International bought Morgan Stanley's physical oil business.      Morgan Stanley is also winding down its solar desk, a group within commodities that develops and structures renewable energy projects. Sandhu's departure was reported earlier by SparkSpread.

722,"  LONDON/MOSCOW Dec 21 Trafigura is expanding its ties with Russia's Rosneft and is likely to become its biggest buyer next year when the Swiss commodities trader adds refined products to its already huge purchases of crude oil.Trafigura said it had agreed to purchase additional volumes from Rosneft from January, mainly refined products.The company declined to disclose details. Trading sources estimated the total volumes at 20 million tonnes, equal to an entire annual output of two large refineries or enough to meet consumption of a country such as Spain for half a year. ""The marketing and supply arrangements cover refined products and were agreed on market terms after a competitive tender process. The transactions are fully compliant with international sanctions and no pre-financing is involved,"" a senior Trafigura spokesman said.Over the past year, Trafigura has been buying 20 million tonnes of crude oil from Rosneft and the addition of refined products will make it the single biggest corporate buyer of oil from Russia. Only China as a country is buying more oil and products from Russia. Rosneft has been expanding its deals with Trafigura as its own ambitions of creating a major trading division have been curtailed by sanctions imposed by the West on Russia over Moscow's actions in Ukraine.Last year, Rosneft abandoned plans to buy the oil trading division of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley and since then it has looked for partners to trade its huge resources and generate maximum profits amid low oil prices.

Prosecutors said Marsh, 31, from 2011 and 2014 obtained confidential information for approximately 730,000 accounts without permission and uploaded the data to a personal server at his home in New Jersey.Prosecutors said Marsh used the data for his personal advantage, and said that at the time, he was in talks about landing a new job with two Morgan Stanley competitors.In December 2014, Morgan Stanley discovered information for thousands of clients had been published online, prompting the bank to investigate and fire Marsh in January. While Marsh was linked to the data, authorities determined that his server had been compromised in October 2014, according to court records.In court, Marsh's lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, said Morgan Stanley informed him that Russian hackers were suspected to be involved.He chastised the bank for allowing a ""false story"" that Marsh himself was responsible for posting the data online to flourish in the media initially after the breach. ""He did not disclose it to anyone,"" Gottlieb said.Morgan Stanley declined to comment. It has said information about 900 client accounts was briefly posted online and that up to 10 percent of its approximately 3.5 million wealth management clients were affected.No clients lost money due to the breach, the bank has said.In court, Marsh apologized to Morgan Stanley, its clients and his family.""I know what I did was wrong,"" he said.

SECOND TIME UNLUCKY Fleming, who joined Morgan Stanley in 2009, was widely seen as a successor to Gorman. He helped grow Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm into an operation that generated nearly half of the firm's revenue as it shifted away from trading to more stable earnings.

The task of running the investment management unit, which he had led, was given to Dan Simkowitz, an investment banker who co-led the firm's stock- and debt-underwriting business.Kelleher's ascent also marks the second time that Fleming was left at the altar.

It hired John Thain, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc  executive, to fill the job permanently.After helping to negotiate the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America at the height of the crisis, Fleming left Wall Street and went to teach at Yale Law School, his alma mater, where he still gives ethics lessons about cases such as Goldman Sachs's controversial ""Abacus"" derivatives deal and JPMorgan Chase & Co's ""London Whale"" fiasco.Morgan Stanley lured him back to the banking world in 2010 and he gained clout at the company after he steered Morgan Stanley Wealth Management through a complicated merger with Citigroup Inc's Smith Barney brokerage, lifting the division's profit margins to a targeted level after a bumpy start.As recently as 2014, Fleming was on the bank board's list of candidates who could potentially succeed Chief Executive James Gorman.

735,"   By Jamie McGeever | LONDON  LONDON Jan 11 The unwinding of China's foreign exchange reserves could soon extend beyond U.S. Treasuries, with U.S. corporate and euro zone sovereign bonds among the assets most vulnerable to selling from Beijing, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Monday.China sold a record $510 billion of FX reserves last year to counter the damaging impact on an already decelerating economy from the surge of capital fleeing the country.The lion's share of that came from $292 billion sales of U.S. Treasury debt, followed by $92 billion sales of U.S. stocks, $3 billion of U.S. agency bonds and $170 billion of non-U.S. assets, according to BAML estimates.China increased its U.S. corporate bond investments by $44 billion last year to $415 billion, BAML strategists estimated, adding that it won't be long before investors turn their attention to other assets Beijing could potentially sell. ""In the next two months I would still say Treasuries. But if the pressure continues beyond that, it's non-U.S. assets, and in the U.S. space it's definitely corporates and agencies,"" said Shyam Rajan, rates strategist at BAML in New York.Rajan and his colleagues estimate that China's $3.33 trillion FX reserves comprise $1.15 trillion non-U.S. assets (mostly short-dated euro-denominated bonds), $415 billion U.S. corporate bonds, $212 billion in agencies, $266 billion stocks and $1.29 trillion of Treasuries. Selling across these bonds may not automatically trigger a sharp rise in their yields though, Rajan said, pointing to the experience of Treasuries in the latter part of last year when swap spreads moved below zero.""The way to trade the reserve flow story is through relative value trades, such as the swap spread tightening in Treasuries. I would imagine it plays out the same way in other markets too,""  Rajan said. Last year's record unwind brought China's total FX reserves to a three-year low of $3.33 trillion. Most analysts expect that to be depleted further this year.JP Morgan estimates that capital flight from China since the second quarter of 2014 has totaled $930 billion, while credit ratings agency Fitch on Monday put the figure at over $1 trillion.U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley on Monday joined Goldman Sachs in lowering its forecast for the Chinese yuan, citing the ongoing flow of capital out of the country and need for a weaker currency to support the economy.

736,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley named a new head for its fixed-income trading unit as it seeks to turn around the struggling business. Sam Kellie-Smith, who previously ran equity trading, will replace global fixed-income co-heads Robert Rooney and Michael Heaney and will also take on responsibility for the commodities division, according to a memo on Thursday from the New York-based bank. The changes come as Morgan Stanley reshapes its bond trading unit. The bank said late last year it is cutting 25 percent of its fixed income jobs as increased regulation has made trading bonds less profitable. Ted Pick, who previously ran the bank's equities trading unit, was tasked by Gorman last year to oversee its entire trading business. Under Pick and recently promoted president Colm Kelleher, the bank is moving key equities executives to fixed income as it tries to facilitate better coordination between the two desks. Kellie-Smith joined Morgan Stanley in 1997 and has since run equities derivatives trading in London and Asia equity trading in Hong Kong.

739,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley will be straying ever further from its Wall Street roots in the coming months as it shifts more operations to lower cost cities like Mumbai and Budapest as it aims to slash costs.The investment bank on Tuesday announced an initiative to cut up to $1 billion by 2017 by using technology and outsourcing jobs now in its New York headquarters and other higher cost cities. However, it declined to give specific details about the number of jobs it would move to lower cost centres.  While shifting so-called back office operations to cities where salaries are a fraction of New York or London is not entirely new, the bank's Chief Executive James Gorman said the pace will now accelerate. ""We have too many employees based in high-cost centres doing work that can sensibly be done in lower cost centres,"" Gorman said on a fourth-quarter analyst call with analysts.Morgan Stanley last April opened an 184,000 square foot office in Bengaluru, India that can house 1,400 staff to support the firm's technology and fund services businesses. The firm, which is aiming to raise its return on equity to 10 percent from a current 8.5 percent, also has an office in Mumbai that houses 2,400 staff. Morgan Stanley's Glasgow office is its second largest location in Europe after London with more than 1,300 employees, up from just 6 workers when the office was opened 15 years ago to support the firm's investment funds businesses, according to the company's website. The bank also has two main hubs in Budapest which it opened in 2006, including a centre to support the firm's fixed income trading business and an operation focused on operations and information technology.""Financial services companies are relatively well advanced already with taking advantage of offshoring but the capacity of the potential to continue has not yet been unleashed,"" said Johan Gott, a principal with consulting firm A.T. Kearney. ""There is a lot of room for growth in that space."" Morgan Stanley is not alone. Several other large U.S. banks are looking at new ways to reduce expenses as they try and raise profits in an environment where revenue growth remains anaemic.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse AG are all looking to expand their operation centres in Poland, as they benefit from the country's relatively expensive and skilled labour force. Goldman has also been moving thousands of jobs to cheaper cities like Salt Lake City, Utah and Dallas over the last several years. Under the aegis of what Morgan Stanley is dubbing Project Streamline, the bank is also looking at ways to use technology, including outsourcing to vendors and to industry partnerships, to cut costs, Gorman said.  A.T. Kearny's Gott added that some low end jobs are also poised for automation, meaning workers could be replaced entirely by technology.Morgan Stanley said in October it had joined with Goldman and JPMorgan Chase & Co to form a data-management company at a lower cost than what the banks would spend individually. The bid to accelerate outsourcing is just the latest sign of the bank's focus on costs amid a protracted slump in bond trading. Cost reductions, including reduced compensation, were a key factor in the bank posting better-than-expected fourth quarter results on Tuesday.

741,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley will be straying ever further from its Wall Street roots in the coming months as it shifts more operations to lower cost cities like Mumbai and Budapest as it aims to slash costs.The investment bank on Tuesday announced an initiative to cut up to $1 billion by 2017 by using technology and outsourcing jobs now in its New York headquarters and other higher cost cities. However, it declined to give specific details about the number of jobs it would move to lower cost centres.  While shifting so-called back office operations to cities where salaries are a fraction of New York or London is not entirely new, the bank's Chief Executive James Gorman said the pace will now accelerate. ""We have too many employees based in high-cost centres doing work that can sensibly be done in lower cost centres,"" Gorman said on a fourth-quarter analyst call with analysts.Morgan Stanley last April opened an 184,000 square foot office in Bengaluru, India that can house 1,400 staff to support the firm's technology and fund services businesses. The firm, which is aiming to raise its return on equity to 10 percent from a current 8.5 percent, also has an office in Mumbai that houses 2,400 staff. Morgan Stanley's Glasgow office is its second largest location in Europe after London with more than 1,300 employees, up from just 6 workers when the office was opened 15 years ago to support the firm's investment funds businesses, according to the company's website. The bank also has two main hubs in Budapest which it opened in 2006, including a centre to support the firm's fixed income trading business and an operation focused on operations and information technology.""Financial services companies are relatively well advanced already with taking advantage of offshoring but the capacity of the potential to continue has not yet been unleashed,"" said Johan Gott, a principal with consulting firm A.T.

742,"   By Richa Naidu, Sudarshan Varadhan and Olivia Oran  For Morgan Stanley, belt-tightening is becoming a way of life. The investment bank posted better-than-forecast fourth-quarter results largely thanks to greater cost cutting, including moves to slash 25 percent of its fixed income headcount to adapt to a protracted slump in bond trading. Now Chief Executive James Gorman is focusing on ways to cut even more deeply, leaning on technology and increased outsourcing to cut another $1 billion in costs this year. ""They’re looking at the environment and have determined that they can’t get enough returns for shareholders through significant increases in banking or massive increases in assets under management,"" said Ryan Kelley, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds and a Morgan Stanley shareholder. ""The best way to get there is through continued cost cuts.""Morgan Stanley plans to lean on technology and outsourcing to reach its latest cost-cutting target. Wall Street banks are grappling with regulations discouraging them from risky trades along with concern about China, oil prices, an uncertain interest rate climate and weak IPO activity.Morgan Stanley's larger rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which faces similar issues, is due to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday.""We enter 2016 with a continued focus on managing expenses across the firm,"" Gorman said in a statement.Morgan Stanley's shares edged up 0.3 percent shortly after midday. The Wall Street bank, which reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, also set a return-on-equity target of 9 percent to 11 percent for 2017. The bank's RoE of 8.5 percent for 2015 missed Gorman's current target of 10 percent. Morgan Stanley is cutting a quarter of the jobs at its fixed income business, revenue from which fell 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Compensation expense dropped dramatically during the quarter to $3.7 billion including a severance expense, from $5.1 billion a year ago. In institutional securities, which includes banking and trading, compensation expense was 37 percent, below the bank’s goal of 39 percent.Lower costs have also helped larger banks Citigroup Inc (C.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) report quarterly profit increases in recent days. Morgan Stanley's non-interest costs fell 41 percent and compensation costs fell by nearly a third. Its after-tax legal bill stood at $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 as it settled litigation related to mortgage-backed securities and crisis-era issues. CORE NUMBERS      As its trading business suffers, the bank has been focusing on its less-volatile wealth management unit, which accounted for nearly half of its revenue in 2015.Still, revenue from wealth management slipped 1.4 percent to $3.75 billion.  Morgan Stanley's adjusted net revenue fell 4.3 percent to $7.86 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31 as revenue declined in every major business but one - equity sales and trading.The firm has been moving key executives, including Ted Pick and Sam Kellie-Smith, to its fixed income division from its successful equities unit to facilitate better coordination between the two businesses.""I think what we have is a temporary pressure on the core businesses ... We should see some rebound as we go into the first half of 2016,"" Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby said.Morgan Stanley reported earnings of $753 million, or 39 cents per share, applicable to common shareholders, compared with a year-earlier loss.Excluding items, the bank earned 43 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 33 cents per share and revenue of $7.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Morgan Stanley's stock slumped 18 percent last year, the steepest fall among big U.S. banks.

A record year for mergers and acquisitions was one of the few bright spots for major banks last year as volatile markets, concerns about China and falling oil prices hurt trading businesses.     But banks are not uniformly rewarding their dealmakers amid a need to shave costs due to falling trading revenues, pedestrian growth elsewhere and regulatory pressure to curb compensation.Those concerns may be thrown to the wind when it comes to top rainmakers at Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley. They are anxious to stem defections to boutique banks such as Centerview Partners and Lazard Ltd, which are not subject to the same regulatory oversight. Investors and regulators have been more closely scrutinizing Wall Street pay following the 2008 financial crisis.     ""In certain groups you are going to see some impressive numbers this year reflecting the robust M&A market and in an attempt to keep top bankers happy and not moving,"" said Noah Schwarz, an executive recruiter at Korn Ferry. ""There have been so many situations of musical chairs in 2015 - more trades than I have seen in a long time.""Overall, though, bonus increases for dealmakers range from flat to low single digits, sources said.    Morgan Stanley saw banker bonuses largely flat to up 5 percent over last year, according to people familiar with the matter.  Within Morgan Stanley's institutional securities group, which includes investment banking and trading, the bank set aside 17 percent less money for compensation for 2015 compared to the year prior. At Citigroup Inc, banker pay remained flat over last year. Revenue from advising on deals rose 16 percent in 2015, although overall investment banking revenue, including equity and debt underwriting, was down 3 percent. Representatives for the banks declined to comment. Deal volume globally rose 42.2 percent to a record $4.7 trillion, according to Thomson Reuters data, spurred by mega mergers like Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc and oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc. Merger fees worldwide, in turn, rose 7.7 percent to $26 billion last year.      Bonuses at boutique shops such as Guggenheim Partners are expected to rise 10 to 20 percent. Still, even for top rainmakers at big banks, bonuses are not expected to reach pre-crisis levels such as when Merrill Lynch's top dealmaker Andrea Orcel took home $34 million.     ""What we’re seeing is the return of the strategic M&A banker,"" said Stéphane Rambosson, managing partner of executive search firm DHR International. ""It’s not quite the rainmaker as in the past, but M&A is back with certain firms at the full front of their strategy.""Banker bonuses in the U.S. and Europe also differ. Under an European Union cap, bonuses cannot exceed 100 percent of bankers' fixed salary, or twice that amount with shareholder approval. But banks have topped up basic pay by awarding allowances to senior staff and also increased fixed salaries as a result in some cases.

748,"   By Sinead Cruise and William James | LONDON  LONDON Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are making large donations to the campaign to keep Britain inside the European Union, sources said, highlighting the concern among some of the world's biggest banks over the impact of a British exit.Goldman Sachs has agreed to donate a ""substantial six-figure sum"" according to one source, while JPMorgan was preparing to make a similar donation, another source familiar with the matter said.Another U.S. bank, Morgan Stanley, is also likely to make donation but has yet to decide a sum to contribute, a source said. The bank declined to comment.In the face of growing Euroscepticism among the British electorate and political pressure from within his own party, Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on Britain's EU membership by the end of 2017.On Thursday, Cameron urged business leaders at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos to speak up about the benefits of Britain staying in a reformed EU.Cameron is hoping to head off the threat of a British exit, or 'Brexit', by negotiating a deal on reforms to the bloc that address concerns about immigration, sovereignty and competitiveness at an EU summit next month.He received some support on Thursday from French President Francois Hollande, who said none of Britain's EU reform demands were ""insurmountable"", but that they must not prevent the euro zone from pursuing further integration.Cameron said very good progress had been made with the EU but that they were ""not there yet"".  With British public opinion finely balanced and renegotiations with Cameron's EU peers meeting resistance, multinational businesses in Britain are facing up to the risk that the vote could sever links with the country's biggest trading partner.The donations by three heavyweight U.S. banks with heavy European presence reflect the financial sector's acute concerns that Britain's role as a global financing hub and major trading center for the euro could be under threat if it gives up its membership.British banks were more circumspect in pledging their support. A source familiar with Barclays said the firm had a policy not to make political donations, while a source with knowledge of Royal Bank of Scotland said the bank was waiting for clarity on the government's position.  ""THE ESTABLISHMENT"" A spokesman for pro-EU group Britain Stronger in Europe, the expected recipient of the donations, said it had a broad range of backers: ""This includes many small donors, philanthropists and businesses worried by job losses and price rises if we were to leave.""Until a date for the referendum is set, campaigns on both sides can accept and spend donations without restriction. However they may be required to declare details of prior donors once the government sets a referendum date. Spending will be capped during the period immediately before the referendum.The donations were dismissed as ""no surprise"" by Leave.EU, one of several pro-Brexit campaigns, which says the EU works against ordinary Britons and protects vested political and commercial interests. ""The referendum will be a campaign of the British people against the establishment of international bankers, multinational corporate tax dodgers and out-of-touch politicians,"" said Arron Banks, the group's co-founder.Arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party whose popularity put pressure on Cameron to make the offer of a referendum, described the donations as ""the unholy alliance of big banks and big politics.""Cameron, however, is keen to enlist the support of businesses to help his reform agenda clear political hurdles in other European capitals, and to illustrate the damage that he believes leaving the bloc would do to the country's economy.""If business backs my reforms ... I would argue get out there and support those things,"" he said in Davos. ""The sooner you can start to look at your own businesses and come up with the examples and the ideas about the benefits and the problems that there are with Europe the more that you are able to help to explain and set the context for this vitally important question.""

753,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman's overall pay fell 7 percent in 2015 as the Wall Street bank saw its shares drop and profitability fail to meet targets.Gorman will receive $21 million in total compensation, down from $22.5 million in the prior year, according to a bank spokesman. Gorman received a $4.6 million stock bonus for his performance in 2015 as part of that pay, up 5 percent from the year before, according to a regulatory filing. The 183,678 shares is in addition to the CEO's $1.5 million salary, cash, deferred cash and long-term incentives.The regulatory filing does not provide greater detail on Gorman's total compensation for 2015.Gorman, who became Morgan Stanley's chief executive in 2010, has been focused on growing the firm's wealth management unit which is considered a more stable source of revenue than trading. Firmwide net income in 2015 grew 77 percent to $6.1 billion from $3.5 billion the year before, although 2014 figures were hurt by charges linked to a legal settlement and expenses tied to deferred compensation.Morgan Stanley has work to do in order to accomplish its profitability targets, as its return on equity of 8.5 percent for 2015 missed Gorman's target of 10 percent.Its fixed-income division is also undergoing a restructuring, as the bank said it would slash 25 percent of the jobs in the unit to adapt to a protracted slump in bond trading..  The bank this week also announced a plan to cut $1 billion in expenses by 2017, leaning on technology and increased outsourcing.

754,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman's overall pay fell 7 percent in 2015 as the Wall Street bank saw its shares drop and profitability fail to meet targets.Gorman will receive $21 million in total compensation, down from $22.5 million in the prior year, according to a bank spokesman. Gorman received a $4.6 million stock bonus for his performance in 2015 as part of that pay, up 5 percent from the year before, according to a regulatory filing. The 183,678 shares is in addition to the CEO's $1.5 million salary, cash, deferred cash and long-term incentives.The regulatory filing does not provide greater detail on Gorman's total compensation for 2015.Gorman, who became Morgan Stanley's chief executive in 2010, has been focused on growing the firm's wealth management unit which is considered a more stable source of revenue than trading. Firmwide net income in 2015 grew 77 percent to $6.1 billion from $3.5 billion the year before, although 2014 figures were hurt by charges linked to a legal settlement and expenses tied to deferred compensation.Morgan Stanley has work to do in order to accomplish its profitability targets, as its return on equity of 8.5 percent for 2015 missed Gorman's target of 10 percent.Its fixed-income division is also undergoing a restructuring, as the bank said it would slash 25 percent of the jobs in the unit to adapt to a protracted slump in bond trading..  The bank this week also announced a plan to cut $1 billion in expenses by 2017, leaning on technology and increased outsourcing.

755,"  NEW YORK Morgan Stanley economists are clinging to their forecast of a 20 percent chance the U.S. economy will slip into recession in 2016 on evidence of contraction in the factory sector and signs of slowing among services industries.""That assessment still feels about right,"" they said in a research note released on Friday.They forecast gross domestic product was little changed in the fourth quarter and would likely grow 1.8 percent in 2016.Among economists polled by Reuters, the median forecast is for U.S. GDP growth of 0.80 percent at an annualized rate in the fourth quarter and annual growth of 2.5 percent in 2016.The government will release its first reading on fourth-quarter economic growth on Jan. 29. If GDP growth deteriorates to a range of 1 percent to 1.5 percent in 2016, the Federal Reserve would likely refrain from raising interest rates this year, the Morgan Stanley economists said.The U.S. central bank raised rates in December, the first hike in nearly a decade. Fed policymakers also released their economic and interest rate forecasts, which suggested on average they see four quarter-point rate increases in 2016. ""Stall speed in the U.S., or even a shift to a lower channel of growth, would likely halt the Fed in its tracks — precipitating a 'one-and-done' scenario for this policy tightening cycle,"" the Morgan Stanley economists said.In a separate report, they said the recent stock market rout and a deterioration in inflation expectations to record lows, as signaled in the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities since the end of 2015, implied the Fed might not raise rates at all this year. ""Wrapping all of this together, there has been a substantial tightening of financial conditions since December - by our estimation the economic equivalent of four rate hikes. The Fed raises rates to tighten financial conditions, it loathes to move when the market has already done its tightening for it,"" the Morgan Stanley economists wrote.

757,"   By Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wall Street's two marquee investment banks each slightly cut their chief executives' pay after a year that saw profitability fall and shares drop amid a turbulent backdrop.Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and his Morgan Stanley counterpart James Gorman saw their overall compensation fall in 2015.Blankfein's overall pay declined 4 percent from the year prior to $23 million, while Gorman's slid 7 percent to $21 million, the banks disclosed on Friday.Both banks have struggled with tumultous markets that hurt bond trading and underwriting, concerns about oil prices and sluggish growth in China. The pay declines come in contrast to a 35 percent raise for JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon's compensation surged to $27 million, although the cash portion was cut and three quarters of the total was tied to performance-based stock awards.Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, has been under pressure at both Goldman and Morgan. Goldman's return on equity in particular slumped to 7.4 percent in 2015, after a $5 billion settlement fourth-quarter hit related to its dealings with mortgage backed securities during the financial crisis.     Goldman typically leads peers with a return on equity of around 11 percent. Rival Morgan Stanley, in contrast, generated a return on equity of 8.5 percent in 2015, below Gorman's target of 10 percent.Morgan Stanley has tried to improve profitability in its fixed income division which has dragged down the firm's overall returns and said it would cut 25 percent of its headcount in the unit. It also announced a $1 billion cost cutting initiative to rely more on outsourcing and technology. Shares of Goldman declined 8 percent in 2015, making it the second worst performer of all the big U.S. banks after Morgan Stanley, which fell 18 percent.

Most of the eight to 10 members of the principal strategic investments group have left the Wall Street firm in the last few months, including head Gary Offner, the people said. A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment. The move comes as Morgan Stanley, like its Wall Street peers, is looking to cut costs amid pressure on its bottom line.

The principal strategic investment group invests in market structure ventures and financial technology that align with the bank's equities division.

770,"   By Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Colm Kelleher is a stickler for discipline, even when it comes to the office dress code.In an internal risk meeting during the summer of 2010, the then head of trading at Morgan Stanley chastised colleagues for rolling up their shirt sleeves and dispensing with their jackets in the New York heat, according to a former executive. Even in the dog days of summer with no clients present, Kelleher held those around him to a high standard. Kelleher's role as enforcer-in-chief at Morgan Stanley was solidified last month when the Wall Street firm's Chief Executive James Gorman named him president, the No. 2 spot.With Morgan Stanley under pressure to slash jobs, assets and business lines to compensate for a decline in bond trading, Gorman needs a lieutenant who can wield the ax as well as get the firm's investment bankers, traders and wealth management advisors to work together to boost revenue.Despite a deep affinity for Morgan Stanley's roots and traditions as a blue-blood Wall Street institution, Kelleher, a 27-year veteran of the firm, is unsentimental about change, according to current and former colleagues.     Ahead of his promotion he culled one-in-four jobs on its bond trading desk and he is shifting more operations to low-cost cities such as Mumbai in India and Budapest in Hungary as part of a two-year plan to boost profits and reboot its flagging share price.A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Kelleher’s role in the bank's strategy and declined to make him available for interview.BRASH AND OUTSPOKEN As chief financial officer of the bank during the financial crisis, Kelleher helped save it from a near-death experience by drastically shrinking its balance sheet, converting it into a traditional bank holding company to access funding from the Federal Reserve and negotiated a $9 billion investment from Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.Given fears that the current rout in commodity prices and slow global growth will hurt bank revenues, Gorman told investors last month that Morgan Stanley needed to ""control what we can control given the market realities.""    Kelleher, a wine buff and classical music lover, is good at maintaining control.    When he ran Morgan Stanley's bond trading division in London, he was known for aggressively tracking down traders who had lost money. Former Morgan Stanley traders recall being summoned to Kelleher's office with a call and then berated if they didn't pick up the phone right away. In his office, he would glare at them over the top of his glasses when he didn't like the answers he got.  Brash and outspoken, former and current colleagues said they could quickly tell they were in Kelleher's good books if he cracked jokes about them in public. The silent treatment was a bad sign.Kelleher's style did not mesh well with that of the more reserved Paul Taubman, Morgan Stanley's former star dealmaker who ran the investment banking division.The two personalities clashed and in the end Gorman chose to put the trading and investment banking arms under Kelleher, prompting Taubman to leave in 2012. Taubman declined to comment for this story.AMBITIOUS BUT CAUTIOUS Kelleher's ascent to the president's job marks the second time he has triumphed over an internal rival in recent years.    His promotion last month was a cue for the departure of Greg Fleming, the former head of wealth management whose aspirations to be CEO jarred with plans by Gorman, who is 57, to stay on for another five to seven years.  Kelleher is a year older than his boss, and that means he could miss out on the top spot.While Kelleher is ambitious, colleagues say, he is a cautious operator, someone who has survived multiple leadership upheavals by keeping his head down.“I don’t think Colm ever postured for a big job, but he knows when the other guy is going to screw up his hand,” said Jerry Wood, who ran fixed income sales at Morgan Stanley for many years and is now retired. A father of two boys and one girl, he has been approached for top jobs at European banks Barclays and Lloyd's, according to former and current colleagues. It is unclear whether he was offered the jobs or asked if he wanted to be on shortlists. But Kelleher's loyalty lies with Morgan Stanley, where he is one of the few entrusted with an access pass to the roof of the New York headquarters in the middle of Broadway’s Theater district, allowing him to puff on a cigar between meetings. There are also pieces of art from his own collection displayed on the executive floors. BYZANTINE HISTORY For Morgan Stanley to compete effectively against rivals with larger balance sheets such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Kelleher will need to encourage more cross-selling between its investment banking and wealth management arms, as well as between banking and trading teams. For example, bankers could encourage their corporate clients to originate trades and hedges with their counterparts in the sales and trading business.    He is well versed in such collaborative initiatives. When he was running investment banking and trading, Kelleher helped create a group of senior executives whose job it was to persuade the firm's biggest clients, from companies to hedge funds, to use as many of the bank's products as possible.More recently, he has moved senior equities executives into bond trading, including naming former equities trading head Sam Kellie-Smith as the new head of fixed income in January.Kelleher has also started rewarding employees who drum up business for other divisions. Investment bankers who, for example, introduce an executive whose company is about to go public to wealth management brokers get a bump in their compensation.It's all a far cry from the career Kelleher once considered. A history graduate from Oxford University, he told the Wall Street Journal in 2012 that had he taken a different path, he would have become a professor, lecturing university students on Byzantine history.Born in Ireland to a family of nine children but raised largely in England, where he is big fan of the Chelsea soccer team, Kelleher likes to pepper business discussions with references to historical and literary figures such as King Canute and Edgar Allen Poe. When Morgan Stanley was threatened with a three-notch downgrade to its credit rating in 2012, which would have led to a big increase in its borrowing costs and may have prompted big clients to pull back from some business, he gathered his team for a pep talk. ""He talked about the house of Morgan and where the firm came from and what its values are that make it unique,"" said Lucas Detor, a former co-head of Morgan Stanley's distressed and U.S. leveraged loan business and now an executive managing director for investment manager CarVal Investors.""He told people, 'I got it. We’ve come from tough places before.' And he was right.""    Morgan Stanley escaped with a two-notch downgrade, which was a blow but not a critical one.

771,"   By Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 4 Colm Kelleher is a stickler for discipline, even when it comes to the office dress code.In an internal risk meeting during the summer of 2010, the then head of trading at Morgan Stanley chastised colleagues for rolling up their shirt sleeves and dispensing with their jackets in the New York heat, according to a former executive. Even in the dog days of summer with no clients present, Kelleher held those around him to a high standard.Kelleher's role as enforcer-in-chief at Morgan Stanley was solidified last month when the Wall Street firm's Chief Executive James Gorman named him president, the No. 2 spot.With Morgan Stanley under pressure to slash jobs, assets and business lines to compensate for a decline in bond trading, Gorman needs a lieutenant who can wield the ax as well as get the firm's investment bankers, traders and wealth management advisors to work together to boost revenue.Despite a deep affinity for Morgan Stanley's roots and traditions as a blue-blood Wall Street institution, Kelleher, a 27-year veteran of the firm, is unsentimental about change, according to current and former colleagues.Ahead of his promotion he culled one-in-four jobs on its bond trading desk and he is shifting more operations to low-cost cities such as Mumbai in India and Budapest in Hungary as part of a two-year plan to boost profits and reboot its flagging share price.A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Kelleher's role in the bank's strategy and declined to make him available for interview.BRASH AND OUTSPOKEN As chief financial officer of the bank during the financial crisis, Kelleher helped save it from a near-death experience by drastically shrinking its balance sheet, converting it into a traditional bank holding company to access funding from the Federal Reserve and negotiated a $9 billion investment from Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.Given fears that the current rout in commodity prices and slow global growth will hurt bank revenues, Gorman told investors last month that Morgan Stanley needed to ""control what we can control given the market realities.""Kelleher, a wine buff and classical music lover, is good at maintaining control.When he ran Morgan Stanley's bond trading division in London, he was known for aggressively tracking down traders who had lost money. Former Morgan Stanley traders recall being summoned to Kelleher's office with a call and then berated if they didn't pick up the phone right away. In his office, he would glare at them over the top of his glasses when he didn't like the answers he got.Brash and outspoken, former and current colleagues said they could quickly tell they were in Kelleher's good books if he cracked jokes about them in public. The silent treatment was a bad sign.Kelleher's style did not mesh well with that of the more reserved Paul Taubman, Morgan Stanley's former star dealmaker who ran the investment banking division. The two personalities clashed and in the end Gorman chose to put the trading and investment banking arms under Kelleher, prompting Taubman to leave in 2012. Taubman declined to comment for this story.AMBITIOUS BUT CAUTIOUS Kelleher's ascent to the president's job marks the second time he has triumphed over an internal rival in recent years.His promotion last month was a cue for the departure of Greg Fleming, the former head of wealth management whose aspirations to be CEO jarred with plans by Gorman, who is 57, to stay on for another five to seven years.Kelleher is a year older than his boss, and that means he could miss out on the top spot.While Kelleher is ambitious, colleagues say, he is a cautious operator, someone who has survived multiple leadership upheavals by keeping his head down. ""I don't think Colm ever postured for a big job, but he knows when the other guy is going to screw up his hand,"" said Jerry Wood, who ran fixed income sales at Morgan Stanley for many years and is now retired.A father of two boys and one girl, he has been approached for top jobs at European banks Barclays and Lloyd's , according to former and current colleagues. It is unclear whether he was offered the jobs or asked if he wanted to be on shortlists.But Kelleher's loyalty lies with Morgan Stanley, where he is one of the few entrusted with an access pass to the roof of the New York headquarters in the middle of Broadway's Theater district, allowing him to puff on a cigar between meetings. There are also pieces of art from his own collection displayed on the executive floors.BYZANTINE HISTORY For Morgan Stanley to compete effectively against rivals with larger balance sheets such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Kelleher will need to encourage more cross-selling between its investment banking and wealth management arms, as well as between banking and trading teams. For example, bankers could encourage their corporate clients to originate trades and hedges with their counterparts in the sales and trading business.He is well versed in such collaborative initiatives. When he was running investment banking and trading, Kelleher helped create a group of senior executives whose job it was to persuade the firm's biggest clients, from companies to hedge funds, to use as many of the bank's products as possible.More recently, he has moved senior equities executives into bond trading, including naming former equities trading head Sam Kellie-Smith as the new head of fixed income in January. Kelleher has also started rewarding employees who drum up business for other divisions. Investment bankers who, for example, introduce an executive whose company is about to go public to wealth management brokers get a bump in their compensation.It's all a far cry from the career Kelleher once considered. A history graduate from Oxford University, he told the Wall Street Journal in 2012 that had he taken a different path, he would have become a professor, lecturing university students on Byzantine history.Born in Ireland to a family of nine children but raised largely in England, where he is big fan of the Chelsea soccer team, Kelleher likes to pepper business discussions with references to historical and literary figures such as King Canute and Edgar Allen Poe.When Morgan Stanley was threatened with a three-notch downgrade to its credit rating in 2012, which would have led to a big increase in its borrowing costs and may have prompted big clients to pull back from some business, he gathered his team for a pep talk.""He talked about the house of Morgan and where the firm came from and what its values are that make it unique,"" said Lucas Detor, a former co-head of Morgan Stanley's distressed and U.S. leveraged loan business and now an executive managing director for investment manager CarVal Investors.""He told people, 'I got it.

785,"  Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are expected to buy back about 15 percent of their outstanding shares over the next three years, analysts at JP Morgan Securities said, citing their strong capital positions.Buying back shares when the stock is trading below tangible book value is the right strategy for the two banks, said analysts led by Kian Abouhossein, who upgraded the stocks to ""overweight"".Shares of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were up about 2 percent in afternoon trading on Tuesday.Goldman bought back shares worth $4.2 billion in 2015, while Morgan Stanley repurchased $2.1 billion of its shares, reducing their outstanding shares by 2 percent each, analysts said.They now estimate Goldman to buy back shares worth $15 billion and Morgan Stanley $10.5 billion of their current market capitalizations between 2016 and 2018.However, the brokerage wasn't too upbeat about the performance of global investment banks this year, saying their earnings may decline, given a challenging credit trading environment and low level of deal flow. The analysts cut their 2016 earnings estimate for the banks by an average 20 percent, while estimating revenue declines of 21 percent.   ""We believe the Q1 IB revenue environment has started on a challenging note with limited issuance activity and widening credit spreads,"" they said. Global investment banks' cash equities revenue may fall as the recent decline in equity markets indicates volumes are not healthy, the analysts said.""Our earnings cuts for 2016E also incorporate our view that if there is market normalization, it could be followed by a period of lower market activity as we have witnessed in past sell-offs, thus impacting IB revenues,"" they added.They downgraded Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX to ""neutral"" from ""overweight,"" as they expect revenue from trading credit and securitized products to remain weak on further widening in spreads. JP Morgan named Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) its top pick among global investment banks, saying it sees no liquidity or funding concerns and that the current negative market sentiment toward the German bank was overdone.For 2017, JP Morgan expects global investment banks' revenues to grow 7 percent.

806,"   By Olivia Oran  When a founder of a tech startup wants to buy a home but has all his money parked in illiquid stock, or a pro-athlete wants to buy a Porsche but has not yet received his guaranteed payout, Morgan Stanley wants to be the lender they turn to.In fact, the bank wants to double the size of these custom loans to 10 percent of its loan book, up from about 5 percent today, Eric Heaton, president of Morgan Stanley's U.S. banks, told Reuters in an interview.The idea is to strengthen ties with wealthy individuals so they will be more inclined to use Morgan Stanley for other services - whether that is managing their investments, selling a business or taking one public.Morgan Stanley has been lending more since acquiring the Smith Barney brokerage business from Citigroup Inc. It had almost $200 billion worth of loans at year-end – quadruple its size three years earlier. Until recently, Morgan Stanley has not focused much on what it calls ""tailored lending"" because it's a niche business: only 20,000 of the bank's more than 3 million clients qualify for such loans, by having a minimum of $10 million in investable assets.Morgan Stanley first focused on the simpler, less lucrative business of lending against wealth clients' investment portfolios, as well as mortgages and merger financing. It is now turning to tailored loans because they have high profit margins and, perhaps more importantly, because it's a good way to encourage wealthy clients to do more business with Morgan Stanley.    ""This isn't a one-off initiative to grow the bank, it's an important piece,"" said Heaton.Though he declined to give a timeframe for reaching the 10 percent target, Morgan Stanley has been laying the groundwork for some time. In 2014, it hired Marcus Mitchell from Deutsche Bank AG to oversee its tailored lending build-out. A year ago, the bank started making loans with museum-quality art as collateral. More recently it began lending against stock in privately held companies, and is now looking toward other offerings, including loans against private aircraft.Tailored lending is just one component of Morgan Stanley's broader lending goals. Management has set its focus on loans as a key source of revenue growth, as the bank struggles to generate a return on shareholder capital of 9 to 11 percent by 2017. That goal, set by Chief Executive James Gorman, has been elusive because of hard luck in other businesses – particularly fixed-income trading.Morgan Stanley is not the only bank facing these challenges. Although most rivals have been producing better returns, near-zero interest rates have broadly weighed on profits, because they diminish the money banks can earn investing idle cash in securities.That means competition to lend to the most attractive borrowers is stiff. And when it comes to tailored lending, risks can be hard to manage, said Portales Partners analyst Paul Gulberg. ""This type of lending carries idiosyncratic risk,"" he said. ""Your risk is against mispricing something because you are working with products that are very unique.""HIGH MARGINS Morgan Stanley says it hires outside appraisers to assess values of one-of-a-kind items it lends against. The bank believes tailored loans are worth the risk, partly because they tend to have higher margins than traditional loans like mortgages, Mitchell said in an interview. Mitchell would not say what margins Morgan Stanley earns on tailored loans, but because clients often need financing in a pinch, and because the loans have unique risk profiles, banks have more leeway in charging higher rates.A private banking executive at another firm said that very unusual tailored loans can deliver margins of eight percentage points but that the types of loans Morgan Stanley is offering likely have much lower margins. By comparison, mortgages tend to have a margin of around 1 percentage point, analysts said.    Morgan Stanley currently lends out about $50 billion of its $149 billion in deposits within wealth management, and is targeting $60 billion by the end of 2017. Tailored loans account for roughly $4.5 billion of that, compared with $21 billion in mortgages.Morgan Stanley is also looking to expand into other types of lending. For instance, late last year it began extending loans to private-equity funds that need cash for investments between the time investors commit capital and deliver hard cash.These so-called ""capital call subscriptions"" come with a special risk too: that investors may not send the money they promised.

808,"   By Kristen Haunss | NEW YORK, April 8  NEW YORK, April 8 Morgan Stanley was the leading arranger of U.S. Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds at the end of the first quarter as issuance slumped more than 70 percent from a year earlier amid global market volatility and preparation for the implementation of risk-retention rules in December.Morgan Stanley arranged four U.S. CLOs in the first quarter, giving it a 19 percent market share, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data, moving up one place from the same period of 2015.CLOs are the biggest buyers of leveraged loans. Lower CLO volume affects appetite for the debt and puts pressure on the $880 billion loan market, which saw a 35 percent drop in annual institutional volume to $294.47 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.""This was a particularly challenging quarter which impacted CLO new issuance,"" Sajid Zaidi, global head of CLO new issue at Morgan Stanley in New York, said. ""We are pleased we were able to find investors for a number of our CLO issuer clients despite the difficult backdrop."" CLO issuance fell 72.5 percent to $8.2 billion in the first quarter compared to $29.8 billion a year earlier, according to the data. It is expected to fall more than 60 percent in 2016 from the $98.6 billion arranged in 2015 as the market works to comply with risk-retention rules that require managers to hold 5 percent of their fund.JP Morgan lowered its 2016 forecast in February to $35 billion to $45 billion from a range of $60 billion to $70 billion. Barclays cut its forecast to $40 billion to $50 billion from $70 billion to $80 billion, according to an April 1 research report. New CLO issuance was also depressed by wider spreads on existing CLOs in the first quarter, which made the older deals more attractive to investors.CLO equity, the most junior slice of the funds, had negative total returns in 2015, which further decreased the appeal of new issue. JP Morgan was second in the first quarter U.S. CLO arranger league table with 16 percent share on three deals. GreensLedge, which was not in the top ten a year earlier, was third with a 12 percent share on two CLOs, according to the data.""We are proud of the results given market conditions,"" Jim Kane, a GreensLedge co-founder, said.Citigroup topped 2015's full-year U.S. CLO arranger league table for volume and deal count, with an 18 percent market share, followed by Morgan Stanley with 13 percent and JP Morgan  with 10 percent, according to the data.

814,"   By Denny Thomas | HONG KONG  HONG KONG McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) is targeting private equity firms, including Bain Capital, MBK Partners, TPG Capital Management and Chinese state-backed conglomerate China Resources (Holdings) for its planned sale of 2,800 restaurants in North Asia, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The U.S. fast food giant is adopting a new business model in Asia, which is now the most intense battleground for global restaurant chains, by planning to bring in partners to own the restaurants within a franchise operation.Several other global restaurant operators have switched to the so-called franchise model and McDonald's has also set a long-term aim of being 95 percent franchised, the company said in a statement on March 31.Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's has hired Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to run the sale of the restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea, the people said. A formal sales process is expected to kick-off in about three to four weeks, one of the people said.Ahead of that, McDonald's and its advisor are drawing up a list of likely partners who will be approached to participate in the auction, the person added.The franchise partners would likely end up owning a majority stake in the restaurants in each market, or even as much as 100 percent, and be responsible for future capital spending. The precise structure of the deal is still to be decided, the sources said. In return, McDonald's will get a one-time franchise payment and ongoing royalty fees, which usually range between 3-5 percent of annual turnover.Asia-focused Baring Private Equity Asia is the other buyouts firm likely to be invited to the auction process, banking sources familiar with the process said.McDonald's declined to add to the March 31 statement. China Resources, MBK, Bain, TPG and Baring all declined to comment. Morgan Stanley didn't respond to an email seeking comment.McDonald's does not break out country-by-country revenue details. It is China's No. 2 fast food chain behind YUM Brands Inc (YUM.N), which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chains. McDonald's is leaning towards finding separate partners in all the three markets and would likely offer a majority stake to make the deal appealing to buyers, the people added.The private equity firms are attracted to the rapid growth opportunity available in the so-called quick-service restaurants' (QSR) business in Asia.""In recent years, even though formal dining may have been impacted by the austerity measures, QSR as a format is growing pretty rapidly,"" said Kiki Yang, a Greater China partner at consulting firm Bain & Co.""QSR has the format that a lot of investors like because of the growth of the segment, standardized procedures and it's easy to expand."" China Resources (Holdings), which is the parent of brewing company China Resources Beer Holdings (0291.HK), and operates Pacific Coffee chains in Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Macau, has previously expressed interest in expanding its retail footprint.""This will attract a lot of sponsor interest,"" said one senior Hong Kong-based M&A banker familiar with the McDonald's process. ""For one, it's an established business and second such assets rarely come to market in Asia.""Buyout firms from KKR & Co (KKR.N) to Carlyle Group (CG.O) and others have raised billions of dollars in new funds in Asia to benefit from the region's growth potential. But the lack of opportunities to gain control of businesses and stiff asking prices have left the Asia private equity industry sitting on about $140 billion of ""dry powder"" or unemployed capital, according to data provider Preqin.Apart from the proceeds from a sale, a deal would lower McDonald's capital spending needs, which totaled $2.6 billion last year.McDonald also plans to open 1,500 more restaurants in China and Hong Kong over the next five years, to tap the region's rapid growth.  However, McDonald's and Yum, have been facing increasing competition from cheaper local rivals, particularly in China, where they are both trying to recover from food safety scares.Yum is also in the process of spinning off its 6,900 China restaurants, and is in talks with buyouts firms, including KKR and Hopu Investments to sell up to a 20 percent stake after battling sliding sales over the past few quarters. Bruised by food safety scandals and changing tastes, McDonald's is also selling a big stake in its Japanese arm. Buyout firms, including Bain Capital, Permira [PERM.UL] and MBK, were among those who submitted bids for the McDonald's Japan stake earlier this year, though it was unclear if a deal is close. All three buyout firms declined comment.McDonald's has struggled in Japan over the past two years, closing more than 150 restaurants last year, remodeling almost 3,000 and posting a $310 million net loss in 2015.McDonald's owns 49.99 percent of its Japanese arm McDonald's Holdings (2702.T), according to the company's website, and intends to cut that to about 20 percent.

815,"   By Lisa Lambert | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Friday they had reissued their letter from earlier in the week to Morgan Stanley  about the bank's ""living will,"" or plan for a bankruptcy that would not rely on federal aid, because of a technical error.""The feedback letter for Morgan Stanley has been re-issued due to a drafting error that labeled a weakness as a deficiency, rather than a shortcoming,"" said Federal Reserve spokesman Eric Kollig. ""The change has no impact on the firm or the required remediation."" The requirement for a living will was part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the U.S. government spent billions of dollars on bailouts to keep big banks from failing and wrecking the U.S. economy.

820,"  NEW YORK U.S. business conditions are the strongest since the summer of 2014 as sentiment has recovered from a weak start to the year, signaling companies' willingness to make capital expenditures, Morgan Stanley economists said on Friday.More investment in equipment, however, might come at the expense of less hiring, they said.The bank's business conditions index rose 3 points to 68 in April, the highest since August 2014. The index is more than double its recent trough of 29, hit in February.""Stronger credit conditions, capex plans and expectations for future activity were offset by weaker hiring and hiring plans and modest downtick in advance bookings,"" Morgan Stanley's economists said in a report.The bank's hiring plans index fell 13 points in April to 34, the lowest since a bottom hit in June 2009 during the recession, while its capex plans index rose 5 points to 58, the highest since July 2015. ""If this signals the beginning of a sustained rebalancing, it would be a positive signal for a potential recovery in productivity,"" they wrote.Stronger productivity is seen as critical for overall economic growth. Productivity growth has fallen steadily since the third quarter of 2009, when it reached 9.5 percent a year after the global credit crunch. In March, it was revised to -2.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015.Economists at the New York Federal Reserve said on Friday they estimated the potential U.S. growth rate is currently about 1.75 percent. In the 1980s to 1990s, potential U.S. growth was running modestly above 3 percent. Actual Gross Domestic Product readings ran at, above or below that potential during those two decades.

823,"  (Repeat story, no change to text)SYDNEY, April 18 The administrator for troubled Australian steel and iron ore group Arrium Ltd said it had agreed to work toward a ""constructive"" outcome with Morgan Stanley after the investment bank took legal steps to call in a three-year-old debt.Morgan Stanley filed action in the Delaware Chancery Court in the United States on Friday seeking orders that Arrium and its units repay a $75.4 million credit facility the U.S. bank provided in 2013, according to legal publishers Law360.com and Arrium's administrator, KordaMentha Pty Ltd.KordaMentha replied with a separate action in the Federal Court of Australia to block Morgan Stanley's attempt to collect the debt. This action has now been stayed after the agreement between the two parties to work together to resolve the issue. ""The parties are now working constructively towards an outcome that will align all interests of the lender group in supporting the best possible outcome for the Arrium Group, including the employees of the businesses in Australia and overseas,"" according to a KordaMentha statement on Monday.Morgan Stanley's legal move had threatened to scupper efforts to restructure Arrium. Already, at the prompting of the Australian Workers Union and Arrium's major lenders, the firm's original administrator Grant Thornton had to be replaced by KordaMentha, known for winning payout from bankrupt companies. Arrium descent into voluntary administration, a potential prelude to bankruptcy, underscores the uphill battle facing smaller companies with high debt versus larger and more efficient sector giants.It also exposes how creditors are souring on indebted resources companies in the current tough climate. Faced with the prospect of years of low iron ore and steel prices, Arrium endured a backlash from creditors who rejected a $927 million recapitalisation plan signed with Blackstone  private equity group's GSO Capital Partners in February.The plan would have left lenders of A$2.8 billion  ($2.15 billion) in unsecured debt with repayments of only 55 Australian cents on the dollar.Morgan Stanley's loan is linked to Arrium's U.S. business, including its profitable ore grinding Moly-Cop unit, the most profitable part of Arrium's business, according to KordaMentha.

824,"  Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) commodity market trading risk measure, known as Value-at-Risk (VaR), fell to its lowest in at least three years in the three months to end-March, the bank said on Monday.The bank's VaR indicator was $11 million in the first quarter, down from $12 million in the prior three months and $19 million in the year-ago period.The drop came as the bank's net revenues from fixed income and commodities sales and trading sank more than 50 percent to $873 million from a year ago due to depressed energy prices and the sale of its oil merchanting business at the end of 2015.The results also reflect slower client activity in rates and foreign exchange, and challenging credit markets, it said.Sliding commodity and oil prices, worries about the Chinese economy and uncertainty about U.S. interest rates led to volatile markets in January and February, scaring off traders, investors and companies hoping to list on stock exchanges.The VaR is a risk-reward indicator that measures the commodities exposure of Wall Street banks, which typically group commodities revenue under the fixed income category and do not break out the sector.Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) will report its quarterly results on Tuesday.The following is a table of VaR, in millions of dollars, for five major U.S. banks:                               2016                      2015                    2014                    2013                                    Q1      Q4     Q3     Q2    Q1    Q4    Q3    Q2    Q1    Q4    Q3    Q2    Q1                      Goldman                 15     17    19    27    23    23    21    22    20    16    19    17                     Sachs                                                                                                         Morgan           11     12     17    16    19    14    15    19    20    18    20    24    20                      Stanley                                                                                                       JPMorgan          9     11     10     9     8     6     7     9    11    15    13    13    15                     BoA-ML                   4      5     6     6     8     8     7     7     6    12    14    15                     Citigroup               17     17    18    24    19    15    15    14    11    13    12    34           (Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Richard Chang)",2016-04-18,MS,"Mon Apr 18, 2016 | 4:04pm EDT",Factbox: Wall Street and commodity risk - Morgan Stanley risk sinks in first quarter,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-banks-commodities-risk-factbox-idUSKCN0XF1ZF?type=companyNews
825,"   By Olivia Oran and Richa Naidu  Morgan Stanley's trouble growing revenue in weak markets may prompt management to take further actions to achieve financial goals, Chief Executive James Gorman said on Monday.His comments came after the Wall Street bank released first-quarter results showing that its profit tumbled by more than half. Trouble in fixed-income markets cut deep into Morgan Stanley's trading revenue. The business of underwriting stocks and bonds was also difficult.Sliding commodity and oil prices, worries about the Chinese economy and uncertainty about U.S. interest rates scared off traders, investors and companies hoping to issue debt or list on stock exchanges early in the quarter.Morgan Stanley's return-on-equity, a key measure of how well it uses shareholder capital to earn profits, was 6.2 percent, well below Gorman's goal of 9 percent to 11 percent by the end of next year.""It must be said that if these markets were to continue as is, our goals would be extremely difficult to achieve and we would therefore take additional appropriate actions,"" Gorman said on a conference call with analysts.He later added that Morgan Stanley's shareholder return was ""not acceptable"" and that the bank might need to get ""much more aggressive"" on cost cutting.Analysts were initially bullish on Morgan Stanley's results because it beat their subdued expectations by a wide margin. But as the call went on, Gorman and Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan were hammered with questions about how it will achieve its financial goals if market conditions do not improve.Morgan Stanley shares were down 15 cents at $25.61 in midday  trading. The stock fell about 21 percent in the quarter - the sharpest decline of any big U.S. bank.Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, said it would be ""very difficult"" for Morgan Stanley to achieve the return-on-equity target Gorman has set out with revenue as weak as it was last quarter.CHANGING FOCUS Morgan Stanley is not alone in struggling to grow revenue in weak markets, though its profit problems are more severe than rivals that are larger and can lean on other businesses to buoy results.Last week, JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 7 percent decline in quarterly profit, while Bank of America Corp reported an 18 percent drop and Citigroup Inc's earnings fell 27 percent. The declines were attributed in part to trading difficulties. Morgan Stanley's most comparable rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, will report results on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley and its peers have increasingly focused on expenses to make up for weak revenue.The bank said in January it was looking to save up to $1 billion by 2017 through technology and moving jobs to less expensive locations. Overall, it cut expenses by 14 percent during the first quarter.In an interview, Pruzan told Reuters most of the cost-cutting last quarter came from ""tightening up discretionary spending."" More cuts are on the way, but it will take time for them to be reflected in earnings, he said.The bank also plans to move more back-office staff to low-cost locations. About 40 percent of Morgan Stanley's back-office employees currently sit in lower-cost locations. Pruzan said the bank would like to increase this to 50 to 55 percent.""There are areas that are starting to take shape but we'll see the actual savings from those towards the end of the year and next year.""Overall, Morgan Stanley's earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 54.4 percent to $1.06 billion, or 55 cents per share, from a year earlier, when the bank reported its most profitable quarter since the financial crisis.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of 46 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net revenue fell 21.3 percent to $7.79 billion, missing the average estimate of $7.87 billion.The bank's adjusted revenue from fixed income and commodities trading slid 54.1 percent in the quarter. Equities trading revenue fell 9.3 percent.Morgan Stanley has been shifting its focus away from more volatile areas of trading and toward more stable and less capital-intensive businesses, like wealth management.Wealth management revenue fell 4.3 percent to $3.67 billion during the quarter, but this accounted for 47 percent of net revenue compared with 39 percent in the same period of 2015.Investment banking revenue, which includes fees from mergers and income from equity and debt underwriting, fell 18.4 percent to $1.11 billion.Industry-wide, investment banking fees fell 29 percent in the period, the worst first-quarter since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data.  However, there were some signs of hope. Gorman said there has lately been a ""slightly better turn in markets,"" that its M&A pipeline is strong and there are some ""green shoots"" in the equity underwriting calendar. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Loan performance of U.S. large-cap banks     (bit.ly/1MuuaHs)U.S. large-cap banks : Q1 stock performance    (bit.ly/1TPu3rg)Morgan Stanley, Goldman comparison    tmsnrt.rs/1Ry717WGLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING REVIEW    FIRST QUARTER 2016    tmsnrt.rs/1TWaz4pMorgan Stanley growth plays 2016 version of Godot    Wall Street and commodity risk: Morgan Stanley risk sinks in Q1   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Reporting by Olivia Oran and Richa Naidu; Additional reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Ted Kerr, Lauren Tara LaCapra and ALan Crosby)",2016-04-18,MS,"Mon Apr 18, 2016 | 3:29pm EDT",Weak markets leave Morgan Stanley struggling to reach return-on-equity target,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-morganstanley-results-idUSKCN0XF190?type=companyNews
826,"   By Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Having searched high and low for revenue growth with little success, Morgan Stanley is taking a hatchet to costs.    The bank cut total expenses by 14 percent last quarter, results released on Monday showed. This followed an even sharper decline the prior period when it announced a sweeping plan to shed more of its bond-trading business.    Much of the cost reduction has come from paying fewer employees less money, and the bank plans to do more of that. Morgan Stanley cut 3 percent of its staff during the first quarter, and compensation-related expenses fell 19 percent compared with the year-ago period.    But even with those steps, analysts grilled Morgan Stanley executives about whether they will be able to hit Chief Executive James Gorman's target of a 9 to 11 percent return-on-equity by 2017. That measure of how profitably the bank is using shareholder capital was just 6.2 percent during the first quarter.     ""If Morgan Stanley doesn't get to this target, investors will want to think about the next alternative,"" CLSA banking analyst Mike Mayo said, referring to more drastic changes in its business mix. ""We're not there yet, but we need to see evidence they're on track for 2017.""    Gorman suggested the bank may, in fact, have to do more to hit his goal. Absent a revenue revival which seems unlikely this year, that means more cost cutting ahead.   ""If these markets were to continue as is, our goals would be extremely difficult to achieve,"" Gorman said. He later added, “If indeed the environment continued as is, we would be much more aggressive on the cost front.”     The extent of Morgan Stanley's cost-cutting is leading some analysts and investors to wonder whether the bank is going too far.    Wall Street has a tendency to cut through fat into muscle, and sometimes bone, when markets are rough for extended periods  as they have now been for more than five years. When conditions improve, banks that cut too much miss out on opportunities to grow revenue and gain market share in key businesses, because they no longer have the staff and resources to be nimble.    Banks ""need to be careful,"" said Tyler Ventura, a research analyst with investment management firm Diamond Hill in Columbus, Ohio. ""As the entire industry cuts, some are going to cut more than others and you want to make sure you can still maintain your business.""    In January, Morgan Stanley announced an initiative to cut up to $1 billion in costs by 2017 in an initiative called Project Streamline. The plan included shifting operations to low-cost cities, outsourcing more and using technology to become more efficient.     Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan told Reuters in an interview on Monday most of the cost-cutting last quarter came from “tightening up discretionary spending.” More cost cuts are on the way, but it will take time for them to be reflected in earnings, he said.    The bank is also moving more staff to cities where salaries and overhead cost less than in New York or London. Around 40 percent of Morgan Stanley's bank-office staff sit in cheaper cities like Mumbai and Glasgow today, Pruzan said on a call with analysts. The bank wants to boost that to 50 to 55 percent.MOVING TO THE CLOUD      Technology is another big part of Morgan Stanley’s cost-cutting drive. The bank is relying more on cloud computing, which is storing and processing data through a shared, centralized system offered by large tech firms. Using “the cloud” tends to be cheaper and more efficient for companies than buying and maintaining their own servers. But it takes time to transition, and for costs related to old technology to fade away.    As it stands, Morgan Stanley has few other options than to focus on costs, analysts say.     ""As market activity improves, some of the cost-cutting questions at Morgan will probably go away,"" said Brian Kleinhanzl, a banking analyst with KBW. ""But as of now, it’s the only lever that banks can really pull in this type of environment.""

But as the call went on, Gorman and Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan were hammered with questions about how it will achieve its financial goals if market conditions do not improve. Morgan Stanley shares were down 6 cents at $25.69 in midday  trading. The stock fell about 21 percent in the quarter - the sharpest decline of any big U.S. bank.Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, said it would be ""very difficult"" for Morgan Stanley to achieve the return-on-equity target Gorman has set out with revenue as weak as it was last quarter.CHANGING FOCUS Morgan Stanley is not alone in struggling to grow revenue in weak markets, though its profit problems are more severe than rivals that are larger and can lean on other businesses to buoy results. Last week, JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 7 percent decline in quarterly profit, while Bank of America Corp  reported an 18 percent drop and Citigroup Inc's earnings fell 27 percent. The declines were attributed in part to trading difficulties. Morgan Stanley's most comparable rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, will report results on Tuesday.Morgan Stanley and its peers have increasingly focused on expenses to make up for weak revenue.The bank said in January it was looking to save up to $1 billion by 2017 through technology and moving jobs to less expensive locations. Overall, it cut expenses by 14 percent during the first quarter.In an interview, Pruzan told Reuters most of the cost-cutting last quarter came from ""tightening up discretionary spending."" More cuts are on the way, but it will take time for them to be reflected in earnings, he said.The bank also plans to move more back-office staff to low-cost locations. About 40 percent of Morgan Stanley's back-office employees currently sit in lower-cost locations. Pruzan said the bank would like to increase this to 50 to 55 percent.""There are areas that are starting to take shape but we'll see the actual savings from those towards the end of the year and next year."" Overall, Morgan Stanley's earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 54.4 percent to $1.06 billion, or 55 cents per share, from a year earlier, when the bank reported its most profitable quarter since the financial crisis.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 46 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net revenue fell 21.3 percent to $7.79 billion, missing the average estimate of $7.87 billion.The bank's adjusted revenue from fixed income and commodities trading slid 54.1 percent in the quarter.

""It won't be easy, and it's likely to be far from smooth,"" the banks' analysts said. However, they see passing the review as the most likely outcome. Sources told Reuters earlier this week that no deal was likely at a special meeting of euro zone finance ministers on May 9.

839,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley is moving its commodities trading business, which has been housed in Purchase, New York, for the last 15 years, to the bank's Times Square headquarters. The physical move is part of a broader strategy shift for the once high-flying team of traders, as Morgan Stanley has moved away from riskier parts of the business, like owning and storing oil or placing bets on the direction of commodity markets. A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the move from Purchase was aimed at ensuring the commodities group was more closely connected with the company's fixed income unit and the broader institutional securities business. The spokesman did not give further details but a person familiar with the matter said the firm expects to move around 150 employees over the summer.  Morgan Stanley initially moved its commodities business to Purchase, a leafy suburb around an hour outside New York City, to spread out its operations after the Sept. 11 attacks. The former Texaco campus also houses its wealth management division, but the bulk of its other U.S.-based trading operations are in Manhattan.Post-crisis regulations and a desire to take less risk have molded the bank's commodities operation into a more traditional trading business where Morgan Stanley simply stands between buyers and sellers. It is also lending to energy companies and issuing derivatives that allow clients to hedge market risk. In January, former equities trading executive Sam Kellie-Smith took charge of the bank's broader fixed income and commodities trading unit. The division was previously overseen by Colm Kelleher, who was promoted to become Morgan Stanley's president.In November, Morgan Stanley completed the sale of its physical oil business to commodity trading firm Castleton Commodities, after the U.S. Federal Reserve pressured Wall Street banks to get out of that type of business. The transaction ended Morgan Stanley's three-decade history as a major player in physical oil markets. The bank lost around 100 front office staff to Castleton as part of the deal.Morgan Stanley also sold its controlling stake in oil storage business TransMontaigne to NGL Energy Partners LP in 2014.

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman on Tuesday stood by his intention to reach a key performance target after facing sharp questions from an analyst about whether he can achieve the goals he laid out.At the Wall Street bank's annual meeting, CLSA analyst Mike Mayo asked Gorman how confident he is that Morgan Stanley can get its return-on-equity up to a range of 9 to 11 percent by the end of 2017.That metric is important to shareholders because it measures how well a bank is using its capital to produce profit. However, tougher capital requirements and weak revenue has left Morgan Stanley far from Gorman's goal, reporting just a 6.2 percent return-on-equity in the first quarter.Mayo, who seemed skeptical, said his investor clients are upset. One recently hung up the phone on him out of anger about Morgan Stanley's performance, he said. Although the first quarter was ""a very challenging environment"" to earn money across Wall Street, Gorman said, he does not expect that to be the case the rest of this year or in 2017.

844,"   By Ron Bousso | LONDON  LONDON Oil discoveries in 2015 fell to their lowest since 1952 as energy companies slashed exploration budgets in the wake of the oil price fall, creating a gap for meeting future demand, analysts at Morgan Stanley said on Monday.The oil and gas industry discovered 2.8 billion barrels of oil outside the United States last year, the equivalent of one month of global consumption, the U.S. bank said, quoting data from consultancy Rystad Energy.Including the United States, where the rapid expansion of the onshore shale industry unlocked major resources over the past decade, global discoveries rose to 12.1 billion figure - but still the lowest since 1952, when the oil industry was one-seventh of its current size.Oil discoveries are vital to replace resources, meet still-growing demand and offset the depletion of existing fields.The sharp drop in oil prices over the past two years has led companies including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) to sharply reduce budgets, particularly for exploration, where spending fell in 2015 to around 95 billion from $168 billion two years earlier, according to Morgan Stanley. Despite a big increase in exploration spending since the start of the decade, when oil demand rapidly rose, there have been few major hydrocarbon discoveries, such as Statoil's (STL.OL) Johan Sverdrup field off Norway's coast or Eni's (ENI.MI) giant Zohr gas field off Egypt.BP last week announced the surprise departure of its exploration boss, and a shift in its oil search strategy that is focusing mainly on expanding existing fields rather than venturing expensively into the unknown. SHORTAGE A big increase in new oil fields in recent years and the ramp up of Iran's production following the lifting of international sanctions mean that in the short term, the impact of the low exploration record will be limited.But even under the most modest demand forecasts, driven by a drive to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, where consumption will decline to around 86 million barrels per day in 2030, only around two thirds of the demand can be met by currently producing fields or resources under development, Morgan Stanley said. ""Building this capacity over the next 25 years will require ongoing investment. Our strong suspicion is that this will be higher than what companies are currently spending, even relative to the 2 Degrees scenario under which demand is falling.""The outlook for exploration remains challenged, the bank said.""The return on exploration dollars spent has clearly deteriorated in recent years.

845,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Acushnet Company, the owner of golf brands including Titleist and Footjoy, is preparing to register with U.S. regulators as early as June for an initial public offering that could value it at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The IPO would come five years after consumer products conglomerate Fortune Brands sold Acushnet, under pressure from activist investor William Ackman, to South Korean sports apparel company Fila Korea Ltd and Mirae Asset Private Equity for $1.23 billion.Acushnet is now working with investment banks that include Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co, UBS Group AG  and Nomura Holdings Inc on the IPO, the sources said on Wednesday. The Fairhaven, Massachusetts-based company, which has more than $200 million in 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, could begin marketing its IPO as soon as this autumn, added the sources, who asked not to be named because the matter is private.Acushnet, JP Morgan, UBS and Nomura declined comment. Morgan Stanley could not be immediately reached for comment. The golf industry has tapered over the past several years, as its prime demographic group has aged and millennials have sought pastimes that are less time-intensive and more accessible. Earlier this year, German sportswear company Adidas  failed to attract enough attention from private equity firms when it explored a sale of its Taylormade golf equipment brands, Reuters reported..Still, the industry is expected to benefit this year from new media exposure, as young golf stars compete in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this summer for the first time in more than a century.For Acushnet, its greatest defense against broader industry woes may be its commanding market share in golf balls. Golf balls are cheaper and more easily lost than golf equipment, making them more frequently replaced. The more rounds of golf people play, the more balls they will buy.",2016-05-25,MS,"Wed May 25, 2016 | 4:44pm EDT",Owner of golf brand Titleist to file for U.S. IPO -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/acushnet-ipo-idUSL2N18M20E?type=companyNews

854,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) wealth management team wants clients to do more business with the firm, whether that means moving more of their investment assets there, taking out loans or performing basic cash management, senior executives said on Monday.This summer, the Wall Street bank is rolling out a new initiative for wealth clients called ""premiere cash management,"" which includes online bill paying and checking, as well as fraud monitoring and insurance.""We are very interested in capturing more wallet from clients where we don't have the entire wallet, with additional services we will provide,"" Shelley O'Connor, Morgan Stanley's co-head of wealth management, said at the Reuters Wealth Management Summit in New York. ""That will be a key focus.""Morgan Stanley currently has 3.5 million households as wealth clients. The bank wants to grow the number of clients it has, but is even more interested in doing additional business with existing clients - particularly those with more than $1 million in investable assets, O'Connor and her counterpart, Andy Saperstein, told Reuters. Morgan Stanley's push to be a bigger part of its clients' financial lives is not new, but it is more of a focus now.The wealth management industry broadly is coming under pressure from automated investing platforms like Wealthfront Inc and Betterment LLC, which offer investment advice at a much lower cost than traditional brokerage firms. In turn, Morgan Stanley and its peers are looking for ways to offer more services to clients, to make the role of a financial adviser more valuable.According to a handout provided by Morgan Stanley, it has been evolving its business model to become more of a ""family wealth manager"" that provides a range of services, from creating investment portfolios to philanthropy management and ""lifestyle advisory."" In the past, clients might work with a number of different firms to invest their assets, but that trend is changing, Saperstein said.""We're starting to see a trend towards consolidation ... to capture those assets,""  he said. Morgan executives say they also interested in attracting new clients, particularly millennials, and are looking at creating new roles on wealth teams to cater to them.""We might have hoodies, maybe people with pinstripe hoods,"" Saperstein joked.

856,"   By Philip Scipio  NEW YORK, June 14 (IFR) - Morgan Stanley still expects to wring about US$4bn a year in revenue from fixed income currency and commodity trading, despite heavy cuts to its FICC group.The announcement of the target Tuesday by Chief Executive James Gorman comes six months after the bank slashed its FICC group by 25% - the steepest such cut on Wall Street.That goal may be tough to pull off this year.Morgan Stanley has pulled in more than US$4bn from FICC in each of the last three years - but each time much of the revenue came in the first quarter. Last year 44% of the bank's US$4.3bn FICC haul came in Q1; in 2014 that figure was 39%.But in 2016, the bank saw FICC revenue fall 54% to US$873m compared to Q1 of 2015. Gorman, speaking at the bank's US financials conference, declined to give a preview of how the second quarter was going.But he did say that the weakness in the first quarter had begun to dissipate by the end of February. Some analysts are expecting second-quarter trading results to be stronger than normal.Maintaining the level of FICC revenue suggests traders at the bank have been tasked to do more with less.But Gorman said the bank had simply been overstaffed for the opportunities in the current environment. The total pie industry-wide for FICC has shrunk by half, he said.Earlier this year Morgan Stanley tapped Sam Kellie-Smith to run the FICC group. He was the first major appointment of Ted Pick, who was given consolidated control of FICC and equity trading groups last October.

857,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is eyeing quarterly revenue of around $1 billion for its fixed income, currencies and commodities trading unit, Chief Executive James Gorman said on Tuesday.    The Wall Street bank is seeing revenues grow in its bond trading business, or FICC, even with reduced headcount, Gorman said, speaking at the bank's U.S. Financials Conference in New York. Morgan Stanley is targeting $4 billion or more in FICC revenue annually, he added. ""It's not great, I'm not celebrating that ... but that's the kind of threshold we want to get the business to and obviously move it up from that point forward,"" Gorman said. Gorman had not previously given investors revenue guidance around the FICC business in the last several quarters.       Morgan Stanley has been focused on rebuilding morale in its bond trading unit and retaining existing employees, he added, after the bank cut 25 percent of its fixed income trading jobs last year.The firm is trying to move away from volatile businesses like trading to more stable areas such as wealth management.     Gorman said Morgan Stanley is finished with major headcount reductions in FICC for the next 12 months.    ""We aren't in the business of every quarter chopping and changing,"" he said.       Wall Street firms broadly are struggling with weakness in their fixed income units as regulations have made trading less profitable.     Morgan Stanley executives have previously said they believe the pool for fixed income trading has shrunk substantially over the last three years to $100 billion industry-wide from $150 billion to $160 billion in the past.     In the first quarter, Morgan Stanley generated FICC revenue of $873 million, down 56 percent from $1.9 billion a year ago. In January, the bank named Sam Kellie-Smith, who previously ran equities trading, as a new head for its fixed income trading business. Ted Pick, who previously ran the bank's equities trading unit, was tasked by Gorman last year to oversee its entire trading business.  Gorman said the trading environment in the second quarter has improved somewhat from the beginning of the year, though he remained cautious in light of upcoming macro events like Brexit that could swing markets. ""The environment was not as bad as everybody predicted and that has carried through to the second quarter ... but I would just be a little cautious because we have a lot of stuff coming up in the next couple of weeks,"" he said.

860,"   By Dan Freed  Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is attracting new money from international investors who want to move their assets into the United States, a senior wealth management executive said on Monday.The United States lately has become a haven for foreign money that once went to other destinations because it is getting harder to shield assets from taxes and transparency laws abroad.""We're growing our international business,"" Shelley O'Connor co-head of Morgan Stanley's wealth management business, said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in New York. ""We have definitely seen assets increase and...clients wanting to house their assets here rather than somewhere else internationally, whether it be Switzerland or an offshore entity.""The United States has long been a haven for individuals who want to use shell companies to hide money, or shield them from taxes, because of laws that support corporate anonymity and favorable trust laws in some states. But many European countries are preparing to set up registries that would make it harder for shell company owners to remain anonymous or avoid taxes. At the same time, there has been an influx of cash from Switzerland after years of pursuit by U.S. tax authorities for the identities of secret bank account owners.Morgan Stanley, which has one of the largest U.S. wealth management businesses, has been hiring advisers from firms including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) and Barclays PLC BARC.l who can help grow its business of managing money for international investors, O'Connor said. Those International Client Advisors, or ICAs, must undergo special accreditation before they can manage money for foreign clients at Morgan Stanley, spokesman James Wiggins said.

861,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ride-hailing company Uber has hired a group of banks to help it raise debt on the leveraged loan market, according to sources familiar with the proposed transaction.While the final size has yet to be determined, the loan could reach at least $1 billion with an even larger size possible, but the deal is still in early stages and could change in size and structure, said a source.Startups like Uber rarely visit the leveraged loan market as investors generally prefer to lend to companies with long track records. Uber was created in 2009, according to the company.                                                            The bank group currently consists of four banks, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, according to sources. The other two banks include Morgan Stanley and Barclays, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The San Francisco-based company has yet to visit the loan market to raise term loan debt, but it did arrange a $1.9 billion five-year revolving credit facility in June 2015 that was increased to $2.27 billion in March 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.Morgan Stanley served as the administrative agent on the revolving credit facility and a bookrunner along with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. The revolving credit facility is priced at 100 basis points over Libor. The loan matures in June 2020.The company has previously favored the equity market over the debt market, as it did when it announced June 1 that it had sealed a deal to raise $3.5 billion from the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, putting the value of the company at $62.5 billion, according to Reuters. Uber’s balance sheet stood at more than $11 billion at that time, according to the company. Uber operates an app allowing users to hail different types of transportation directly to where they are.Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined comment. Bank of American Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Uber did not immediately return requests for comment.

862,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley global commodities group co-head Peter Sherk is leaving the firm, the bank said Thursday in a memo.Nancy King, who co-heads the business, will become sole head. A Morgan Stanley spokesman confirmed the contents in the memo.Sherk's departure comes as Morgan Stanley is moving away from riskier parts of the commodities business, like owning and storing oil. Post-crisis regulations and a desire to take less risk have shifted the bank's commodities operation into a more traditional trading business in which the bank stands between buyers and sellers. It is also lending to energy companies and issuing derivatives that allow clients to hedge market risk.Morgan Stanley is in the process of moving the commodities group, which had been housed in Purchase, New York for more than a decade, to its Times Square headquarters where it can be more connected with the rest of the firm's fixed income unit. Sherk and King were named co-heads of commodities in January 2015 after former co-head Simon Greenshields left the firm and his counterpart Colin Bryce moved to a senior advisory role.Sherk joined Morgan Stanley in 1999 as a natural gas trader. He helped build the bank's North American power and gas practice, rising to become head of natural gas trading in 2006 and head of North American power and gas trading and origination two years later. King, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1986 as an oil and natural gas trader, will become part of the fixed income operating committee in her new role.Separately, commodities chief operating officer Martin Mitchell is also leaving Morgan Stanley, according to a person familiar with the matter. Last November, Morgan Stanley completed the sale of its physical oil business to commodity trading firm Castleton Commodities, after the U.S. Federal Reserve pressured Wall Street banks to get out of that type of business. The transaction ended Morgan Stanley's three-decade history as a major player in physical oil markets.

863,"   By Olivia Oran  Morgan Stanley global commodities group co-head Peter Sherk is leaving the firm, the bank said Thursday in a memo.Nancy King, who co-heads the business, will become sole head. A Morgan Stanley spokesman confirmed the contents in the memo.Sherk's departure comes as Morgan Stanley is moving away from riskier parts of the commodities business, like owning and storing oil. Post-crisis regulations and a desire to take less risk have shifted the bank's commodities operation into a more traditional trading business in which the bank stands between buyers and sellers. It is also lending to energy companies and issuing derivatives that allow clients to hedge market risk.Morgan Stanley is in the process of moving the commodities group, which had been housed in Purchase, New York for more than a decade, to its Times Square headquarters where it can be more connected with the rest of the firm's fixed income unit. Sherk and King were named co-heads of commodities in January 2015 after former co-head Simon Greenshields left the firm and his counterpart Colin Bryce moved to a senior advisory role.Sherk joined Morgan Stanley in 1999 as a natural gas trader. He helped build the bank's North American power and gas practice, rising to become head of natural gas trading in 2006 and head of North American power and gas trading and origination two years later. King, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1986 as an oil and natural gas trader, will become part of the fixed income operating committee in her new role.Separately, commodities chief operating officer Martin Mitchell is also leaving Morgan Stanley, according to a person familiar with the matter.

882,"   By Olivia Oran and Sudarshan Varadhan  Morgan Stanley, which has struggled for years to improve its bond-trading business, may finally be turning the corner. The Wall Street bank reported a lower second-quarter profit on Wednesday, but beat expectations by delivering relatively strong bond-trading revenue and cutting expenses.Chief Executive James Gorman has faced tough questions from analysts about the state of its fixed income, currency and commodities trading unit since taking the helm of the bank in 2010. Morgan Stanley scaled back the business in an effort to make it more profitable, but its choppy revenue led some to wonder whether the bank was on the right course.But so far this year, the business is hitting a revenue target Gorman laid out, and many analysts attributed Morgan Stanley's earnings beat to the bond trading unit. In discussing results, Gorman sounded triumphant, defending his decision to maintain the business on a smaller scale.""(It's) the topic of the day, the year and the century, it would appear,"" he said when asked whether the results were sustainable. ""Listen, my view was that there was a general over-reaction to the underperformance.""In both quarters this year, Morgan Stanley produced more than the $1 billion per quarter in revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading that Gorman recently set out. As part of the restructuring effort, the bank has reduced headcount there by 25 percent, slashed risky assets and focused on transactions that require little capital under new regulations.Gorman advised analysts to expect quarterly fluctuations, but said the target was achievable over the long term.""At the time it almost sounded like an aspirational goal, but clearly they did well,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski. ""Maybe ... we are closing in on a sustainable and predictable level."" Morgan Stanley's shares rose 2 percent to close at $28.78.Morgan Stanley is also in the midst of a cost-cutting program, targeting $1 billion by 2017. As part of this effort, the bank cut nonessential travel by half this year, Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan said. It is also closing data centers and shifting employees to lower-cost hubs.Second-quarter operating expenses fell 8.4 percent to $6.43 billion. Compensation costs, its biggest expense, fell 8.9 percent to $4.02 billion.Following the results, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr issued a report cheekily titled ""Morgan Stanley Beats on FICC (not a typo) & Cost Control."" Although it exceeded expectations, Morgan Stanley is still falling short when it comes to a key measure of how well it's using shareholder money to produce profits.Its return on equity of 8.3 percent during the second quarter is less than the 10 percent minimum that many investors expect, and less than Gorman's stated target of 9 to 11 percent by the end of 2017.Overall, the Wall Street bank's net income attributable to common shareholders was $1.43 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with an adjusted $1.69 billion, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. After adopting a new accounting method, Morgan Stanley's earnings no longer reflect changes in the value of its own debt. Adjustments for the year-ago period make the figures comparable.Equities sales and trading, typically a bright spot for the bank, fell 6 percent to $2.1 billion compared to the year before. Competitors including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp also reported strong bond trading and weak equity trading revenue.Morgan Stanley's wealth management division, which the firm has sought to bulk up over the last few years as a more stable business than trading, saw net revenue fall 2 percent to $3.8 billion. Loans and lending commitments to wealth clients rose 5 percent over the prior quarter, to $61.3 billion.  Up to Tuesday's close, Morgan Stanley shares had fallen 11.4 percent since the start of the year.Bank stocks have moved higher over the past week on better-than-expected earnings. The S&P 500 Financials Index is up 1 percent since the sector began reporting results on July 14 and up more than 10 percent from last month's lows reached after Britain voted to leave the European Union.

As part of the restructuring effort, the bank has reduced headcount there by 25 percent, slashed risky assets and focused on transactions that require little capital under new regulations.Gorman advised analysts to expect quarterly fluctuations, but said the target was achievable over the long term.""At the time it almost sounded like an aspirational goal, but clearly they did well,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski. ""Maybe ... we are closing in on a sustainable and predictable level."" Morgan Stanley's shares rose 2 percent to close at $28.78.Morgan Stanley is also in the midst of a cost-cutting program, targeting $1 billion by 2017. As part of this effort, the bank cut nonessential travel by half this year, Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan said. It is also closing data centers and shifting employees to lower-cost hubs.Second-quarter operating expenses fell 8.4 percent to $6.43 billion. Compensation costs, its biggest expense, fell 8.9 percent to $4.02 billion.Following the results, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr issued a report cheekily titled ""Morgan Stanley Beats on FICC (not a typo) & Cost Control."" Although it exceeded expectations, Morgan Stanley is still falling short when it comes to a key measure of how well it's using shareholder money to produce profits.Its return on equity of 8.3 percent during the second quarter is less than the 10 percent minimum that many investors expect, and less than Gorman's stated target of 9 to 11 percent by the end of 2017.Overall, the Wall Street bank's net income attributable to common shareholders was $1.43 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with an adjusted $1.69 billion, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. After adopting a new accounting method, Morgan Stanley's earnings no longer reflect changes in the value of its own debt. Adjustments for the year-ago period make the figures comparable.Equities sales and trading, typically a bright spot for the bank, fell 6 percent to $2.1 billion compared to the year before. Competitors including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp also reported strong bond trading and weak equity trading revenue.Morgan Stanley's wealth management division, which the firm has sought to bulk up over the last few years as a more stable business than trading, saw net revenue fall 2 percent to $3.8 billion. Loans and lending commitments to wealth clients rose 5 percent over the prior quarter, to $61.3 billion.  Up to Tuesday's close, Morgan Stanley shares had fallen 11.4 percent since the start of the year.Bank stocks have moved higher over the past week on better-than-expected earnings. The S&P 500 Financials Index is up 1 percent since the sector began reporting results on July 14 and up more than 10 percent from last month's lows reached after Britain voted to leave the European Union.

889,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 21 (Fitch) Morgan Stanley's (MS) second quarter 2016 (2Q16)  earnings improved and grew 35% from the sequential quarter, but were down 14%  from the year-ago quarter, which was somewhat strong, according to Fitch  Ratings.  This earnings improvement was largely due to better trading results  amid a more favorable market environment. The company's reported return on average equity (ROE) was 8.3% in 2Q16, up from  6.2% in the sequential quarter, but down from 9.9% in the year-ago quarter.   While the ROE improvement relative to the sequential period is good, Fitch also  notes that these returns remain below MS's long-term targets as well as Fitch's  estimate of the company's cost of equity of between 10% to 12%. This quarter's results generally are in line with peer banks that have reported  thus far, as all have benefited from improved market conditions for trading  activity within their Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities divisions. Net revenue in MS's Fixed Income and Commodities segment increased 49% from the  sequential quarter and was down only 6% from the year-ago quarter, which notably  still include the results from MS's oil merchanting business which was sold in  late 2015.  Improvement in this segment has been a focus more of MS over the  last year, as the company had change leadership in this group and implemented  efficiency measures across this platform. Equity trading net revenue for MS was more muted, increasing 4% from the  sequential quarter, but declining 8% from the year-ago quarter amid lower client  activity levels and weakness in Asia.  These results in equity trading are  largely consistent with peer institutions that have reported thus far. Investment banking (IB) net revenue benefited from favorable comparisons to the  sequential quarter, increasing 12%, but was down relative to the year-ago  quarter.  The net revenue improvement relative to the sequential quarter was  mixed as higher debt and underwriting net revenue more than offset a decline in  advisory net revenue.   While in general the debt and equity underwriting environment in 2Q16 remains  muted, it has improved relative to a very challenging 1Q16.  Compared to the  year-ago quarter, advisory net revenue was up 17%, while debt and equity  underwriting net revenue was down 35% and 46%, respectively.  MS's wealth management business continues to generate good and stable earnings.   Net revenue in the wealth management segment was up 4% relative to the  sequential quarter but down modestly by 2% relative to the year ago quarter.   At the same time, the segment's pre-tax margin improved to 22.5%, up from 21% in  the sequential quarter.  A portion of this margin improvement was due to MS  holding the line on expenses, with the compensation and benefits as a percentage  of net revenues (comp ratio) in wealth management decline to 56% from 57% in  both the sequential and year-ago quarters. MS's investment management segment continues to perform satisfactorily despite  continuing to experience some modest overall net outflows from its fund  platform.  Nevertheless, the segment's pre-tax margin remains good at 20% in  2Q16. Fitch continues to note that MS's management is managing expenses carefully.   The company's overall pre-tax margin was 28%, up from 22% in the sequential  quarter, and unchanged from the year-ago quarter.  While this sequential  improvement was due to the better net revenue performance, MS also reduced its  compensation ratio to 45% and its non-compensation ratio to 27% in 2Q16, from  30% in the sequential quarter.    The company's strong capital and liquidity positions continue to support its  ratings in Fitch's opinion. MS's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1  (CET1) ratio under the advanced approaches improved to 15.8% in 2Q16 up from  14.5% in 1Q16, as MS continues to focus on reducing high density risk weighted  assets (RWA). MS's CET1 ratio is at the top end of peer group averages.  Given the company  received a conditional non-objection to its capital plan under the annual  Comprehensive Capital Analysis & Review (CCAR) in late June 2016, Fitch would  expect MS to begin returning more capital to shareholders.   Under the capital plan MS increased its dividend by $0.05 per quarter to $0.20  per quarter and plans to repurchase $3.5 billion of shares over the next four  quarters beginning in the 3Q16.  To address the conditional non-objection, MS  will be required to submit an additional capital plan by the end of 2016  addressing weaknesses identified in its capital planning processes. MS's 2Q16 fully phased-in Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio improved to 6.1%  in 2Q16, up from 6.0% in the sequential quarter. Liquidity was similarly strong with the company's Global Liquidity Reserve (GLR)  down just slightly to $207 billion, or 25% of total assets relative $211 billion  or 26% of total assets in the sequential quarter.  MS's deposit balances  seasonally declined to $153 billion in 2Q16, down from $158 billion in the  sequential quarter, but up from $139 billion in the year-ago quarter.

890,"   By Sujata Rao and Asli Kandemir | LONDON/ISTANBUL July 21  LONDON/ISTANBUL July 21 Turkey's botched coup and an apparent lurch towards authoritarianism is ratting investors and threatens to throw into reverse the hundreds of billions of dollars that have flowed to this once-booming emerging market.In the years after its 2001-2002 financial crisis, Turkey rode a wave of bullishness towards emerging markets, and while estimates vary, the Institute of International Finance reckons overseas investors poured more than $150 billion into Turkish stock and bond markets since end-2003.The IIF, one of the most authoritative trackers of capital to and from the developing world, also calculates bricks-and-mortar direct investment (FDI) into Turkish factories and property at $163 billion.Much of that success was down to game-changing reforms by President Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party from 2003. After sweeping privatisations, fiscal discipline and banking reforms, Turkey's old problems - military coups, soaring debt and crawling growth - seemed firmly consigned to history.Now, suddenly, they may be back.What's more, many are unnerved by the ferocity of Erdogan's response to the coup, with tens of thousands of soldiers, civil servants, judges and academics fired, arrested or suspended in the past week and a state of emergency imposed.There is concern also about economic growth collapsing and surging inflation, as the lira weakens against the dollar.The political shock will complicate Turkey's fragile balance of payments picture as its $30 billion-plus annual deficit requires a steady inflow of foreign money.""The risk of capital flight remains unless the measures adopted during the state of emergency are revealed clearly,"" said Ozlem Derici, chief economist at Deniz Invest in Istanbul.The issue is potentially serious because Turkey's funding gap is largely plugged with portfolio capital, dubbed ""hot money"" due to the speed at which it can move between markets. Derici said that Turkey's investment-grade credit rating, gained only in 2013, was in danger; its loss will drive capital outflows from conservative, rating-constrained funds while making it costlier for companies and banks to raise finance.Aviva and GAM were among foreign investment funds that used Monday's temporary bounce in the lira to cut back on Turkish holdings, while many banks, including Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Citi suggested reducing exposure.Others such as Standard Life, Ashmore and Lombard Odier told Reuters they made no changes because their Turkey holdings had already been below its weight in indexes.Patrick Mange, head of EM strategy at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, has been negative on Turkish assets and plans to leave them in ""the underweight box"" until there is more clarity.""Turkey's risk premium is on the rise and there could be repatriation of funds for some time,"" Mange said. ""When you speak of hot money you speak of something that's quite volatile and this is one of our worries."" HOLDING ON Turkish stocks, 64 percent of which are in foreign hands according to official data, had outperformed other emerging markets prior to Friday's putsch with dollar-based returns in excess of 15 percent.They have slumped now into the red as both the lira and blue-chip local equities have been whacked.But not everyone sees recent developments as unambiguously negative - asset managers Aberdeen, Baring and Berenberg said recent price falls could represent an opportunity to buy back newly cheap assets, given Turkey's longer-term potential. Turkey remains a preferred emerging equity market for UBS Wealth Management which says that share valuations are cheap compared to other emerging markets and already contain a price premium for the risks.That's reflected in equity risk premia - the excess returns stock market investments offer over government bonds - of 190 basis points, versus a long-term 120 bps average, UBS says.Many other funds will be cautious however, especially those which do not typically invest in emerging markets but have in recent years been lured into the sector by high bond yields.Such funds often require credits to be rated investment-grade by at least two big ratings agencies.For them, decisions by Fitch and Moody's agencies next month will be crucial, because a third, rival organisation, S&P Global, already rates Turkey as ""junk"".JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used emerging debt indexes, reckons a rating downgrade will force funds to dump around $10 billion worth of Turkish bonds. Over 10 percent of hard currency Turkish debt would be at risk of forced selling, it added.Of Turkey's $80 billion-plus lira-denominated bond market, 18.8 percent is in foreign hands, JPM said, and up to $1 billion of this is ratings-sensitive.But even funds with leeway to invest in junk-rated credits may take fright as their holdings are whacked by weakness in the lira.The lira is down 7 percent this week to around 3.07 per dollar but more weakness is likely ahead - some analysts predict the currency as low as 3.25 per dollar in coming months.(Reporting by Karin Strohecker, Marc Jones and Claire Milhench; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",2016-07-21,MS,"Thu Jul 21, 2016 | 11:42am EDT",AKP-era foreign investments jarred by post-coup Turkey crackdown,http://www.reuters.com//article/emerging-turkey-funds-idUSL8N1A74MY?type=companyNews

Earlier this year, Boston-based Advent had announced plans to sell the 50 percent stake it has in TCP, which can handle about 1.5 million tonnes of cargo containers annually. BTG Pactual (BBTG11.SA) joined Morgan Stanley as advisor to Advent at the start of July, the people said.The sources, who spoke with Reuters in recent days, asked for anonymity because the plan remained confidential.According to one of the people, Advent wants to fetch a price for the stake that values TCP around at least 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion.) The other person said other Advent partners in TCP, which include three Brazilian investment firms and Spanish companies Group Maritim TCB SL and Galigrain SA, could join the sale. The people declined to elaborate further on a timetable for the deal or name potential bidders. The second person said three Asian port operators, two of which are China-based, have shown preliminary interest in TCP.The transaction could also include a potential fundraising effort by TCP, possibly through the sale of notes in the domestic debt markets, the second person said. Advent paid about $500 million for the TCP stake five years ago.The TCP stake sale has failed to gain traction rapidly, as potential buyers monitor developments in Brazil, which is struggling with the harshest recession in eight decades and political turmoil, the people said.  Steelmaker Cia Siderúrgica Nacional SA's (CSNA3.SA) planned sale of container terminal operator Sepetiba Tecon SA has also been slow, even as a number of bidders - including Advent - have shown interest.TCP, Advent and the port operator's other shareholders declined to comment, as did BTG Pactual and Morgan Stanley.

916,"  (Repeats to broaden distribution)By Olivia OranNEW YORK, Sept 1 Over the past two years, a growing number of U.S. banks has capped their directors' earnings, but the ceilings are so high that they primarily serve to fend off potential shareholder litigation rather than control the pace of pay increases.Most of the caps are typically 2-3 times what directors now get paid, according to data and filings reviewed by Reuters.For instance, Morgan Stanley's quarterly financial statement last month noted a new $750,000 limit on annual compensation for independent directors. That is more than double the $350,000 median the bank now pays its directors.Morgan Stanley's board has permission to ""alter, amend or modify the plan at any time"", according to the bank's filing.Pay consultants and recruiters say banks need such flexibility because heightened regulatory burdens make positions on bank boards less attractive than in other sectors.Competitive pay can help lure qualified directors who otherwise would choose less time-consuming and highly scrutinized jobs, they say.""The time spent in these type of positions has grown, as has the risk and potential liability,"" said Rose Marie Orens, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.However, advocates of reforming executive pay - by linking it with performance and reducing incentives for risk-taking - argue the pay ceilings are so high they lack teeth.""It doesn't really change the landscape significantly other than insulate companies from lawsuits,"" said Yaron Nili, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who focuses on corporate governance. Overall, the median annual board compensation at the six biggest U.S. banks was $349,027 in 2015, nearly $80,000 more than the median director pay at S&P 500 companies overall, according to executive compensation data firm Equilar. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2bVXg3x)While regulators scrutinize executive pay at big banks, investors wield the stick when it comes to independent directors' earnings. Several shareholder lawsuits on the issue got banks' attention.In one important case, investors sued waste disposal company Republic Services Inc, accusing directors of paying themselves too much.

917,"   By Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Over the past two years, a growing number of U.S. banks has capped their directors' earnings, but the ceilings are so high that they primarily serve to fend off potential shareholder litigation rather than control the pace of pay increases.Most of the caps are typically 2-3 times what directors now get paid, according to data and filings reviewed by Reuters.For instance, Morgan Stanley's quarterly financial statement last month noted a new $750,000 limit on annual compensation for independent directors. That is more than double the $350,000 median the bank now pays its directors.Morgan Stanley's board has permission to ""alter, amend or modify the plan at any time"", according to the bank's filing.Pay consultants and recruiters say banks need such flexibility because heightened regulatory burdens make positions on bank boards less attractive than in other sectors.Competitive pay can help lure qualified directors who otherwise would choose less time-consuming and highly scrutinized jobs, they say.""The time spent in these type of positions has grown, as has the risk and potential liability,"" said Rose Marie Orens, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.However, advocates of reforming executive pay - by linking it with performance and reducing incentives for risk-taking - argue the pay ceilings are so high they lack teeth.""It doesn't really change the landscape significantly other than insulate companies from lawsuits,"" said Yaron Nili, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who focuses on corporate governance.Overall, the median annual board compensation at the six biggest U.S. banks was $349,027 in 2015, nearly $80,000 more than the median director pay at S&P 500 companies overall, according to executive compensation data firm Equilar.

923,"  Retailer Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) will close a further 64 Kmart stores in the United States, a source familiar with the matter said, in addition to the nearly 70 it announced earlier this year.Sears, which has posted a quarterly profit just once in the last four years, said in April it would close 68 Kmart discount stores and 10 Sears department stores to cut costs.Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has lost its standing as customers move to online shopping or rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).Sears had a total long term debt of $3.4 billion and cash balance of $276 million as of July 30, 2016. The company said later in May that it would explore options to expand its home-improvement service business and some of its best-known brands such as Kenmore appliances.Ratings agency Moody's investor service cut its rating on Sears' liquidity last week, saying Kmart's meaningful market share erosion has made it uncertain about its viability.  Business Insider first reported the closures on Monday citing local news reports and Kmart employees.The additional stores earmarked for closure will begin liquidation sales on Sept. 22 and close by mid-December, the financial news website reported.  Sears said it would provide an updated store count in their next quarterly filing.

924,"   By Patrick Rucker and Olivia Oran | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The Federal Reserve on Friday outlined a plan to limit Wall Street bets on the energy sector by forcing companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to hold more capital against such investments.Under current law, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) may invest in energy storage and transportation in ways that other banks cannot, but the U.S. central bank's new plan would make such bets more costly.Banks would have to hold more capital against energy and commodity investments under the plan. The Fed also contemplated other limits like banning Wall Street control of power plants and prohibiting bank holding companies from owning copper.At this stage the plan is only a proposal that is subject to comment and change. The Fed has opened a three-month window for comment.The Fed, which regulates the banking and financial services sector, said the new measures would help shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Under the plan, Fed officials said, banks would have to hold roughly $1 in capital for every $1 of energy infrastructure they owned.In the Fed’s calculus of bank safety, that amounts to a 1,250 percent capital charge - the regulator's highest tariff for the riskiest investments.Wall Street would have to offer roughly $4 billion in fresh capital to satisfy the proposal. SCALING BACK Firms on Wall Street have already been scaling back their ownership of refinery, shipping and storage facilities in the face of scrutiny from regulators who have asked what benefit comes from banks in the raw material market.Morgan Stanley has decreased the value of physical commodity assets on its balance sheet to $321 million in 2015 from $9.7 billion in 2011. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure, too, but the bank is still a major trader of fossil fuels.J. Aron, Goldman's commodities arm, traded more natural gas than both Chevron (CVX.N) and ExxonMobil (XOM.N) in the second quarter of this year, according to Natural Gas Intelligence, a trade publication.The energy trader moved 5.42 billion cubic feet of physical gas in the United States during the period, more than 73 percent of the volume it did during the same time in 2011, according to data.Morgan Stanley and Goldman declined to comment on the Fed's proposal. Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading for banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman accounted for as much as a fifth of their overall annual revenues.Although Goldman has scaled back its ownership of physical commodities, it has remained committed to trading.The bank during the second quarter of 2016 earned more from that business than any of its Wall Street peers, according to data provider Coalition.Tougher regulations conceived since the 2008 financial crisis, though, have push much of that trading business to specialists like Glencore Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group.(This version of the story has been refiled to delete extraneous text in seventh paragraph) (Reporting By Patrick Rucker in Washington and Olivia Oran in New York.

925,"   By Vikram Subhedar  Deutsche Bank could pay about $6 billion to settle charges related to its sale of toxic mortgage bonds before the financial crisis, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated in a note to clients.Germany's largest lender said about two weeks ago it would fight a $14 billion demand from the U.S. Department of Justice to settle claims it missold the securities. Talk of a smaller-than-expected fine bounced Deutsche Bank shares sharply off their lows on Friday to end the day up 6.4 percent. Its U.S. listing was up more than 12.6 percent. A $6 billion fine would keep Deutsche Bank's fully loaded common equity tier 1 ratio above 10.5 percent. Morgan Stanley suggested a settlement would be agreed before the U.S. presidential election.

926,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Morgan Stanley was charged with ""dishonest and unethical conduct"" by Massachusetts' top securities regulator on Monday for having pushed its brokers to sell loans to their clients.Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin alleges that the bank ran high-pressured sales contests in Massachusetts and Rhode Island where brokers could earn thousands of dollars for selling so-called ""securities based loans."" (SBLs)The contests, designed to boost business, were officially prohibited by Morgan Stanley but turned out to be lucrative for the bank with the pace of loan origination tripling and adding $24 million in new loan balances, Galvin said.The charges against Morgan Stanley come one month after Wells Fargo was fined for fraudulently opening accounts and illustrate how large banks are facing increasing scrutiny over their sales practices.Securities based loans let clients borrow against the value of their investment accounts but involve certain risks including the bank's ability to sell securities to repay the loan.Morgan Stanley said the complaint has no merit and that the company plans to defend itself vigorously. ""The securities-based loan accounts were opened only after discussing the product with each client and obtaining their affirmative consent,"" spokesman James Wiggins said in a statement. But Galvin charges that Morgan Stanley executives were slow in discovering the improper sales contests, failed to shut them down immediately, and downplayed the risk associated with the SBLs. ""This complaint lays bare the culture at Morgan Stanley that bred the high pressure effort to cross sell banking products to its brokerage customers without regard for the fiduciary duty owed to the investor,"" Galvin said in a statement.The practice of cross-selling – or getting customers to buy products and services from a range of business lines – is common across the banking industry. But the scandal involving Wells Fargo has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to set aggressive sales targets for employees, and whether customers really need all the products they are being offered. Thirty financial advisers working in five Morgan Stanley offices from Springfield, Massachusetts to Providence, Rhode Island joined in the contest that began in January, 2014, Galvin said.The incentives were: $1,000 for 10 loans, $3,000 for 20 loans, and $5,000 for 30 loans, Galvin said, adding that  performance was closely tracked by supervisors. Four years ago the bank shifted the way its advisers are paid, rewarding them for growing assets and loans. reut.rs/YSxe5hMorgan Stanley's internal rules prohibited such contests, Galvin said, adding it took the bank's compliance and risk office until December 2014 to detect the contest and that it was not stopped until April, 2015, Galvin said.

Shares in BP, Tullow Oil and Royal Dutch Shell rose 1.2 to 2.3 percent.Financial stocks were also in demand after Morgan Stanley's  results were boosted by a surge in bond trading.

941,"   (This October 19 story makes clear in paragraph 3 that Xu is head of Bank of China in New York)NEW YORK Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc are among those vying to be the designated U.S. bank clearing yuan trades in the United States alongside Bank of China Ltd (BoC), China's fourth-biggest bank by assets, a senior BoC executive said on Wednesday.Appointing banks to clear yuan CNY=CFXS trades is part of China's drive to encourage worldwide use of the currency, also known as the renminbi, which it hopes would some day supplement or rival the dollar as a global reserve currency.Unlike other countries where China is also trying to expand the yuan's reach, the United States will have two banks to clear renminbi trades, said Xu Chen, president and chief executive officer of BoC's (3988.HK) (601988.SS) New York office.This is in part because the advocacy group led by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that has championed wider usage of the yuan in the United States had asked China to allow a U.S. bank to clear renminbi trades in the country, Chen said.China usually designates just one Chinese bank to clear all yuan trades in each country outside its borders.Chen said Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citi (C.N) are both looking into submitting their respective bids to the Chinese central bank, the People's Bank of China. ""Based on our understanding, the (advocacy) group suggested to the People's Bank of China (PBOC) that it adopts the approach of appointing one Chinese bank and one U.S. bank,"" he said.The sheer volume of trade should help catapult the United States into the second-largest offshore yuan clearing centre after Hong Kong in three to five years, Chen said.BoC was only appointed last month as the designated bank to clear yuan transactions in United States, which can currently be cleared through Hong Kong, London or Singapore, the major renminbi clearing centers outside China.     To that end, BoC plans to expand its yuan trading desk in New York and sell renminbi hedging services in the city before year-end, Chen said.Morgan Stanley and Citi declined to comment. The PBOC was not immediately available for comment.Despite strong trade ties between China and the United States - the world's two largest economies - Beijing has been slow in making inroads to set up a yuan market in the United States compared with other countries.  Chinese and U.S. officials have said this is partly due to a desire by some within the U.S. government to protect the dollar's status as the world's pre-eminent currency.The United States was China's largest bilateral trade partner last year, with $558 billion worth of goods and services exchanged between the two countries, Chinese data showed.The advocacy group for the yuan, which counts ex-Securities and Exchange Commission chair Mary Schapiro and former U.S. Treasury secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson as its vice chair and co-chairs, includes JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) as its members.The yuan was the fifth-most-active currency for global payments in July, accounting for 1.9 percent of the market share, according to global transaction service provider SWIFT.

With overseas business extending its climb out of losses after a painful restructuring announced in April, Nomura said in a statement its July-September net profit climbed 31 percent from a year earlier to 61.2 billion yen ($586 million) despite a slump in its retail business as investors shunned stocks.Pretax profit at Nomura's wholesale division, which includes currency and bond trading, rocketed nearly fivefold from a year earlier to 39.3 billion yen. Volatility in foreign exchange rates in the wake of Britain's June 'Brexit' vote boosted demand for bonds and forex hedging products, even as domestic retail investors remained in a ""wait-and-see mode"", Nomura said.However, Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura said the domestic market was beginning to stabilise as uncertainty eases, boosted by the strong performance of Kyushu Railway Co's  listing this week - the world's third-biggest this year. ""We've started to see some brightness in the market,"" Kitamura said at a earnings briefing. ""We expect uncertainty to clear once events such as the (U.S.) election and (Federal Open Market Committee meeting) in November are finished.""Global investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have in recent weeks reported strong quarterly profit, helped by strong bond trading.Nomura's wholesale unit was also buoyed by fees from advising companies in a spate of domestic mergers and acquisitions, driven by restructuring in industries such as oil refining. But with retail investors remaining cautious from July to September, pretax profit in Nomura's retail arm tumbled by nearly two-thirds compared with a year earlier to 14.4 billion yen. Demand for both stocks and domestic bonds was depressed, Nomura said.Meanwhile Nomura's overseas business, which racked up 385 billion yen in losses over the last six years, continued to recover following the heavy cost cuts implemented early this year.The operations recorded a quarterly pretax profit of 23.2 billion yen, up from a loss of 45.8 billion yen a year earlier.All three of Nomura's three geographical areas were also in the black for the first time since October-December 2012, suggesting the brokerage is on course for now to restore its overseas business to annual profit by in the 12 months through March 2017.
