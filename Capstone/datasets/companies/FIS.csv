0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the ratings for  Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS) including its Issuer Default  Rating to 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings upgrade reflects the following considerations: FIS has furthered its commitment to maintaining a conservative balance sheet and  disciplined approach to capital allocation. The company is several years into  its current strategy of optimizing the business following an aggressive and  often debt-financed acquisition growth strategy. FIS' combination of organic  growth and cash-funded acquisitions lends to expectations for significantly  reduced volatility in its balance sheet and credit metrics going forward.  Underlying the ratings upgrade is the company's strong free cash flow and  relatively modest debt level. In the past this has led to higher event risk for  the credit. Fitch believes FIS now has a growing business need for a strong  investment grade rating as it supports the company's strategy to attract larger  bank clients. Fitch also believes the company's dividend policy, which was  raised 9% at the end of 2013, helps support the stock valuation and has led to a  reduction in event risk.  KEY RATING DRIVERS: Fitch expects the company to maintain leverage over the long-run at or below  2.5x and to fund share repurchases principally through organic cash generation.  Fitch estimates leverage (total debt / operating EBITDA) at 2.6x (or 2.8x when  adjusted for operating leases). Fitch would expect leverage to remain near 2.5x  given the current rating category with the potential for modest temporary  spikes. Alternatively, free cash flow before dividends would be expected to  remain near 15% of total adjusted debt (14% currently). FIS' ratings are supported by many qualitative factors which also drive  significant event risk. Specifically, FIS competes in a relatively stable market  with high barriers to entry, significant recurring revenue and long-term  contracts. The company's strong profitability (EBITDA margins of 28.5% in 2013)  and free cash flow generation are evidence of this position in the marketplace.  Fitch believes that a leveraged recap or leveraged buyout event remains the  biggest risk for the credit. However, Fitch believes a more conservative  approach to capital allocation from management and recent significant increase  in the dividend rate reduces the probability of such an event. While higher  dividends are not generally considered credit friendly, Fitch expects that this  should reduce the potential for activist shareholder pressure on FIS in the  future. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend 9% to $0.24 per share  ($0.96 per year or approximately $280 million in total). This represents a 1.8%  dividend yield based on the current stock price.  Rating strengths include the following: --Stable end demand; --Strong diversification, with increasing international diversification although  highly dependent on small- and mid-tier banks; --High customer switching costs. Rating concerns include: --History of debt financed M&A and shareholder friendly actions; --High fixed cost business; --Potential regulatory changes; --Increasing competition from non-traditional competitors such as IBM which has  greater resources. Liquidity as of Dec. 31, 2013 was solid with cash of $548 million and $2 billion  available under a $2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility,  expiring March 2017. Additionally, free cash flow has averaged near $600 million  annually over the past three years. Total debt as of Dec. 31, 2013 was $4.5 billion consisting principally of: --$29 million outstanding under the aforementioned senior unsecured revolving  credit facility;   --$2 billion outstanding under a senior unsecured term loan-A maturing March  2017; --$250 million in 2% senior unsecured notes due April 2018; --$500 million in 7.875% senior unsecured notes due July 2020; --$700 million in 5% senior unsecured notes due March 2022; and --$1 billion in 3.5% senior unsecured notes due April 2023. Fitch has upgraded the ratings for FIS as follows: --IDR to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured term loans to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include:  --Continued growth in the business driven by cross-selling of products and  services across the domestic customer base, which increases FIS' value to  customers, as well as growth in the international business which provides  further diversification.  --Commitments from management to maintain leverage at or below 2x with adjusted  free cash flow near 20% of total adjusted debt. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:  --More aggressive capital distribution to shareholders, particularly if these  actions are in response to changes in equity valuation. --Significant changes to the structure of the financial services sector which  could lead to the loss or consolidation of a significant portion of FIS'  customer base.

1,"  * Fidelity publicly criticises Barclays over bonus rise* Barclays has said it needs to raise bonuses to keep staff in US* European lawmakers to consider revamping EU bonus rule* British banks risk tougher regulation due to pay risesBy Steve Slater and Chris VellacottLONDON, March 11 Barclays faces a backlash from shareholders over its decision to raise bonuses despite a fall in profits, with investors increasingly demanding CEO Antony Jenkins give more money to them and less to his staff.British banks have failed to rein in pay despite a new EU cap, leading to a threat that politicians and regulators in both  Brussels and London might impose more curbs.Few have drawn as much criticism as Barclays, where profits fell by a third but staff have just won a 10 percent bigger bonus pot to share for last year than the year before.Jenkins said in a newspaper interview last week that he was forced to increase bonuses after an exodus from Barclays' investment bank in America left him fearing a ""death spiral"". But the excuse seems only to have annoyed shareholders who think he should have fought harder on their behalf.""The bonus issue is on a collision course with shareholders again. I have been unhappy with this for a long time,"" one of the bank's institutional shareholders told Reuters on Tuesday.""Shareholders have been long suffering, while employees sail on unscathed. They will trot out the same arguments again, about how if they don't pay up they will lose key staff. This is a bluff that has never yet been called,"" the shareholder added.In a rare public display of criticism, Fidelity, Barclays' 17th biggest shareholder, said it was ""disappointed"" the bank was not paying shareholders more.Chief investment officer Dominic Rossi said the bank had landed itself in a ""public relations mess"". Fidelity confirmed the comments, first reported by Sky News. Barclays is now paying three times more in bonuses to staff than in dividends to its owners, a fact that business leaders' group the Institute of Directors said should push shareholders to be more ""aggressive"".Once hailed as Saint Antony for his pledge to overhaul the hard-charging culture at Barclay's investment bank, Jenkins is instead on the defensive after raising the 2013 bonus pool to 2.4 billion pounds ($4 billion) despite the fall in profits.While investors do not have a vote on overall pay levels at banks, some told Reuters last week they could voice dissatisfaction at banks' failure to cut overall pay by voting down remuneration for executives. Shareholders in British companies have a binding vote on directors' pay.Barclays holds its annual general meeting on April 24.Barclays declined to comment on the criticism. Its shares dropped 2.4 percent to 236.1 pence on Tuesday after sagging as low as 233.6p, their lowest level since December 2012. The stock has fallen 15 percent since results on Feb. 11 amid concern that fixed income revenues have stayed weak across the industry, and Barclays is losing share to U.S. rivals.Bumper bonuses have been widely blamed for encouraging the risk-taking that contributed to the 2007-09 financial crisis, which saw taxpayers bail out lenders with billions of pounds and euros of public money. But efforts to rein them in have failed, with almost half of Britain's bankers and other financial service professionals set to get a higher bonus for 2013 than they did in 2012 and the average payout rising by nearly a third, a survey showed.STIFFER REGULATIONS? Barclays has often been a lightning rod for pay issues in Britain as it has the largest investment bank and the highest pay scales among UK lenders. But this year other lenders have also irked regulators and politicians.Banks in Britain have led the way in raising fixed pay in response to new European rules that cap banker bonuses. The banks say they have no choice but to raise other forms of pay or lose top talent to U.S. rivals that have no bonus caps.Britain's HSBC has said it will use ""allowances"", paid monthly or quarterly to raise fixed pay.

4,"  * Schroders urges AstraZeneca to restart talks with Pfizer* Many investors frustrated at breakdown of takeover talks* But Fidelity says Pfizer was not ""a suitable partner""   (Adds Astra comment, share prices)By Chris VellacottLONDON, May 20 Some leading AstraZeneca Plc shareholders were at odds over whether the British drugmaker made the right decision in rejecting Pfizer Inc's final $118 billion bid to buy the company.Schroder Investment Management Ltd, AstraZeneca's  12th-biggest shareholder, urged the drugmaker on Tuesday to restart takeover talks with Pfizer while Fidelity Worldwide Investment (UK) Ltd, holder of the 18th largest stake in Astra, backed the British company's stance.The division highlighted a split among investors following the collapse of a potential transaction, leaving many shareholders frustrated at missing out on a big windfall.Schroders said it was disappointed with ""the quick rejection by the AstraZeneca board"" of an improved 55 pounds-a-share offer and the decision by Pfizer to ""draw a premature end to these negotiations by calling their latest proposal final."" ""Given the increase in the offer we would encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer, and subsequently their shareholders,"" the fund manager, which owns 2 percent of AstraZeneca, said.Schroders' comments echoed those of other shareholders, including Jupiter Asset Management Ltd, which were dismayed at AstraZeneca's rejection of Pfizer's offer on Monday.Astra said that under UK takeover rules, there could be no further talks with Pfizer and that the U.S. drugmaker could not privately or publicly even suggest it was willing to raise its ""final"" rejected bid prior to a May 26 deadline unless a third party made a higher offer. ""This restriction that prevents further negotiation on value is a consequence of Pfizer's actions,"" AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement.Pfizer declined to comment on the AstraZeneca statement. The largest U.S. drugmaker had previously said it was now up to Astra shareholders to urge the board to reconsider Pfizer's final offer.The deal would have created the world's biggest drugs group. Instead, AstraZeneca's rejection triggered the biggest intra-day slump in its shares since the creation of the company through a merger of British and Swedish businesses in 1999.The anger, however, was not universal. ""I think Astra did the right thing. I don't think that Pfizer was a suitable partner,"" said Dominic Rossi, London-based Fidelity's global chief investment officer for equities, arguing the deal was motivated by Pfizer's desire to cut taxes.""The Astra board has taken a very difficult decision. They understood in rejecting the offer they would be criticised by some shareholders. We will now have to wait two to three years to see whether they were right. With a little luck they could well be."" Fidelity owns 1.2 percent of AstraZeneca, according to Thomson Reuters data.Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management which holds 2.4 percent of the British drugmaker, also said Pfizer's offer ""certainly wasn't a knock-out.""Veteran fund manager Neil Woodford, who controls AstraZeneca shares in funds he runs for wealth manager St James's Place , said he was ""relieved that AstraZeneca appears to have retained its independence.""Strict British takeover rules mean the angry stalemate between AstraZeneca and Pfizer is almost certain to end with no deal, unless AstraZeneca's board did a U-turn and recommended Pfizer's final offer.AstraZeneca shares ended 0.5 percent higher in London, while their shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.7 percent shortly before the close of trading. Pfizer shares were flat at $29.28, also on the NYSE.

8,"  Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), founded by Elon Musk, said it has raised about $1 billion in a financing round with two new investors, Google Inc and Fidelity.Google and Fidelity will collectively own just under 10 percent of SpaceX, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. SpaceX said the funding will help it continue research in space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing.Google and Fidelity join existing investors Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. Google has already a presence in the aerospace sector following a few high-profile acquisitions last year, including that of satellite company, Skybox Imaging for $500 million in June.

The offer represented a 21.3 percent premium to the stock's Thursday close.Shares in Colt, which runs fibre optic networks and data centres for companies, jumped as much as 23 percent to 192.91 pence on Friday morning, above Fidelity's offer. But they were later trading at 190 pence. A third party could potentially pay much more for Colt, the independent directors said. But a deal would not go through unless Fidelity changes its plan to hold on to its stake through next year.Fidelity, one of the founding investors of Colt, said it would not increase its offer. The firm held 62.4 percent of Colt.The offer has been accepted by Standard Life Investments and Ruffer LLP, who together held about 7.8 percent of Colt, Fidelity said.""We have accepted Fidelity's ... offer as being the best available option in the circumstances,"" a spokeswoman for Standard Life Investments said. Other top shareholders where either unavailable to comment or declined comment.""I would consider (the offer) redemption for long suffering Colt shareholders."" Andrew Darley of brokerage finnCap told Reuters.Colt shares, Friday's top percentage gainer on London's FTSE-250 Midcap index, have fallen about 11 percent since listing in 2006. Reduction in call rates have hit the company's voice services business, which bring in nearly a third of its revenue.

21,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK, Sept 14  NEW YORK, Sept 14 This fall, Boston-based fund giant Fidelity plans to celebrate the 25-year tenure of William Danoff, head of the biggest fund run by a single manager in the U.S. and arguably the best-performing large cap manager of his time.At a time when investors have been shifting tens of billions of dollars from active management to passively-managed funds, Danoff is one of the few mutual fund managers whose quarterly disclosures can move market prices. His Contrafund, with $106.3 billion in assets under management, is a mainstay of retirement savings plans nationwide.Yet some financial advisors and fund analysts say they are concerned that Fidelity has yet to name a co-manager for Contrafund, setting up the risk that investors will flee and remaining shareholders will suffer should Danoff, 55, retire or otherwise leave the fund suddenly.""There is a key man risk with Contrafund,"" said Katie Rushkewicz Reichart, an analyst at Morningstar who covers the fund. ""Not only has Danoff done quite well but he's managing such a large sum of money that it's not a role that another person could easily step into.""Those concerns are an echo of last September, when Bill Gross, who often referred to himself as the king of bonds, abruptly left Pimco and his management of the Total Return fund. To be sure, Gross had his worst performance in nearly two decades in the year before he left Pimco, and the fund had seen 16 straight months of outflows leading up to his departure. After his departure, Total Return suffered $18 billion in outflows in the first month alone, and another $107 billion between October 2014 and August 2015, according to Lipper data.Should Danoff leave, a sizeable rush to redeem shares could force Contrafund to unload some of its positions in companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Walt Disney  in which it is one of the largest shareholders, analysts said. Retirement plans, meanwhile, may be forced to remove the fund from among its investment options because the fund would no longer have the same management team in place for at least three years.Most advisors and institutional investors require at least a three-year track record with current management before investing, and the slate is wiped clean if the principal manager leaves without having three years or more with a co-manager, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. Fidelity did not make Danoff available for this article, but said concerns about succession planning are overblown.""Will is not going anywhere,"" said Brian Hogan, the head of Fidelity's equity division. ""I can say that with a lot of confidence. I talk to Will almost every day in person, on phone, or email. He's tremendously engaged and he's the investment leader, a real workhorse in the department.""When asked what would happen if Danoff was somehow incapacitated, Hogan said, ""We have a tremendously deep bench of portfolio managers who may not be household names yet but probably will be.""The problem is unique to Fidelity: the next-largest stock fund run by a single manager, the T Rowe Price Growth Stock fund, run by Joseph Fath, is at $44.1 billion under assets, while the third largest is another Fidelity product, the Fidelity Growth Company fund, at $39.2 billion, run by Steven Wymer. 'ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR' Since he took over Contrafund in September of 1990, Danoff has posted an average annualized gain of 13.3 percent, the best performance of any large cap growth fund over the same time, according to Lipper data. The benchmark S&P 500 posted a 10 percent annualized gain over the same time, while the average actively managed large cap fund returned an annualized 9.4 percent.Someone who invested $10,000 in Contrafund in September 1990 would now have $213,719, more than double the $103,058 gain from investing in the S&P 500. The average large cap fund, meanwhile, would have returned $95,586 from the same investment. That performance is one reason why Fidelity emphasizes the chance to work with him to potential recruits, and why he leads a meeting each year with all of the firm's analysts that is said to be standing room only. Known to carry around a spiral notebook with handwritten notes on stocks, Danoff meets with hundreds of companies a year, and has easy access to management at companies who are keen to receive his endorsement.Danoff, who joined Fidelity in 1986 as an analyst, has a degree in history from Harvard and an MBA from Wharton. He's known to walk around with a bulging file folder and messy hair, a marked contrast from some of the slickly-groomed fund managers who often show up on television.""I love Will Danoff, he's like the absent-minded professor and he has encyclopedia knowledge of stocks,"" said David Caruso, managing director of Danvers, Massachusetts Coastal Capital Group who oversees approximately $800 million in client assets. ""If he were to leave I would have to think very hard about leaving my assets there.""Fidelity named John Roth as co-manager of another fund that Danoff had run by himself, the $27 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights fund, in 2013. The move was interpreted by many fund analysts as a sign that Roth will eventually become Danoff's successor at Contrafund.Ford Motor Company announced last month it would drop Contrafund from its fund lineup, pulling $900 million from the fund. The company attributed the decision as part of a plan to ""best suit the needs of our employees,"" while retirement plan analysts said Ford has been removing funds run by stockpickers.Unlike competitor T.

22,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Fidelity National Information Systems, Inc.'s (FIS) offering of senior unsecured  notes. The Rating Outlook remains Negative. At June 30, 2015, the company had  $5.043 billion in total debt outstanding. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to fund a portion of FIS's  pending acquisition of SunGard, the ultimate parent of SunGard Data Systems,  Inc. (SunGard), for $9.1 billion, including SunGard's debt (not rated by Fitch).  FIS plans to fund the $5.1 billion equity component with a mix of 55% equity and  45% cash. The proceeds, along with cash on hand, a new $1.5 billion senior  unsecured term loan, and FIS's existing revolving credit facility are expected  to be used to fund the cash component of the transaction, repay SunGard's bank  facility, and pay related fees and expenses. Fitch anticipates that to the  extent there are proceeds from the current offering in excess of overall  liquidity needs, FIS will use them to redeem some or all of the SunGard notes  outstanding, including the related call premiums.  KEY RATING DRIVERS -- Fitch believes the transaction is strategically positive in the long term but  that the initial leverage and the timeline for FIS to reduce leverage to under  3x (Fitch estimates around mid-2017 assuming a fourth-quarter 2015 close)  warrants a Negative Outlook.  -- The SunGard transaction provides FIS with a strong entry into adjacent  markets (serving financial institutions). From a product-set basis there is  minimal overlap, although the two companies serve and/or target many of the same  institutions. SunGard's overlap is principally with FIS's Global Financial  Solutions sector, which serves large, global financial institutions. --Highly Stable Market Demand: FIS's customer base in the Integrated Financial  Solutions (IFS) segment - mid-tier U.S. banks - are highly reliant on the  company for their internal operations. Customer engagements are typically  secured by long-term contracts and renewal rates are very high. A majority of  revenue is contract-based (88% recurring revenue) or account volume-based with a  minority amount exposed to cyclical changes in consumer spending. As a result,  revenue, margins and cash flow tend to be highly predictable. EBITDA margins are  relatively strong, given standard solutions are supplied to many customers. --Faster Growth in GFS: FIS's Global Financial Solutions (GFS) segment is  expected to produce revenue growth in the high-single- to low-double digits.  Recurring revenues are lower than in IFS but still relatively high at about 70%  of revenues. In this segment, solutions for the large global financial  institutions are generally customized, and its EBITDA margins reflect the more  personnel-intensive nature of its business. --Commitment to Investment Grade Ratings: Management has reconfirmed its  commitment to having a solid investment grade rating and maintaining reasonably  conservative credit metrics. Fitch believes management is committed to reducing  leverage to 2.5x or lower over the long-run following the acquisition of  SunGard. Fitch believes the company's increasing focus on growing its business  with large Tier 1 banks creates a business need for a solid investment grade  rating. --Moderated Event Risk: The acquisition of SunGard and the expected continuation  of the company's existing dividend policy may reduce near-term event risk. The  potential for event risk stems from the stable and solid free cash flow inherent  in the business. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects pro forma revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits; --EBITDA margins, following the close of the transaction, are expected to be  just over 30% and to expand slightly in the following years; --Fitch expects the full run-rate of synergies of $200 million annually to be  reached in 2017; --Near-term expected cash flows incorporate certain upfront expenses to achieve  synergies; --Fitch does not expect FIS to engage in stock buybacks and will focus on  reducing debt until it approaches its target range. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Continued growth in the business driven by cross-selling of products  and services across the domestic customer base, which increases FIS's value to  customers, as well as growth in the international business which provides  further diversification. Commitments from management to maintain leverage at or  below 2.25x. Negative: More aggressive capital distribution to shareholders, particularly if  these actions are in response to changes in equity valuation. Significant  changes to the structure of the financial services sector which could lead to  the loss or consolidation of a significant portion of FIS's customer base.  Leverage above 3.0x for a sustained period would be a potential cause for a  negative rating action. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Liquidity as of June 30, 2015 was solid with cash of $446 million ($239 million  held outside the U.S.) and approximately $2.2 billion available under a $3  billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring December 2019.  Additionally, free cash flow (after dividends) has been more than $450 million  annually over the past three years.

""The deal is too small for anti-trust issues, but there could be regulatory hurdles as the deal will have to be cleared by a number of state regulators in the U.S.,"" Sandler O'Neill analyst Paul Newsome told Reuters.""There has been a broad trend of consolidation within the insurance space. It could accelerate this year,"" he added.Anbang and other Chinese insurers including Fosun International Ltd have launched some $6.1 billion of overseas deals this year as they seek to diversify. Beijing-based Anbang acquired New York's famed Waldorf Astoria Hotel earlier this year from Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc for $1.95 billion.In July, White Mountains Insurance agreed to sell its property and casualty reinsurer Sirius International Insurance Group Ltd to a unit of China Minsheng Investment Corp Ltd for about $2.24 billion.Fosun completed in May the acquisition of the remaining 80 percent interest that it did not already own in Ironshore Inc for $1.84 billion.Jefferies & Co and Credit Suisse were financial advisers to Fidelity & Guaranty, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was legal adviser.Anbang was advised by Evercore ISI and Debevoise & Plimpton, while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP was legal adviser.

25,"   By Liana B. Baker  Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS) (FIS.N) is seeking to sell SunGard Data Systems Inc's business that serves the public sector and education markets, hoping to fetch more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The sale process follows FIS' acquisition of payment processing peer SunGard from buyout firms in November for $9.1 billion, including debt. It illustrates its desire to focus on areas of core competence, such as retail and enterprise banking, payments, capital markets, wealth management and insurance. FIS is working with investment bankers on an auction of the public sector and education division, which may attract the interest of other companies in the sector and private equity firms, the people said this week.The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential.

30,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, August 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the National Long-Term  Ratings of Investec Limited (IL), Investec Bank Limited (IBL) and RCS Investment  Holdings Limited (RCS). Fitch has also affirmed the National Long-Term Rating of  Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action  commentary. The rating actions follow Fitch's downgrade of South Africa's Long-Term Local  Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BBB' as a result of  which it is now equalised with South Africa's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR.  This was driven by the change in Fitch's sovereign rating criteria (for more  details see 'Fitch Applies Criteria Changes to Global Sovereign Ratings' dated  22 July 2016 at www.fitchratings.com). The National Long-Term Ratings of IL and IBL have been upgraded to 'AA(zaf)'  from 'AA-(zaf)' following the recalibration of the South Africa National Rating  scale due to the sovereign's LTLC downgrade. This reflects our view that the  bank's business model may be resilient in a downturn on a relative basis to  other banks and its creditworthiness is in line with other large domestic banks.  Following the upgrade of IBL's National Rating, its Basel 3-compliant  subordinated debt has been upgraded to 'AA-(zaf)' from 'A+(zaf)'. RCS's National Long-Term Rating, which is driven by potential support from the  ultimate parent, BNP Paribas (BNPP; A+/Stable), and from BNP Paribas Personal  Finance, has been upgraded to 'AAA(zaf)' from 'AA(zaf)' following the  recalibration of the South Africa National Rating scale. The ratings on RCS's  domestic medium term note (DMTN) programme and notes have also been upgraded to  'AAA(zaf)' from 'AA(zaf)'. DBSA's National Long-term Rating has been affirmed at 'AA+(zaf)' as it  creditworthiness relative to the best credit in the country has not changed  following the downgrade of the sovereign LTLC IDR and the recalibration of South  Africa's National Rating scale. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs (IL, IBL, RCS), SENIOR DEBT (RCS) AND NATIONAL RATINGS IBL's and IL's IDRs are driven by their standalone creditworthiness and are  capped by the South African sovereign Long-Term IDRs of 'BBB-', because of their  strong links with South Africa. Their National Ratings reflect their  creditworthiness relative to the best credit in the country. The National Ratings of DBSA reflect the high probability of support it would  receive from the South African authorities, if required, as a state-owned  development finance institution, incorporated by Acts of Parliament. On the  National scale DBSA's Long-Term rating of 'AA+(zaf)' reflects lower perceived  creditworthiness relative to the sovereign. The IDRs and National Ratings of RCS reflect a high probability of support  available from its ultimate parent, BNP Paribas, and from BNP Paribas Personal  Finance, if required. RCS's IDRs are notched down four times from BNPP's 'A+'  IDR.  The notching takes into account the increasing operational integration of RCS  into BNPP's sizeable personal finance division and our expectation that BNPP  will remain a majority owner of RCS (currently at 100%) in the medium term. In  addition, the ratings factor in sizeable undrawn funding and liquidity  facilities in place with the parent. However, the ratings also reflect RCS's  small size in terms of assets and earnings compared with BNPP and that RCS is  based in a different jurisdiction and a market that we do not view as core for  BNPP.  RCS's domestic medium term note (DMTN) programme and notes are rated in line  with RCS's National Ratings, reflecting our view that non-payment of these  senior unsecured obligations would reflect the uncured failure of the entity in  accordance with Fitch's rating definitions. SUBORDINATED DEBT (IBL) The instrument is notched once from IBL's National Long-Term Rating, reflecting  the greater loss severity of subordinated obligations than senior unsecured  obligations. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs (IL, IBL, RCS), SENIOR DEBT (RCS) AND NATIONAL RATINGS The IDRs of IL and IBL could be upgraded if the operating environment improves,  as reflected by an upgrade of the sovereign rating. Their IDRs and National  Ratings are sensitive to weaker financial metrics, particularly signs of higher  risk appetite or deterioration of asset quality or capital. The IDRs of IBL and IL and the senior debt ratings of IBL would be downgraded by  one notch if South Africa is downgraded by one notch. DBSA's National Ratings would be sensitive to a change in Fitch's perception of  the South African authorities' willingness to support, if required. This could  include public statements of a decrease in willingness to support or potentially  an increase in willingness to support including explicit, formalised support  such as guarantees or callable capital facilities.  RCS's IDRs and National Ratings are sensitive to a reduction in the perceived  ability or willingness of BNP to provide support to RCS. RCS's IDRs are also  sensitive to a downward revision of South Africa's Country Ceiling. RCS's DMTN and senior debt ratings are primarily sensitive to a change in RCS's  National Ratings. SUBORDINATED DEBT (IBL) IBL's subordinated debt ratings are primarily sensitive to a change in the  bank's National Long-Term Rating (the anchor rating for domestic subordinated  debt issuance).  The rating actions are as follows:  Investec Limited Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR unaffected at 'BBB-'; Stable Outlook Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR unaffected at 'F3' Long-Term Local Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable National Long-Term Rating upgraded to 'AA(zaf)' from 'AA-(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)' Viability Rating unaffected at 'bbb-' Support Rating unaffected at '5' Support Rating Floor unaffected at 'No Floor' Investec Bank Limited Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR unaffected at 'BBB-'; Stable Outlook Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR unaffected at 'F3' Long-Term Local Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable National Long-Term Rating upgraded to 'AA(zaf)' from 'AA-(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)' Viability Rating unaffected at 'bbb-' Support Rating unaffected at '3' Support Rating Floor unaffected at 'BB-' Senior unsecured debt unaffected at 'BBB-'/F3 Basel 3-compliant Tier 2 subordinated debt: upgraded to 'AA-(zaf)' from  'A+(zaf)' Development Bank of Southern Africa National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA+(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)' Support Rating unaffected at '2' RCS Investment Holdings Limited Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR unaffected at 'BBB'; Stable Outlook Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR unaffected at 'F2' Long-Term Local Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable National Long-Term Rating upgraded to 'AAA(zaf)' from 'AA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)' Support Rating unaffected at '2' DMTN programme's National Long-term rating: upgraded to 'AAA(zaf)' from  'AA(zaf)' National Short-Term Rating: affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)' Senior unsecured debt's National long-term rating: upgraded to 'AAA(zaf)' from  'AA(zaf)' Contact:  Primary Analyst (IL, IBL and DBSA) Mahin Dissanayake Director +44 203 530 1618 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Primary Analyst (RCS) Christian Kuendig  Senior Director +44 203 530 1399 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst (IL, IBL and RCS) Andrew Parkinson  Director +44 203 530 1420 Secondary Analyst (DBSA) Joao Correira de Matos Analyst +44 203 530 1723 Committee Chairperson  Eric Dupont Senior Director +33 1 4429 91 31 Media Relations: Elaine Bailey, London, Tel: +44 203 530 1153, Email:  elaine.bailey@fitchratings.com.

31,"   By Mike Stone  Fidelity National Information Services Inc's stock could climb up to 25 percent in the coming year as the U.S. financial services technology company grows its business and pays down debt, the weekly business newspaper Barron's reported.The business has grown following the Jacksonville, Florida-based company's $5.1 billion acquisition of competitor SunGuard last year but labored under an increased debt burden, the business weekly said.  The newspaper said if Fidelity National followed through with its trend of debt repayment, it could shed $1.2 billion of its $11 billion plus debt load by the end of 2017 and lift shares. Fidelity National had a market capitalization of $25.9 billion as of the end of trading on Friday. Founded in 1968 as Systematics, Fidelity National provides  financial technology services to facilitate payment processing and banking solutions. The company has more than 20,000 clients over 130 countries in a range of industries including banks, asset managers, traders, custodians, treasurers, third-party administrators and clearing agents according to its website.

35,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Fidelity National  Information Systems' (FIS) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior  unsecured ratings at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook remains Negative. As of June 30,  2016, the company reported $11.2 billion of total debt outstanding. A complete  list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.  The Negative Rating Outlook reflects FIS' elevated leverage following the close  of the SunGard acquisition and slower than expected deleveraging progress. Fitch  calculates pro forma total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) for the  SunGard acquisition and August debt issuance to be 4.0x, as of June 30, 2016,  which is outside the expectations for the current rating. Fitch expects leverage  to decline below our 3.0x sensitivity over the next 12 to 18 months.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Market Demand: Fitch believes FIS' mission critical products, recurring  revenue and financial institution outsourcing trends offer stable market demand  and visibility into future revenues and cash flow. Customer engagements are  typically secured by long-term contracts (five years on core products) and high  renewal rates (>90%). Fitch estimates FIS' recurring revenue for the combined  company to be 79% and only 3% of revenue is tied to trading volume.   Outsourcing Trends: Fitch believes financial institutions will continue  outsourcing functions to keep pace with competitors and to focus on core  competencies. Regional banks are facing the most pressure as they try to keep  pace with the big banks and are falling behind community banks that have already  made the decision to outsource. Fitch also believes FIS' complete bank solution  is a competitive advantage as customers outsource additional functions and  consolidate vendors.  Commitment to Investment Grade Ratings: Management has reconfirmed its  commitment to having a solid investment grade rating and maintaining reasonably  conservative credit metrics. FIS is committed to reducing leverage to 2.5x or  below over the long-run following the acquisition of SunGard. As bank regulators  focus on safety and soundness of banks, Fitch believes vendors with investment  grade ratings could have an advantage given the mission critical nature of  certain applications.  Scalable Business: Fitch believes FIS' strong EBITDA margins are supported by  the operating leverage in the business and will expand over the intermediate  term. Integrated Financial Solutions (IFS) EBITDA margins are approximately 39%  and Fitch expects modest expansion as FIS' core bank processing software is  offered through a hosted model. The hosted software is pushed to thousands of  customers, generating higher EBITDA margins as incremental customers are added.  However, pricing pressure is expected to partially offset margin improvement as  core processing is very competitive in the U.S. EBITDA margins for Global  Financial Solutions (GFS) are approximately 27% and are expected to expand as  85% of revenue is tied to intellectual property, providing economies of scale as  the business grows.  Leverage: Fitch estimates pro forma total leverage (total debt to operating  EBITDA) for the SunGard acquisition and August debt issuance to be 4.0x, as of  June 30, 2016. Leverage is currently elevated for the rating category, Fitch  expects FIS to get below our 3x leverage rating sensitivity in the next 12 to 18  months. The company has decreased leverage, pro forma for the SunGard  acquisition, from 4.3x as of the year-ended Dec. 31, 2015 by reducing debt and  EBTIDA growth.  End Market Concentration: FIS' customers are primarily financial institutions,  exposing the company to industry cyclicality and consolidation. Fitch believes  that industry consolidation is FIS' primary risk, but cyclicality could result  from customer's exposure to interest rates.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Fitch expects organic revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits; --EBITDA margins in the low 30's and expanding over the rating horizon from  synergies and operating leverage; --Fitch expects the full run-rate of synergies of $200 million annually to be  reached in 2017; --Near-term expected cash flows incorporate certain upfront expenses to achieve  synergies; --Fitch does not expect large acquisitions in the near term but does expect  bolt-on acquisitions over the rating horizon; --Fitch does not expect FIS to engage in stock buybacks and will focus on  reducing debt until it approaches its target range. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Sensitivity: Continued growth in the business driven by cross-selling  of products and services across the domestic customer base, which increases FIS'  value to customers, as well as growth in the international business which  provides further diversification. Commitments from management to maintain  leverage at or below 2.2x to 2.3x. Negative Sensitivity: A change in financial policy leading to more aggressive  capital distribution to shareholders or leverage targets. Significant changes to  the structure of the financial services sector which could lead to the loss or  consolidation of a significant portion of FIS' customer base. Leverage above  3.0x for a sustained period would be a potential cause for a negative rating  action. LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: Pro forma for the August debt issuance, liquidity as of June  30, 2016 was solid with cash of approximately $1 billion ($500 million held  outside the U.S.) and $3 billion available under the senior unsecured revolving  credit facility, expiring August 2021. Additionally, free cash flow (FCF; after  dividends) has been more than $400 million annually over the past three years  and Fitch expects FCF to exceed $1 billion over the rating horizon. Total debt as of June 30, 2016 is $11.2 billion and has not materially changed  from the August financing activities. Total debt consists of: --$3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility due 2021; --$1.5 billion senior unsecured term loan due 2018; --$300 million 1.45% senior unsecured notes due 2017; --$250 million 2.00% senior unsecured notes due 2018; --$750 million 2.85% senior unsecured notes due 2018; --$1.75 billion 3.625% senior unsecured notes due 2020; --$750 million 2.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021; --$700 million 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2022; --$500 million 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2022; --$1 billion 3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2023; --$700 million 3.875% senior unsecured notes due 2024; --$1.5 billion 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025; --$1.25 billion 3.00% senior unsecured notes due 2026; --$500 million 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2046.
