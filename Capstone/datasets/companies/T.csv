0,"  MEXICO CITY Jan 2 Mexican businessman and board member of U.S. phone giant AT&T Jaime Chico Pardo has accumulated a $20 million stake in billionaire Carlos Slim's America Movil phone company, according to a recent regulatory filing.The 285.4 million peso ($21.79 million) purchase occurred  around the same time as AT&T sold 250 million shares in America Movil , according to the filing from the end of December. Chico Pardo's purchase, which is equivalent to less than 0.1 percent of America Movil, was made with personal funds and as compensation from his employer, the filing said. The businessman, who heads an energy and healthcare fund, was previously a board member of several Slim companies. In its third quarter report, AT&T said it had a 9.1 percent  stake in America Movil.",2014-01-02,T,"Thu Jan 2, 2014 | 10:01am EST",Mexican AT&T board member buys $20 mln stake in America Movil,http://www.reuters.com//article/americamovil-shareholder-idUSL2N0KC0GL20140102?type=companyNews
1,"   By Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc on Friday offered customers of No.4 U.S. mobile provider T-Mobile U.S. Inc a $200 credit to switch to its service, firing the first volley this year in what may become a price war that benefits consumers but plays havoc with profits across the industry.AT&T, the No.2 U.S. mobile provider, announced the promotion after months of direct marketing against it by T-Mobile, and in anticipation of a new offer from its smaller rival on January 8.The news depressed shares in T-Mobile and Sprint Corp - which have been rallying in recent weeks on optimism about potential consolidation - and to a lesser extent industry leader Verizon Communications.The move could kick off a year of discounts from U.S. wireless operators, who are increasingly dependent on price to compete because they all offer similar phones and any network advantages are hard to prove, according to analysts.MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett described AT&T's move as the ""early makings of a price war"" that would boost customer switching, also known as churn, and in turn hurt profits.""Everybody's fighting for market share because there simply isn't an organic market share left to be had,"" Moffett said. ""The natural upshot to any strategy that pays customers to change service is higher churn.""Analysts also worry that No. 3 U.S. rival Sprint, which has been losing customers for years, will unveil dramatic promotions in 2014 as its new 80 percent owner, SoftBank Corp, is expected to push Sprint to regain lost ground.TOOTH AND NAIL AT&T's move may also bolster U.S. regulators' conviction that the industry is healthier with four national rivals, making it difficult for SoftBank to realize its reported ambitions to merge Sprint with T-Mobile, analysts said. After failing to sell itself to AT&T in 2011 because of regulatory opposition, T-Mobile has been fighting tooth and nail with its one-time suitor. It halted four years of subscriber losses by criticizing its rivals and selling itself as more consumer-friendly with lower prices and more flexibility.T-Mobile, which is 67 percent owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG, posted two quarters of subscriber growth as a result of the promotions, and trumped rivals AT&T, Verizon Wireless and Sprint in phone customer growth.In early December, AT&T cut service fees for customers who pay for their phones in installments due to pressure from T-Mobile, the first operator to offer this option.AT&T is seen as the most vulnerable to T-Mobile's attacks because both companies use the same network technology, making it easier for their consumers to switch.While analysts had expected Verizon Wireless and AT&T to shy away from any aggressive responses to T-Mobile, Credit Suisse analyst Joseph Mastrogiovanni said in a research note they now appeared to be under more pressure to discount. ""While the carriers try to remain rational while tweaking their plans and promotions, there is no doubt that they feel the need to get more competitive,"" Mastrogiovanni said. He estimated AT&T's latest move could cut its earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent depending on T-Mobile's response.Citi analyst Michael Rollins said T-Mobile's next move could also prompt responses from Verizon Wireless as well as Sprint.T-Mobile's outspoken Chief Executive, John Legere, has been building up anticipation for a new offer his company will unveil at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week.In a New Year's Day tweet, he listed winning over family plan customers as a major goal for 2014, prompting speculation that he will announce discounts aimed at families at CES. Many analysts say that to maintain its momentum it is crucial for T-Mobile to lure entire families from AT&T, which says the vast majority of its customers are in family plans.Legere teased AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson after Friday's news, questioning whether he thinks AT&T can really buy back customers who had moved to T-Mobile.He also described the offer as a ""desperate move by AT&T on the heels of what must have been a terrible Q4"" and said, ""I'm flattered that we have made them so uncomfortable!Analysts also speculated that T-Mobile's January offer may involve issuing credits covering early contract-termination fees for customers switching from AT&T contracts .This may have led AT&T make the $200 offer per line for a limited-time, to T-Mobile customers who switch to AT&T, starting on January 3. The per-line credit would be on top of another credit of up to $250 for customers who trade in their smartphone. While trade-in values vary based on the phones traded, AT&T said that many of the latest phones will qualify for the $250 credit.Independent telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan said the news was a sign of a ""real boxing match"" between AT&T and T-Mobile.

4,"   By Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc plans to give cash-strapped consumers options to save money on mobile data fees as soon as this quarter while offering sponsors a new way to entice consumers to use their services.The company said it will announce details on Monday at AT&T's developer conference at the Consumer Electronics Show. The offering will let sponsors subsidize consumer's data fees, which have gradually gotten more expensive in recent years as phone companies charge for mobile web-surfing based on how much data their customers download.AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile operator, compared the offering to 1-800 telephone services where businesses such as florists pay for inbound calls with a view to attracting more consumers.It will start with deals from companies including a health insurer, an advertiser and a software firm but may expand to businesses ranging from media companies to retailers.AT&T and its rival Verizon Wireless have both talked about the idea of offering sponsored data for two years, but the plans have been slow to materialize as the operators sought partners and worked out how best to offer the service.AT&T's first partners include insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc, Boston-based advertising start-up Aquto and Orlando-based mobile software developer Kony Solutions. It said the offering could also work well for retail, media, entertainment and financial services customers or could be used by employers aiming to sponsor their own workers' data usage for certain corporate applications.Under the new service, AT&T said data charges from use of sponsored content would be billed directly to the sponsor and will appear on the consumer's invoice as sponsored data.For example AT&T said that UnitedHealth customers could view healthcare information or videos from their insurer without incurring data or customers using Aquto's service could watch ads without incurring data fees.Kony customers, which include hoteliers, could potentially use its reservation systems to let customers book hotel rooms while on the go without having to pay AT&T for the airtime. Mark Collins, AT&T senior vice president for voice and data products, said the service would complement existing data services for cost-conscious customers.Collins declined to disclose financial arrangements for the service but said that agreements would differ between sponsors depending on their agreements and that some companies will engage in revenue-sharing deals with the operator.ReconAnalytics analyst Roger Entner said UnitedHealth was a good launch partner for AT&T because it could provide an important service by giving lower-income consumers easier access to key health information.

Warburg Pincus LLC said last November that former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner would join the private equity firm in March as president, while peer KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) tapped former CIA Director David Petraeus last year as chairman of a new global institute it had set up to assess the investment implications of global issues.Carlyle is renowned for its connections in Washington, having in the past tapped political heavyweights, such as former U.S. President George H.W. Bush and former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III, as advisors. Genachowski, who oversaw FCC's rejection of a landmark merger bid in 2011 between U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier AT&T Inc (T.N) and fourth-largest provider T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), is no stranger to the private equity realm, having been special advisor to General Atlantic LLC between 2006 and 2009.He co-founded two investment firms, LaunchBox Digital and Rock Creek Ventures, which helped to advise and launch technology companies. A technology industry veteran, Genachowski held several positions at billionaire Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp between 1997 and 2005, as well as seats on the boards of companies.Carlyle completed fundraising for its latest U.S. private equity fund in November, raising $13 billion. It has deployed more than $18 billion in equity in investments in the technology, media and telecom sectors globally since its founding in 1987.(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2014-01-06,T,"Mon Jan 6, 2014 | 10:59am EST",Carlyle Group hires former FCC chairman as dealmaker,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-carlyle-genachowski-idUSBREA050MX20140106?type=companyNews

AT&T said last week it would pay T-Mobile customers to switch.According to a Cnet.com report, Legere was escorted out of the Las Vegas event by security guards about 15 minutes after Cnet reporter Roger Cheng posted a picture of himself and Legere and tweeted that the executive had crashed AT&T's party wearing his trademark pink T-Mobile t-shirt.Around the same time that Legere was being escorted out, AT&T's mobility chief Ralph de la Vega was announcing that his company had won a deal to provide wireless connections to Audi vehicles, beating T-Mobile US, Cnet reported. According to the Cnet report, Legere went to the party because he wanted to see a performance by rapper Macklemore, whose agent gave the executive and his entourage a pass for the party.While AT&T and T-Mobile did not respond to requests for comment, Legere retweeted multiple tweets about the incident, including Cheng's tweet that Legere was kicked out. Legere, an outspoken critic of his industry rivals, spent most of 2013 directly marketing against AT&T in particular. AT&T is most vulnerable to competition from T-Mobile because both companies have the same network technology, which makes it easy for consumers to switch between their services without having to buy new phones.

13,"   By Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc plans to give consumers options to save money on mobile data fees as soon as this quarter while offering sponsors a new way to entice consumers to use their services.The company announced details on Monday at AT&T's developer conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The offering will let sponsors subsidize consumer data fees, which have gradually become more expensive in recent years as phone companies charge for mobile web-surfing based on how much data their customers download.AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile operator, compared the offering to 1-800 telephone services where businesses such as florists pay for inbound calls with a view to attracting more consumers.It will start with deals from companies including a health insurer, an advertiser and a software firm but may expand to businesses ranging from media companies to retailers.AT&T and its leading rival Verizon Wireless have both talked about the idea of offering sponsored data for two years, but the plans have been slow to materialize as the operators sought partners and worked out how best to offer the service.AT&T's first partners include insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc, Boston-based advertising start-up Aquto and Orlando-based mobile software developer Kony Solutions.It said the offering could also work well for retail, media, entertainment and financial services customers or could be used by employers aiming to sponsor their own workers' data usage for certain corporate applications.Under the new service, AT&T said data charges from use of sponsored content would be billed directly to the sponsor and will appear on the consumer's invoice as sponsored data. For example, AT&T said that UnitedHealth customers could view healthcare information or videos from their insurer without incurring data or customers using Aquto's service could watch ads without incurring data fees.Kony customers, which include hoteliers, could potentially use its reservation systems to let customers book hotel rooms while on the go without having to pay AT&T for the airtime.Mark Collins, AT&T senior vice president for voice and data products, said the service would complement existing data services for cost-conscious customers.Collins declined to disclose financial arrangements for the service but said that agreements would differ between sponsors depending on their agreements and that some companies will engage in revenue-sharing deals with the operator.

29,"   By Kate Holton and Sophie Sassard | LONDON  LONDON AT&T on Monday ruled out a bid for Britain's Vodafone after Britain's takeover watchdog asked the U.S. phone company to clarify its position following reports that it had sounded out European regulators on the prospects of a merger.AT&T's statement means it cannot make an offer for Vodafone for at least six months, unless the British company invites it to do so or a third party enters the fray.Banking sources said that while an uproar over the U.S. National Security Agency's electronic surveillance program and a year-long rally in European telecom shares may have disrupted prospects for a deal any time soon, many think it could still happen.AT&T, the second-largest U.S. mobile operator, had sparked speculation it could be interested in a potentially 70 billion pound-plus ($115 billion) deal for Vodafone after its CEO said in October there was a ""huge opportunity"" in Europe to invest in mobile broadband.AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson met European Union telecoms chief Neelie Kroes at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said they discussed high-speed wireless and cross-European opportunities as well as the NSA spying scandal, but did not talk about any specific deals. AT&T declined to discuss Stephenson's Davos meetings.Vodafone's shares fell as much as 7 percent before ending down 3.9 percent at 224.78 pence as some investors had hoped that a deal process could start as early as February. AT&T's stock was up 0.9 percent at $33.73.Analysts also said a deal could still make sense for AT&T, which is facing a more competitive home market even as Europe could soon benefit from economic recovery and investment in high-speed mobile services that trail behind the United States'.""I don't think this signals the end of AT&T's interest in Europe,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst Chris Watts.One banker hoping to advise AT&T on any future Vodafone bid told Reuters that the British group, which is in the process of selling out of its U.S. joint venture, remained the perfect partner for AT&T because of its presence across Europe.AT&T was simply not ready to make an offer, the banker said, adding that matters had been complicated by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden's leaking of the NSA's massive phone and Internet surveillance program, which has sparked particular outrage in Europe. Before any bid, AT&T would have to win over its shareholders, some of whom have questioned the wisdom of entering fiercely competitive and highly regulated markets such as Britain, Germany and Spain.Another complication for AT&T is that it is unlikely to want to run Vodafone's businesses in emerging markets such as India, South Africa and Turkey, which were hit last week by a selloff in their currencies.Analysts said AT&T's reticence could provide a reality check for the wider European telecoms sector, which has surged about 24 percent in value over the past year compared with an 11 percent rise in Europe's top share index. The sector has been lifted by a string of takeover deals, despite few signs of an improvement in underlying trading.Another sector banker said a recent surge in Vodafone's share price due to the U.S. sale and speculation of a takeover bid might also have deterred AT&T. Vodafone shares are up 38 percent over the past year.ADVANTAGES OF A DELAY  If it does not buy Vodafone, AT&T could instead look at other European operators, such as British market leader EE, according to bankers and analysts.But Vodafone is seen as a better option than EE, which would give AT&T much more limited exposure to Europe. Investors showed little sign of betting on such a deal on Monday as they pushed down shares of EE's parents - Orange and Deutsche Telekom.""A number of other potential targets might be accretive in their own right (for AT&T) but wouldn't have the sort of game-changing potential Vodafone would have, if you think that Europe is the right place to be,"" Watts said.Citi analysts said a six-month delay in bidding for Vodafone could have advantages for AT&T as the British company is due to complete the $130 billion sale of its stake in U.S. venture Verizon Wireless around the end of February. This would give investors time to value Vodafone's remaining business.Analysts think that value is likely to settle around 60 billion pounds, with a bid premium of around 20 percent taking the price tag of any takeover deal to over 70 billion pounds. Regulators would have also given their decision by then on Telefonica's takeover of KPN's German mobile business, which is seen as a key test of whether competition authorities are more open to consolidation in Europe.In addition, AT&T's Stephenson, who has promoted the need for regulatory changes in Europe, may have a better idea of movement on that front later this year.A package of reforms intended to spur investment in networks and encourage cross-border services is under debate in the European Parliament. On top of this, the current crop of regulators, including Kroes, could be replaced at the end of October.M&A EVERYWHERE A series of telecoms and cable industry deals has helped fuel speculation that competition regulators could loosen the leash on mobile companies wanting to merge in Europe to help them cope with fierce competition that has driven down prices.Vodafone itself has recently agreed to buy Germany's Kabel Deutschland, and a person familiar with the situation said it was also in talks to buy Spain's main cable operator Ono.U.S. cable company Liberty Global on Monday clinched a takeover of Ziggo in a deal valuing the Dutch media and communications services provider and its debt at 10 billion euros ($14 billion).Espirito Santo analyst Robert Grindle, who downgraded his rating on Vodafone shares last week, said AT&T may return once it sees signs of trading in Europe starting to stabilize.

The Bundesbank said on Monday that growth in Germany - Europe's largest economy - would accelerate in the first quarter, and Lilley backed Germany's DAX, which hit record highs earlier this year, as his favourite European market.""I'm not panicking,""  Lilley said.

32,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO What many people don't realize about economist John Maynard Keynes is that he was a professional investor, not just a thinker who addressed big issues. Although Keynes did not foresee the crash of 1929 and was nearly wiped out on three separate occasions, he made money during some of the most challenging years - and pioneered some durable investing principles along the way worth following in all market conditions.So how would the father of Keynesian economics, who died in 1946, have played 2014?He likely would not have been swayed by the recent swoon - the S&P 500 Index is down 3 percent year-to-date through January 24. He quickly threw out conventional wisdom and stopped trading based on big economic themes in the early 1930s, instead focusing on the intrinsic value of companies. This strategy later influenced mega-investors like Warren Buffett, George Soros and John Bogle.When stocks were getting battered, Keynes was buying. He managed money for his alma mater, King's College at University of Cambridge, as well as two British insurance companies, friends and family.In researching my recent book ""Keynes's Way to Wealth,"" (McGraw-Hill, 2013, ((link.reuters.com/gyf46v )) ), I discovered that Keynes made money in 12 out of 18 years between 1928 and 1945, a period that includes the Crash of 1929, the Great Depression and World War Two. All told, his annualized return for the Cambridge ""Chest"" portfolio, a discretionary portfolio he managed, was 13 percent from 1928 through 1945, compared with a negative 0.11 percent for the UK market during that period.How did Keynes do it? Here are some key strategies he developed that are worth emulating today:1. Ignore the noise Keynes saw daily price information as: ""an altogether excessive, and even an absurd influence on the market."" Unless you are a professional who can beat robotic, high-frequency trading programs, you should not be trading based on short-term price fluctuations. Think year-to-year and have a long-term investment policy.2. Be a contrarianThat means buying unloved stocks, not glamorous tech titans like Google Inc and Apple Inc. Keynes bought out-of-favor shipping, railroad and mining stocks in the 1930s. They would later rebound and post huge profits. Today's toads are in the real estate, energy and utilities sectors, among the poorest-returning groups in the S&P 500 last year. 3. Favor stocks over bonds to beat inflationKeynes made a switch from the traditional staples of institutional portfolio managers - bonds and real estate - to stocks in the 1920s and 1930s. It is a strategy that still works today. Including a 30 percent return last year, common stocks gained an average 10 percent from 1926-2013. ""Ultrasafe"" U.S. Treasury Bills averaged only 3.5 percent during that period and lost ground to inflation last year.4. Commodities can be dangerously volatileKeynes was heavily into commodities futures during the 1920s, but got crushed when the 1929 crash came along. Commodities are a reliable inflation hedge that do not move in lock step with stocks, but in the event of a market catastrophe, commodities follow equities. When global demand for items like oil, metals and agricultural goods plummets - as in the early 1930s and in 2008 - those markets are not a good place to be. 5. Dividends are desirableSome of the most valuable companies in the world are boring, but have paid steady dividends for decades. They are worth holding because they boost and compound total return, particularly if you reinvest dividends in new shares. Keynes sought dividend payers in the 1930s when many of these companies were being dumped. Today you do not even have to purchase individual stocks: buy and hold an exchange-traded fund like the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF, which holds established companies including AT&T Inc, Consolidated Edison Inc and Clorox Co. The fund gained 30 percent last year, has a 2 percent yield and charges 0.35 percent annually to manage a portfolio of companies that are regularly increasing their dividends.6. Stop sweatingWhen Keynes stopped market timing and forecasting, he became more successful. His best portfolios held companies with solid long-term prospects, were bought at bargain prices and spread out across the world. He bought more shares when they became cheaper, ignoring market sentiment. Keynes learned that abandoning large-scale ""macro"" forecasts was a plus; he was better off looking at company ""enterprise"" values, or how well they could increase earnings in the future based on their management and business model.The moral of Keynesian investing is to play the long game, stick to an investment plan and avoid being distracted.

34,"  * FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.5 pct, Euro STOXX 50 eases 0.1 pct* Energy sector hit after BG warns over production* Vodafone falls as AT&T says no plans to bid for Vodafone* No need to panic - OMGI's Kevin LilleyBy Sudip Kar-GuptaLONDON, Jan 27 European shares slipped to their lowest level in more than a month on Monday, hit by drops in major telecoms and energy stocks.The downward move extended falls from last week triggered by  concerns about emerging markets and the pace of growth in China, while weak corporate earnings in Europe have also helped to knock European stock markets off multi-year highs.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down by 0.5 percent at 1,295.73 points in late session trading, its lowest level in more than a month, while the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index also slipped 0.1 percent to 3,025.82 points.Telecoms and energy were the worst-performing European equity sectors. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas Index  fell 1.9 percent as BG slumped 14 percent after warning that production this year and next would fall short of expectations. The STOXX Europe 600 Telecoms Index also fell 1 percent, with Vodafone dropping 3.3 percent after U.S. mobile operator AT&T said it was not planning to take over Vodafone.Traders and investors said European markets could lose more ground in the coming month. One fund manager said he expected a further 1 percent fall in the pan-European STOXX 600 index , but added the longer-term picture remained more robust as Europe's economic recovery slowly gathers momentum.""We continue to think the equity market will trend higher but there is a higher risk of a short-term setback,"" said Goldman Sachs chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer.""SLOW EUROPEAN RECOVERY""  European stocks suffered their biggest one-day fall in seven months on Friday, with the FTSEurofirst 300 shedding 2.4 percent and Spain's IBEX dropping 3.6 percent on concerns about economies and currencies in Latin America.Emerging markets were hit hard last week, with Argentina knocked by a devaluation in its peso currency, while Ukraine has been rocked by political turmoil.Kevin Lilley, head of European equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, said the emerging markets' problems and concerns about weak corporate earnings could push the STOXX 600 index down by another 1 percent to around 319 points.However, Lilley said the longer-term picture for 2014 in western Europe was more sound. The Bundesbank said on Monday that growth in Germany - Europe's largest economy - would accelerate in the first quarter and Lilley backed Germany's DAX - which hit record highs earlier this year - as his favoured European market.""I'm not panicking. The issues with Argentina and Ukraine seem quite specific to those countries but in Europe itself, the economic data is telling us that we're still in this slow rebound and recovery mode,"" said Lilley.",2014-01-27,T,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 10:47am EST","Weak telecoms, energy sectors drag European shares lower",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-europe-stocks-close-idUSL5N0L11UT20140127?type=companyNews

42,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. wireless industry lobby is proposing a pilot project to test how two television stations could share radio frequencies, hoping the practice catches on and broadcasters free up more of the valuable airwaves to be sold in an upcoming spectrum auction.The wireless association, CTIA, said on Tuesday it has found two stations in Los Angeles - KJLA and KLCS - interested in testing how they could send their video through the same radio frequency channel.Known as channel sharing, the practice has been supported by the Federal Communications Commission as a way to clear up more airwaves, or spectrum, for the so-called incentive auction currently scheduled for 2015.In the auction, TV stations would voluntarily give up control of low-frequency airwaves so that they can be sold to wireless providers such as AT&T Inc or T-Mobile US. The wireless companies are keen to boost the strength and reach of their networks as consumers increasingly rely on wireless phones for data-heavy uses like streaming video.The auction proceeds would reimburse the broadcasters and also help fund a new U.S. public safety network.The auction is widely regarded as the most complex undertaking by the FCC to date, balancing numerous economic, engineering and political considerations, including a vocal push from smaller carriers for limits to how much spectrum their larger competitors will be allowed to acquire.The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) has worried about numerous implications of the auction for the industry, including the push for participation and the ultimate rearrangement of how frequencies are used after changing hands. The FCC has promoted channel sharing as a way for TV stations to clear up spectrum and sell their airwaves in the auction without leaving the broadcasting business.Channel sharing would not affect the availability of familiar TV content to consumers, experts say. With digital television, the virtual channel numbers that viewers see displayed on TV are unrelated to radio frequency channels.In an order last year, the FCC said it was ""interested in possibly authorizing one or more channel sharing pilots in order to demonstrate the technical and legal arrangements necessary to implement a successful channel sharing operation.""

44,"  (Adds executive and analyst comment, share price update)By Sinead CarewNEW YORK Jan 28 AT&T Inc's fourth quarter wireless subscriber growth and its free cash flow target lagged well behind analyst estimates, sending its shares down 2 percent in late trade on Tuesday.Chief Executive Randall Stephenson also told investors on the company's conference call that a U.S. spying scandal was hurting its business irrespective of any effect it could have on prospects for overseas acquisitions.With a price war brewing and market share losses to smaller rival T-Mobile US and market leader Verizon Wireless   at home, some investors want AT&T to expand overseas with an acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc even after it ruled out such deal for now.AT&T added fuel to investor worries with a free cash flow target of $11 billion for 2014 and 2015 down from $13.6 billion in 2013. This implies that a ""nerve-wracking"" 86 percent of its cash flow will be needed for paying dividends, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.""That doesn't leave much room for a price war,"" Moffett said in a research note. ""AT&T may or may not return to Vodafone in the second half, but they need to do ... something.""Analysts had hoped for 2014 free cash flow closer to $14 billion. AT&T, which is beefing up its network in an effort to compete better, also set a 2014 capital budget in the $21 billion range, which was $1 billion more than analysts expected.On top of financial concerns, investors are worried about whether competition will become more intense as T-Mobile U.S. has spent several quarters directly marketing to AT&T customers, while AT&T recently offered to pay T-Mobile customers to switch.For the fourth quarter, AT&T had subscriber net additions of 566,000, behind the average Wall Street expectation for 636,000 according to eight analysts contacted by Reuters.It also trailed market leader Verizon Wireless which had 1.6 million subscriber additions, and T-Mobile U.S. which had 869,000. While AT&T executives spoke of intense competition on the quarterly conference call they said their customer defection rate, known in the industry as churn, was their best ever for the fourth quarter, and showed that they were holding their own.Jefferies analyst Michael McCormack was disappointed with the free cash flow and capital budget targets, although he noted that AT&T's churn of 1.11 percent was much better than his expectation for 1.19 percent.""I think the market was expecting a much worse result in terms of wireless profitability and market share losses,"" he said.The company reported stronger than expected wireless profitability with a service margin of 37.4 percent, compared with 29.1 percent in the year-ago quarter and analyst expectations closer to 34 percent.NSA ISSUES  While the bulk of AT&T's business is domestic, CEO Stephenson noted for the first time on Tuesday that his company was being hurt by revelations from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden of a widespread U.S. surveillance program that used records of communications on networks including that of AT&T.U.S. equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc recently blamed the scandal for a loss of business in China.Stephenson said he had discussed the matter with European policy makers at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week as the NSA scandal fallout was ""not inconsequential"" to AT&T.He explained that AT&T had issued a statement on Monday ruling out a Vodafone bid at least for now because of a request from UK regulators over the weekend due to press reports about his meetings with European officials.Although he did not quantify the financial impact of the NSA issue, Stephenson said: ""We are having customers ask us a lot of questions."" Some investors worry that the NSA affair could hurt AT&T's ability to gain European regulatory approval for a purchase of Vodafone if it pursued such a deal.""We've had some business impacts from the NSA,"" Stephenson told investors during the company's quarterly earnings call. ""Its affecting our ongoing business today irrespective of anything that might relate to M&A.""EARNINGS, REVENUE SLIGHTLY AHEAD AT&T reported fourth-quarter earnings of $6.9 billion, or $1.31 per share, compared with a loss of $3.86 billion, or 68 cents per share in the year-ago quarter when it had a massive actuarial charge.The latest quarter included a pension related gain.Excluding unusual items AT&T earnings per share was 53 cents in the quarter compared with Wall Street expectations for 50 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $33.16 billion from $32.58 billion slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations for $33.06 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.For 2014, AT&T forecast continued revenue growth in the 2 to 3 percent range.AT&T shares fell to $33.00 in late trade after closing at $33.70 in the regular New York Stock Exchange session.

45,"  WASHINGTON Jan 30 U.S. wireless providers like AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday received a nod from regulators to test a transition of the telephone industry away from traditional analog networks to digital ones.The Federal Communications Commission unanimously voted in favor of trials, in which telecommunications companies would test switching telephone services from existing circuit-switch technology to an alternative Internet protocol-based one to see how the change may affect consumers.The experiments approved by the FCC would not test the new technology - it is already being used - and would not determine law and policy regulating it, FCC staff said. The trials would seek to establish, among other things, how consumers welcome the change and how new technology performs in emergency situations, including in remote locations.""What we're doing here is a big deal. This is an important moment,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said. ""We today invite service providers to propose voluntary experiments for all-IP networks."" The move in part grants the application by AT&T to conduct IP transition tests as companies that offer landline phone services seek to ultimately replace their old copper wires with newer technology like fiber or wireless. ""We cannot continue requiring service providers to invest in both old networks and new networks forever,"" Commissioner Ajit Pai, a Republican, said.Some consumers, particularly in rural or hard-to-reach areas, have complained about poor connectivity of their IP-based services. Advocates have also expressed concerns about the impact of the transition on consumers with disabilities. ""I think we must be mindful of the impact this transition has on consumers -- their needs, their expectations and their willingness to embrace network change,"" said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat.The trials will be voluntary, and regulators require that the experiments ""cover areas with different population densities and demographics, different topologies, and/or different seasonal and meteorological conditions.""

Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play,"" it says.

Critics says it fosters a climate of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) groups.Telecoms company AT&T, a sponsor of the U.S. Olympic team,  criticised Russia this week over the law, increasing pressure on other companies to speak out.

54,"  Red-hot Jimmy Walker stands on the verge of his third victory of the PGA Tour season, six strokes clear of his nearest pursuers after his third round at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on Saturday.Walker opened the commanding lead with two late birdies to post a four-under-par 67 on Saturday at Monterey Peninsula, one of three courses used for the $6.6 million pro-celebrity event on the California coast.The 35-year-old American's round came on a day with high winds that reached nearly 40 mph and caused a delay of more than two hours as the gusts moved several balls on the greens.Twelve players, including second-round co-leader Jordan Spieth, did not complete the round due to the delay and were returning at 7 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) to finish their third rounds.Walker posted a 13-under-par 202 total heading into Sunday's final round, which will bring everyone who makes the cut together at Pebble Beach.Fellow American Hunter Mahan (72) and New Zealander Tim Wilkinson (69) were tied for second on seven-under.The three frontrunners all played at Monterey Peninsula. ""I have never had whatever big lead this is going into the last round,"" Walker told reporters.""It played really tough. When (we) made the turn, coming back and playing about five or six (holes) in a row in the wind, it was really stout.""We were all just kind of laughing at some of the shots that we were hitting and the numbers we were hitting."" Phil Mickelson stayed on the edge of contention with a 71 at Spyglass Hill that left him equal fifth, eight strokes behind Walker, though he lamented a bogey at his final hole.""It was a tough day, tough conditions, but I played pretty well,"" said the five-time major champion.Spieth endured a wretched day on the Pebble Beach greens, soaring to five-over-par through 15 holes to stand nine strokes off the pace. Walker has been the dominant player on the PGA Tour since the new ""wraparound"" season started in October.The unheralded American showed positive signs last season, registering five top-10s on tour, including a runner-up finish, but he has taken his game to another level over the past four months.He won the opening event of the 2013-14 season, the Frys.com Open in October, and followed up with another victory at the Sony Open in Hawaii in January.Though he missed the cut two weeks ago in his last start, Walker started Pebble Beach leading the tour's FedEx Cup standings, as well as the money list.(Reporting By Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Larry Fine)",2014-02-09,T,"Sat Feb 8, 2014 | 10:17pm EST",Hot Walker takes commanding lead at Pebble Pro-Am,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSBREA1801V20140209?type=companyNews

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The arrangement comes as federal regulators are wrestling with an issue known as ""Net neutrality"" concerning broadband providers and whether they can slow down traffic to particular websites, potentially forcing content companies to pay for faster Web service.The Federal Communications Commission said last week it plans to rewrite the rules after a U.S. court struck down the commission's previous version.

""We are assuming the payments are not going to materially change the business model."" Netflix shares rose 3.4 percent to a record $447.Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said on CNBC, where he discussed Verizon's talks with Netflix, that the two companies have been in negotiations for a year.These deals hinge on whether Netflix can set up direct access to Verizon, known as an ""interconnect agreement,"" rather than go through a third party. Verizon provides millions of U.S. customers with its FiOS broadband service and Netflix speeds have slowed on that network in recent months, leading to complaints. Many providers including Cox, Cablevision and Google Fiber directly connect to the Netflix network through a service the streaming company developed called Open Connect. Those providers have not seen their speeds deteriorate in recent months.But others, including AT&T and Verizon, have opted not to use Open Connect.Shares of Cogent Communications, one of the companies that took care of the Internet traffic exchange between the Comcast and Netflix networks, fell 7 percent on Monday as investors worried that these deals would take away Cogent's business. Cogent's chief executive Dave Schaeffer played down the effect of the Comcast-Netflix agreement on its business and reaffirmed the company's annual revenue forecast.""It doesn't mean that revenue goes away from Cogent. It just means that some of the growth in revenue may not occur through us,"" he said.McAdam, the Verizon CEO, spoke out in favor of telecom companies signing deals with Netflix.""It shows you don't necessarily need a lot of regulation in a dynamic market here. Doing these commercial deals will get good investment and good returns for both parties,"" McAdam said.Asked about discussions with Verizon or other providers, Netflix spokesman Joris Evers said ""we talk to all major ISPs all the time to make sure Netflix users get the best possible experience.""(Reporting by Liana B.

62,"  Netflix has agreed to pay one of the largest broadband providers in the United States Comcast Corp for faster speeds, throwing open the possibility that more content companies will have to shell out for better service.Comcast and Netflix made the joint announcement on Sunday, marking the first time that Netflix is paying for faster speeds in the U.S. after customers complained about slow service. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The arrangement comes as federal regulators are wrestling with an issue known as ""Net neutrality"" concerning broadband providers and whether they can slow down traffic to particular websites, potentially forcing content companies to pay for faster Web service.The Federal Communications Commission said last week it plans to rewrite the rules after a U.S. court struck down the commission's previous version.The issue is being closely watched as millions of people view movies and TV shows through streaming services offered by such companies like Netflix and Amazon. Netflix, which got its start as a DVD-by-mail service, has 44 million subscribers worldwide and 34 million in the U.S. alone. About 7 million subscribers pay for mail delivery services.The companies said in a statement that they have been ""working collaboratively over many months"" to strike a multi-year agreement. Netflix will not receive preferential network treatment, the companies said. As part of the deal, Netflix will deliver its movies and TV programs to Comcast's broadband network directly as opposed through third party providers, giving viewers faster streaming speeds for watching movies and TV programs.It also could force Netflix to strike similar arrangements, known in the industry as interconnect agreements, with other major broadband providers like Verizon and AT&T. With more than 44 million subscribers throughout the world, Netflix has been making an effort to connect directly with broadband Internet providers. It has struck similar deals with Cablevision and Cox, though Netflix did not pay for these connections.The arrangement with Netflix comes on the heels of Comcast's agreement to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, a deal that will draw the scrutiny of U.S. antitrust enforcers.The combined company would have a near 30 percent share of the U.S. pay television market, as well as be the major provider of broadband Internet access.(Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-02-24,T,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 12:35pm EST",Netflix to pay Comcast for faster speeds,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-comcast-netflix-idUSBREA1M0X520140224?type=companyNews

65,"   By Kate Holton and Leila Abboud | BARCELONA  BARCELONA Shareholders in Vodafone (VOD.L) say they support Chief Executive Vittorio Colao's plan to rebuild the company with pricey European broadband assets, even though it could complicate a lucrative mooted bid from AT&T (T.N).Fresh from the sale of the company's U.S. arm for $130 billion, Colao has said he could spend up to $40 billion on acquisitions to shore up its recession-hit European operations,with the initial focus falling on superfast cable networks.Top of the list is Spain's cable operator Ono, which would help Vodafone keep up with the growing popularity of all-included bundles of mobile to fixed-line services as well as help it carry the ever-increasing data traffic on its networks.Vodafone shareholders have proven surprisingly unfazed by Ono's eye-popping 7 billion euro-plus price tag, nor do they think Colao should just sit tight and wait for a possible bid from AT&T while his European business deteriorates.""You cannot stop running a business while you negotiate possible deals,"" a top 20 shareholder in Vodafone told Reuters, when asked about the likely impact on an AT&T deal.""Vodafone is in a weak position in Spain. Regardless of AT&T, if Vodafone wants to keep Spain it needs to put more money into capex and fix the business.""One person, however, who does not agree with Colao's strategy of splashing out on broadband is AT&T boss Randall Stephenson.Stephenson, who has expressed an interest in expanding in Europe - with Vodafone tipped as the most likely target - was reported by the Wall Street Journal this week as having said that buying cable assets wasn't what he would do, as the wireless market was a better option.AT&T, which declined to comment on the WSJ report, said in January it would not bid for Vodafone in the next six months, after being forced to make its intentions clear by the British regulator.One of Vodafone's biggest 10 shareholders said AT&T would prefer not to watch Vodafone spend the proceeds of the Verizon deal, but it wouldn't change the American company's mind on the virtues of a takeover. ""I don't think Vodafone's buying would really put them (AT&T) off,"" the shareholder said, on condition of anonymity.EUROPEAN MISERY Like its rivals, Vodafone has been hammered in its big European markets in the last five years due to fierce competition sparked by the recession and price cuts imposed by regulators.In Spain, Vodafone's core earnings fell by nearly a quarter to 422 million pounds in the first half of its fiscal year. Its core profit margin fell to 22.9 percent from 27.2 percent.The situation is not much better in Italy, where core earnings fell 25 percent to 818 million pounds in the same period, while margins fell to 36.9 percent from 42.5 percent. In total the group has written down the value of its European businesses by around 20 billion pounds.Newly flush with cash from the U.S. deal, Vodafone has said it will invest $30 billion to improve its infrastructure in Europe, Africa and India and either build superfast broadband networks, or buy them.The addition of fixed-line assets in Spain would enable Vodafone to provide a stronger challenger to market-leader Telefonica (TEF.MC) by offering pay-TV, mobile, fixed-line and broadband in one bundle. It could also move its data traffic onto the high-capacity network.Under Colao, Vodafone has largely shed its old reputation of an expansionist group that overpaid for assets, earning back investor trust with a series of minority disposals in France, Poland and China.Colao's one mis-step on M&A was passing up on buying Kabel Deutschland, Germany's largest cable operator, ahead of its initial public offering in 2010, only to pay nearly four times the IPO price when he bid for it three years later. His move for Britain's Cable and Wireless Worldwide for 1.3 billion pounds in 2012 was seen as a cannier buy.Colao's standing among investors rose even further when he pulled off the deal that had eluded his predecessors, the sale of the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, funneling $84 billion in cash and shares from the deal back to shareholders. ""He has already delivered on selling the Verizon stake for a whopping $130 billion,"" Bruno Grandsard, the senior portfolio manager at Global Equities, AXA IM, told Reuters. ""So if he spends 15 billion euros or so on pricey cable assets in Europe, I think most shareholders will forgive him that.""SPANISH PRESSURE Acquiring Ono would give Vodafone a fiber network covering 7.2 million of Spain's 16 million households, in largely rural areas that would complement Vodafone's own fiber network, which it is building with Orange in the biggest cities.It has approached the private equity owners of Ono about a deal, but publicly the cable operator has said it will continue with its plans to float the business, putting pressure on Vodafone to offer more.""The asset makes a lot of sense from a strategic point of view,"" the top 20 Vodafone shareholder told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""It doesn't mean they should spend crazy money on it, or outbid the IPO, though.""In Italy, Colao's most logical target would be Fastweb, a unit of Swisscom SCMN.VX, which has built a national fiber broadband network. Vodafone has approached Swisscom in the past about the company, but bankers told Reuters in January that the group was not eager to sell at the moment.In recognition of the superior speeds a cable network can achieve, cable operators enjoy heady valuations. They trade on an enterprise value to 2013 core profit multiple of 9.4, according to Reuters data, while the telecoms sector trades on a multiple of 7.5.""I've just completed a mini-roadshow and I would say shareholders are on board with the new strategy,"" Colao told reporters in Barcelona at the Mobile World Congress trade fair.""My real challenge is to keep the discipline but push ahead at the same time.""(Additional reporting by Chris Vellacott; Editing by Will Waterman)",2014-02-26,T,"Wed Feb 26, 2014 | 11:40am EST",Investors back Vodafone's pricey cable push despite AT&T risk,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mobile-world-vodafone-idUSBREA1P1FV20140226?type=companyNews

67,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, March 5 (IFR) - Any concerns about AT&T's desire to expand abroad didn't stop the telecom giant from attracting about US$6bn of demand on Wednesday morning for its first bond deal so far this year.Bookrunners Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Securities closed the books at 11:30am, having garnered more than enough interest for the offering of five-year fixed and floating rate notes as well as AT&T's first 10-year offering since 2012.The last time the company came to market was in November last year, when it issued US$400m of five-year floating rate notes maturing in November 2018 at 3mL+91bp, and US$1.6bn of 2.375% fixed-rate securities with the same maturity date.The new deal includes a benchmark five-year, rated A3/A-/A and whispered at 85-90bp, and a 10-year with initial price thoughts at 135-140bp. Comparables include AT&T's outstanding 1.4% November 2018s trading at T+60bp, or G+71bp; and Verizon's Baa1/BBB+/A- September 2018s, trading at T+60bp or G+80bp.The new 10-year's whispers compare with AT&T's outstanding 2.625% December 2022s at T+98bp or G+120bp; and Verizon's 2.45% February 2022s at T+105bp or G+128bp; and its 5.15% September 23s at T+130bp or G+138bp. AT&T was heavily rumored last year to be interested in buying Vodafone Plc. Rumors have swirled in the markets in the past week that it might also be considering cable assets in Europe.British law required AT&T to respond to rumors last year that it was contemplating a purchase of Vodafone. It said it wasn't pursuing such a deal, but analysts have interpreted that to mean that AT&T didn't want to rush a merger.""The decision means that the company cannot acquire Vodafone over the next five months unless it obtains the approval of the Vodafone board,"" said Dave Novosel, strategist at Gimme Credit.""But we suspect that Vodafone is still under consideration.""",2014-03-05,T,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 12:34pm EST",AT&T taps bond market for first time this year,http://www.reuters.com//article/att-bonds-idUSL1N0M21KY20140305?type=companyNews

70,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T on Friday dismissed Netflix's recent call for free interconnection as an arrogant and unfair attempt to force others to pay for the content provider to gain access to faster broadband speeds and better services.""As we all know, there is no free lunch, and there's also no cost-free delivery of streaming movies. Someone has to pay that cost,"" Jim Cicconi, AT&T's senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs wrote in a company blog post.""Mr. Hastings' arrogant proposition is that everyone else should pay but Netflix,"" he said.The post was a rebuttal to comments published by Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Thursday calling for greater protections for open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, which require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.In January a U.S. appeals court rejected federal rules that required Internet service providers to treat all web traffic equally, a decision that could allow mobile carriers and other broadband providers to charge content providers for faster access to websites and services. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast Corp for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service.Comcast is seeking approval from U.S. regulators for its proposed $45.2 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N.

71,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK, March 21  NEW YORK, March 21 AT&T on Friday dismissed Netflix's recent call for free interconnection as an arrogant and unfair attempt to force others to pay for the content provider to gain access to faster broadband speeds and better services.""As we all know, there is no free lunch, and there's also no cost-free delivery of streaming movies. Someone has to pay that cost,"" Jim Cicconi, AT&T's senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs wrote in a company blog post.""Mr. Hastings' arrogant proposition is that everyone else should pay but Netflix,"" he said.The post was a rebuttal to comments published by Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Thursday calling for greater protections for open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, which require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.In January a U.S. appeals court rejected federal rules that required Internet service providers to treat all web traffic equally, a decision that could allow mobile carriers and other broadband providers to charge content providers for faster access to websites and services. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast Corp   for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service.Comcast is seeking approval from U.S. regulators for its proposed $45.2 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N.

75,"  * American Express, Citigroup, Discover prevail* Cardholders alleged collusion to require arbitration   (Adds comments from Citigroup, Discover lawyer)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, April 10 Consumers suffered a setback on Thursday as three big credit card issuers won the dismissal of U.S. lawsuits accusing them of colluding to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than class action lawsuits.U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said cardholders failed to show that American Express Co, Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  conspired to violate the Sherman antitrust law.The plaintiffs had argued that the conspiracy ran from May 1999 to October 2003, when 10 card-issuing banks and their lawyers held 28 meetings to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements.Pauley said his decision in the decade-old case was a close call, given the ""conscious parallel action"" among the biggest card issuers to include the clauses.""It was only by a slender reed that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the lawyers who organized these meetings had spawned a Sherman Act conspiracy among their clients,"" Pauley wrote in a 92-page decision, following a 2013 non-jury trial.Class action litigation can allow consumers to pool resources and obtain greater recoveries at lower cost than individual arbitrations. ""This is a big dent for consumer rights,"" said Curtis Arnold, a consumer advocate and founder of CardRatings.com in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""Class action lawsuits have over the years kept this industry in check. Individuals don't have much recourse taking on card giants by themselves.""Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years.Merrill Davidoff, a partner at Berger & Montague representing the plaintiffs, said his clients were ""obviously disappointed"" and strongly disagreed with Pauley's decision. He said it is premature to address whether there will be an appeal.Robert Sperling, a partner at Winston & Strawn representing Discover, said the cardholders ""never came close to proving collusion."" Citigroup spokeswoman Emily Collins said that the bank is pleased with the decision. Spokeswomen for American Express did not respond to requests for comment. American Express, Citigroup and Discover collectively held about 31.1 percent of U.S. outstanding credit card balances in 2013, according to the Nilson Report.AVOIDING A BACKLASH In April 2010, Bank of America Corp, Capital One Financial Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co settled with the plaintiff cardholders by agreeing to remove their arbitration clauses for 3-1/2 years. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated in December that just over 50 percent of outstanding credit card loans remain subject to the clauses. It said the percentage would have been 94 percent absent the earlier settlements.Other industries also use arbitration clauses. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 upheld contracts used by AT&T Inc  requiring consumers to arbitrate disputes individually.In his decision, Pauley noted that of the 10 banks that had been part of the litigation, just two had mandatory arbitration clauses at the start of the alleged collusion.He found ""compelling evidence"" that cardholders would have little economic incentive to fight alleged abuses absent class actions, and said that the banks' ""need to parry consumer backlash and temper any 'rogue' players"" established a motive to conspire.""A motive to conspire, however, does not mean that a conspiracy existed,"" he said. ""This court is convinced that the evidence is just as consistent with legitimate activity in furtherance of the issuing banks' independent self interests.""Pauley said the case also offered a ""cautionary lesson"" to lawyers, given that the banks' cost to defend against the lawsuits offset potential savings from the arbitration clauses.""In retrospect, the issuing banks' short-term goal of lowering litigation costs eluded them,"" he wrote.The cases are in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. They are Ross et al v. American Express Co et al, No. 04-05723; and Ross et al v. Bank of America NA et al, No. 05-07116.

81,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The top U.S. telecommunications regulator on Thursday reasserted his commitment to helping smaller national wireless carriers get access to valuable lower-frequency airwaves in the upcoming spectrum auction.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, in a letter to Representative John Barrow, reaffirmed his plans to restrict how much spectrum the biggest U.S. carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, could buy in the auction scheduled for mid-2015.""The Incentive Auction offers the opportunity, possibly the last for years to come, to make low-band spectrum available to any mobile wireless provider, in any market, that is willing and able to compete at auction,"" Wheeler wrote to Barrow.""At the same time, a priority of the auction should be to assure that companies that already possess low-band spectrum do not exploit the auction to keep competitors from accessing the spectrum necessary to provide competition,"" he also wrote.Wheeler's letter comes a day after AT&T, the No. 2 wireless provider, threatened to sit out the auction altogether over the regulator's proposed restrictions.Wheeler's plan would reserve part of the spectrum, up to 30 megahertz, in each market for bidding only by carriers that control less than one-third of low-frequency airwaves there. The reserve would kick in only after the auction reaches a particular trigger, which will be established in coming months, according to people briefed on the proposal. The plan is expected to be formally circulated at the FCC later this month and voted on at the May 15 public meeting.The rules would benefit the No. 3 and No. 4 nation-wide carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile USA as they would largely restrict Verizon and AT&T, which Wheeler said control some two-thirds of those frequencies across the country.In the letter, Wheeler argued that the smaller national carriers need a boost in getting low-band spectrum to provide more and better rural coverage, and to correct what he called ""the historical accident of previous spectrum assignments.""

82,"  (Adds further details of Wheeler's letter, proposed rules and AT&T opposition)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, April 17 The top U.S. telecommunications regulator on Thursday reasserted his commitment to helping smaller national wireless carriers get access to valuable lower-frequency airwaves in the upcoming spectrum auction.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, in a letter to Representative John Barrow, reaffirmed his plans to restrict how much spectrum the biggest U.S. carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, could buy in the auction scheduled for mid-2015.""The Incentive Auction offers the opportunity, possibly the last for years to come, to make low-band spectrum available to any mobile wireless provider, in any market, that is willing and able to compete at auction,"" Wheeler wrote to Barrow.""At the same time, a priority of the auction should be to assure that companies that already possess low-band spectrum do not exploit the auction to keep competitors from accessing the spectrum necessary to provide competition,"" he also wrote.Wheeler's letter comes a day after AT&T, the No. 2 wireless provider, threatened to sit out the auction altogether over the regulator's proposed restrictions. Wheeler's plan would reserve part of the spectrum, up to 30 megahertz, in each market for bidding only by carriers that control less than one-third of low-frequency airwaves there.The reserve would kick in only after the auction reaches a particular trigger, which will be established in coming months, according to people briefed on the proposal. The plan is expected to be formally circulated at the FCC later this month and voted on at the May 15 public meeting.The rules would benefit the No. 3 and No. 4 nation-wide carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile USA as they would largely restrict Verizon and AT&T, which Wheeler said control some two-thirds of those frequencies across the country. In the letter, Wheeler argued that the smaller national carriers need a boost in getting low-band spectrum to provide more and better rural coverage, and to correct what he called  ""the historical accident of previous spectrum assignments.""Critics have argued that Sprint and T-Mobile both had a chance to acquire more low-band spectrum in the past but for various reasons chose not to to so.

84,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK, April 21  NEW YORK, April 21 Netflix Inc, the video streaming service, on Monday criticized AT&T's high-speed fiber network as inadequate and slow, while renewing its call for AT&T to interconnect directly with Netflix.Netflix made the remarks in a letter to shareholders on its first-quarter results. The company has been calling for greater protections for open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, which require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.Netflix, in a letter signed by its chief executive, Reed Hastings, and chief financial officer, David Wells, said AT&T's fiber-based U-verse service has ""lower performance than many DSL"" Internet service providers.The letter came hours after AT&T said it expects to expand its fiber network and TV services to up to 21 U.S. cities.AT&T did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a March blog post, AT&T dismissed Netflix's call for free interconnection as an ""arrogant"" and unfair attempt to force others to pay for the content provider to gain access to faster broadband speeds and better services.""The 249 customer comments on AT&T's anti-Netflix blog post indicate that AT&T customers expect a good quality Netflix experience given how much they pay AT&T for their Internet service,"" the Netflix letter said. Netflix added that AT&T can connect directly with Netflix for free, saying that doing so would ""quickly improve their customers' experience.""Netflix also adressed wider tensions with the Internet service providers it relies on to distribute its services. The company said it opposes the proposed merger between Comcast  and Time Warner Cable because it would give Comcast a monopoly over high-speed broadband and allow it to charge ""unprecidented fees"" from transit and service providers like Netflix.AT&T, which is fighting rivals such as Google Inc  as well as cable companies with its fiber-based product, on Monday said it is considering providing broadband Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and its U-verse television service in some metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. Before the company can enter these markets, it must make  agreements with local leaders in each city.The services are currently available in Austin, Texas, and some surrounding communities, and will be rolled out in parts of Dallas this summer, the company said.AT&T said it may consider expanding its reach to 100 cities eventually.U-verse launched in 2006 and currently has 10.7 million combined Internet and TV customers.

87,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc on Tuesday raised its forecast for full-year revenue growth to reflect its acquisition of LEAP wireless in March and the popularity of a new handset pricing model that charges customers for devices separately from their wireless plans.Like other carriers, AT&T (T.N) is seeking growth in a nearly saturated environment, making strategies such as alternate pricing plans more crucial to attract customers.The company raised its forecast for full-year revenue growthto at least 4 percent from 3 percent.A higher-than-expected 35 percent of wireless customers transferred to NEXT, its new pricing plan, boosting quarterly revenue 3.6 percent from the year-earlier quarter.""We are very pleased with the take rates,"" John Stephens, AT&T's chief financial officer, said of NEXT in a conference call following the earnings release. ""I believe the 35 percent will become a new standard.""AT&T added 625,000 postpaid net wireless subscribers in the quarter, the company's strongest post-paid growth in the first quarter in five years, blowing past Jefferies Equity Research expectations of 173,000. Yet the growth in subscribers was somewhat offset by weak service revenue growth as customers who moved off of the traditional device subsidization model were eligible for Mobile Share, a plan that includes unlimited talk and text and allows for shared data in up to 10 devices.Mobile share accounts tripled year-over-year and reached 11.3 million customers with an average of three devices per account, which lowered revenue per user. Despite the increase in subscribers, phone-only average revenue per user increased only 0.4 percent per year compared with the year-earlier quarter.""They did not expect this large of an uptake,"" said Kevin Smithen, a managing director at Macquarie Securities Group in New York.""Though they saved a lot of money on the NEXT plan by lowering the expenses of subsidies, the service revenue came in light because they have re-priced 11 million subscribers at a lower average revenue per user."" In response to growing competition from smaller rivals such as fourth-ranked T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N, AT&T introduced its NEXT pricing plan in July 2013, eliminating down payments for devices and instead allowing customers to pay in installments.The company previously paid heavy upfront subsidies to phone makers in order to offer customers device discounts and tie them into two-year contracts. It then recouped the cost of the phone over the span of the contract through its service fees.Under NEXT, AT&T unbundles the cost of the device from customer's wireless plan. It can then achieve a limited-term boost to revenue by booking device purchases upfront as immediate revenue, despite the fact customers continue paying in installments over the duration of their contract period. The company maintained its estimate of free cash flow for 2014 in the $11 billion range and capital expenditures in the $21 billion range, easing analysts' worries that NEXT could tie up capital in financing installment plans.""The uptake of the NEXT program should have a positive impact on the profitability of the company. They came in fine on cash flow this quarter, with a bit of a working capital swing, but they are maintaining their full-year guidance and I find that to be pretty constructive,"" Jefferies analyst Michael McCormack said.Earnings were also boosted by AT&T's acquisition of Cricket Communications Inc's LEAPC.UL LEAP wireless, which brought in $3 billion in new spectrum, key to supporting increasing demand for wireless data services, Stephens said.AT&T expects about $1.2 billion of integration costs in the next two years and $0.05 earnings per share dilution in 2014.AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, earned $3.65 billion, or 70 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $3.70 billion, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.

""We will take our time and respond where we need to respond. We will attack the quality base of customers that we are targeting.""The company's wireless business added 539,000 postpaid  subscribers in the quarter, 20 percent less than in the year-ago quarter, while No. 2 carrier AT&T Inc added 625,000 subscribers, blowing past Wall Street expectations.Analysts say that as the industry leader, Verizon is looking to maintain its premium price point as a sign of a superior product even at the expense of additional subscribers.""It is very easy in this industry to lower prices, but it is almost impossible to raise them,"" said Roger Enter of Recon Analytics. ""They are rightfully cautious about not jumping head-on into what could be a price war,"" he said.Excluding unusual items, Verizon's earnings per share of 91 cents beat Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S analyst expectations of 87 cents per share.The No. 1 U.S. mobile provider earned $5.98 billion in the first quarter, compared with $4.86 billion in the year-ago quarter.On the wireline side, it said it added 57,000 FiOS video customers and 98,000 net new FiOS Internet connections in the quarter.The company said wireless customer defections, known in the industry as churn, increased slightly from a year ago.Revenue rose 4.8 percent, the highest growth rate in five quarters, to $30.82 billion from $29.42 billion a year earlier. Wall Street expected $30.698 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Its February acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc's 45 percent share in their prior joint venture for $130 billion gave the company access to greater amounts of cash flow.Verizon shares were down 2.6 percent at $46.18 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday on Thursday.

108,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. consumer spending recorded its largest gain in more than 4-1/2 years in March and factory activity accelerated last month, reinforcing views the economy was regaining steam.Economic growth stalled in the first quarter after a very cold and disruptive winter, but the data so far point to a strong second-quarter rebound.""The weakness in growth we saw in the first quarter is not indicative of what is going on in the economy. The fundamentals continue to look pretty good, the economy has momentum,"" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group.Consumer spending increased 0.9 percent in March after rising by 0.5 percent in February, the Commerce Department said. March's gain was the biggest since August 2009 and beat economists' expectations for a 0.6 percent rise.Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. When adjusted for inflation, it increased 0.7 percent in March after advancing 0.4 percent in February.That was also the largest gain since August 2009 and put consumer spending on a strong upward trajectory heading into the second quarter.In an early sign of growing consumer spending, four of the top six automakers, including Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, reported year-to-year gains in sales on Thursday.""It provides a very strong hand-off to second-quarter spending and also reinforces our expectation for a 3.5 percent or better second-quarter growth performance,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 54.9 last month, up from 53.7 in March. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the nation's factories. Manufacturing activity has now accelerated for three consecutive months and last month's gains were driven by a pickup in employment, export orders and inventories. New orders, however, were unchanged.Data so far, including employment and industrial production, suggest there was momentum in the economy at the tail end of a difficult first quarter, providing a springboard for faster growth in the April-June period.The economy grew at an annual rate of only 0.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Economists and Federal Reserve officials, however, pinned the slowdown on the impact of a brutal winter. A moderation in the pace of restocking by businesses, which is likely temporary, also weighed on growth.There is, however, a risk that first-quarter growth could be lowered to show a contraction after a report from the Commerce Department showed an unexpectedly smaller rebound in construction spending in March. CLAIMS VOLATILE While another report from the Labor Department showed an unexpected rise in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, the overall trend in initial claims continued to point to improving labor market conditions.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 344,000. Economists had expected a decline to 319,000. The four-week moving average for new claims rose only 3,000 to 320,000.Claims are volatile around this time of the year because the timing of the Easter and Passover holidays and school spring breaks makes it difficult to adjust for seasonal fluctuations.""The broader labor market picture has not changed materially and we are expecting another firm employment print in April,"" said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York. The government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 last month after rising by 192,000 in March, according to a Reuters survey. The jobless rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 6.6 percent.In March, consumer spending was buoyed by a 1.4 percent surge in goods purchases. Spending on durable goods rose 2.7 percent, the largest increase since March 2010. Spending on services also increased by a solid 0.7 percent, reflecting increased demand for utilities and healthcare services.Income increased 0.5 percent in March, the biggest gain since August 2013, after rising 0.4 percent in February.Income continues to be supported by government subsidies for healthcare payments. With spending outpacing income growth, the saving rate, which is the percentage of disposable income households are socking away, hit a 14-month low.Despite the rise in consumer spending, inflation was benign. A price index for consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.1 in February. It was up 1.1 percent from a year ago, compared to a 0.9 percent year-on-year advance in February.Excluding food and energy, prices also rose 0.2 percent after gaining 0.1 percent in February. They were up 1.2 percent from a year ago in March, compared to a 1.1 percent year-on-year rise in February.Both measures remain stuck well below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target, giving the central bank room to keep benchmark interest rates near zero for a while. The Fed plans to wrap up a bond-buying program later this year, but it is not expected to move rates higher until sometime in 2015.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica; Editing by Paul Simao)",2014-05-01,T,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 1:39pm EDT","Strong consumer spending, factory data buoy U.S. growth outlook",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-economy-idUSBREA3T03420140501?type=companyNews

""Our next-generation solutions... will be faster and flying sooner than AT&T's proposed solutions,"" Gogo Chief Executive Michael Small said on a post-earnings conference call.Analysts have said AT&T's impact may be limited due to Gogo's long-term contracts, regulatory hurdles for AT&T, high switching costs for airlines and the increasing demand for seamless in-flight connectivity.Satellite-based wi-fi keeps flyers connected to the Internet across land and sea, while mobile networks - including 4G LTE - work only over land. Gogo, which launched satellite connectivity on Delta Air Lines Inc's international fleet in March, will be able to offer up to 70 megabits per second (mbps) speed on satellite-based systems.The company also said it was on track to upgrade 800 of the 2,056 aircraft fitted with its wi-fi with newer technology, tripling connectivity to 10 mbps this year.Gogo, which competes with satellite-based service providers such as ViaSat Inc, Row 44, Panasonic Avionics and OnAir, charges customers $16 per day to access its in-flight Wi-Fi.

They asked not to be named because the matter is not public.Other details also have yet to be worked out, such as a break-up fee as well as a potential role for DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White, the second person said.The talks are the latest sign of a rising tide of potential megadeals in the telecoms, cable and satellite TV space, which is being roiled by Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc as well as market forces such as the rise of Web-based TV and surging mobile Internet usage. AT&T and DirecTV declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported that AT&T was offering to pay around $100 per share for DirecTV, whose management team will continue to run the company as a unit of AT&T. (link.reuters.com/xyf39v). The Wall Street Journal said a deal could happen in two weeks.DirecTV shares rose 6 percent to $92.50 in extended trading on Monday.DirecTV is working with advisers including Goldman Sachs Group to evaluate a possible combination following a recent takeover approach from AT&T, Reuters reported last week. A combination of AT&T and DirecTV would create a pay television giant close in size to where Comcast will be if it completes its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable. For that reason, the proposed merger is likely to face a prolonged battle to convince regulators to allow further consolidation in pay-TV.""This is not the first time that AT&T and DirecTV have danced around the fire and thought if they could give it a go,"" said ReconAnalytics analyst Roger Entner.""They both looked at each other for at least 10 years. Both kind of came to the conclusion that it was in the right environment. It makes a lot of sense to get together, but there was never the right regulatory environment for it."" A Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would call for a counterweight like a combined AT&T-DirecTV, Entner said. He added that the merger would make sense for DirecTV given the decline of satellite TV.""They both see the Grim Reaper at the horizon. DirecTV hasn't gone out and bought spectrum. Dish has, so DirecTV needs to find a partner, and AT&T is that partner,"" he said.Some investors have also speculated about a potential tie-up of DirectTV and smaller rival Dish Network Corp.But Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen last week said his company, which attempted to buy DirecTV more than a decade ago, would not make a fresh approach at current prices even though he said such a tie-up would create many benefits.(Additional reporting by Marina Lopes, Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Tom Brown, Richard Chang and Ken Wills)",2014-05-13,T,"Tue May 13, 2014 | 1:04pm EDT",AT&T in talks to buy DirecTV for nearly $50 billion: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-directv-att-idUSBREA4B0W220140513?type=companyNews

139,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 15 U.S. telecommunications regulators will vote on Thursday on whether to formally propose new ""net neutrality"" rules that may let Internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has come under fire from consumer advocates and technology companies for proposing to allow some ""commercially reasonable"" deals where content companies could pay broadband providers to prioritize traffic on their networks.Critics worry the rules would create ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay up and mean slower traffic for others, although Wheeler has pledged to prevent ""acts to divide the Internet between 'haves' and 'have nots.'""Some 200 activists have said they plan to protest at the FCC on Thursday, joining a few hard core critics who have camped outside the agency for a week. Consumer advocates were also mobilizing Internet users to protest online on blogs and through social media. Those advocates want the FCC to reclassify Internet providers as utilities, like telephone companies, rather than as the less-regulated information services they are now. That move is opposed by broadband companies and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC.Opponents, including House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and CEOs of major Internet providers, told Wheeler that stricter regulations would throw the industry into legal limbo, discourage investment in network infrastructure and still not prevent pay-for-priority deals. House Democrats have come out on both sides of the reclassification issue in recent communications to Wheeler.More than 100 technology companies, including Google Inc  and Facebook Inc, have spoken out against allowing pay-for-priority, although have not called for reclassification. Wheeler's proposal reaches the tentative conclusion that some pay-for-priority deals may be allowed, but asks whether the FCC should presume ""some or all"" such deals are illegal, according to an FCC official briefed on the proposal. It also asks whether the FCC should instead consider reclassification or other net neutrality proposals.The two Republican FCC commissioners are expected to vote against Wheeler's proposal. Wheeler's two fellow Democrats have both expressed misgivings about the plan, but are likely to vote  to launch the process and open it up to public comment.The FCC will also vote on Thursday on rules for the sale of highly valuable low-frequency airwaves to wireless carriers. Those rules are expected to restrict how much the largest two providers, Verizon and AT&T, can buy.    (Reporting by Alina Selyukh.

Representatives for AT&T declined to comment while Lazard did not respond to requests for comment.Reuters and others previously reported that DirecTV is working with advisers including Goldman Sachs Group to weigh a potential deal with AT&T. The proposed deal, if it happens, would be a big payday for Wall Street banks that are enjoying a revival in mergers and acquisitions after several years of lackluster activity following the financial crisis.Based on a roughly $48 billion deal, advisers for AT&T could earn between $40 million and $60 million in advisory fees, while DirecTV's advisers could earn $50 million to $75 million, according to preliminary estimates by consulting firm Freeman & Co LLC. Those figures do not include any financing fees.Banks pursue big-ticket deals not only for revenue but also for prestige. Lazard's advisory role with AT&T also underscores a growing trend of smaller investment banks, or boutiques, winning larger deals often at the expense of mega banks. In February, boutique advisory Allen & Co scored the prized role of advising Facebook Inc on its $19 billion acquisition of smartphone-messaging app WhatsApp. Paul Taubman, a former top Morgan Stanley banker who is now acting on his own, was lead adviser to Comcast Corp on its $45 billion deal for Time Warner Cable Inc this year.Lazard's global telecommunications banking team is led by veteran banker George ""Woody"" Young, who joined the bank in 2009 from Merrill Lynch where he served as global head of technology, media and telecommunications.During his career, Young has advised on major transactions for the world's largest telecommunications companies, including three mega deals involving AT&T - Cingular on its $41 billion merger with AT&T Wireless, SBC on its $22 billion merger with AT&T, AT&T on its $89 billion merger with BellSouth.Considered one of Wall Street's most experienced telecom bankers, he also served as an adviser on other headline deals that reshaped the industry, including working with Sprint Corp  on its $46.5 billion merger with Nextel that created Sprint Nextel Corp.

142,"  (Adds additional comment, details)By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK May 17 AT&T is close to announcing that it will buy the No. 1 U.S. satellite TV operator DirecTV, according to people familiar with the matter, in the second potentially transformative deal to jolt the U.S. television industry this year.The No. 2 U.S. cellular operator, which also has some TV and broadband services, has been in active discussions to buy DirecTV for nearly $50 billion, or low to mid-$90s per share, and has been working to finalize a deal in coming weeks, Reuters reported last Monday.The two companies agreed key terms of the proposed transaction and are expected to announce the deal in days pending final approval from each company's board, one of the  people said on Saturday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.The takeover would be the latest in a string of mega-acquisitions AT&T has considered. Those include an abortive bid for T-Mobile USA in 2011, as well as a potential takeover of Vodafone Plc, which receded as a possibility after Comcast Corp surprised the industry this year with a $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc.A tie-up with DirecTV would expand AT&T's reach and allow it to bundle new services, offering certain customers one-stop shopping for the range of cellular, broadband, TV and fixed line phone services. DirecTV would also produce cash flows that could help support AT&T's dividend.Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of America Merrill Lynch  are advising DirecTV, while Lazard Ltd is advising AT&T, the people said.A spokeswoman for AT&T declined to comment. A DirecTV spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.News of an imminent announcement was first reported by  BuzzFeed, which said on Saturday that DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White told his senior executives a deal had been reached and would be announced on Sunday.EXPANDED CUSTOMER BASE  AT&T's acquisition would expand its customer base by 20 million for its U-verse fiber product, which provides television and Internet service.The transaction may also allow current DirecTV customers to get Internet service where AT&T's U-verse is available. DirecTV's growth has been hurt because unlike cable companies, it is unable to offer broadband alongside its TV subscriber services. AT&T has about 10.4 million U-verse Internet customers in states such as California and Texas.""AT&T just upped the ante,"" said Roger Entner, lead analyst at Recon Analytics, referring to the imminent deal.

AT&T'S PUSH FOR GROWTH Yet many investors have questioned why AT&T, which is facing slowing growth, would buy DirecTV, which also has more than 18 million customers in Latin America, at a time when U.S. satellite TV subscriptions have flattened.The growth of web-based television services could mean that demand for satellite slows further in the coming years.AT&T shares have underperformed the S&P 500 index for the past three years. Like other U.S. wireless operators, the company, whose origins lie in Southwestern Bell, one of the ""Baby Bells"" that followed the 1984 breakup of the original AT&T, has struggled to find growth areas as the U.S. mobile phone market has become saturated.AT&T's average revenue per user fell in its most recent earnings report, reflecting a price war that has broken out between T-Mobile and other carriers including T-Mobile  and Sprint Corp. Sprint, controlled by Japan's Softbank, has made no secret of its interest in buying T-Mobile, and the sole hurdle to such a deal is regulators' concern that a T-Mobile/Sprint deal would reduce competition.DirecTV shares have been up 75 percent over the past three years. Its trailing compound five-year annual growth rate is 10 percent, although that has slowed lately, compared with less than 1 percent for AT&T, according to Thomson Reuters data. DirecTV's top holder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway  with 34 million shares, a 6.85 percent stake.REGULATORS EYE CONSOLIDATION From the point of view of the regulators, the AT&T-DirecTV deal could enjoy a somewhat smoother ride than the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal, although both are expected to ultimately win approval.Still, AT&T and DirecTV may face questions about the areas where their TV services now overlap.Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge, said an AT&T-DirecTV deal would mean a loss of choice in video for about 25 percent of Americans but would  allow the companies to compete more effectively with their more powerful rivals.Still, the increasing proliferation of telecoms and cable deals presents regulators with a conundrum as they seek to preserve competition.""At some point the government may step back and say, wait a minute, there's too much consolidation in the sector, individually these deals are okay but combined they create a problem,"" said Blair Levin, a fellow at the Washington-based nonprofit Aspen Institute and former top aide at the FCC.

152,"   By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T is close to announcing that it will buy the No. 1 U.S. satellite TV operator DirecTV, according to people familiar with the matter, in the second potentially transformative deal to jolt the U.S. television industry this year.The No. 2 U.S. cellular operator, which also has some TV and broadband services, has been in active discussions to buy DirecTV for nearly $50 billion, or low to mid-$90s per share, and has been working to finalize a deal in coming weeks, Reuters reported last Monday. The two companies agreed key terms of the proposed transaction and are expected to announce the deal in days pending final approval from each company's board, one of the  people said on Saturday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.The takeover would be the latest in a string of mega-acquisitions AT&T has considered. Those include an abortive bid for T-Mobile USA in 2011, as well as a potential takeover of Vodafone Plc, which receded as a possibility after Comcast Corp surprised the industry this year with a $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc.    A tie-up with DirecTV would expand AT&T's reach and allow it to bundle new services, offering certain customers one-stop shopping for the range of cellular, broadband, TV and fixed line phone services.

DirecTV’s growth has been hurt because unlike cable companies, it is unable to offer broadband alongside its TV subscriber services. AT&T has about 10.4 million U-verse Internet customers in states such as California and Texas. ""AT&T just upped the ante,"" said Roger Entner, lead analyst at Recon Analytics, referring to the imminent deal.

153,"  (Adds DirecTV, analyst comments about NFL agreement condition)By Liana B. BakerMay 19 AT&T Inc can pull out of its agreement to buy DirecTV if the satellite TV operator is unable to renew a deal with the National Football League to offer the popular NFL Sunday Ticket football package, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.The current DirecTV offer allows subscribers to watch football games outside of their local markets on Sundays. The exclusive package, which costs subscribers up to $300 a year, is an important tool for DirecTV to attract subscribers and the company has said about 2 million people receive the service.In a filing related to the acquisition, the companies said: ""the parties also have agreed that in the unlikely event that the company's agreement for the 'NFL Sunday Ticket' service is not renewed on substantially the terms discussed between the parties, AT&T may elect not to consummate the merger.""Investors have been watching closely to see whether DirecTV would renew the Sunday Ticket contract with the NFL, estimated to be worth $1 billion annually, with the potential to rise in value as part of a new agreement. The filing said that if a renewal isn't struck, AT&T will not be able to claim damages as long as DirecTV used its best efforts to get a deal done with the NFL.On a conference call with analysts on Monday, DirecTV CEO Mike White said he and AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson had spoken with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell as well as New England Patriots Owner Robert Kraft who heads the league's broadcast committee, and the parties were in ""positive and constructive"" discussions with the league.""I am still highly confident that we are going to get our deal done,"" White said, adding he expects a pact to be agreed by the end of the year, which would be before the acquisition closes. AT&T has said it expects the deal to take a year to close.A DirecTV spokesman said the company was ""totally comfortable"" with including the Sunday Ticket condition in the merger agreement.""DirecTV has been telling the world for months that we are comfortable that we will complete the NFL contract this year,"" the spokesman said. Representatives from AT&T and the NFL did not immediately respond to requests for comment.News of the condition may affect the negotiations between DirecTV and the league, said Neal Pilson, head of consulting firm Pilson Communications and the former president of CBS Sports.""It gives the NFL additional leverage knowing a $48 billion acquisition is depending upon the renewal,"" he said.A contract that renews DirecTV's exclusive deal would give the satellite operator a key marketing advantage over cable operators.

160,"   By Liana B. Baker, Soyoung Kim and Marina Lopes  AT&T Inc plans to pay $48.5 billion to buy DirecTV, in the latest sign that the wireless industry and the U.S. television market are set to converge as customers consume more video on their mobile devices.The deal, announced on Sunday, highlights AT&T's pressing need for fresh avenues of growth beyond the maturing U.S. cellular business, which has become increasingly competitive.The combination with DirecTV, the No.1 U.S. satellite TV provider with 20 million customers, would beef up Dallas-based AT&T's packages of cellular, broadband, TV and fixed-line phone services.For DirecTV, the deal will enable it to offer broadband Internet for the first time to its U.S. customers, filling in a gap that had made the company vulnerable to cable rivals, which can provide Internet service through their networks.""It gives us the parts to fulfill a vision we have had for a couple of years, that is, the opportunity and the ability to take premium content and deliver premium content over multiple points for the customer, whether it be through a smartphone, through a tablet, or television or laptop,"" said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, speaking on a conference call.Stephenson's counterpart at DirecTV, Mike White, will stay on to run the satellite television business, which will continue to be based outside Los Angeles in El Segundo, California.AT&T currently offers a video service known as U-Verse and Stephenson said during a conference call the company would continue to offer it after the acquisition is completed. It expects the deal to close in about a year.AT&T and DirecTV made their announcement just a few months after Comcast Corp offered $45 billion for Time Warner Cable Inc, a transaction that would create the leading U.S. cable and broadband Internet powerhouse. The Comcast proposal is now awaiting regulatory approval.AT&T is offering $95 per DirecTV share in a combination of stock and cash, a 10 percent premium over Friday's closing price of $86.18. It will finance the cash portion, $28.50 per share, with funds on hand, asset sales and financing already lined up.The transaction has a total value of $67.1 billion, including the assumption of DirecTV's net debt. To help its case with regulators, AT&T will sell its roughly 8 percent stake in Carlos Slim's America Movil, worth roughly $5 billion. DirecTV has some 18 million customers throughout Latin America.COMPETITIVE CONCERNS The logic behind the long-expected deal has raised some doubts. Some analysts and investors have questioned why AT&T, which is facing slowing growth, would buy DirecTV at a time when growth in U.S. satellite TV subscriptions has stalled. The growth of web-based video services like Netflix and Hulu mean that demand for satellite TV will slow further in the coming years.There are also potential anti-competitive hurdles to clear. AT&T is likely to face questions from regulators about the deal's impact on competition in those areas where its U-verse service now competes with DirecTV in offering television.AT&T said it expected to be able to add 15 million broadband customers, mostly in rural areas, within four years of the deal closing, adding to its base of 11 million current Internet customers. Consumer advocates are already putting pressure on regulators to reject the deal.""You can't justify AT&T buying DirecTV by pointing at Comcast's grab for Time Warner, because neither one is a good deal for consumers,"" said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.The companies had thought about a combination for years, but discussions only took off in March following the Comcast-Time Warner Cable announcement.The latest deal will immediately ratchet up the pressure on competitors. In particular, it raises questions about the No.2 satellite TV operator, Dish Network and what it might do. With 14 million subscribers, Dish trails DirecTV and has spent billions for wireless spectrum it has yet to use.Dish's chief, Charles Ergen, has said that he does not have the cash to outbid AT&T for DirecTV. Dish tried to buy DirecTV in 2001 in a deal that was blocked by regulators. DirecTV is the latest in a string of big takeover targets that AT&T has considered. Those include a failed bid for T-Mobile USA in 2011, as well as a potential takeover of Vodafone Plc.DirecTV, founded in 1994, has changed hands before. It had been previously owned by Hughes Electronics, which was part of General Electric, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, and its most recent owner Liberty Media, which sold its stake in 2009.BUFFETT'S POSITION The deal, which comes after a 25 percent gain in DirecTV's stock price this year that was fueled by takeover speculation, represents a potential win for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, the satellite provider's top shareholder.Goldman, Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisers to DirecTV, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, Jones Day and Wiltshire & Grannis LLP served as legal advisers.AT&T, which has an extensive internal M&A team, was also advised by Lazard, and on the legal side, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Crowell & Moring, Arnold & Porter, Sidley Austin, Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel PLC and Gibson Dunn acted as legal advisors to AT&T.DirecTV has agreed to pay a $1.4 billion breakup fee to AT&T in the event that it pursues another transaction with a higher bidder, the companies confirmed.AT&T will not have to pay a penalty if regulators veto the deal.(Additional reporting by Mike Stone; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Frank McGurty and Matt Driskill)",2014-05-19,T,"Mon May 19, 2014 | 12:31pm EDT",AT&T makes bet on video with $48.5 billion DirecTV bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-directv-att-idUSBREA4B0W220140519?type=companyNews
161,"  By Asher Levine     SAO PAULO, May 19 Latin American stocks dropped on Monday as a decline in iron ore prices hammered shares of Brazilian miner Vale while America Movil drove losses in Mexico's bourse after AT&T said it would sell its stake in the Mexican telecommunications firm.     The broader MSCI Latin American stock index  nearly erased the previous session's gains though most of the region's currencies strengthened slightly against the dollar.     Data from China on Sunday showed annual growth in average new home prices slowed to an 11-month low in April, raising concerns over an economic slowdown in the key consumer of Latin American commodities, including copper, soybeans and iron ore.     That caution should remain in place until China's government announces stimulus measures, analysts from BB Investimentos wrote on Monday, citing what they see as the ""inevitable continuation of an economic slowdown"" in the country.     Preferred shares of Vale SA, which counts China as its biggest customer, sank by their most in three weeks as spot iron ore for immediate delivery to China .IO62-CNI=SI dropped to its lowest since September 2012.      Steelmakers and commodities producers also fell, driving Brazil's Bovespa stock index to a 1 percent loss.     Mexico's IPC stock index fell about 0.6 percent as shares of telecommunications firm America Movil posted their biggest one-day drop in nearly two months.     The fall came after AT&T said it would sell its roughly 8 percent stake in the Mexican firm and withdraw its board members in order to help it gain regulatory approval for its purchase of DirecTV.      Latin American currencies were mostly stronger against the dollar, though moves were muted.     Chile's peso posted the biggest gain in the region, strengthening 0.46 percent to 548.2 per dollar.     The peso, which has risen about 3.4 percent over the past 10 sessions, was bolstered by stronger than expected economic growth data on Monday and a nearly 1 percent gain in the price of copper, the country's main export.

162,"  * AstraZeneca rejects sweetened Pfizer offer* AT&T to buy DirecTV for $48.5 billion* Indexes: Dow off 0.05 pct, S&P up 0.11 pct, Nasdaq up 0.46 pct   (Updates to market open, adds quote)By Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK, May 19 U.S. stocks were little changed on Monday, on the heels of back-to-back weekly declines for the S&P 500, as investors exercised caution over valuations after a run of mixed economic data.U.S.-listed shares of AstraZeneca slumped 9.6 percent to $72.60. The British drugmaker rejected a sweetened and ""final"" merger offer from Pfizer which would have created the world's largest pharmaceuticals group. Pfizer shares advanced 1.5 percent to $29.56. AT&T lost 1.7 percent to $36.12 after the telecom company said it will acquire DirecTV for $48.5 billion, as it seeks fresh avenues of growth beyond the maturing U.S. cellular business. DirecTV shares lost $1.81 at $84.37.Equities have come under pressure, with consecutive weekly declines for the first time since January, as investors have become leery about growth prospects. Last week, readings on retail sales and consumer sentiment fell shy of expectations while labor and housing data provided reason for optimism. ""The issues really are more the U.S. economy and the fact equity investors are very hopeful we will see an acceleration in the economy,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.""We still get very mixed economic signals - one positive data point is in contrast with a negative data point.""Small-cap stocks, often the first beneficiaries of growth, have tumbled. The small-cap Russell 2000 index has several times approached correction territory, a decline of 10 percent from a recent high, only to bounce back slightly. Investors' defensive posture has been reflected by a sector rotation into utilities, telecoms and energy, which have outperformed the broader S&P 500 over the past three months.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.7 points or 0.05 percent, to 16,483.61, the S&P 500 gained 2.14 points or 0.11 percent, to 1,880 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 18.74 points or 0.46 percent, to 4,109.33.Campbell Soup Co fell 3.4 percent to $43.58, the worst performer on the S&P 500. The world's largest soup maker posted weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its full-year sales guidance.Earnings season will effectively draw to a close this week, with 23 companies scheduled to report, including retailers Home Depot and Lowe's Cos.Of 464 S&P 500 companies that reported through Friday, 69.2 percent beat expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent and the 66 percent average over the past four quarters.

163,"  NEW YORK May 20 Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam shot down rumors that the company was in potential merger talks with satellite operator Dish Network on Tuesday, days after rival AT&T announced plans to buy no 1. U.S. satellite operator DirecTV.""I know there are reports out there that we are talking to Dish. I can tell you now, that is someone's fantasy. There were not, and there are not, discussions going on with Dish,"" McAdam told investors at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference.""I don't think owning a satellite company is something I'm interested in at this point,"" he said adding the company's focus was on over-the-top programming, meaning content utilized over a network, but not offered by a network operator. On Monday, speculation that Verizon and Dish were in talks to merge pulled shares up at Dish. AT&T's plans to purchase DirecTV raises questions about Dish's next move. With 14 million subscribers, Dish trails DirecTV and has spent billions for wireless spectrum it has yet to use. Dish's chief, Charles Ergen, has said he does not have the cash to outbid AT&T for DirecTV. Dish tried to buy DirecTV in 2001 in a deal that was blocked by regulators.

164,"   By Liana B. Baker  AT&T Inc can pull out of its agreement to buy DirecTV if the satellite TV operator is unable to renew a deal with the National Football League to offer the popular NFL Sunday Ticket football package, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.The current DirecTV offer allows subscribers to watch football games outside of their local markets on Sundays. The exclusive package, which costs subscribers up to $300 a year, is an important tool for DirecTV to attract subscribers and the company has said about 2 million people receive the service.In a filing related to the acquisition, the companies said: ""the parties also have agreed that in the unlikely event that the company's agreement for the 'NFL Sunday Ticket' service is not renewed on substantially the terms discussed between the parties, AT&T may elect not to consummate the merger.""Investors have been watching closely to see whether DirecTV would renew the Sunday Ticket contract with the NFL, estimated to be worth $1 billion annually, with the potential to rise in value as part of a new agreement.The filing said that if a renewal isn't struck, AT&T will not be able to claim damages as long as DirecTV used its best efforts to get a deal done with the NFL. On a conference call with analysts on Monday, DirecTV CEO Mike White said he and AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson had spoken with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell as well as New England Patriots Owner Robert Kraft who heads the league's broadcast committee, and the parties were in ""positive and constructive"" discussions with the league.""I am still highly confident that we are going to get our deal done,"" White said, adding he expects a pact to be agreed by the end of the year, which would be before the acquisition closes.AT&T has said it expects the deal to take a year to close. A DirecTV spokesman said the company was ""totally comfortable"" with including the Sunday Ticket condition in the merger agreement.""DirecTV has been telling the world for months that we are comfortable that we will complete the NFL contract this year,"" the spokesman said.Representatives from AT&T and the NFL did not immediately respond to requests for comment. News of the condition may affect the negotiations between DirecTV and the league, said Neal Pilson, head of consulting firm Pilson Communications and the former president of CBS Sports.""It gives the NFL additional leverage knowing a $48 billion acquisition is depending upon the renewal,"" he said.A contract that renews DirecTV's exclusive deal would give the satellite operator a key marketing advantage over cable operators. Cable companies sought a deal in 2009, but DirecTV ended up renewing its agreement with the NFL for four years.The current agreement is due to expire at the end of the 2014-15 season, meaning there is one season to go under the previous terms.(Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Ken Wills)",2014-05-20,T,"Mon May 19, 2014 | 9:20pm EDT",AT&T-DirecTV merger may hinge on NFL agreement,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-att-directv-idUSBREA4I0I520140520?type=companyNews
165,"   By Liana B. Baker and Marina Lopes  May 21 AT&T Inc's planned takeover of DirecTV has been touted as a deal that will redefine video and broadband, but translating that to reality for a potential 70 million subscribers could take a while.Combining the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier with the No. 1 satellite TV provider could give the merged company greater leverage to negotiate prices with sellers of TV programming. One exciting benefit to consumers, AT&T has said, involves new service packages with DirecTV, Internet and home phone on one bill.""We all know from a customer standpoint the more you bundle the more advantageous it is from a value standpoint, from a pricing standpoint,"" AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on a media call on Sunday.But SNL Kagan cable analyst Ian Olgeirson pointed out that sale prices for new customers who sign up for combined services tend not to last. ""Where we've seen the industry be aggressive is in the bundled promotions and not on regular rates and I don't think this changes that,"" he said.AT&T said it will offer a three-year price guarantee on its standalone broadband service while DirecTV also pledged to keep its service available for the next three years, but not at a fixed cost. Bundles with DirecTV service, Internet and phone will only be available where AT&T is planning to expand its network, but not for every DirecTV customer. AT&T's U-Verse service, which includes Internet, television and home phone, is available in 22 states including Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Connecticut, Michigan and Ohio.AT&T has 11 million Internet subscribers out of 25 million homes in its service area, and has previously said it plans to extend its total reach to about 57 million homes by 2015. After the merger closes, AT&T would extend its broadband service to 15 million more homes within four years.AT&T said the plan would bring its total broadband reach to about 70 million U.S. households. Analysts said this would be viewed as a major public benefit and help smooth the way for regulatory approval of the merger. OVER THE TOP As for a video product that can be streamed over the Internet, both Verizon and smaller satellite provider Dish are several steps ahead of AT&T.Verizon earlier this year acquired Intel Corp's  media technology, as part of its plan to create such a service. Dish has said it expects to launch its personalized streaming product by year-end, having already struck a deal for programming from Walt Disney Co. AT&T CEO Stephenson said it would take 12 to 18 months for his company and DirecTV to come up with such a service, though both companies have been exploring how to deliver video over the Internet outside of a TV subscription known as an ""over the top"" service.On a conference call about the merger on Monday, Stephenson spoke about how AT&T customers will be able to see DirecTV content on phones, tablets, in autos, in airplanes and many other places after the merger.DirecTV CEO Mike White pointed to a bigger research and development budget on a conference call, but it remains unclear whether that content would only be available via Wifi connections or on AT&T's extensive wireless network. The latter option has generally been a non-starter for mobile phone users because of data restrictions, but AT&T could be in a position to lift such curbs in the case of DirecTV programming, said Brean Capital analyst Todd Mitchell.More broadly, analysts said the merger could eventually allow U.S. consumers, for the first time, to obtain video and wireless service from one provider.Liz Wile, a 26-year-old subscriber of AT&T's video and broadband service in Burbank, California, said she does not watch much video on her phone because of high data charges. The entertainment marketer said she wonders if AT&T and DirecTV could provide unlimited video without draining her data service.""I'm definitely one of those mobile people who does things on the go, so it would be nice when you're traveling to have access to your Internet content without worrying about it,"" she said.

Stephens also dismissed recent analyst suggestions that the company might have better synergy with DirecTV rival, Dish Network Corp, which owns licenses for wireless spectrum that could help AT&T carry heavier data traffic.He said a bid for Dish would have raised regulatory scrutiny due to the company's stated broadband ambitions and spectrum holdings, as regulators hope to raise interest in upcoming wireless spectrum auctions.

""I've never seen that before.""Pence fervently hopes his scooter is located, as the backup has a weak motor and requires him to use his foot to generate propulsion.

The filing adds details to a bid that has boggled some analysts who see little benefit to the mobile carrier. Pay TV operators have complained about rising programming costs, which take up a major chunk of operators' video revenue and hurt their margins.   AT&T expects to save roughly $650 million annually in the two years after the deal closes, and $1.6 billion annually in year three and after.

171,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to AT&T Inc.'s  (AT&T) proposed offering of senior unsecured 30-year notes. Proceeds are  expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of  maturing debt. AT&T's Issuer Default rating (IDR) is 'A'. The company's IDR and  debt securities remain on Rating Watch Negative, where they were placed on May  19 upon the announcement of the acquisition of DIRECTV. DIRECTV's wholly-owned  indirect subsidiary, DIRECTV Holdings LLC, has an IDR of 'BBB-'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch believes AT&T's acquisition of DIRECTV will improve its financial  flexibility owing to DIRECTV's strong free cash flows and the significant equity  component in the transaction financing. The addition of DIRECTV will also  strengthen AT&T's position in the evolving video landscape, offering the  potential to capitalize on trends for mobile video and over-the-top (OTT) video  delivery. Other benefits include the scale brought by DIRECTV's substantially  larger video subscriber base and the diversification of AT&T's revenue stream. DIRECTV's video assets are complementary to AT&T's operations, but the longer  term strategic benefits are less clear and depend on the post-merger company's  ability to capitalize on emerging trends in the industry. The Negative Watch reflects the modest increase in leverage for AT&T, pro forma  for the transaction. Currently, AT&T operates with leverage at the upper bounds  for the current 'A' rating. As currently proposed the transaction would likely  lead to a one-notch downgrade for AT&T to 'A-' and a Stable Outlook. On a pro  forma basis, Fitch estimates leverage in 2015 will be less than 2.0x. However,  the final rating would depend on any additional conditions placed on the  transaction by the regulatory approval process, an updated view of AT&T's  anticipated spectrum spending, and an assessment of AT&T's post-acquisition  financial policies.  For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended March 31, 2014, AT&T's net leverage as  calculated by Fitch was 1.8x, an increase from the 1.6x at year-end 2012. AT&T  has maintained relatively aggressive stock repurchases over a period when free  cash flow (FCF) has been lower due to temporary, growth-focused capital  spending, leading to additional borrowing. Modestly growing EBITDA is softening  the effect of the rise in debt on leverage. In Fitch's view, AT&T's liquidity is strong and supported by the company's cash,  FCF and availability on its revolving credit facilities (RCFs). At March 31,  2014, cash amounted to $3.6 billion and for the most recent LTM, AT&T produced  $3.1 billion in FCF (net cash provided by operating activities less capital  expenditures and dividends), an amount short of the $8.4 billion in stock  repurchases over the course of the same period. Fitch expects 2014 FCF to be  similar to the trend through the LTM ending March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2014, the company did not have any drawings on either its $5  billion RCF due 2018 or its $3 billion RCF due 2017. The principal financial  covenant for both facilities requires debt-to-EBITDA, as defined, to be no more  than 3x. At March 31, 2014, total debt outstanding was approximately $79.9 billion.  Relative to the company's expected FCFs, upcoming debt maturities are  manageable. For the remainder of 2014, debt maturities are approximately $4  billion, and in 2015, $8.2 billion. Maturities in 2015 include debt putable to  the company. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: The transaction as it currently stands will likely lead to a one-notch  downgrade of AT&T's rating to 'A-'. Positive: The rating could be affirmed at 'A' if the company's financial  policies targeted leverage of 1.6x to 1.7x by 2016. Contact: Primary Analyst John C.

However, recent advances have come in light trading, indicating the rally has lacked conviction. About 101,000 S&P 500 e-minis  contracts changed hands in morning trading on Tuesday, suggesting another day of light action.* The CBOE Volatility Index has also been lower than average, hovering near levels not seen since March 2013. While the current levels of the VIX indicate a lack of fear in the market, some investors are concerned it also reflects a sense of complacency among investors.* Trading catalysts could come later in the session, with the release of data on durable goods and factory orders, both for April and scheduled for release at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT). Factory orders are seen rising 0.5 percent in the month, a smaller advance than in March. The Institute for Supply Management's May read on New York economic activity is also on tap, due at 9:45 a.m. * S&P 500 futures fell 4 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures slid 26 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 12 points.* AT&T Inc dipped 0.5 percent to $35.25 in premarket trading after the Dow component forecast full-year revenue growth of 5 percent. * Pilgrim's Pride Corp confirmed a revised proposal to buy Hillshire Brands for $55 a share, an offer that values the company at $7.7 billion. Last week, Tyson Foods Inc  offered to buy Hillshire for $6.3 billion. Hillshire said it would conduct talks with both parties. Its stock rose 8.4 percent to $58.05 before the bell.* Element Financial Corp late Monday agreed to buy PHH Corp's auto fleet leasing business for about $1.4 billion in cash. Shares of PHH rose 5 cents to $25.30 before the bell.* Prosena Holding NV jumped 3.9 percent to $11 in heavy premarket trading after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration outlined a regulatory path for the accelerated approval of its lead drug.* Gladstone Commercial Corp was one of the premarket session's most active Nasdaq names, falling 4.2 percent to $16.80 after the company announced a common stock offering of an undisclosed size. Separately, Spherix Inc  rose 9.4 percent to $1.98 in heavy trading after the company announced $20 million in equity financing.(Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2014-06-03,T,"Tue Jun 3, 2014 | 8:34am EDT",US STOCKS-Futures point to lower open after record close,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL1N0OK0IE20140603?type=companyNews

179,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to AT&T Inc.'s  (AT&T) offering of senior unsecured Euro1.6 billion of global notes due 2024 and  Euro500 million of global notes due 2034. AT&T's Issuer Default rating (IDR) is  'A'. The company's IDR and debt securities remain on Rating Watch Negative,  where they were placed on May 19 upon the announcement of the acquisition of  DIRECTV. DIRECTV's wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, DIRECTV Holdings LLC,  currently has an IDR of 'BBB-'. Proceeds from this offering, combined with cash on hand a June 3, 2014 offering  in the amount of $2 billion, are expected to be used for general corporate  purposes, including the repayment of debt maturing from 2014 to 2016 with a  principal amount totaling approximately $4.4 billion.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch believes AT&T's acquisition of DIRECTV will improve its financial  flexibility owing to DIRECTV's strong free cash flows and the significant equity  component in the transaction financing. The addition of DIRECTV will also  strengthen AT&T's position in the evolving video landscape, offering the  potential to capitalize on trends for mobile video and over-the-top (OTT) video  delivery. Other benefits include the scale brought by DIRECTV's substantially  larger video subscriber base and the diversification of AT&T's revenue stream. DIRECTV's video assets are complementary to AT&T's operations, but the longer  term strategic benefits are less clear and depend on the post-merger company's  ability to capitalize on emerging trends in the industry. The Negative Watch reflects the modest increase in leverage for AT&T, pro forma  for the transaction. Currently, AT&T operates with leverage at the upper bounds  for the current 'A' rating. As currently proposed the transaction would likely  lead to a one-notch downgrade for AT&T to 'A-' and a Stable Outlook. On a pro  forma basis, Fitch estimates leverage in 2015 will be less than 2.0x. However,  the final rating would depend on any additional conditions placed on the  transaction by the regulatory approval process, an updated view of AT&T's  anticipated spectrum spending, and an assessment of AT&T's post-acquisition  financial policies.  For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended March 31, 2014, AT&T's net leverage as  calculated by Fitch was 1.8x, an increase from the 1.6x at year-end 2012. AT&T  has maintained relatively aggressive stock repurchases over a period when free  cash flow (FCF) has been lower due to temporary, growth-focused capital  spending, leading to additional borrowing. Modestly growing EBITDA is softening  the effect of the rise in debt on leverage. In Fitch's view, AT&T's liquidity is strong and supported by the company's cash,  FCF and availability on its revolving credit facilities (RCFs). At March 31,  2014, cash amounted to $3.6 billion and for the most recent LTM, AT&T produced  $3.1 billion in FCF (net cash provided by operating activities less capital  expenditures and dividends), an amount short of the $8.4 billion in stock  repurchases over the course of the same period. Fitch expects 2014 FCF to be  similar to the trend through the LTM ending March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2014, the company did not have any drawings on either its $5  billion RCF due 2018 or its $3 billion RCF due 2017. The principal financial  covenant for both facilities requires debt-to-EBITDA, as defined, to be no more  than 3x. At March 31, 2014, total debt outstanding was approximately $79.9 billion.  Relative to the company's expected FCFs, upcoming debt maturities are  manageable. Taking into account the repayment of maturing debt as noted above,  for the remainder of 2014, debt maturities are approximately $2.5 billion, and  in 2015, $6.5 billion. Maturities in 2015 include debt putable to the company. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: The transaction as it currently stands will likely lead to a one-notch  downgrade of AT&T's rating to 'A-'. Positive: The rating could be affirmed at 'A' if the company's financial  policies targeted leverage of 1.6x to 1.7x by 2016. Contact: Primary Analyst John C.

The merger will also face an antitrust review at the U.S. Department of Justice, where critics are expected to raise questions about the areas where AT&T's and DirecTV's TV services overlap. In Wednesday's filing, AT&T said that DirecTV cannot offer bundled services, while AT&T's video subscribers predominantly choose bundled services, meaning if they abandon AT&T they would be much likelier to switch to cable competitors.AT&T said it needed DirecTV's customer base to give it scale to compete with its ""principal competitors,"" Time Warner Cable and Comcast.

192,"  (Adds comments from AT&T CEO on capital investment, tax benefits)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, June 17 U.S. chief executives are slightly less positive about the economy's growth prospects this year and fewer of them expect to increase their capital expenditures in the next six months, according to a quarterly by the Business Roundtable released on Tuesday.The CEOs said they expected U.S. gross domestic product to rise by 2.3 percent in 2014, which is short of normal growth rates in past economic recoveries, according to the survey.In the last survey released in March, CEOs said they expected economic growth of 2.4 percent this year. ""CEO expectations for both investment and growth remain well below the potential of the U.S. economy and below what we should be experiencing at this stage of a recovery,"" said Randall Stephenson, chairman of Business Roundtable and chairman and CEO of AT&T Inc, in a press release.Only 44 percent of CEOs said they expected to increase their companies' capital investment in the next six months, down from 48 percent in the last survey.""There's broad consensus among many economists and policymakers, and obviously business people, that real improvement in economic growth is simply not on the cards if you don't have capital investments,"" Stephenson said on a conference call with reporters after the survey's release. Stephenson said the increased pessimism over capital expenditures during the second quarter was due in part to the expiration of dozens of business tax benefits at the end of 2013, referred to as ""tax extenders,"" and the failure of Congress thus far to reinstate those benefits.""It's not a surprise when you have a significant increase in tax outlays that would have an impact on investment,"" Stephenson told reporters. On a positive note in the second-quarter survey, 43 percent of respondents said they expected to hire more people in the next six months, up from 37 percent in March.The survey, conducted between May 14 and June 4, had responses from 131 member CEOs. Of those, 73 percent said they expected their sales would increase, compared with 72 percent a quarter ago. And fewer expect sales to decline: only 2 percent versus 5 percent in March.The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index - a composite of investment, sales and hiring expectations - rose to 95.4 in the second quarter from 92.1 in the first quarter. A reading above 50 indicates economic growth is expected.The Business Roundtable, which advocates for public policy, has put at the top of its agenda pushing for corporate tax and immigration reform, as well as expanded trade agreements.

215,"  (Adds quote from CEO, background on subscribers and details)By Marina LopesWASHINGTON, July 10 Verizon Communications Inc  had a net addition of over 1.4 million postpaid subscribers in the second quarter, its chief executive said on Thursday, a dramatic increase from the first quarter, when customer growth fell short of expectations.The company also saw record growth in its tablet business and very strong growth in its smartphone business, Lowell McAdam, Verizon's chief executive, said in an interview on CNBC on Thursday, two weeks before the release of its second-quarter earnings.""The second quarter will be strong for us, which is an indication that the whole industry is very strong,"" said McAdam. Verizon's stock was up 1.3 percent at $49.54 in afternoon trading and was the best performer in the Dow Jones.Verizon, which is expected to announce second-quarter earnings on July 22, posted a 20 percent decline last quarter in net additions of its postpaid customers -- those who subscribe to monthly calling plans -- as it hesitated to offer the aggressive discounts popular with its competitors. McAdam also said Verizon is open to purchasing Dish Network Corp's spectrum, or airwave licenses.""Dish has got some great spectrum. Spectrum is the life and  blood of the  mobile industry."" McAdam said. ""Anything around spectrum is always of interest for us."" But he emphasized the company is not interested in acquiring Dish, refuting rumors that arose following rival AT&T's  $48.5 billion bid for satellite operator DirecTV.""I haven't seen a scenario that owning a satellite company is of interest to us, not being critical of any other deal out there,"" he added.McAdam also commented on a dispute the company had last month with video streaming service Netflix, when Netflix began sending messages to its customers blaming Verizon's broadband service for slow deliveries of its TV shows and movies.McAdam said Verizon allows users access to all lawful content, but that Netflix should pay for priority access for faster service because video streaming takes up 100 percent more capacity than surfing the web.

216,"   By Mark Felsenthal | WASHINGTON, July 11  WASHINGTON, July 11 President Barack Obama is enlisting several major U.S. and multinational companies to draw attention to an initiative aimed at helping small businesses expand and hire workers.The president will meet on Friday with representatives of household name firms such as Apple, AT&T, Coca Cola and Johnson & Johnson to spotlight the corporate giants' pledge to pay their smaller suppliers within 15 days.The speedy payout puts more money in the coffers of smaller firms and helps them invest and hire workers, the president and his aides say.For the larger companies, the initiative ensures that their own suppliers are robust and ""demonstrates a recognition that a healthy supply chain is good for business,"" the White House said in a statement. Frustrated by a legislative stalemate with the Republican-led House of Representatives, Obama has vowed to act unilaterally when he can to achieve his agenda, and the announcement Friday is typical of the sorts of modest initiatives the White House has unveiled.This approach has antagonized congressional Republicans who say the president has overstepped executive branch authority. House Republicans on Thursday made public a ""discussion draft"" of legislation to authorize legal action against the president for misusing executive orders and other unilateral actions to advance his agenda.The supplier initiative is based on a similar program for government contractors. The federal government promises to pay contractors quickly if those companies in turn commit to rapidly pay the smaller firms that supply them. The White House says that arrangement affected 172,000 small businesses and generated over $1 billion for them to invest and hire workers since it was launched three years ago. The president was due to renew that program on Friday as well as announcing the public sector initiative.Other firms attending the White House event include CVS , FedEx, IBM, Lockheed Martin, and Walgreens.Honda, Toyota, Rolls Royce, Ericsson, and Westinghouse are also among the corporate participants in the White House event.

224,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In the days after its infamously mishandled initial public offering in May 2012, it looked as if Facebook would struggle to become a must-own for fund managers. Now the company's $190 billion market value makes it bigger than such bellwethers as Coca-Cola and AT&T. It's not a member of the Dow industrials, but if it were, it would be larger than two-thirds of that index's 30 members. Shares of the world's No. 1 social network touched a record high of $76.74 on Thursday after earnings and revenues easily topped analysts' forecasts, boosting its market value to nearly $194 billion. That ranks it 15th in the Standard & Poor's 500 benchmark index, just below the $196 billion market cap of International Business Machines Corp. ""A 100-year-old company with real assets versus a company admittedly with virtual assets and they are trading at the same market cap – crazy,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The speed of Facebook's rise to mega-cap status is what's notable. It took Apple Inc nearly three decades to achieve such a market value; Google Inc needed five years.Facebook has only been public for a little more than two years, and only joined the S&P 500 seven months ago. Since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the addition on Dec. 11, Facebook shares have risen 54 percent.The gains represent a reversal of fortune for the social media company. After a botched IPO that infuriated investors in May 2012, the stock slumped, underperforming for 15 months before finally eclipsing its offering price of $38 in August 2013. Since then, Facebook shares have been unstoppable, doubling in less than a year.""People understand the world is moving to mobile, and when you look at the time spent on mobile, Facebook has the lion's share,"" said Walter Price, senior portfolio manager and managing director of the AllianzGI Global Technology fund, which owned more than a million shares as of June 30.  The firm has leveraged its position by selling put options, or negative bets on the stock, and buying more call options, or bets on the shares rising further. ""This is a momentum stock you can put a P/E on,"" Price said.Facebook's rally has left e-commerce giant Amazon Inc in the dust. That company's value peaked around $187 billion in January, but closed Thursday at $165 billion. Amazon reported disappointing results afterwards, which dragged down its stock by 7 percent, valuing the company around $153 billion.Facebook's market cap is still dwarfed by the roughly $403 billion in combined market cap for the two classes of Google shares, arguably the most similar in terms of revenue generation. However, Facebook tops The Coca-Cola Co by about $15 billion and Disney by more than $40 billion.SHORT, QUICK TRIP   Apple, the S&P 500's most valuable company, needed nearly three decades before its market value finally rose to more than $190 billion, surpassing that level in late December 2009. Google's move was swifter. The company went public in August 2004, and posted a closing market value of more than $190 billion for the first time in October 2007, right around the S&P's peak before the financial crisis.That's not to say there aren't detractors. StarMine, a Thomson Reuters company, sees Facebook as more overvalued than 95 percent of the companies in its stock universe. Using expected growth rates over the next decade, StarMine puts an intrinsic value of $29 on the stock. It has a high price-to-earnings ratio of 42, more overvalued than 90 percent of the stocks StarMine tracks.However, the stock's relentless march has left few willing to stand in its way. Investors betting on the stock falling have dried up. In August 2012, more than 80 percent of shares available for short bets were being borrowed by investors expecting the stock to drop, according to Markit. Now, just 0.4 percent of shares available are being used for short bets.   Of the 43 analysts with recommendations on the stock, 37 are ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" ratings, with six ""hold"" ratings. ""If you were looking to short names that were ridiculously overvalued and people were not even thinking the growth was going to continue, I wouldn't put Facebook in that category,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. ""That being said, do I buy Facebook here? From my perspective, I am a value investor - I wouldn't get anywhere near it with a 10-foot pole.""         That acceptance of Facebook's legitimacy as a successful and viable company makes the comparison to the classic names that now surround it on the market cap list more palatable.""In some respects, Facebook speaks to a demographic shift in the way retailing, social media and virtually every other component of people’s lives is being bundled,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. ""Investors are starting to see the brilliance of this platform in ways that haven’t to date really captured the imagination of many.""

229,"   By Marina Lopes, Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The long-anticipated merger of Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N is not expected to occur before September, with the companies continuing due diligence and preparing a detailed case for a deal before U.S. regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.Japan's SoftBank Corp (9984.T), which controls Sprint, and T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE) have agreed to broad terms of a deal, under which Sprint would pay around $40 per share for T-Mobile, valuing the smaller rival at nearly $32 billion, Reuters reported in early June. Despite agreeing to other key terms such as break-up fees, the proposed transaction is taking extra time to finalize, partly because the companies are keen to bulletproof their arguments for a merger that is sure to face heavy regulatory scrutiny, two of the people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.All the people asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Representatives for Deutsche Telekom could not be immediately reached for comment, while representatives for Sprint, T-Mobile and SoftBank declined to comment.Analysts see the regulatory challenge as the biggest hurdle facing the companies since both the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) have expressed a desire to have at least two more network operators competing against the market leaders AT&T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N). SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son has argued to U.S. regulators that a merger would give the companies leverage to compete against the two dominant rivals. A combined Sprint-T-Mobile would boast more than 100 million subscribers, still behind both Verizon and AT&T.SoftBank is also likely to argue that the huge pending mergers of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, and AT&T with DirecTV DTV.O, would further marginalise Sprint and T-Mobile. But top U.S. antitrust and communications enforcers have already warned that the wireless market is too concentrated. In 2011 the Justice Department stopped a bid by AT&T to buy struggling T-Mobile.Others say recent approval of a merger between US Airways and American Airlines was a sign regulators could be convinced of the merits of a deal that reduces the number of competitors but creates a stronger number three.

Equities recovered from an initial selloff that took the S&P 500 to its 100-day moving average, which provided technical support. But the benchmark gave up an earlier 0.4 percent advance by mid-afternoon.The S&P 500 telecom services sector slipped 1.5 percent as the worst performing industry, with AT&T and Verizon down on news that Sprint, facing regulatory resistance, gave up its bid for T-Mobile. Sprint lost 18.3 percent to $5.94 and T-Mobile fell 8 percent to $31.19.Investors were leery after NATO reported Russia has around 20,000 combat-ready troops on the eastern border of Ukraine that it could use to invade under the pretext of a humanitarian or peace-keeping mission. Further souring the mood, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Moscow's biggest economic response to Western sanctions so far. ""On the domestic side, we're seeing markets that are see-sawing and still appearing to be assessing damage from volatility over the last few days,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner of Mayflower Advisors in Boston.""Everything seems to be taking a backseat to concerns in Russia and Ukraine right now.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.2 points, or 0.12 percent, to 16,449.67, the S&P 500 was up 1.33 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,921.54 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 9.22 points, or 0.21 percent, to 4,362.05. Market reaction was initially muted after data showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than expected in June to the lowest reading since January. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs were among Wall Street banks that raised economic growth estimates on the back of that figure.Walgreen Co shares fell 12.2 percent to $60.66 after it said it would not use a full takeover of Europe's biggest pharmacy chain Alliance Boots to move its domicile overseas. The decision came a day after the Obama administration said it was considering administrative actions to discourage corporate inversions that are aimed at reducing tax bills.Cognizant Technology shares took a beating, falling 14.2 percent to $42.88. The IT services provider forecast its slowest full-year sales growth in its 20-year history.On the upside, Molson Coors Brewing Company gained 6.2 percent to $71.37 after better-than-expected earnings.21st Century Fox Corp was another winner, its shares up 4.7 percent to $32.78, after the company pulled its $80-billion offer to buy Time Warner Inc on Tuesday.

At the time, Comcast said the network should be put up for sale and that it was prepared to bid. The sports network owes the Astros $27.8 million for unpaid licensing fees from its 2013 season, and it has not paid the team at all for 2014, according to court documents.The Rockets was owed $44.4 million for its 2013-14 season,  court documents say.The network plans to repay some of what it owes the teams by pursuing legal claims against Comcast for exerting undue influence over the network and attempting to it at a knock-down price, according to court documents. Regional sports networks have risen sharply in value in recent years, thanks to exclusive rights to broadcast games and the loyalties of sports fans. The Houston network was formed in 2003 by the Astros and Rockets to broadcast their games as well as games of the Houston Dynamo soccer team and 150 college games.

The Rockets was owed $44.4 million for its 2013-14 season,  court documents say.The network plans to repay some of what it owes the teams by pursuing legal claims against Comcast for exerting undue influence over the network and attempting to it at a knock-down price, according to court documents.Regional sports networks have risen sharply in value in recent years, thanks to exclusive rights to broadcast games and the loyalties of sports fans.

233,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON T-Mobile US TMUS.N will overtake Sprint Corp (S.N) as the No. 3 wireless U.S. carrier in subscribers by the end of the year, Chief Executive John Legere tweeted on Thursday.The declaration came a day after T-Mobile said it surpassed Sprint as the No. 1 wireless provider for prepaid customers, with 15.64 million users, compared with Sprint's 15.19 million.The figures put T-Mobile, which calls itself the ""uncarrier,"" well ahead of rivals AT&T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N)  in the prepaid market. Verizon and AT&T hold a larger share of the more profitable postpaid U.S. subscriber base. ""I predict the #uncarrier will overtake @Sprint in total customers by the end of the year! There, I said it!,"" tweeted Legere.  A spokeswoman for Sprint declined comment. While T-Mobile has been adding record numbers of subscribers through promotions and campaigns, Sprint customers have been leaving in droves because of service problems arising from carrier's network overhaul. Earlier this week, Sprint's parent company, SoftBank Corp (9984.T), walked away from its offer to buy T-Mobile and replaced Sprint CEO Dan Hesse with Miami businessman Marcelo Claure. Legere, known for his outspoken style, did not waste time in engaging with his new competitor, and tweeted at Claure on Thursday ""Sorry @marceloclaure, you're already behind!.""While T-Mobile's aggressive strategy has helped the company turn around, its parent company, Deutsche Telekom (9984.T), has been concerned that its lack of low-frequency spectrum and fixed-line infrastructure is hampering its ability to compete. The company will have to spend an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion in the upcoming auction of radio frequency waves, according to one analyst, the first public auction of valuable low-frequency airwaves in nearly a decade.T-Mobile shares were down 4.3 percent and Sprint shares were down 0.8 percent after falling nearly 20 percent on Wednesday.

243,"   By Alina Selyukh | Sept 8  Sept 8 AT&T Inc on Monday said Spain's Telefonica SA will license its home security technology for limited trials in Europe as the U.S. carrier hopes it has found a new way to profit from its nascent connected-home business.Telefonica will offer European customers a version of Digital Life, AT&T's home monitoring and automation system, for three to six months before evaluating results of the trial, said Steven Bartholomew, a Telefonica spokesman.AT&T, which released the Digital Life platform in the United States in spring 2013, is in talks with numerous other potential global partners about similar licensing agreements, said AT&T Mobility CEO Glenn Lurie.""We spent a lot of money building the platform ... This is just another way to take those same assets and monetize them, and not just in the U.S., but globally,"" Lurie said in an interview. ""International (licensing) we think is one of the largest revenue opportunities on top of the core business in the U.S.,"" he said, adding that the company is also looking to expand its connectivity system to small businesses and healthcare.AT&T's Digital Life service allows consumers to connect to the Internet various home appliances and processes - such as lights, thermostats, smoke detectors, security cameras or locks - so they can be monitored or controlled remotely.AT&T has said it expected to eventually grow Digital Life into a $1 billion annual revenue stream, but the company has not disclosed the profitability of the platform so far. Lurie said AT&T could license Digital Life to foreign partners either in parts, such as software only, or in its entirety.Neither company's representative elaborated on the specific content of their particular licensing agreement or the terms of the licensing, which are individually negotiated and rarely disclosed. Typically such deals involve up-front and per-customer payments, among other fees. ""We are not able to fully disclose how much of the platform we are going to use,"" Telefonica's Bartholomew said in an email. But he highlighted some of the core elements, such as the digital user experience and the remote management system, as expected to provide consumers ""with a unique and strong user experience.""Bartholomew said the Telefonica-branded service will be a version of AT&T's product adapted to the European market. He also said it was too soon to comment on where exactly the trials will take place.Telefonica had approached AT&T about licensing its Digital Life platform after the U.S. wireless carrier showcased it at Mobile World Congress, the international consumer electronics show, Lurie said.""We've looked at platforms from a large number of vendors - we believe the AT&T Digital Life platform to be best in class,"" said Bartholomew.

Indiana said it was looking at the deal but declined to say if it was working with the group of state attorneys general. It is not unusual for attorneys general to join a Justice Department investigation of a major merger that potentially affects consumers in their state.Asked about the expanded investigation, AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris said: ""We look forward to discussions with these state attorneys generals on the significant consumer benefits created by this merger."" While antitrust experts have said they expect the AT&T deal to be approved, the proposed transaction has raised hackles for several reasons.One is because of lost competition in the estimated quarter of U.S. homes where AT&T, the No. 2 wireless carrier, offers U-Verse, fiber optic delivery of television programming, high-speed Internet and home phone service. DirecTV, a satellite alternative to local cable providers, is present in those markets.The attorneys general also are looking at programming issues, one source said. Content producers and smaller cable operators worry that the combined company might wield too much power over the creation, distribution and costs of programming. They also are asking questions about the merger's effects on the development of high-speed broadband. As part of the deal, AT&T pledged to expand broadband to 70 million consumer locations.The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission must sign off on both deals before they can close.

249,"  (Corrects details of AT&T offer in fourth to last paragraph)By Marina LopesWASHINGTON, Sept 10 T-Mobile US added 2.75 million customers in August, the largest number of monthly subscriber additions in its history, the carrier announced at a company event on Wednesday.Led by quirky Chief Executive John Legere, the third-largest wireless operator in the U.S. has turned around years of subscriber losses through aggressive promotions in the past year and a half.The company also announced that it will enable its phones to allow customers to seamlessly be transferred onto WiFi networks where its network doesn't reach. While rivals Verizon and AT&T networks stretch almost across the country, T-Mobile's network is clustered around urban centers.Current subscribers can trade in their devices for phones enabled with Wifi connectivity when they sign up for the company's early upgrade program. The carrier is also offering a free personal CellSpot site customers can place wherever they lack coverage.The move comes the day after Apple Inc. announced it will release an iPhone programmed with technology to allow automatic shifts between WiFi and carrier networks. ""Apples announcement set the road map for this,"" said Legere at the event. ""It gives us the option to turn the wireless industry on its head starting with trashing the old rules about where cellular ends and WiFi begins,"" he said.T-Mobile customers will also now be able to use the setting to make free calls internationally.Major wireless carriers have amped up their promotions in the face of the Apple's new iPhone 6 release on Tuesday, in an attempt to poach customers from each other in a nearly saturated market. Earlier on Wednesday, AT&T announced it is offering customers the iPhone 6 with no immediate down payment required when subscribers sign up for its equipment installment plan.Sprint Corp announced on Tuesday a program that allows customers to lease the iPhone 6 and get the latest iPhone model every two years for $20 a month when they sign up for an unlimited plan.Verizon Communications will give subscribers who trade in an old iPhone a free iPhone 6 in exchange for a two-year contract.Earlier in the week, T-mobile announced it will match any  deal in the industry.

255,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 17 (Fitch) An acquisition by AT&T Inc. of America Movil  S.A.B. de C.V.'s (AMX) assets, valued at roughly $17.5 billion, would only have  a modest credit impact for AT&T, according to Fitch Ratings. Media rumors have  indicated the value of the assets under discussion using a valuation of five to  seven times EBITDA. However, no concrete details have emerged regarding key  components. AT&T reportedly has been approached by AMX regarding potential interest in a  portion of AMX's assets in Mexico. AMX plans to sell operational assets in order  to reduce its market share below 50%, and thus cease to be a 'preponderant  economic agent.' AMX has indicated the sale will only take place at a fair  market value, and only if it will be allowed to provide convergent services  after the divestiture without being subject to unfavorable regulations.  Based on the rumored asset value and range of EBITDA multiples, an acquisition  would not have a material impact on AT&T's credit profile following its  combination with DIRECTV, and Fitch's possible rating actions surrounding the  DIRECTV acquisition. We believe the impact would not be material, even if the  acquisition was entirely debt funded. Fitch currently has AT&T's 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Rating Watch  Negative in view of the incremental leverage resulting from its anticipated  acquisition of DIRECTV (IDR of 'BBB-'). Upon the announcement of that  transaction, we stated that, as proposed, the DIRECTV transaction would likely  lead to a one-notch downgrade to 'A-' and a Stable Rating Outlook.  We estimate that AT&T's leverage in 2015 following the DIRECTV acquisition would  be under 2.0x; the addition of the AMX assets based on some very preliminary  assumptions would lead to leverage of slightly over 2.0x, but still within range  of an 'A-' rating. A final evaluation of the rating would encompass, and could  be affected by, the regulatory approval process for both transactions, potential  spectrum spending and AT&T's potential financial policies. AT&T will materially increase its scale upon completion of the DIRECTV  acquisition, adding a large pay-TV business to its already large wireless and  wireline businesses. Therefore, we believe the potential acquisition of the AMX  assets would not have a material effect on its credit profile. On an LTM pro  forma basis ending June 2014, a combined AT&T and DIRECTV would have nearly $163  billion in revenue and more than $50 billion in EBITDA.  The size of the post-acquisition company poses challenges regarding the  acquisition of other material high-growth businesses in the US. Therefore, Fitch  believes it likely that AT&T will have to turn abroad in order to seek  opportunities with the potential for meaningful impact on growth. In the US,  solid organic growth opportunities remain in the wireless business and certain  strategic elements of the wireline business, but further participation in  wireless consolidation has been foreclosed by regulators.  AT&T has stated that the Latin American region is one where growth opportunities  for the company have been identified. AT&T has extensive experience in the  region through its long-time ownership of AMX. This stake was divested in June  2014 as part of the DIRECTV transaction, given DIRECTV's extensive assets in  Latin America. Contact: John C.

266,"   By Marina Lopes and Bernie Woodall | WASHINGTON/DETROIT  WASHINGTON/DETROIT Verizon Communications, the No.1 U.S. wireless carrier known for its widespread coverage, is falling behind its biggest rival in what many are betting will be the next big thing in the wireless industry: connected cars. The reason? Simply put, the type of network Verizon uses isn't global. The $1.7 trillion wireless industry has just about reached capacity for growth, and mobile companies are turning to connected devices for future revenue. Connected cars, which hook up with a wireless network, currently allow you to do everything from turning an auto into a Wifi link for other devices, to honking its horn from anywhere in the world. The cars are also able to update software remotely.The market for such technology is just getting ramped up. It produced revenue of $8 billion in 2013 and is expected to bring in $20 billion annually by 2018, according to Juniper Research.So far, AT&T has announced deals with brands at eight automakers and Verizon is trailing with four announced deals. Sprint has announced two and T-Mobile has announced one. The value of such deals have not been disclosed. Verizon, for its part, rejects the notion that it is falling behind. It says it is offering more robust services to consumers and auto makers than its rivals. GLOBAL ADVANTAGE But AT&T appears to have the edge because its network uses specifications that have become a global standard, analysts and consultants said. Verizon's network specs are only used in a handful of countries.  While that hasn't stopped Verizon from becoming the United States' most popular carrier, it puts the company at a disadvantage with automakers who want to manufacture cars that work on a common standard worldwide.AT&T has also developed a universal SIM card for cars, tractors and shipments that can be programmed remotely to adapt to networks around the world. Verizon has to install location-specific settings on cars depending on where they are shipped.The global reach of AT&T's network type was a key factor in Audi's decision to sign a deal with AT&T in early September. ""We needed a foreign app that was acceptable in Europe and the U.S.,"" said Brad Stertz, Audi's corporate communications manager. ""That narrowed the choices for us at that point.""Unlike AT&T's 3G network, Verizon's does not allow customers to make a phone call and access the Internet at the same time. So in an emergency, Verizon's connected cars can't diagnose problems with vehicle through its data network and call the customer through the car at the same time. This factor was one of the reasons General Motors Co. signed a deal with AT&T in February 2013 for a new line of connected cars, after almost 20 years in partnership with Verizon. ""We all multi-task every day, so why shouldn't our cars multi-task?"" said Kevin Jackson, a connected customer specialist at General Motors.THE COMEBACK?  That's not to say that Verizon cannot catch up. A new wave of technology known as Long-Term Evolution will eventually override the distinction between the two network types. By transforming voice calls into data, the technology will allow Verizon users to place calls and access the internet simultaneously. But analysts said automakers may have to wait until 2020 before the technology can be reliably used. At that point, they add, it may be too little, too late for Verizon.  Verizon's president of Telematics, Erik Goldman disagrees. The company, which in 2012 bought Hughes Telematics, a maker of voice and data connectivity systems for cars, is not providing just a wireless connection, he said.The company answers customer help lines for support on vehicles, trains car dealers to know how to properly activate the connection in the cars and helps customers with billing issues. Unlike AT&T, the company does not partner with any third party for these services.""Our strategy is to do the entire ecosystem ourselves. It allows us to participate up and down the value chain,"" said Goldman. Another sign of life for Verizon: Wireless carriers often sign deals not with an automaker as a whole, but for a particular make and model of a line of cars, leaving Verizon plenty of opportunities to score deals with automakers around the world.For example, AT&T's deal with Audi only encompasses the A3 and Q3 cars, leaving other Audi models up for grabs. Said Elizabeth Kerton executive director of the Autotech Council, which connects car companies with technologies and start ups: ""I would not recommend AT&T get lazy.""

A shrinking base of new customers has made the wireless industry increasingly competitive, with carriers slashing prices and launching new plans every few weeks as they vie for customers.

271,"  (Adds details on AT&T bid; updates shares)By Lisa RichwineLOS ANGELES Oct 1 DirecTV extended its exclusive contract to sell the Sunday Ticket package of National Football League games, and sources said the company will pay $1.5 billion a year to keep the popular offering that has helped attract subscribers.The agreement announced on Wednesday removes a potential roadblock to AT&T Inc's proposed $48.5 billion purchase of the satellite TV provider. AT&T had the right to pull out of the deal if DirecTV was unable to renew its Sunday Ticket pact.Sources familiar with the agreement said DirecTV's annual payments to the NFL would average $1.5 billion for eight years. DirecTV sells the package of Sunday games to its subscribers for about $300 a year, a key marketing advantage over cable TV competitors. Roughly 2 million people receive the service, which allows them to watch games outside of their local markets.NFL games rank among the most-viewed shows on television. Americans are tuning in at even greater numbers this year than last year, according to early season ratings, a sign that a domestic violence scandal has not dented the league's overall popularity. DirecTV pays an estimated $1 billion annually for its current Sunday Ticket rights, which were set to expire at the end of the 2014-2015 season.The new agreement expands DirecTV's rights to stream the games live on mobile devices and broadband. The company will continue to broadcast the NFL Red Zone Channel and the DirecTV Fantasy Zone channel. The cost increase DirecTV will pay is at the low end of the company's guidance to investors, a DirecTV spokesman said.Regulators are still reviewing AT&T's proposed purchase of DirecTV.Shares of DirecTV rose $1.16, or 1.3 percent, in after-hours trading to $87.75.

272,"   By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON AT&T Inc (T.N) will pay $105 million to settle allegations that it put unauthorized charges on customers' cell phone bills, a practice known as cramming, federal regulators said on Wednesday. The settlement comes after years of complaints from cell phone owners about being charged for services like daily horoscopes or trivia that they never requested. It was negotiated by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and all state attorneys general.AT&T will pay $80 million to refund customers while $20 million is earmarked for penalties and fees to all 50 U.S. states and Washington, said the FTC. The FCC also fined the company $5 million. The FTC alleged that for companies whose billing was handled by AT&T, as many as 40 percent of subscribers complained about the charges.""What’s shocking to me, as I thought about this particular settlement, is that we’re talking about reputable companies like AT&T and others. This isn’t, you know, Phil’s Phone Shack that’s doing this,"" said Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler. Prodded by state attorneys general, AT&T, T-Mobile US TMUS.N, Verizon (VZ.N) and Sprint (S.N) agreed in November to stop billing customers for such third-party services. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler estimated that 20 million consumers a year are crammed, and said other wireless providers were under scrutiny. ""Stay tuned,"" said Wheeler, hinting of potential actions against other carriers.      AT&T said it had ""rigorous protections"" against unauthorized billing but it eventually scrapped what it called premium short messaging services, or PSMS. ""We reached a broad settlement to resolve claims that some of our wireless customers were billed for charges from third-parties that the customers did not authorize. This settlement gives our customers who believe they were wrongfully billed for PSMS the ability to get a refund,"" an AT&T spokesman said in an emailed statement. FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said consumers were often hit with $9.99 charges lumped together into ""AT&T monthly subscriptions"" on their bills. When customers protested, Ramirez said, ""Instead of acting to stop the charges, AT&T continued to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the practice by taking at least 35 percent of every charge and refused to provide refunds to many consumers.""The FTC has also moved against the smaller companies which originate the charges.  The FCC and the Justice Department are reviewing AT&T's proposal to buy DirecTV (DTV.N) for $48.5 billion.In July, the FTC filed a complaint against T-Mobile USA, accusing the wireless provider of cramming.

Faced with growing competition, wireless carriers have dumped two-year contracts and replaced them with equipment financing plans, which reduce service fees but eliminate subsidies for devices. But the increase in customers bringing their own devices also reduced the number of customers signing up for equipment financing, weighing on revenue further. AT&T shares fell 1.5 percent to $34 in extended trade after closing at $34.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company reported a record low number of contract customer defections, but average revenue per phone user fell 8 percent from a year earlier.

""But the way the brick is built and the chain-link fence, it's possible the ball can go any which way.""Speedy outfielder Dyson, who frequently comes into a game as a late-inning defensive replacement, said the angle often shoots a ball away from the right-field line. ""It kicks away from you, everything goes towards right-center,"" Dyson told Reuters after practice.That is, unless it hits the softer, lower part of the wall and drops with a thud.""There's a lot of ground to cover, which is in our favor,"" Dyson suggested, referencing the Royals' speed in the spacious outfield. ""Hopefully (batted balls) don't get above, where we can't catch it, and have to play it off the wall. If we do, just try to make sure we don't look crazy out there.""And then there is the wind, often blowing in hard off China Basin, the section of San Francisco Bay directly behind the wall.In the National League Championship Series both the Giants and Cardinals misjudged fly balls they thought would hit high off the wall or over it for home runs only to see them knocked down by wind for what should have been potential catches. ""You have to be careful. There's a lot of uneven surfaces out there,"" said Aoki, who has previously played in San Francisco's stadium from when he was with the Milwaukee Brewers.""We have to back each other up as best as we can. ""It might be better to have the mental image that two people are going after the ball,"" he said, stressing the importance of backing one another up.

291,"   By Rory Carroll | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Oct 28 Ten years ago, when San Francisco's AT&T Park became the first sport's stadium to offer free Wi-Fi to fans, it was considered a novelty.Fewer than 100 people connected to the network per game that first season, and those that did, did not necessarily endear themselves to their fellow Major League Baseball fans.""Back then, people would kind of laugh at you if were using your laptop and popped in a Wi-Fi card (during a game),"" said Bill Schlough, senior vice president & chief information officer for the San Francisco Giants.Fast-forward to Sunday's World Series game, when half of the sold-out crowd at the waterside stadium connected to the Wi-Fi network, and it's plain to see that wireless technology has gone from novelty to necessity for fans.Thousands of jubilant orange and black-clad Giants fans held their phones out during the ninth inning on Sunday night, trying to capture the final out of the final home game of the year.To keep up with the growing demand for bandwidth, the ballpark will install hundreds of additional under-the-seat Wi-Fi antennas during the offseason as well as some in hand rails, Schlough said.Doing so is an expensive and labor-intensive undertaking, but one that is necessary to cater to the Bay Area's tech-savvy baseball fans, who consider being able to post photos and videos from the games on Facebook, Twitter, Vine and other social networks instantly a key element of the experience.""That's what it's all about when you get to the biggest event in our sport -- letting all your friends know you were here and sharing that experience with them,"" Schlough said. While the number of Wi-Fi users has jumped, it's the surge in the volume of data, driven by rapidly evolving cell phone technology, that's truly astounding.When the Giants appeared in the World Series in 2012, 38 percent of those in attendance connected to the network, but the total amount of data transferred through the Wi-Fi network was 370 gigabyte.On Sunday the number of WiFi users rose by about 12 percent, but the total amount of data transmitted by fans through the same network jumped nearly five-fold, to 1.57 terabytes.""We're reaching something of a saturation point in terms of the number of Wi-Fi devices, but people are doing more and more with video and photos on their devices,"" Schlough said. The advent of high-quality video technology as well as the proliferation of video sharing websites is a chief reason why the ballpark has to continually expand its broadband capabilities.""In 2012 when we won it all, there was no video. Vine wasn't around, Instagram video hadn't come on yet, GoPro was something we didn't use,"" said Bryan Srabian, director of social media for the Giants.""So video has definitely increased in terms of us creating short, sharable features in real time.""It is fitting that the city viewed by many as the crucible of technological innovation sports some of the country's most high-tech venues, including the San Francisco 49ers' brand new Levi's Stadium in Silicon Valley. The Giants tech team knows there is a lot riding on the wireless systems working correctly. A system crash during a high-profile game would be disastrous to fans and to AT&T, the communications behemoth which works side-by-side with the Giants to ensure fans can post and text without incident.This year's World Series games also served as the first major stadium test for the Apple iPhone 6's new Apple Pay system. After seeing it in action, Schlough said there is no going back.""It's revolutionary. I don't see people with iPhone 6s ever pulling out their wallet again at a stadium,"" he said.The success of the wireless systems at AT&T Park, which also includes an LTE network that services AT&T, Verizon and Sprint customers, has caught the attention of stadium operators around the world.""I've got people out here all the time from all the sports,"" Schlough said, adding that he was flown to South Korea to speak at a conference and has fielded questions from Australian stadium operators this year, too.He is always comparing notes with his counterparts in the United States as well.""When we turned the ballpark into a WiFi hotspot in 2004, we anticipated a future that's come to fruition. Now we've got 900 games under our belt and a lot of experience meeting our fan's needs,"" he said.

292,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government sued AT&T Inc (T.N) on Tuesday, alleging the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier sold consumers unlimited data plans but would reduce their Internet speeds once they exceeded a certain amount of data.The Federal Trade Commission said this throttling of Internet feeds was deceptive and that in some cases data speeds were slowed by nearly 90 percent.FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said that AT&T wanted to retain longtime customers and so allowed them to buy unlimited data plans, in some cases after new customers were no longer offered unlimited plans. Then they unilaterally changed the terms, she said.""They stopped providing the service that customers understood they had purchased when they entered into their contract,"" she said. ""Customers would be subject to an early termination fee if they wanted to get out of their existing contract.""AT&T called the allegations ""baseless"" and said the practice was needed to manage network resources.""We have been completely transparent with customers since the very beginning,"" said Wayne Watts, AT&T's general counsel. ""This program has affected only about 3 percent of our customers, and before any customer is affected, they are also notified by text message."" More than 3.5 million customers with legacy unlimited data plans had their Internet speeds slowed more than 25 million times by AT&T's practice, which began in October 2011, the FTC said. AT&T says on its support website that people with certain plans can experience data slowdowns once they exceed certain limits. Customers with a 3G smartphone will experience slowdowns after using 3 gigabytes of data in a month, while those with 4G LTE smartphones can use 5 gigabytes before potential slowdowns.Those who dislike the throttling can use Wi-Fi or switch to a different plan, AT&T says on its website. AT&T closed up 0.6 percent at $34.33 per share.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has said that his agency was troubled that some carriers singled out specific customers for throttling.The FCC is reviewing wireless carriers' data management practices after Verizon (VZ.N) in July announced that the top 5 percent of high-speed data users on its older unlimited data plans might experience slower speeds. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless provider, ultimately scrapped the plan for the higher-speed 4G network, though the policy is in effect for unlimited subscribers on the 3G network.  Sprint (S.N) and T-Mobile US TMUS.N continue to offer unlimited data plans.Earlier this month AT&T said it would pay $105 million to settle FTC allegations that it put unauthorized changes on customers' mobile phone bills.Separately, the Justice Department is currently reviewing AT&T's proposed purchase of DirecTV DTV.O.

""We have repeatedly made clear - both to our customers and more generally to the public - 'Comcast doesn't prioritize Internet traffic or have paid fast lanes, and we have no plans to do so,'"" Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen told Leahy in a letter dated Oct. 24 and viewed by Reuters late on Wednesday.AT&T, in its response on Thursday, said it had no plans to strike deals with third parties to prioritize traffic as it travels the so-called last mile of the network from the ISP's facilities to consumers' screens ""without the knowledge and direction of the end user.""The Federal Communications Commission received almost 4 million comments after it proposed new Web traffic, or ""net neutrality"" rules that prohibited ISPs from blocking content, but suggested allowing some ""commercially reasonable"" paid prioritization deals.  Verizon Communications Inc on Wednesday published its own response to Leahy, also asserting no plans for ""fast lane"" deals, and calling paid prioritization a ""phantasm"" and worries about it ""demagoguery, since no major ISP has expressed an interest in offering 'paid prioritization' and all agree that the FCC has a valid legal path to prohibit it.""

Instead, some critics have urged the FCC to reclassify ISPs so they are regulated more like public utilities. The broadband companies object, saying it would hamper investments and innovation.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)The U.S. Labor Department releases labor costs and productivity data for the third quarter. With productivity likely to fall, unit labor costs - a key gauge of inflation and profit pressures - are likely to jump, although the year-on-year gain is likely to show the trend is still quite subdued (0830/1330). The department also releases its latest reading on jobless claims, which have been trending lower in a sign the labor market continues to gradually tighten (0830/1330). Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans gives welcome remarks before the ""The New International Financial System: Analyzing the Cumulative Impact of Regulatory Reform"" conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Bank of England, in Chicago (1040/1540). Also speaking at the conference is Federal Reserve Board Governor Powell (1330/1830). Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester speaks on ""Federal Reserve Communications and Forward Guidance"" before the Money Marketeers of New York City (1915/0015).  ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", the highest-grossing movie of the year, is expected to boost fourth-quarter results for Dow component Walt Disney Co. Wall Street analysts on average expects the media and theme park giant to report earnings of 88 cents per share for the three months ended September, up from 77 cents a year earlier, according Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Satellite TV provider DirecTV is expected to report third-quarter earnings slightly below the average analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. DirecTV recently extended its exclusive contract to sell the Sunday Ticket package of National Football League games, effectively removing a roadblock to AT&T Inc's proposed $48.5 billion purchase of the company. Investors will watch for plans in Latin America, its largest growth area, after the completion of the merger as DirecTV was unwilling to explore opportunities in the region as a standalone company.  AOL Inc CEO Tim Armstrong proved last quarter that his change of strategy to focus more on advertising technology appears to be working. The digital media and entertainment company is expected to report third-quarter profit above estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by a growth in advertising revenue. The company is seeing advertising revenue fast replacing its earlier dial-up subscription service.  Cable company Cablevision Systems Corp is likely to beat the analysts' average estimate when it reports third-quarter results, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Cablevision has been focusing on boosting its profit by raising prices and cutting expenses - moves that have come at a cost as subscribers switch to providers offering better deals. However, the company is likely to offset some the impact of a fall in the number of video customers by higher advertising revenue and cable subscription rates. Also reporting third-quarter results is cable TV network AMC Networks Inc. The company is expected to report quarterly revenue above the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company is expected to report revenue growth in its international business, helped by the acquisition of Chellomedia, the owner of TV channels such as Buzz, Canal A, Cosmopolitan.  British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc is expected to report a decent third quarter, helped by the delayed arrival of a generic copy of ulcer pill Nexium in the United States and the strong launch of new diabetes pill Farxiga, which should help CEO Pascal Soriot justify a go-it-alone strategy.  Offshore drilling contractor Transocean Ltd is expected to post a lower third-quarter profit due to a fall in demand for its rigs as the market continues to be oversupplied. The recent slump in oil prices could hurt quarterly profit as oil and gas producers are likely to move further away from expensive offshore production. Investors will also look for comments on lower spending by customers in the coming months. Oil and gas company Apache Corp, in the midst of a plan to spin off or sell its international and LNG assets, is due to report third-quarter earnings ahead of a Nov. 20 meeting where it plans to provide a comprehensive overview of its operations.  Drugmaker Hospira Inc is expected to report a lower third-quarter profit as its sedative, Precedex, faced greater-than-expected competition from generics. While Hospira appeals the FDA ruling of allowing generics in the market, its earnings report will give investors more insight into the impact of competition from generic drugmakers. The company also received an FDA warning letter earlier this month about one of its facilities in Australia and has been embroiled in a number of nation-wide recalls this year - issues which the management is expected to address.  Nvidia Corp's third-quarter results may reflect how the PC chipmaker continues to struggle after getting squeezed out of the lucrative market for smartphone chips by much larger rival Qualcomm. Wall Street wants stronger evidence that their growth initiatives, centered around automobiles and ultra high-end graphics, are proceeding and contributing more to the bottom line.  The Wendy's Co, the third-largest hamburger company in the United States, is expected to miss estimates for both third-quarter profit and revenue, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The fast-food chain is struggling amidst tough competition from rivals like McDonald's and Burger King. Wendy's is also expected to suffer from a fall in traffic to its U.S.-based Wendy's restaurants despite revamping its image with new menu and restaurant renovations.  Molson Coors Brewing Co, which sells beers such as Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Carling, and Blue Moon, will report third-quarter results before the bell. The brewer has been helped by newer launches and higher growth in international markets, offsetting volume declines in the United States and Canada. It expects to spend higher on brand investments in the second half of this year.  Skyworks Solutions Inc, which supplies radio frequency chips to Apple, is expected to report fourth-quarter results that confirm its estimate that adjusted profit and revenue would be above its forecast. Skyworks has been benefiting from higher demand from handset makers, particularly Apple. The company's upbeat estimates come at a time when investors are concerned about a broad-based downturn in the semiconductor industry due to lower demand for electronic devices.  Auto parts maker Visteon Corp is expected to report a higher quarterly profit as global vehicle production rose 3 percent in the third quarter. Visteon's heating, ventilation and air conditioning for vehicles business, which accounts for more than two-thirds of its revenue, is expected to record higher sales in Europe and North America.  Struggling Zynga Inc is expected to shed more light on what exactly it's pinning its future growth prospects on after Facebook, several rounds of debilitating layoffs, and a broad management reshuffle. When the company reports third-quarter results, investors will want to see new ideas, not Farmville XXVII. Also reporting third-quarter results is King Digital Entertainment. King, the once red-hot Candy Crush Saga developer whose growth seemed to have peaked earlier this year, will twin its quarterly report card with details of what it's got up its sleeve to replace the runaway smash that delivered its early growth.  Online travel agency Orbitz Worldwide has benefited in the past year from higher U.S. leisure and business travel, which is being boosted by growing confidence in the U.S. economy. Analysts expect Orbitz to report third-quarter results similar to rival Expedia Inc and will be watching out for the company's estimate for global travel next year.  Handbag and accessories maker Kate Spade & Co has been struggling to ease the pressure on its margins as competition stiffens and spending in North America weakens. When the company reports third-quarter results, investors will be looking for any commentary on margins and the promotional environment. They will also keep an eye out for comments on how the company is poised to perform in the holiday season.  The European Central Bank meeting will be the main money event in Europe despite the fact that it is not likely to be one of action. As usual, the attention will be on ECB chief Mario Draghi's nuances at the news conference that follows the likely non-decision. The Bank of England looks also looks to keep interest rates on hold at record low levels after three of its most senior officials expressed staunch opposition to hiking rates in the last two weeks.   The Brazilian central bank releases the minutes from its last rate-setting meeting, in which policymakers shocked investors with a rate hike. In the minutes, the bank will explain in more detail why it decided to raise rates three days after the re-election of President Dilma Rousseff and signal if more increases are in store. Many investors saw the surprise hike as a signal that Rousseff will adopt more market-friendly policies in a second term to regain markets' confidence. Separately, Mexico's monthly central bank survey of inflation and growth is scheduled for release. This closely watched survey of economists by the central bank sheds light on analysts' expectations for growth and inflation.

304,"   By Marina Lopes and Elinor Comlay | WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY  WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY AT&T Inc agreed to pay $1.7 billion to acquire Mexico's third-largest wireless operator, Iusacell, as it seeks to grab a slice of a market with lower cellular penetration than the United States and faster potential growth.Mexico's government earlier this year implemented reforms to shake up its telecom and broadcast market by weakening the dominance of broadcaster Grupo Televisa and billionaire Carlos Slim's cellphone and fixed-line company America Movil.AT&T is looking to tap into the growing cellphone market in Latin America's No. 2 economy now that the government is encouraging foreign investment in the sector, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told Reuters.""Our focus in investing in Mexico is about the great environment from an investment perspective, the regulatory reforms, the growing population and middle class,"" Stephens said.    AT&T shares were up 0.57 percent at $35.11 in after hours trading. The deal, which is subject to approval by Mexican regulators, will occur after Iusacell's owner, billionaire businessman Ricardo Salinas' Grupo Salinas, buys out its partner's 50 percent stake in Iusacell. Iusacell said in September it would buy back that stake,  currently held by broadcaster Grupo Televisa, for $717 million.

312,"   By Marina Lopes and Christine Murray | WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY  WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY AT&T's $1.7 billion agreement to buy Iusacell, Mexico's No. 3 cellular operator, puts it in the unfamiliar position of market underdog, owning an asset that may require billions in investment to catch up to the market's two larger players. But analysts and investors say the deal could be a cheap way to get a foothold in Latin America's second-largest economy and learn the market's contours before plotting more ambitious acquisitions. To be sure, extending AT&T's high-speed service across the border will require significant investment in Iusacell's patchy network, marketing and new retail stores.That growth will put AT&T in direct competition with former ally Carlos Slim's America Movil, whose shares have fallen some 3 percent since news of the deal.The acquisition comes on the eve of two back-to-back auctions for airwaves in the United States and follows AT&T's $48.5 billion bid for satellite operator DirecTV earlier this year.  ""The motive here is to continue to look for new growth opportunities. You have a very mature market in the U.S., and it is apparent that they are looking to shift south,"" said Angelo Zino, analyst at S&P Capital IQ. Mexico has welcomed AT&T with open arms.""The announcement ... confirms the confidence of foreign investors to invest in the country, a direct result of the reforms adopted by the current administration,"" Mexico's telecommunications and transport ministry (SCT) said. President Enrique Pena Nieto has spearheaded an effort to shake up the telecom sector, which is dominated by America Movil.In response to the new rules, America Movil has said it will spin off assets and reduce its market share to below the required 50 percent threshold, implying the sale of at least 19 million subscribers. Those assets are up for grabs and AT&T is a prime contender. But AT&T has other options. Smaller players like Nextel, owned by bankrupt NII Holdings, has 2.8 million subscribers, and analysts say it could be a smart next step for AT&T. The company is also likely to leverage its stake in satellite operator Sky, which has more than 6 million subscribers in Mexico, to bundle television and wireless offerings.

The settlement must still be approved by the Alameda County Superior Court, where it was filed. Investigators cited AT&T for illegally disposing of hazardous wastes and other materials at more than 235 of its warehouses and dispatch centers across the state over a nine-year period.Inspections of trash dumpsters at those facilities by county prosecutors and state regulators found the company was routinely sending hazardous materials to local landfills not permitted to receive such contaminants.The wastes in question consisted primarily of discarded electronic equipment, batteries and aerosol cans, as well as ""certain liquids and gels"" used by AT&T service technicians, the state said in a statement.   ""This settlement holds AT&T accountable for unlawfully dumping electronic waste,"" state Attorney General Kamala Harris said.AT&T admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, nor is it compelled to remove any of the waste it was found to have dumped illegally, said David Beltran, a spokesman for Harris. But the judgment also expressly does not release AT&T from any liability for contamination in the event the Dallas-based company is named in a lawsuit seeking damages, Beltran said. AT&T officials were not immediately available for comment.Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) has acknowledged that it was the subject of a similar investigation by California earlier this year.  Under the agreement with AT&T, the company will pay $23.8 million in civil penalties and other costs and spend $28 million more over the next five years to carry out ""enhanced environmental compliance measures"" required by the settlement, the state said.Consumer advocate Liza Tucker from the nonprofit Santa Monica-based group Consumer Watchdog criticized the settlement as falling short by not requiring AT&T to undertake a costly cleanup necessary to ensure public health and deter similar dumping by others.""They're being fined what amounts to chump change for a company like AT&T, and the public is not going to be protected in the end because wherever they've illegally disposed of that waste, it's going to stay there,"" she said.

The index is above the long-term average of 80.3, but more than 10 points below the second quarter when it stood at 95.4. CEOs said they expected 2015 U.S. economic growth of 2.4 percent, the same as their forecast for 2014.""The economy ended the year essentially where it started - performing below its potential,"" Randall Stephenson, chairman of Business Roundtable and chief executive officer of AT&T Inc , said in a release accompanying the survey results.

""You really don't have to look further than capital spending."" In the survey, 74 percent of respondents said they expected sales to increase in the next six months, a slight increase from 73 percent in the previous quarter.But 40 percent said they expected to hire more people over the next half year, up from 34 percent in the last quarter but still below the 43 percent of respondents who said in the second quarter they expected to add jobs.In the fourth quarter the survey asks CEOs what their top cost pressures are and this year 39 percent said regulatory costs were their leading concern over the next six months, followed by labor and healthcare costs. Regulatory costs also topped the list for CEOs in the previous two years.

337,"  (Adds opposition group)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Dec 3 U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday restarted its informal 180-day countdown to review the proposed mergers between Comcast Corp  and Time Warner Cable Inc, and AT&T Inc and DirecTV.The FCC's self-imposed, non-binding ""shot clock"" will restart at Day 70 for the AT&T-DirecTV merger and Day 85 for the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, the agency said.The agency had paused the clock on the reviews as it figured out how to properly consider and allow the public to review sensitive documents related to agreements with media companies. The FCC will now restart its collection of public comments on various aspects of the merger, allowing some reviewers to access highly confidential information that is not related to video programming agreements.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, at the request of numerous content companies, is weighing how the FCC should handle the confidential materials related to programming agreements. Once the court rules, the FCC indicated it may further reset or delay the deadline to ensure enough time for outside parties to comment and for the agency to properly consider those comments.The country's biggest cable company Comcast has bid $45 billion for the No. 2 Time Warner Cable, while second-largest wireless provider AT&T has bid $48.5 billion to buy biggest satellite TV provider DirecTV. The FCC has to determine whether the deals are in the public interest. It is reviewing the mergers alongside the Justice Department, whose antitrust review also includes sensitive programming documents but is confidential.A group of critics of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger on Wednesday announced a coalition to press regulators to block the transaction. The ""Stop Mega-Comcast"" coalition includes satellite company Dish Network Corp, consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and TheBlaze, conservative commentator Glenn Beck's media company.Critics say the merger would create a cable and Internet provider that would have too much control over what Americans watch on TV and their web activity, among other things.Comcast has stressed that it does not compete against Time Warner Cable in any market and that, together, they would offer better services to more consumers.

339,"   By David Ingram and Bill Rigby | NEW YORK/SEATTLE  NEW YORK/SEATTLE Corporate lobbyists, news organizations and academics joined forces with Microsoft Corp on Monday in the software company's legal battle with the U.S. government over access to customer data stored overseas.The diverse set of interests filed briefs with a federal appeals court in New York, urging it to reverse a judge's order that Microsoft turn over emails from a data center in Ireland. They argued that turning them over would jeopardize the future of international cloud computing. The case has taken on urgency for tech and media companies in the wake of revelations about bulk electronic data collection by the U.S. National Security Agency from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.    Technology companies including and AT&T Inc and even rival Apple Inc also filed briefs supporting Microsoft's bid to fend off a government search warrant for the emails.Microsoft began fighting the warrant in 2013, saying that U.S. prosecutors were overreaching by demanding data held in a foreign country without the assistance of local authorities.It is not known whose emails are sought, but prosecutors said they wanted them for a drug investigation. The prosecutors said their demand did not violate Irish sovereignty because Microsoft's U.S. employees had control of the emails and could retrieve them without going to Ireland. In July, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska agreed and ordered Microsoft to comply.The ruling could wreak havoc in cloud computing for both businesses and individuals if countries regularly begin to claim authority over data stored elsewhere, said Andrew Pincus, a lawyer who filed a brief for groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business lobby.Businesses want to be sure their legal records, intellectual property and merger plans are generally private from authorities worldwide, Pincus said. ""If by putting them in the cloud, you lose control over them and the government just gets access whenever it wants, nobody's going to do that,"" Pincus said at a conference at Microsoft's New York office.The security of data centers is critical to journalists, said Bruce Brown, executive director of the U.S.-based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.""We have stuff governments around the world want,"" Brown said at the conference. Others supporting Microsoft in court briefs included the American Civil Liberties Union and 35 computer science and engineering professors.A ruling by the appeals court is likely months away. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Monday. The case is Microsoft v. U.S., 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2985.

340,"  SEATTLE Dec 15 Technology companies Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc , AT&T Inc and more than 20 others are supporting Microsoft Corp in the software company's legal battle with the U.S. government over access to customer data stored overseas.The long-running court fight has taken on an urgency for technology and media companies in the wake of revelations about bulk electronic data collection by the U.S. National Security Agency from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.A U.S. judge ruled in late July that Microsoft must turn over a customer's emails stored in a data center in Ireland to U.S. federal prosecutors under a criminal search warrant. It is unclear what type of investigation led to the warrant, which remains under seal. Microsoft is appealing that ruling, saying U.S. authorities cannot automatically compel U.S. companies to hand over customer information stored overseas. The judge has temporarily suspended her order from taking effect while Microsoft appeals. ""We believe that when one government wants to obtain email that is stored in another country, it needs to do so in a manner that respects existing domestic and international laws,"" said Microsoft head lawyer Brad Smith in a blog post on Monday. ""The U.S. government's unilateral use of a search warrant to reach email in another country puts both fundamental privacy rights and cordial international relations at risk."" Smith said 10 industry groups planned to file ""friend of the court"" briefs with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Monday. He said the briefs will be signed by 28 tech and media companies, 35 computer scientists and 23 trade and advocacy organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The U.S. government has yet to file its response to Microsoft's appeal, and oral arguments on the case are not expected for another six months or so.

345,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Sprint Corp will keep investing in its networks even if U.S. regulators adopt stricter ""net neutrality"" rules as long as they are applied with a ""light touch,"" the company said in a letter to the FCC released on Friday.Sprint's position appears in contrast with other cable and phone companies who have staunchly rejected the possibility that the FCC regulate Internet service providers (ISPs) more strictly under a section of communications law known as Title II, which would treat them more like public utilities.At stake is whether and how ISPs should be banned from blocking or slowing down websites and applications and from charging content companies for ""prioritized"" downloads.Republicans in Congress on Friday introduced a discussion draft of legislation that seeks to set new net neutrality rules, such as bans on data throttling and paid prioritization, but without resorting to the Title II regime. President Barack Obama has endorsed the use of Title II for new rules and the White House on Thursday said that approach gave the FCC the necessary authority, without the need for legislation.Large ISPs, such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, say they support an open Internet but have warned that a stricter regulatory regime could hurt their investments and innovation. AT&T Inc has said it will not make new investment commitments for high-speed Internet connections while the net neutrality rules are in flux and has threatened legal action if the FCC adopts the Title II approach. ""Sprint does not believe that a light touch application of Title II, including appropriate forbearance, would harm the continued investment in, and deployment of, mobile broadband services,"" Sprint's Chief Technology Officer Stephen Bye wrote to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in a letter dated Jan. 15.""So long as the FCC continues to allow wireless carriers to manage our networks and differentiate our products, Sprint will continue to invest in data networks regardless of whether they are regulated by Title II, Section 706, or some other light touch regulatory regime."" Republicans propose to set new rules that would ban blocking or slowing some downloads, unless required for reasonable network management, and would restrict the FCC from any moves, such as making new rules, beyond enforcing the existing ones."" The House and Senate commerce committees are expected to discuss net neutrality and the legislation at hearings on Jan. 21. The FCC plans to vote on new rules on Feb. 26.

356,"  * Durable goods data sharply below expectations* Caterpillar, Microsoft shares slide after results* Apple up after the bell on strong revenue growth* Indexes down: Dow 1.7 pct, S&P 1.3 pct, Nasdaq 1.9 pct   (Updates with results from Apple, AT&T and Yahoo)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Jan 27 U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent lower on Tuesday as disappointing results from a number of bellwether companies pointed to weakening conditions, while an unexpected decline in durable goods orders also weighed on sentiment.The day's losses were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors lower on the day, though tech was the biggest drag by far. The group lost 3.3 percent in its biggest one-day drop since November 2011, in the wake of results from industry bellwether Microsoft. Industrial shares fell, led by Caterpillar.The two names were the biggest decliners on the Dow, but fellow components Procter & Gable and DuPont Co  also tumbled. Microsoft fell 9.3 percent to $42.66 a day after the main engine of its historic earnings power - selling Windows and Office to big businesses - showed signs of waning.Heavy machinery marker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, warning the recent plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Shares dropped 7.2 percent to $79.85.""There's clearly a lot of froth baked into certain areas of tech, while Caterpillar is giving tangible evidence that things can go down more than they already have,"" said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer at Forward in San Francisco.""People may not be aware of the sensitivities that heavy industrial guys have to the oil cycle, or what the ripple effects of oil's weakness will be. There are a lot of companies that are going to be adversely impacted."" With 24 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, 70.6 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations while 55.5 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue.Still, many multinational companies disappointed this quarter, with the stronger dollar a common culprit.  P&G was one of the companies pressured by a stronger dollar, sending shares down 3.4 percent to $86.49.After the market closed, Apple Inc rose 5.4 percent to $115 after it posted better-than-expected revenue growth, along with record sales of its iPhone line.AT&T Inc's revenue rose more than expected in the latest quarter. Yahoo Inc reported its results and unveiled a plan for a tax-free spin-off of its 15 percent stake in China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, a first step in a highly-anticipated process to unwind the holding, valued at roughly $40 billion. Shares of AT&T rose 1.8 percent to $33.40 after the bell, while Yahoo added 7.7 percent to $51.69.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 291.49 points, or 1.65 percent, to 17,387.21, the S&P 500 lost 27.54 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,029.55 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 90.27 points, or 1.89 percent, to 4,681.50.Adding to the day's weakness, a gauge of U.S. business investment plans unexpectedly fell in December, another sign that slowing global growth and falling crude oil prices were having an impact on the economy.On the plus side, consumer confidence posted its highest reading since August 2007. That helped indexes recover from their lows of the session; the Dow earlier fell as much as 2.2 percent.About 6.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 7.2 billion.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,726 to 1,337, for a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,710 issues fell and 1,029 advanced, for a 1.66-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 49 new lows.

358,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings does not anticipate taking an  immediate rating action associated with AT&T's plans to acquire the wireless  operations of NII Holdings, Inc. in Mexico (Nextel Mexico) for $1.875 billion,  less the outstanding net debt of the business at closing.  The transaction is expected to close in mid-2015 following the approvals by the  U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York and Mexico's telecom  regulator. Further investment in Mexico has been expected, given AT&T's  acquisition of wireless operator Iusacell in January 2015 for $2.5 billion. Currently, AT&T's 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt  securities remain on Rating Watch Negative, where they were placed on May 19,  2014 upon the announcement of the acquisition of DIRECTV. DIRECTV's wholly-owned  indirect subsidiary, DIRECTV Holdings LLC, has an IDR of 'BBB-'. In addition to a review AT&T's financial policies after the DIRECTV transaction  and the investments in Mexico, Fitch will also assess AT&T's spending in the  Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) AWS-3 auction. The FCC's auction is  nearing completion, and industry-wide bidding is approaching $45 billion.  Fitch has previously stated that if the DirecTV acquisition closes as proposed  the rating is likely to be downgraded by one notch. To remain within the  potential 'A-' category, Fitch believes AT&T would have the capacity to spend in  the mid-teens of billions of dollars in the AWS auction and remain within the  'A-' rating.

361,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to AT&T  Inc.'s (AT&T) debt issue in Taiwan. AT&T's Issuer Default rating (IDR) is 'A'.  The company's IDR and debt securities remain on Rating Watch Negative, where  they were placed on May 19 upon the announcement of the acquisition of DIRECTV.  DIRECTV's wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, DIRECTV Holdings LLC, has an IDR of  'BBB-'. Proceeds from this offering are expected to be used for general corporate  purposes, including acquisition related payments.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch believes AT&T's acquisition of DIRECTV will improve its financial  flexibility owing to DIRECTV's strong free cash flows (FCF) and the significant  equity component in the transaction financing. The addition of DIRECTV will also  strengthen AT&T's position in the evolving video landscape, offering the  potential to capitalize on trends for mobile video and over-the-top (OTT) video  delivery. Other benefits include the scale brought by DIRECTV's substantially  larger video subscriber base and the diversification of AT&T's revenue stream. DIRECTV's video assets are complementary to AT&T's operations, but the longer  term strategic benefits are less clear and depend on the post-merger company's  ability to capitalize on emerging trends in the industry. The acquisition is  expected to be completed in the first half of 2015, following the necessary  regulatory approvals. The Negative Watch reflects the modest increase in leverage for AT&T, pro forma  for the transaction. Currently, AT&T operates with leverage at the upper bounds  for the current 'A' rating. As currently proposed the transaction would likely  lead to a one-notch downgrade for AT&T to 'A-' and a Stable Outlook. However,  Fitch anticipates that the potential funding for spectrum acquired in the  Federal Communications Commission's AWS-3 auction, once disclosed, may lead to a  rating action prior to the close of the DIRECTV transaction. For 2014, AT&T's net leverage as calculated by Fitch approximated 1.8x, an  increase from the 1.7x at year-end 2013. EBITDA has been under some pressure due  to wireless subscribers converting to no-device subsidy plans, which provide for  discounted service on the company's data sharing plans. Other factors  contributing to EBITDA pressure include rising content costs for its U-verse  video services, and expenses related to the March 2014 Leap Wireless acquisition  and the pending DIRECTV transaction. In Fitch's view, AT&T's liquidity remains solid and supported the company's cash  and availability on its existing revolving credit facilities (RCFs). At Dec. 31,  2014, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $8.6 billion. In addition, AT&T also  had approximately $1.9 billion of highly liquid certificates of deposit and time  deposits available to support liquidity needs. The company did not have any drawings on either its $5 billion RCF due 2018 or  its $3 billion RCF due 2017, and recently entered into $11.155 billion in term  loan facilities which it has yet to draw on. The principal financial covenant  for all facilities, other than a new 18-month facility, requires debt-to-EBITDA  as defined to be no more than 3x. For 2014, FCF (net cash provided by operating activities less capital  expenditures and dividends) was modestly positive at $353 million, and capital  spending was $21.4 billion.  Recently, AT&T completed wireless and wireline initiatives focused on its 4G LTE  and IP broadband networks, respectively, leading to a moderation of spending  going forward. Following the completion of these initiatives, AT&T has indicated  2015 capital spending will approximate $18 billion. At Dec. 31, 2014, total debt outstanding was approximately $82.1 billion.  Relative to the company's cash, RCF availability, and modest expected FCF, Fitch  believes upcoming debt maturities are manageable. Debt maturities are  approximately $6.5 billion in 2015 and include approximately $1.7 billion of  debt putable to the company on an annual basis that Fitch believes is unlikely  to be put. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: The transaction as it currently stands, plus the additional  investments in Mexico in 2015, will likely lead to a one-notch downgrade of  AT&T's rating to 'A-'. Spectrum spending, which is currently unknown, may have a  further impact on the Outlook or rating depending on AT&T's financial policies. Positive: Although Fitch views this scenario as unlikely within its rating  horizon, the rating could be affirmed at 'A' if the company's financial policies  targeted leverage of 1.6x to 1.7x by 2016.

Dish itself did not win any licenses, but had invested in bidding partners SNR Wireless LicenseCo LLC and Northstar Wireless LLC, which bid a total of $13.3 billion.The two companies, backed also by financial firms including BlackRock Inc but with little to no revenue, had applied to receive a discount as small-business entities, bringing their net bid amount to $10 billion.Verizon and T-Mobile bids were $10.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, according to the results of the Federal Communications Commission's largest ever auction.""Dish was the one that surprised most, spending a couple of billion more than anticipated,"" said Jefferies & Co analyst Mike McCormack. Dish's larger-than-expected bid for over 700 licenses put a damper on the investors' hypothesis that the satellite company had expected to turn around and sell the newly acquired airwaves to Verizon or another buyer. However, Dish's plans remain unclear.Shares of Dish fell 4.3 percent to close at $70.35 on Thursday.Verizon made slightly lower-than-expected bids but the company had hinted to investors that it would do so in December, McCormack added. The record $44.9 billion auction, which ended on Thursday, demonstrated the voracious appetite of wireless carriers and other companies for spectrum to satisfy the growing consumer demand to stream video and other data-guzzling content.AT&T, Dish's partners and Verizon snapped up airwaves in some of the most coveted and expensive markets, such as New York and California.Verizon and AT&T shares were relatively unchanged before closing at $45.71 and $32.92, respectively. Dish acknowledged in a statement it had invested in two entities that participated in the auction but did not further explain its plans, citing FCC anti-collusion rules.Verizon said in a statement it bought a total of 181 licenses that cover markets reaching 61 percent of the United States.AT&T was awarded 251 licenses, while T-Mobile bagged 151 licenses. AT&T's debt leverage may rise given its AWS-3 spectrum investment, it said in a statement.""The company will use excess cash - after paying its dividend - over the next three years to pay down debt, and expects to return to historical debt ratios,"" it added.Sprint, the third-largest U.S. carrier, skipped the AWS-3 auction.",2015-01-30,T,"Fri Jan 30, 2015 | 6:29pm EST",AT&T top buyer at U.S. airwaves auction; Dish spends big,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-spectrum-wireless-idUSL1N0V92VI20150130?type=companyNews

370,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Jan 30 (IFR) - Microsoft's coveted Triple A rating could come into question and AT&T is likely to lose its Single A rating after both brand names outlined plans that could see their leverage surge.Microsoft, one of only three Triple A rated corporates in the world, told analysts on its earnings call on Monday that it wanted to complete its entire US$40bn share buyback programme by the end of 2016 - a move that analysts and bankers think could see it almost double its US$28.3bn of outstanding debt with issuance of about US$25bn over the next two years.""Microsoft's leverage will likely increase to the 1.3-1.5 times range in the next couple of years, from around 0.8 times, and that will make it hard to justify the Triple A rating,"" said Jordan Chalfin, senior technology analyst at CreditSights.Microsoft is currently rated Triple A by both Moody's and S&P and AA+ by Fitch.On Tuesday, just days before the government disclosed that AT&T was the largest bidder in its biggest-ever auction of wireless spectrum, the company served notice to analysts that it was now comfortable going from being the lowest leveraged investment-grade telco to possibly more highly geared than Triple B-plus rated Verizon.""It is very conceivable that our net debt-to-Ebitda ratio would go  somewhere in between the 2.0 and 2.5 range,"" said CFO John Stephens on the earnings call. ""We will let the debt rating agencies deal with it as they see fit. But we are comfortable with where we are going and we understand the implications.""The moves by both companies reflect an increasing realisation among the top US corporates that having high ratings is not as relevant as it used to be, now that all-in yields have dropped to such lows.""We expect more companies to leverage up because at this point in time you can issue a fair amount of debt without really having a meaningful impact on default risk or spreads,"" said Stephen Antczak, head of US credit strategy at Citigroup.""And it's clear that companies are rewarded by their shareholders for buying back equity and pursuing acquisitions."" MILD IMPACT The mild impact, at least on funding costs, of a one-notch downgrade on either Microsoft or AT&T, can be seen on an all-in yield basis now that the 10-year Treasury yield has plunged by more than 40bp in January alone, to around 1.68%.On Friday, the 30-year Treasury yield hit 2.24%, the lowest it has ever been.Even looking at credit spreads, which have widened in recent months to compensate for the plunge in Treasury yields, the difference between ratings is minimal.""Microsoft in 10-years trades at 65bp over Treasuries, while [Aa1/AA+ rated] Apple trades at 75bp, so in reality saving 10bp isn't all that much for such a large company,"" said Scott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin Canida & Habacht, part of the BMO Global group of funds. The same goes for the difference in dropping from Single A to Triple B.AT&T, rated A3/A-/A, had a 3.9% 2024 bond recently trading at 143bp over Treasuries - just 8bp inside the 151bp level on Verizon's 3.5% 2024s, which are rated lower at Baa1/BBB+/A-.Kimball estimates each basis point saves a mere US$100,000 on a US$1bn borrowing.SPENDING SPREE  AT&T's Stephens expressed hopes last May, when the company announced a US$49bn acquisition of satellite broadcaster DirecTV, that the combined company would maintain a Single A rating.But since then, AT&T has also bought Mexico's Iusacell and Nextel, and it bid US$18.2bn in the airwaves auction, the results of which were announced Friday.AT&T, like Verizon, has outlined a three-year deleveraging plan to ratings agencies, but it appears that after having to compete so aggressively at the spectrum auctions, it has re-adjusted its expectations about keeping a Single A rating in the short term.As for Microsoft, its net leverage is actually negative, given that it has US$90bn of cash and US$28.3bn of debt outstanding.But with US$31.1bn of share buybacks left to do, as well as about US$10bn each year in dividend payments, Microsoft's gross leverage - which does not incorporate any cash, even the US$6bn held in the US - could soar above one time.S&P puts more emphasis on Microsoft's net leverage, but bankers and analysts believe Moody's could question why it should keep its Aaa rating on the company now that it is rushing through its buyback programme.""I would definitely think there would be pressure on the Moody's rating because of their gross debt focus,"" said a head of debt capital markets technology origination at one of the biggest bond houses.According to CreditSights' Chalfin, Microsoft will use about US$25bn-$26bn of domestic cash in each of the next two years to pay for the buybacks and dividends.""It seems possible that Microsoft could issue around US$25bn of debt to fund half of its total shareholders returns over the next two years,"" he said.

379,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to AT&T  Inc.'s (AT&T) Euro note offering of senior unsecured debt, consisting of EUR1.25  billion 1.3% notes due 2023 and EUR1.25 billion of 2.45% notes due 2035. The  Rating Outlook is Stable.  Proceeds from this offering are expected to be used for general corporate  purposes, including the repayment of upcoming debt maturities. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating and Stable Rating Outlook reflect AT&T's intent to delever to a net  leverage target of 1.8x over a three-year period following the completion of all  pending transactions, including spectrum. Fitch estimates the 2015 transactions  will cause net leverage to rise to pro forma 2.3x to 2.4x from approximately  1.8x at year-end 2014. In addition, the company is likely to reach gross  leverage of approximately 2x, which in Fitch's view is appropriate for the 'A-'  rating, by the end of 2017. AT&T's largest pending acquisition, DIRECTV, is in the regulatory approval  process and Fitch believes it has a high likelihood of going through, as it has  been relatively uncontroversial. The debt raised for the cash component of the  transaction as well as the modest effect of DIRECTV's higher leverage (net  leverage of approximately 2x at year-end 2014) contribute to AT&T's higher  leverage in the interim. DIRECTV's wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, DIRECTV  Holdings LLC, has a Fitch IDR of 'BBB-'. Debt levels have also increased due to the acquisition of spectrum in the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) AWS-3 spectrum action, which closed at  the end of January 2015. In the auction, AT&T bid approximately $18.2 billion to  acquire contiguous 10x10 MHz blocks of AWS-3 spectrum covering approximately 96%  of the U.S. population. AT&T's total remaining payment (80% of the total amount)  is due March 2. To fund spectrum purchases, Fitch anticipates that AT&T will use its $11.155  billion in term loan facilities and a portion of its cash balances. At Dec. 31,  2014, cash and cash equivalents, pro forma for a recent $2.6 billion debt  offering and the $2.5 billion acquisition of Iusacell, amounted to approximately  $8.7 billion, and highly liquid certificates of deposit and time deposits  amounted to approximately $1.9 billion.  At Dec. 31, 2014, the company did not have any drawings on either its $5 billion  revolving credit facility (RCF) due 2018 or its $3 billion RCF due 2017. The  principal financial covenant for all facilities other than a new $2 billion  18-month term loan facility requires debt-to-EBITDA, as defined, to be no more  than 3x. For 2014, FCF (net cash provided by operating activities less capital  expenditures and dividends) was modestly positive at $353 million, and capital  spending was $21.4 billion.  At Dec. 31, 2014, total debt outstanding was approximately $82.1 billion.  Relative to the company's cash, RCF availability, and modest expected free cash  flow (FCF), Fitch believes upcoming debt maturities are manageable. Debt  maturities are approximately $6.5 billion in 2015 and include approximately $1.7  billion of debt putable to the company on an annual basis that Fitch believes is  unlikely to be put. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes revenues will grow in the low single digits over the near term,  and that margins ? after the acquisition of DIRECTV ? will remain relatively  stable in the low-30% range. --Fitch believes that through EBITDA growth and debt repayment AT&T is likely to  reach gross leverage of approximately 2x by the end of 2017. --Fitch believes the acquisition of DIRECTV will improve AT&T's financial  flexibility owing to DIRECTV's strong FCF of approximately $3 billion annually  and the significant equity component in the transaction financing. The  acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2015, following the  necessary regulatory approvals. --In 2015, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be in line with  company guidance of $18 billion, lower than the $21.4 billion spent in 2014.  Recently, AT&T completed wireless and wireline initiatives focused on its 4G LTE  and IP broadband networks, respectively, leading to a moderation of spending  going forward.  --Potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV broadcast auction, currently  anticipated to occur in early 2016, is not included in Fitch's assumptions and  will be an event-driven consideration. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance causes  delevering to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace, either  alone or in combination with material debt-financed acquisitions. Discretionary  management moves that cause the company to fall off its delevering path, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever. Positive: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable  future, given the leverage incurred primarily through the pending DIRECTV  acquisition and spending on spectrum.

380,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc (T.N) will link its connected car and smart home technologies to bolster its foothold in the fast-growing market for Internet-connected devices, a new battleground for the company and rivals ranging from Verizon (VZ.N) to Google Inc (GOOGL.O).The wireless company's home security and automation service ""Digital Life"" and connected car service ""Drive"" will be integrated so users can control their homes from a dashboard in their vehicles, Glenn Lurie, chief executive of AT&T Mobility told Reuters last week ahead of the company's announcement at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. ""Once you’ve told your home when the car is (for instance)within 20 feet of the house to please open the garage door, put the lights on, turn the alarm off, move the thermostat up, you can have those inanimate objects, the home and your car, really taking care of you,"" Lurie said.With the two services linked up, a ""Drive"" car can control devices in the home, including security cameras, air-conditioners, coffee makers, stereo systems, door locks, alarm sensors on windows and sensors that detect leaks from water pipes.   Most Americans own a mobile phone, and the $1.7 trillion U.S. wireless industry is turning for growth to connected devices. AT&T said it had about 20 million connected devices from cars to cargo ship container sensors in 2014, up 21 percent from the year earlier. It has not yet revealed its revenue from its ""Internet of Things"" business. Technology companies including Apple and Google are making their own plays. Mercedes-Benz has an application that lets drivers control thermostats from Nest, a company acquired by Google. Analysts expect fast growth from the ""Internet of Things"", or web-connected machines and gadgets. Connected car revenue is expected to be $20 billion annually by 2018 from $3 billion in 2013, and smart homes revenue is estimated to touch $71 billion by 2018, according to Juniper Research.AT&T has deals with eight automakers from General Motors (GM.N) to Ford (F.N)  on connected car services. Lurie said it was still signing deals.On the home front, it has partnered with home appliance makers such as Samsung and LG Electronics. Customers will pay for the new service through AT&T's Mobile Share Value plan. A user can add $10 to the monthly phone bill to share data across multiple connected devices such as wearables and cars, Lurie said. Or customers can opt for plans provided by their car manufacturer. In the fourth quarter of 2014, AT&T said it added 800,000 connected cars out of 1.3 million connected devices it added to its network.

381,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  U.S. chief executive officers are modestly more upbeat about the economy and almost half plan to increase capital spending over the next six months, a quarterly business group survey said on Tuesday.CEOs expect U.S. gross domestic product to rise by 2.8 percent this year, compared to a projection of a 2.4 percent increase a quarter earlier, according to the first-quarter survey by the Business Roundtable.Of the 120 CEOs who responded to the survey, 45 percent expect to boost U.S. capital spending in the next six months, up from 36 percent in the fourth-quarter survey. Forty percent expect to increase U.S. employment, about the same level as in the prior survey.""The U.S. economy and the job outlook are starting the year in a stronger position than 2014,"" said Randall Stephenson, chairman of Business Roundtable and CEO of AT&T Inc (T.N). Passage of tax-extender legislation late last year gave companies greater confidence to invest, Stephenson said.""There’s just one little microcosm of how tax policy is influencing how CEOs think about investing in the U.S. economy,"" Stephenson told reporters on a conference call. ""There is probably nothing that will move this economy forward and drive capital investment faster than tax reform."" In response to a question about foreign trade, 81 percent said the ability to sell more goods and services to foreign markets would help their company grow and be more competitive globally. Fifty-four percent said such an ability would allow them to hire more U.S. workers.Trade issues are ""ripe"" for bipartisan cooperation among legislators, Stephenson told reporters. The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index, a composite index of expectations for the next six months for sales, capital spending and employment, rose to 90.8 from 85.1 in the fourth quarter. The long-term average of the index is 80.5, and the index has generally ranged from about 85 to 95 since the fourth quarter of 2013.Eighty percent said they expected their companies' U.S. sales will increase in the next six months, up from 74 percent a quarter ago. Eight percent expect U.S. sales to decline.

It's also a marker of Apple's transformation, from a struggling company with a small, fervent following two decades ago, into the nation's predominant consumer tech company.""This is a sign of the times, and it might get everyone to look at the Dow more than they have been,"" said Richard Sichel, who oversees $2 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co.

The stock was added to the Dow in 1916, the year after the first-ever transcontinental telephone call.

The company has a market capitalization of $737 billion, making it twice the size of the second-largest Dow component, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).  Shares of Apple rose 0.15 percent to $126.60 on Friday, while those of AT&T fell 1.5 percent to $33.48.In a twist of fate, Apple owes some of its success to its partnership with AT&T over the iPhone, the device that propelled Apple's dominance. The iPhone first hit the market in 2007 with AT&T as its exclusive carrier, a deal that continued for more than three years. Since the iPhone's introduction, Apple's annual revenue has risen more than sevenfold, from $24.6 billion in 2007 to $182.8 billion most recently. AT&T saw 11 percent revenue growth over the same period to $132.4 billion in 2014. ""There’s irony in that they are replacing AT&T, which helped them lift off to begin with,” said Neil Azous, founder of Stamford, Connecticut-based advisory firm Rareview Macro. Despite Apple's size, as of Thursday's close it would only have a 4.66 percent weighting in the Dow because of its price, the index company said.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose 295,000 last month, topping estimates for a gain of 240,000, after a downwardly revised 239,000 increase in January.

388,"  (Repeats without change to widen readership)By David GaffenNEW YORK, March 6 Apple Inc, the largest U.S. company by market value, will join the storied Dow Jones industrial average, replacing AT&T Inc, in a change that reflects the dominant position of iPhone maker in the U.S. economy and society.The decision to nudge aside AT&T, which has been part of the Dow for the better part of a century, is a recognition of the way in which communications and technology have evolved over the last several decades.""This is a sign of the times, and it might get everyone to look at the Dow more than they have been,"" said Richard Sichel, who oversees $2 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co.""It would be difficult to pick any 30 companies that would cover the entire economy, especially compared with the S&P 500, but it does give the Dow more credibility."" With a market capitalization of $736 billion, Apple is the largest publicly traded company in the index. The action, by S&P Dow Jones Indices, had been widely expected since Apple split its shares seven-for-one in June 2014.After the split, many investors felt it was only a matter of time before the iPad maker was added to the 30-stock average, since it had been excluded because its stock price was too high for the price-weighted index.AT&T has a market value of $176.5 billion. Its deletion from the index leaves Verizon as the sole telecommunications company in the average. The company has had two stints in the Dow. It was added in 1916 and removed in 2004. After SBC Communications renamed itself AT&T following a 2005 merger, it was reinstated.Despite Apple's size, it would as of Thursday's close only have a 4.66 percent weighting in the Dow because of its price, the index company said in a statement. Apple will join the average on March 18.In early trading, shares of Apple were higher, gaining 1.4 percent to $128.15, while AT&T's shares fell 1.4 percent to $33.53. Had Apple had replaced any one of the 30 Dow components except Visa after its June 2014 split, a Reuters analysis recently showed,  the index would have been higher. Visa is the only Dow component that would have helped the Dow more during that time, in part because of its high stock price.Kevin Landis, chief investment officer of Firsthand Capital Management, a Silicon Valley-based technology-investing specialist with $300 million in assets under management, said he hopes that this is not a sign that Apple is past its prime.""The Dow Jones is such a backwards-looking list, I cringed when Intel and Microsoft were added,"" Landis said. ""I'm cringing today. Let's hope Apple can defy the forces of history.""Intel and Microsoft joined the average in November 1999, and their performance was weak for years following.(Reporting by David Gaffen and Ryan Vlastelica; Editing by Dan Burns, Bernadette Baum and Steve Orlofsky)",2015-03-06,T,"Fri Mar 6, 2015 | 10:41am EST",RPT-UPDATE 3-Apple to replace AT&T in Dow industrials,http://www.reuters.com//article/apple-dow-idUSL1N0W819G20150306?type=companyNews

391,"   By Eric Auchard and Leila Abboud | BARCELONA  BARCELONA Telecom network gear makers are on a collision course with Silicon Valley computing giants as software and cloud computing have begun to change the way operators from AT&T to China Mobile run their networks.The shift, while in its early stages, involves relying on ever cheaper computer boxes and powerful software that promises to make networks more flexible and efficient.As networks move to relatively standard hardware, formerly entrenched equipment groups must increasingly compete for contracts with the likes of Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and VMware, as well as a slew of startups.Relying more on software to run networks could boost the gear makers' profit margins one day, but will also force them to search for new sources of revenue. They must learn skills such as acting more as consultants or finding business beyond their traditional telecom operator clients.The changes, which simplify how networks are managed, are blurring the lines between the telecom and computer industries, setting the stage for a wave of acquisitions as a virtual showdown in the clouds takes shape.At the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week, the brewing battle was apparent in dozens of partnership and product announcements.Likewise, some equipment makers talked tough about their rivalry with information technology (IT) groups as the operators make greater use of cloud computing - running software networks and storing data remotely on centralized servers.""We actually see the transition to the cloud as less of a threat that IT players will disrupt our markets and more of a threat that we will disrupt theirs,"" Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told a news conference in Barcelona before the Congress.Finland's Nokia, the world's third largest mobile equipment maker after Ericsson of Sweden and Huawei of China, believes its strengths in wireless radio, navigational map systems and its large amount of patented technology cannot be easily duplicated by fast-moving Internet players.The pace will accelerate over the next five years as industrial rivals compete for trillions of dollars in contracts to build a new generation of networks known as 5G. These networks must handle mushrooming demand for video and billions of new devices including wireless connections to cars, industrial sensors and home appliance. They must do all this while helping operators to slash costs in an industry looking to pare back capital spending.BREAD AND BUTTER Network operator Telefonica set the cat among the pigeons this week by awarding a major contract to computer company HP for it to overhaul how the operator's networks run to make them more flexible and cheaper.""What we are seeing is a coming together of two industries,"" Ian Miller, an executive with Telefonica, which runs networks in Europe, the Americas and Asia. ""Each industry is moving into the other side,"" he said. Meanwhile, Cisco Systems, which started out building computer networks, announced smaller deals with carriers across Europe to deliver new cloud-based Internet services and ""small cell"" antennas to improve mobile phone and data coverage in busy calling areas.Such contracts would once have been the bread and butter for telecom network gear makers such as Ericsson, Nokia, France's Alcatel-Lucent, or their newer Chinese peer Huawei.Firing back, Ericsson, the world's largest mobile telecom equipment maker, teamed up with computer chip giant Intel Corp to build advanced datacentres to help the telecoms industry match the firepower of Internet groups such as Google or Amazon.SLICING UP THE PIE  The likes of Ericsson and Nokia will have to snap up smaller start-ups to gain software expertise but they'll also have to compete for targets with deep-pocketed technology rivals. In the years to come, bigger consolidation moves are likely to shore up one side or the other, as well as ones which create hybrid players.The first phase already has begun: Ericsson bought five cloud and software start-ups in 2014, VMware paid $1.26 billion for Nicira in 2012 and Cisco has made nearly a dozen small scale deals in the telecom arena in the last three years.Marcus Weldon, who heads Alcatel-Lucent's Bell Labs, acknowledged that competition with software makers and technology companies was intensifying, but said telecom network companies were also raising their skills.""It's not clear yet whether the overall pie of available revenue will be bigger, or if we'll be fighting with new entrants for a similar-sized pie,"" he said.Software-based products accounted for roughly 5 percent of Alcatel, Ericsson and Nokia's revenue in 2014, but will grow to the low teens in 2017, according to Exane BNP Paribas analyst Alexander Peterc.Weldon and other executives pointed out in Barcelona this week that telecom networks have peculiarities, such as a low tolerance for outages and society's growing reliance on mobile airwaves, making it difficult to swap some equipment for software and ensuring that telecom players are far from obsolete.But their role with major customers such as AT&T and Vodafone will change markedly as they move into new service lines like network consulting and systems integration, to displace falling hardware sales.

The sale of Connecticut wireline properties, the exiting of some low-margin businesses and non-cash changes in benefit expenses are expected to hurt margins in the wireline business, AT&T said.Margins in the wireless business are expected to come under pressure partly due to the adoption of the Mobile Share Value plans, it said. AT&T forecast net addition of about 400,000 postpaid customers in the current quarter. The company had net added 625,000 postpaid subscribers in the year-earlier quarter, marking its strongest postpaid growth in the first quarter in five years.AT&T continues to expect its acquisition of satellite TV company DirecTV to close in the first half of 2015. The deal, valued at $48.5 million, is awaiting regulatory approval.In a separate filing on Tuesday, the company said total compensation for Chief Executive Randall Stephenson was $24 million last year, up from $23.2 million in 2013. Total compensation for Chief Financial Officer John Stephens was $10.7 million in 2014 versus $7.9 million in 2013.AT&T's shares closed at $32.78 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

399,"   By Alina Selyukh and Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON AT&T Inc's proposed acquisition of satellite television company DirecTV is getting a smooth ride from U.S. regulators and industry rivals, who instead are directing their firepower at a merger deal between the nation's two biggest cable operators.U.S. Federal Communications Commission filings and interviews with several people familiar with the Justice Department show the $48.5 billion AT&T-DirecTV deal is getting far less attention than Comcast Corp's agreement to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45 billion.At the core is how Comcast's deal would bolster the company's already dominant position in broadband Internet, an important growth area as more Americans drop cable subscriptions to watch video on the Web.      Each merger would create a company controlling more than a quarter of the pay TV market. But it is the Comcast deal that has triggered FCC and Justice Department inquiries resulting in hours-long depositions, hundreds of meetings and nearly 90,000 comments, according to disclosures and people who have met with the regulators.Muted opposition does not necessarily guarantee a painless regulatory process for AT&T and DirecTV, but it does reduce pressure on regulators, whose bar is high for rejecting a merger, antitrust and FCC experts say. COMCAST CONCERNS  With Time Warner Cable, Comcast would provide high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data. Critics at advocacy groups and telecom, media and Web companies say they fear Comcast would gain unparalleled control over how content providers reach millions of pay-TV subscribers, as well as consumers' access to video delivered by competitors over the Internet.By contrast, AT&T covers about 17 percent of the broadband market, and DirecTV does not offer Internet access. ""The customers aren't anxious, and the competitors aren't rattled,"" said former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, now at law firm Covington & Burling. ""The FCC or the Justice Department will be looking for markets where this will have an impact, and hardly anyone is telling them that there are such markets.""The FCC, which determines if deals are in the public interest, has received nearly 20 petitions to deny Comcast's proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable, but only five such petitions for AT&T-DirecTV, a review of disclosures shows. The FCC has received about 14,000 ""brief comments"" on the AT&T deal, many from members of the public concerned about the merger, according to a Reuters tally. On Comcast-Time Warner Cable, the agency has gotten about 88,000 such comments.FCC disclosures show officials there have held more than 300 meetings with supporters and opponents of Comcast's proposed merger, compared with about 70 for AT&T-DirecTV.  A critic of the AT&T-DirecTV deal who met with the Justice Department said reviewers there asked ""few questions"" and gave ""blank stares."" The Justice Department, which looks at antitrust issues, and the FCC declined to comment for this story. A Comcast spokeswoman declined to comment on comparisons with AT&T's merger. But she said merging with Time Warner Cable would not cause consumers to lose any video, broadband or phone choices as the two companies do not directly compete in any market.An AT&T spokesman said the DirecTV acquisition received support from ""labor, rural interests, the tech community, and many others eager for an alternative to cable.""

The number of shares pledged to HSBC may vary going forward, according to the filing, which said that the shares must be 150 percent of the amount borrowed from HSBC.A spokeswoman for America Movil, the telecoms company which Slim controls, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear what use Inbursa might have for the loans. The bank, Mexico's No. 7 with 291 billion pesos ($19.04 billion) in assets, in March agreed to buy the Brazilian unit of South Africa's Standard Bank Group for $45 million.Previous filings, which refer to Inbursa's subsidiary slightly differently as ""Control Empresarial de Capitales"", show that it acquired America Movil shares when AT&T last year divested its holding in Slim's flagship company. AT&T sold the America Movil stake as part of efforts to gain regulatory approval for its purchase of DirecTV.Separately, Thursday's filing showed that the control trust that holds America Movil shares for Slim and his family has acquired 92.1 million L shares since the family's last filing was published in January.America Movil L shares closed down 2.18 percent at 15.73 pesos on Thursday.

407,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc was too late to appeal a $40 million loss in a  patent infringement case because its lawyers did not read key rulings in time, a federal appeals court said on Thursday.AT&T, which was represented by a team of lawyers from the law firm Sidley Austin, failed to file its notice of appeal within the requisite 30 days after a judge from a federal court in San Antonio denied several of the company's post-trial motions, according to a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.The case began in 2009 when a Colorado company, Two-Way Media Llc, accused Dallas-based AT&T of infringing several Internet media streaming patents. A jury in 2013 found AT&T infringed two of the patents and awarded $27.5 million in damages, to which U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia added interest, according to court filings. In October 2013, AT&T filed motions asking Garcia to overturn the verdict, which Garcia denied the next month. The court posted the denials on its docket, but with labels that omitted the actual substance of the rulings.  Attorneys on both sides received emailed notices of the court filings with those labels. The labels were updated with descriptions of the underlying orders a few days later, but no new notices were sent to attorneys. The Sidley Austin lawyers did not discover the November orders until 51 days later, in January, after the appeal period had expired.

410,"  (Repeats story to additional subscribers)By Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO, April 1 With regional heavyweight Brazil less of a force in global capital markets this year, Mexican companies are filling the void by luring more investment in the form of mergers and acquisitions, bond and equity offerings.Several deals have taken place since Mexico's $2 billion sovereign bond sale in January as investors look to benefit from the impact of U.S. economic growth on its southern neighbor.First-quarter deal-making activity was more robust in Mexico than anywhere else in Latin America for only the second time in a decade. Thomson Reuters data shows the value of announced mergers and acquisitions in Mexico reached $8.64 billion, above Brazil's $8.51 billion.Illustrating how the tables have turned, $13.93 billion worth of M&A deals were announced in Brazil during the first three months of 2014, against just $3.99 billion for Mexico.Bankers expect the trend to extend to the underwriting of stock sales, such as initial public offerings. Brazil is experiencing a turbulent year as an economic slump and a corruption probe at state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA  sap business confidence, investment and capital markets activity.""Mexico continues to be the region's darling,"" Ignacio Benito, JPMorgan Chase & Co's managing director for Latin America M&A and equity capital markets, said in New York last week. ""You may have whatever issue hampering sentiment but with the U.S. economy doing well, it's hard to see Mexico not getting a lift from it."" Although Mexico's economy has consistently underperformed over the last decade, it is expected to grow more than 3 percent this year and long-awaited reforms in the telecommunications and energy industries spurred recent takeovers such as AT&T Inc's  purchase of Grupo Iusacell SAB last year.The disposal of telephone, cement and industrial assets by market leaders are spurring optimism that bidders could seek merger financing, bankers said.Cementos Mexicanos SA has identified $100 million of assets to sell, while America Movil SAB hopes to complete the spin-off of its cellphone towers unit by June.

411,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO, April 1  SAO PAULO, April 1 With regional heavyweight Brazil less of a force in global capital markets this year, Mexican companies are filling the void by luring more investment in the form of mergers and acquisitions, bond and equity offerings.Several deals have taken place since Mexico's $2 billion sovereign bond sale in January as investors look to benefit from the impact of U.S. economic growth on its southern neighbor.First-quarter deal-making activity was more robust in Mexico than anywhere else in Latin America for only the second time in a decade. Thomson Reuters data shows the value of announced mergers and acquisitions in Mexico reached $8.64 billion, above Brazil's $8.51 billion.Illustrating how the tables have turned, $13.93 billion worth of M&A deals were announced in Brazil during the first three months of 2014, against just $3.99 billion for Mexico.Bankers expect the trend to extend to the underwriting of stock sales, such as initial public offerings. Brazil is experiencing a turbulent year as an economic slump and a corruption probe at state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA  sap business confidence, investment and capital markets activity.""Mexico continues to be the region's darling,"" Ignacio Benito, JPMorgan Chase & Co's managing director for Latin America M&A and equity capital markets, said in New York last week. ""You may have whatever issue hampering sentiment but with the U.S. economy doing well, it's hard to see Mexico not getting a lift from it.""Although Mexico's economy has consistently underperformed over the last decade, it is expected to grow more than 3 percent this year and long-awaited reforms in the telecommunications and energy industries spurred recent takeovers such as AT&T Inc's  purchase of Grupo Iusacell SAB last year. The disposal of telephone, cement and industrial assets by market leaders are spurring optimism that bidders could seek merger financing, bankers said.Cementos Mexicanos SA has identified $100 million of assets to sell, while America Movil SAB hopes to complete the spin-off of its cellphone towers unit by June. Supermarket group Organización Soriana SAB plans to raise $600 million in capital later this year.In contrast, deals in Brazil, Colombia and Chile are taking longer to finalize as slumping commodity prices and weaker  currencies make it harder to calculate future returns, said Facundo Vázquez, head of Latin America equity capital markets at Itaú BBA.While Mexico is far from immune, it looks more resilient than its Latin American peers at the moment.

422,"  (Adds events for Verizon, AT&T, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications)Week AheadA slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald's Corp, AT&T Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares.General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business.Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods.Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry's top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working.On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules.

429,"  * U.S. sells $18 bln 5-year TIPS to mediocre demand     * AT&T bond deal lures investor attention from Treasuries     * Steep fall in U.S. new home sales revives economic worries   (New throughout, updates prices and market activity)     By Richard Leong     NEW YORK, April 23 U.S. Treasuries yields fell on Thursday with benchmark yields retreating from 3-1/2 week highs as investors stepped back in the bond market a day after a broad selloff in Treasuries, German Bunds and British Gilts.      A larger-than-expected 11.4 percent drop in domestic new home sales in March, together with disappointing global factory data, rekindled doubts about whether the U.S. economy is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.       ""The weaker economic data certainly helped pulled some bids back into the market,"" said Andrew Richman, fixed income strategist at SunTrust Private Wealth Management in Palm Beach, Florida.     Uneasiness about Greece and its future in the euro zone also underpinned safe-haven demand for Treasuries.     Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a speeding up of work to conclude a reform-for-cash deal with euro zone creditors to keep his country afloat after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday.      Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields fell 3.5 basis points to 1.937 percent after hitting 1.993 percent on Wednesday, which was the highest in 3-1/2 weeks, according to Reuters data.     The 30-year bond yield slipped 3 basis points from late Wednesday to 2.623 percent, a day after reaching 2.679 percent, the highest in five weeks.     Analysts blamed Wednesday's market downdraft on factors including a perceived hawkish tilt in the minutes of the Bank of England's previous meeting and investors paring heavy holdings in Bunds due to the European Central Bank's bond purchase programs, and concerns about Greece.       The number of Americans filing for first-time jobless benefits rose unexpectedly last week by 1,000 to 295,000, but the underlying trend was seen consistent with employers hiring more workers.       Thursday's drop in yields was also limited by gains on Wall Street where the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite was on track to record closing highs.                        On the supply front, the Treasury Department sold $18 billion of five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities   to mediocre demand.       Low-yielding Treasuries were overshadowed by a robust corporate bond sector where AT&T launched a $17.5 billion deal, which is the third biggest ever, according to IFR, a unit of Thomson Reuters.

431,"  MEXICO CITY Mexico's America Movil (AMXL.MX) said on Friday that it was still reviewing alternatives to a sale of assets in Mexico in the wake of AT&T's entry into the market, adding that it did not want to sell infrastructure.The company first said in July that it would sell a chunk of assets in its home market to cut its market share and avoid tough new measures imposed on it under new regulation.The original plan was to sell a cross-section of the company, but America Movil is now reviewing its plan since U.S. carrier AT&T's (T.N) purchase of Mexico's No. 3 and No. 4 wireless operators, which could increase competition anyway. ""We are reviewing exactly how the market is going to be in Mexico and then we're going to take the decision what we're going to sell,"" Chief Executive Daniel Hajj told an analyst call, adding that the company no longer wanted to sell infrastructure or a share of its frequencies, or spectrum.The company on Thursday reported a 41 percent slump in first-quarter net profit, missing expectations due to a foreign exchange loss for the second consecutive quarter, mostly on the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the dollar.

434,"  (Adds reform details)MEXICO CITY, April 23 Mexico's America Movil on Thursday reported a 41 percent slump in first-quarter net profit, missing expectations due to a foreign exchange loss for the second consecutive quarter, mostly on the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the dollar.The telecoms company, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim, said net profit in the January-March period was 8.23 billion pesos ($539 million), compared with 13.89 billion pesos a year earlier.It was hit by a 17.883 billion peso foreign exchange loss, which it said was mostly due to the 21 percent depreciation of the Brazilian currency against the dollar during the quarter.The drop in profit comes despite a 13 percent jump in revenue, roughly in line with expectations, driven principally by the inclusion of Telekom Austria's results. Analysts had been expecting a higher net profit of 13.46 billion pesos, according to a Reuters poll.Slim's company is subject to a sweeping sector reform in Mexico, finalized last year, which forced it to share infrastructure and let rivals interconnect calls to its network for free. The new laws meant Mexican revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell in the quarter, but increased data and pay TV use across Latin America and growth in its Brazil unit has blunted the effect of the reform on results.The company said it would sell a chunk of assets to avoid the rules, but many analysts' base scenario is now that there will be no sale, partly because U.S. carrier AT&T's  purchase of Mexico's No.3 and No.4 wireless operators will increase competition anyway. The telecoms regulator IFT has said that it would not necessarily punish America Movil for maintaining its market share of around 70 percent in mobile, and that it would only concerned if market power is abused.One of the new rules made it easier for clients to switch between mobile providers with the aim of promoting competition. America Movil said in the quarter it gained more clients through this rule than it lost.Shares in America Movil have risen around 4 percent since the beginning of the year, a little less than the 5 percent rise in Mexico blue chip IPC index. The shares are well above lows reached in 2013 and 2014 as the Mexico reforms were being passed.($1 = 15.2610 pesos at end March)   (Reporting by Christine Murray; Editing by Diane Craft)",2015-04-24,T,"Thu Apr 23, 2015 | 8:19pm EDT",UPDATE 2-America Movil profit hammered by weak Brazilian currency,http://www.reuters.com//article/americamovil-results-idUSL1N0XK3YD20150424?type=companyNews

443,"   By Christine Murray | RIVIERA MAYA, Mexico  RIVIERA MAYA, Mexico AT&T Inc will take ""a couple of years"" to shape up its new business in Mexico, where it competes with billionaire Carlos Slim's dominant carrier America Movil, AT&T Mexico Chief Executive Thaddeus Arroyo said in an interview on Thursday.AT&T, which bought Mexico's No.3 and No.4 wireless carriers in the last few months, faces the task of integrating the two companies' networks to face off against Slim's telecoms group, which controls 70 percent of the mobile market.The purchases gave AT&T, which was looking for growth outside the saturated U.S. wireless market, a cheap foothold in Latin America, but analysts don't see the Mexico unit having a major impact for some time.""What we really want to do over the long term is deploy advanced fourth generation services to over 100 million Mexicans ... That will take a number of years,"" Arroyo said on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum summit on Latin America in the Riviera Maya.AT&T is in the vanguard of companies seeking to benefit from sweeping telecoms sector overhaul finalized last year. The reform is forcing Slim to open up infrastructure and let rivals interconnect to his network for free. ""It actually will take us a couple of years to ultimately begin to enhance and begin to deploy the experiences that we're looking for,"" said Arroyo.AT&T has said that Iusacell, whose previous owners never broke down numbers in detail, made a $27 million first quarter operating loss. AT&T also lowered Iusacell's number of subscribers to 5.97 million from the 9.2 million it said when the deal closed in January. Arroyo highlighted Mexico's growing middle class and a relatively young population, and emphasized that companies are better positioned than government to enhance wireless services ""because networks are living organisms to a degree.""He said that for the company to reach its goal of becoming  market leader within a decade, it needs to be successful in both prepaid and postpaid mobile contracts.Asked if the company is considering the acquisition of any America Movil assets, Arroyo demurred. ""We'll always continue to look at other alternatives in the market, but right now we really have our hands full,"" he said.AT&T's purchase of DirecTV, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, would make it and Spanish-language television content Grupo Televisa co-investors in Mexico's biggest pay TV provider Sky.

(on.wsj.com/1QFPUh2)AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless provider, in May last year offered to buy DirecTV, the biggest satellite TV provider, to create the largest U.S. pay TV company.Regulators may still decide to impose conditions on the deal, but do not appear to have serious concerns, the Journal reported. FCC staff might recommend approving the deal with certain conditions that should be acceptable to AT&T, sources told the paper. One of the possible conditions AT&T could agree to involves about how the company deals with streaming video, the Journal added.AT&T and DirecTV were not immediately available for comment. The deal highlights AT&T's pressing need for fresh avenues of growth beyond the maturing U.S. cellular business, which has become increasingly competitive.DirecTV's shares were up 1.3 percent on Tuesday afternoon, while AT&T's were up marginally after the report.

448,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dish Network Corp, Cogent Communications Holdings Inc and advocacy groups are asking U.S. regulators to restrict AT&T Inc's power over online video and other content as part of its proposed purchase of DirecTV.The group of critics of the pending $48.5 billion acquisition met with a large team of officials at the Federal Communications Commission, including the top merger reviewers, on May 8 and laid out the most detailed yet demands for potential conditions to the deal, disclosed in a filing on Wednesday.Reviewers at both the Justice Department and the FCC are nearing a decision that is poised to clear the deal with some conditions, people familiar with the review had previously told Reuters. AT&T is expected to meet with FCC reviewers to negotiate in coming days. The merger of the No. 2 wireless carrier and the largest satellite company would create the largest pay-TV provider in the country. Dish, Cogent and other critics have focused on the impact of that in combination with the companies' expansion as an Internet provider to raise questions about potential threats to video streamed over the web.In the May 8 meeting, they asked the FCC to demand that AT&T promise to sell Internet service as a standalone service outside of any packages, at a reasonable price and at the same speeds as it offers as part of a bundle. Additionally, they urged the FCC to require AT&T to comply with the new, stricter so-called net neturality regulations for Internet service providers for seven years after the merger, regardless of the fate of AT&T's pending court challenge to those rules.The companies and public interest groups also asked the FCC to require AT&T to include all video services in any data caps that it places on customers' broadband use. The critics worry that AT&T would put data caps on its customers' usage but then exempt video content provided by itself and DirecTV. The group also sought restrictions on how AT&T handles traffic from content companies such as video streaming service Netflix Inc and long-haul Internet traffic carriers such as Cogent. For Dish, at stake is the future of its Sling TV that delivers programming over the Internet.The consumer advocacy groups included Public Knowledge, Free Press and New America's Open Technology Institute.An AT&T spokesman did not immediately comment.

455,"  MEXICO CITY Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico rose to $7.57 billion in the first quarter of the year according to preliminary figures, boosted by U.S. telecoms giant AT&T's (T.N) purchase of Iusacell, the economy ministry said on Wednesday.The figure is 30 percent higher than the $5.8 billion obtained from January to March, 2014 when measured by preliminary calculations.   The result is a third less, however, than the $11.4 billion in FDI seen during the same period last year, according to final figures published on the ministry's website.  The United States accounted for nearly 60 percent of first quarter 2015 foreign direct investment, with Spain and Japan contributing 14 and 8 percent respectively.

457,"  WASHINGTON, June 11 A U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday declined to suspend new Internet traffic regulations, rejecting the telecom industry's request to partially block the implementation of the ""net neutrality"" rules while they're being litigated.The ruling marks an early win for the Federal Communications Commission, whose assertion of a broader enforcement authority over Internet services providers is being challenged in court by AT&T Inc and cable and wireless industry groups.  The new regulations are slated to go into effect on Friday as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit takes on the issue of net neutrality for the third time.

458,"   By Andrew Chung  AT&T Inc, which was found to be too late to appeal a $40 million judgment against the company in a patent infringement lawsuit because its attorneys did not read key rulings in time, will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. AT&T's lawyers at Sidley Austin on Wednesday asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to stay the issuance of the mandate to the lower court in San Antonio, Texas, while they petition the high court to grant certiorari.

That, the FCC says, made for misleading and inadequate disclosures that violated the agency's transparency requirements of the 2010 Open Internet order, also known as ""net neutrality"" regulations, which have remained in place despite a legal dispute over the rules.AT&T and several cable and wireless industry groups are challenging the FCC's 2015 net neutrality regulations in court.

463,"  * Trading quiet as investors await clarity on Greek debt* Energy rises alongside oil prices; AT&T rallies on upgrades* Facebook ends at record, its market cap surpasses Wal-Mart's* Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all rise 0.1 pct   (Updates to close)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, June 23 U.S. stocks ended with slight gains on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq eking out another record close while investors continued to await clarity on whether Greece could reach a deal to prevent defaulting on its loans.The day's action was quiet, with trading volume below average. While energy shares rose alongside a jump in the price of crude oil, a sharp rise in the U.S. dollar capped broader gains. While there were no major developments involving Greece, investors continued to hope that the country's newest budget proposals - introduced on Monday - would avert a looming default.Greece needs fresh funds to avoid defaulting on a $1.8 billion debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30. Equities have been largely driven by Greece lately, with investors concerned that if the country defaults, it may have to leave the euro or the European Union, potentially shaking the region's economic foundations.""The market seems to expect that this will end favorably, or at least benignly, but I think people need to be nimble right now as circumstances could change at any time,"" said Steve Sosnick, equity-risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Greece may not be all that meaningful to the U.S. market, but it could have a big impact on the euro and the dollar, and it is unclear how big of an impact that will have on stocks.""The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 1.1 percent. A strong dollar is considered a headwind for equity prices as it weighs on the profits of multinational corporations.U.S. crude futures settled up 1 percent at $61.01 per barrel, lifted ahead of U.S. inventory data expected to show strong demand for gasoline. The S&P energy index  rose 0.3 percent and was one of the day's top-performing sectors. Halliburton Co rose 0.9 percent to $44.49. AT&T Inc rose 2.5 percent to $35.91 and was one of the biggest percentage gainers on the S&P 500 after at least two brokerages upgraded the stock.Facebook Inc shares rose 3.7 percent to $87.88, a record close. With the day's gains, the social network's market value is now bigger than that of Dow component Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.29 points, or 0.13 percent, to 18,144.07, the S&P 500 gained 1.35 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,124.2 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.12 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,160.10. The Nasdaq ended at a record while the S&P 500 closed 0.3 percent below its own record.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,772 to 1,276, for a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,567 issues rose and 1,203 fell for a 1.30-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 180 new highs and 23 new lows.About 5.4 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 6.15 billion.

465,"  (Adds details of AT&T and Verizon restrictions, and of Dish bidding and next year's auction, T-Mobile and Wheeler comments; byline)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, June 25 The Federal Communications Commission is considering capping bidding discounts that small businesses can receive in U.S. auctions of airwaves, after Dish Network Corp partners sought $3 billion in discounts under current rules.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed the agency's first such cap on Thursday, and also dismissed T-Mobile US Inc's  request for new limits on how much spectrum dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc can buy in the next auction in 2016.The proposal, to be voted on at the July 16 meeting, is part of the FCC's preparation for next year's auction, expected to be its largest and most complex. Telecom companies will get their first chance since 2008 to buy low-frequency airwaves, highly prized for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings.The FCC is expected to decide in coming days whether Dish abused the small-business discount program by investing in companies with little or no revenue that can receive a 25 percent discount as so-called ""designated entities."" These companies bid more than $13 billion in the so-called AWS-3 auction that ended in January and sought more than $3 billion in discounts.FCC senior officials on Thursday declined to comment on their review of the Dish partners' bids. Dish declined to comment.Wheeler's proposal would cap the discount for small businesses at $150 million and for rural service providers at $10 million for the 2016 auction. It also would prohibit joint bidding agreements that involve a shared bidding strategy and multiple auction applications by parties with common controlling interests, with certain exceptions. ""We will not allow small businesses to serve as a stalking horse for another party,"" Wheeler said in a blog post.The FCC has also been under pressure from T-Mobile to set aside more airwaves for smaller carriers like itself in next year's auction. The Department of Justice on Wednesday wrote to the FCC to ""give considerable weight"" to concerns that biggest wireless carriers may pay up extra to dominate the auction. The agency voted last year to restrict the participation of Verizon and AT&T in the 2016 spectrum sale by reserving a piece of each market's airwaves for non-dominant carriers, including T-Mobile and Sprint Corp as AT&T and Verizon already control the vast majority of low-frequency airwaves.T-Mobile had sought a bigger amount.""Everyone with a wireless phone has a stake in the outcome of this proceeding, and the FCC should heed the calls of DoJ, many in Congress and a slew of consumer groups and move to strengthen the reserve,"" Andy Levin, T-Mobile's senior vice president for government affairs, said in a statement.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Bill Trott and Richard Chang)",2015-06-25,T,"Thu Jun 25, 2015 | 3:31pm EDT",UPDATE 1-U.S. FCC may cap small-business discount in airwaves auctions,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fcc-auction-idUSL1N0ZB1QI20150625?type=companyNews

475,"  * Morgan Stanley, AT&T have sold US$ bonds in Taiwan* Says to launch ETF on Formosa bond index next year* Says sees US$ - and yuan-bonds growing by $5 - $10 bln for rest of 2015   (Adds details in paragraphs 8-9)By Faith Hung and Emily ChanTAIPEI, July 6 Taiwan is aiming to set up its first exchange to list U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by foreign firms, in its latest effort to boost its capital markets and keep in line with global trends, the top financial regulator told Reuters.Morgan Stanley and AT&T are among those global names that have sold U.S.-denominated bonds in Taiwan, mostly to local insurance firms. However, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) says a bond exchange is necessary to make capital markets more active. ""We're studying proposals to have insurers take a certain portion of their bond positions to trade... We're aiming to reach a conclusion late this year,"" the FSC chief William Tseng said in an interview late on Friday.""The point in the future is to set up a secondary market,"" he said, adding London already has such a bond exchange.Taiwan, once criticized for not being open enough to foreign investors, has eased some major financial regulations since Tseng became the FSC chief in 2013. Keen to build Taiwan into a wealth management hub in Asia, regulators have made it easier for bonds to be issued by foreign companies and Chinese banks and raised the limit for insurance firms to invest overseas.Taiwan's yuan-denominated ""Formosa bonds,"" which are sold by Chinese banks here and the equivalent of Hong Kong's ""Dim Sum bonds,"" have also been growing thanks to the improved business ties with China.Trade ties across the Taiwan Strait have gathered steam since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008. For example, Taiwan is now the world's second-biggest offshore yuan market after Hong Kong, with more than 300 billion yuan in deposits. The FSC is planning to launch an EFT (exchange-traded fund) on a Formosa bond index next year, said the top financial regulator, without elaborating.China Development Bank, the mainland's biggest development bank, will sell Formosa Bonds in the second half of 2015, a source told Reuters last month.When being asked if the FSC would approve that, Tseng said ""We welcome them (China Development Bank).""Currently, Bank of China and other big mainland banks have sold Formosa bonds, using their offshore branches.The top financial regulator expects new issues of U.S. dollar-denominated and yuan bonds to increase by $5 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2015, compared with the current outstanding level of around $40 billion.

476,"  (New throughout, adds details on investment and plan changes)By Christine MurrayMEXICO CITY, July 16 Mexican telecoms giant America Movil, controlled by billioinaire Carlos Slim, will respond to a challenge from U.S. carrier AT&T by offering some subscribers free calls to and data in the United States, and will also invest $6 billion in its network in Mexico, its chief executive said on Thursday.AT&T Inc has challenged America Movil on its home turf with the purchases of two Mexican wireless operators. America Movil Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hajj said the company would eliminate roaming charges from Mexico to the United States for post-pay customers who opt to pay an extra 50 pesos ($3.16) per month.The company hopes to do the same for prepay customers, which make up more than 80 percent of its Mexico subscriber base, and extend the deal to cover Canada, he told a news conference in Mexico City. Rivals AT&T, Telefonica SA and T-Mobile US Inc  have all also introduced new packages with free calls between Mexico and the U.S. this year.The $6 billion would be invested in Mexico over the next three years, Hajj said. That figure is double the $3 billion AT&T pledged in Mexico investment in June, though the U.S. carrier has just 6 million Mexico subscribers, less than one tenth of America Movil's 72 million.America Movil was still looking at how to sell some assets but was in no rush, Hajj noted. America Movil is set to report its second-quarter results later on Thursday. The company said in July last year that it would sell assets in Mexico to cut its market share and avoid tough new measures imposed under a sweeping telecom reform aimed at curbing America Movil's dominance.In April, America Movil said it was reviewing the original plan to sell a cross-section of the company. It cited AT&T's purchase of Mexico's No. 3 and No. 4 wireless operators, which could increase competition.At the time, Hajj said the company no longer wanted to sell infrastructure, a share of its frequencies, or spectrum.($1 = 15.8030 Mexican pesos)   (Editing by Lisa Shumaker and David Gregorio)",2015-07-16,T,"Thu Jul 16, 2015 | 4:32pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Facing AT&T, America Movil pledges free roaming, $6 bln network upgrade",http://www.reuters.com//article/mexico-americamovil-idUSL2N0ZW21C20150716?type=companyNews

However, only 55 percent have topped revenue forecasts, below the 61-percent average beat rate since 2002.""Lack of revenue growth is definitely worrisome because at some point hiring is going to pick up and that will affect margins which will reduce financial engineering,"" said Luschini.S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.06 percent, with 107,411 contracts traded at 8:43 a.m. ET (1243 GMT).

The company said it will serve more than 26 million U.S. customers and more than 19 million in Latin America, making it the world's biggest pay-TV company.After more than a year of review, the Federal Communications Commission finalized its vote to approve the deal with conditions, imposed for four years and enforced by an internal and an external compliance officers.The requirements from the FCC, which ensures that deals are in the public interest, include protections for rival video and pledges to expand high-speed Internet services to schools, low-income Americans and other customers.The Justice Department gave its nod to the merger on Tuesday, saying that its antitrust review found no significant risks to competition. ""The conditions imposed by the Commission address potential harms presented by the combination,"" the FCC said in a statement. ""The conditions also ensure that the benefits of the merger will be realized.""With the merger, DirecTV gets the broadband product it previously lacked, and AT&T gets new avenues of growth beyond the maturing wireless service.

When the deal was first announced, analysts questioned the move. DirecTV's satellite TV business was hit by stagnation affecting the broad pay-TV market as viewers increasingly shift to watching videos on mobile devices.Since then, they have warmed to the idea that AT&T could benefit from DirecTV’s robust cash flow and customer base of 20.4 million. The company has said it expects annual cost savings from the deal of at least $2.5 billion by the third year.The success of the deal in passing regulatory muster is in sharp contrast to rival telecom mega-merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable Inc, which was rejected in April largely over the combined companies' reach into the broadband market.Video companies Netflix Inc and Dish Network Corp, traffic company Cogent Communications Holdings Inc and others had fought for the FCC to reject the $45 billion Comcast merger, but took a more lenient tack with AT&T. The companies pushed for limitations to AT&T’s power to slow down or charge fees for the web traffic traveling through its networks, as well as protections for competing video services.The issues are addressed by the FCC's conditions with requirements for AT&T to count its own affiliated video services toward any data caps on fixed broadband connections and to share with the FCC all traffic exchange agreements it strikes with content and web transit companies.AT&T also pledged to the FCC's to build out high-speed Internet connections to 12.5 million customer locations and to sell affordable broadband access to low-income Americans without bundling it with TV services.

492,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T, which on Friday received final U.S. regulatory approval to buy DirecTV, will offer ad-supported TV streaming and mobile video products while building out its advertising technology, John Stankey, the AT&T executive named as chief of the company's Internet and Entertainment division, told Reuters.Stankey, who was previously AT&T's chief strategy officer, will head a division that will craft over-the-top or TV streaming and mobile video products. He will also oversee the wireless distribution of mostly youth-oriented original content created by Otter Media, a joint venture of the telecom carrier and the investment group headed by media entrepreneur Peter Chernin.""It's a two-pronged approach - it's great premium content and scale that DirecTV brings married with the innovative cutting edge, new models that the Chernin organization is focused on and bringing those two together so we can meet customers' needs over time,"" Stankey said.AT&T's $48.5 billion deal to buy satellite TV company DirecTV Corp will create the No. 1 U.S. pay-TV company with over 26 million U.S. subscribers. The combined company is the second largest U.S. video subscription service after Netflix.AT&T is looking for new revenue streams as the wireless market stagnates. Whether it can effectively compete in the online video market as players such as Netflix and Dish Network Corp and new entrants like Verizon Communications rush to service viewers who increasingly watch video on mobile devices remains to be seen.AT&T will let DirecTV users stream linear TV content that they watch in their living rooms to their mobile devices even before they set up their satellite TV connection, in addition to offering new mobile video content services targeted at younger customers, according to Stankey.    He did not provide a timeline for the launch of Chernin's mobile video products but said revenue would come from ads, sponsored or free content and subscriptions.ADVERTISING REVENUE AT&T already has content rights to offer over 200 live TV channels such as ABC, Disney, ESPN and CNN that users can stream on mobile devices outside the home on its U-Verse broadband and TV service through an app.  While DirecTV has exclusive content deals such as the popular NFL Sunday Ticket and some wireless agreements in place, AT&T will negotiate to bring a U-Verse-like mobile viewing experience to DirecTV services, Stankey said.""That amount of content will increase virtually every quarter and that’s going to be a constant drumbeat march that we’re going to be on,"" he said.AT&T's bigger rival Verizon is gearing up to launch a mobile video service this summer with short-form content. In June, Verizon acquired AOL Inc, to access its ad technology and make a $4.4 billion bet that a push into mobile video and targeted advertising can help it find new growth avenues. AT&T will move aggressively on the advertising side by creating ad tools within the company and partnering or acquiring advertising technology firms, Stankey said.The combined company's ad revenue is currently $2 billion, Stankey said. ""We have high expectations that we are going to continue to grow that so we have a meaningful advertising business.""(Story refiles to add dropped words ""going to"" in quote in last paragraph.)

The auction, tentatively slated to start in March, will be a landmark one for the U.S. wireless industry as it will give participants their first chance since 2008 to buy low-frequency airwaves, which are valued for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings.The FCC voted last year to curb participation of carriers that held dominant slices of low-frequency airwaves in each market by reserving a piece of spectrum for bidding only by non-dominant carriers, but not to the extent T-Mobile sought. The vote was something of a compromise among the FCC's Democrats, who wanted to give smaller carriers a leg up while ensuring that restrictions on the big carriers would not cut the proceeds of the auction, expected to be the agency's largest.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere on Twitter played down the policy loss, touting the existence of the reserved spectrum in the first place. ""Good news - the reserve includes great quality spectrum & looks like the FCC will be monitoring closely so duopoly can't game the system,"" Legere tweeted, referring to the top two U.S. carriers, Verizon and AT&T.He said T-Mobile was committed to ""showing up, playing hard and being successful at the auction.""T-Mobile shares were down 1.2 percent at $40.24 in afternoon trading, while Verizon dipped 0.6 percent and AT&T fell 1.6 percent.

519,"   By Tim McLaughlin  AT&T Inc may take a charge estimated at $1.1 billion related to DirecTV's Venezuela assets in what is the latest U.S. company to confront the South American country's currency woes.The plunging value of Venezuela's currency cut nearly $3 billion in profit at U.S. blue-chip companies during the second quarter and prompted Procter & Gamble Co to remove its operations in the South American country from its consolidated financial reports. On Friday, AT&T said it is evaluating whether to use a less preferential currency exchange rate to value more than $1.1 billion in DirecTV assets in Venezuela. AT&T's disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was missed by much of the market. AT&T on Tuesday declined to comment on the filing.In July, AT&T completed its $48.5 billion merger with DirecTV to become the largest U.S. pay-TV company. AT&T has said previously that the primary value of the deal is in DirecTV's U.S. business. The value of DirecTV's $1.1 billion in Venezuelan assets is currently based on an exchange rate of 12 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar. AT&T said it may value the assets at the so-called Simadi exchange rate of about 200 bolivars per U.S. dollar, according to the SEC filing. Revaluing those assets at the less preferential Simadi rate would erase nearly all of the value of those Venezuelan assets, AT&T said.""If AT&T changes to the Simadi exchange rate, it will have a negative impact on reported revenues, operating income and the fair value of our investment in the Venezuelan subsidiary,"" the company said in the SEC filing. Venezuela introduced the Simadi rate in February as part of a currency devaluation. With slumping crude oil prices and debt payments coming due this year, the Venezuelan government has fewer U.S. dollar reserves available to meet the private sector’s demands. As a result, U.S. corporations say they are having a harder time obtaining dollars from operations in the country than any time since currency controls were first implemented in 2003.     In the first quarter of 2015, DirecTV's Venezuela operations generated $200 million in revenue and operating profit before depreciation and amortization of $75 million. Had DirecTV used the Simadi rate for that quarter, those operations would have reported an operating loss, AT&T said in the filing.

Revaluing those assets at the less preferential Simadi rate would erase nearly all of the value of those Venezuelan assets, AT&T said.""If AT&T changes to the Simadi exchange rate, it will have a negative impact on reported revenues, operating income and the fair value of our investment in the Venezuelan subsidiary,"" the company said in the SEC filing. Venezuela introduced the Simadi rate in February as part of a currency devaluation. With slumping crude oil prices and debt payments coming due this year, the Venezuelan government has fewer U.S. dollar reserves available to meet the private sector's demands.As a result, U.S. corporations say they are having a harder time obtaining dollars from operations in the country than any time since currency controls were first implemented in 2003.In the first quarter of 2015, DirecTV's Venezuela operations generated $200 million in revenue and operating profit before depreciation and amortization of $75 million. Had DirecTV used the Simadi rate for that quarter, those operations would have reported an operating loss, AT&T said in the filing.

537,"  Dec 8 AT&T Inc Chief Executive Randall Stephenson on Tuesday hinted at launching a mobile video streaming service as early as January to target price-conscious U.S. viewers who don't currently have payTV subscriptions.AT&T is interested in putting together a bundle of content that can be viewed on a smaller screen, or to a single screen in a home that's not set-top box-driven, Stephenson said.""It is something we are pursuing very, very aggressively and you should assume that we will be doing something in the market with that,"" he said at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York. AT&T is looking for new revenue streams as the wireless market stagnates. The online video market is a competitive space with established players such as Netflix Inc and Dish Network Corp and new entrants like Verizon Communications rushing to service viewers who consume video on mobile devices. AT&T has already acquired rights to stream content to mobile devices for various premium cable channels such as Showtime and will deploy 40 megahertz of contiguous spectrum to relay content over its network, Stephenson said.""We think we have about as robust an entertainment portfolio of content for our customers as any OTT (over-the-top) provider out there,"" he said.

546,"   By Liana B. Baker and Malathi Nayak  Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica SA has expressed interest in buying AT&T Inc's pay TV assets in Latin America, which could be valued at around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.AT&T bought the Latin American assets as part of its acquisition of DirecTV last year. The business includes satellite and cable television services in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and several other countries.The U.S. telecoms company has yet to decide if it will explore a deal with Telefonica or another company, the people familiar with the matter said. Other parties are interested in AT&T's assets in specific countries, and the company may choose to run several sale processes, one of the people said. One potential buyer could be Liberty Global Plc, that person added.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.  Telefonica and AT&T declined to comment. Liberty Global could not immediately be reached for comment. AT&T has about 19 million pay TV subscribers in Central and South America, making it the biggest player in the region. But profits have been pressured by depreciating currencies in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said at an industry conference in December that AT&T would consider selling the Latin American business, but that the company was patient.""So if somebody were interested in talking about a strategic combination of those assets with a different product, we would have to look at it. Would we consider selling them? Yes, but we are in no rush,"" Stephenson said. Telefonica, which has debt of about 50 billion euros ($54 billion), has been shuffling its portfolio in recent months. It agreed to sell its O2 UK business to CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd for 10.3 billion pounds ($15 billion). It is also planning to sell or spin off its Spanish infrastructure unit, including wireless towers, later this year, Reuters previously reported.  The Spanish company is a major wireless player in Latin America under the brands Movistar in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico; it also owns Vivo in Brazil. Telefonica's regional pay TV operations, however, are smaller, and trail AT&T and American Movil's Claro. AT&T owns about 93 percent of Sky Brasil, the largest satellite provider in the region's biggest economy. It owns  PanAmericana, which offers satellite TV services under the DirecTV brand in countries including Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Puerto Rico. It is also a shareholder in Sky Mexico, which is controlled by Mexico's Grupo Televisa.  (Reporting by Liana B.

Proceeds from the  notes are expected to be used to refinance debt maturing in 2016 as well as for  general corporate purposes. AT&T's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently  'A-', and the Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Large Scale and Financial Flexibility: The 'A-' rating assigned to AT&T is  underpinned by the company's diversified revenue mix, its significant size and  economies of scale as the largest telecommunications operator in the U.S., solid  free cash flow (FCF) following the DIRECTV acquisition and Fitch's expectation  that it will benefit from continued growth in wireless operating cash flow. Deleveraging Expected: The rating and Stable Outlook reflect AT&T's intent to  delever to a net leverage target of 1.8x and to dedicate FCF after dividends and  any asset sale proceeds to the reduction of debt over the three-year period  following the completion of the DIRECTV transaction in July 2015. The DIRECTV  and other 2015 transactions (discussed below) caused 2015 pro forma net leverage  to rise to approximately 2.3x from 1.8x at year-end 2014. After 2015, Fitch  believes leverage will gradually decline, likely reaching approximately 2x by  the end of 2017, which in Fitch's view is appropriate for the 'A-' rating. DIRECTV Acquisition: AT&T completed its acquisition of DIRECTV on July 24, 2015  for consideration of $47.1 billion. Consideration consisted of $14.4 billion of  cash and equity of $32.7 billion, based on the value of AT&T's stock. In  addition, DIRECTV had $15.9 billion in net debt for a total transaction value of  $63 billion (about $4 billion less than when proposed due mainly to $2.7 billion  less in net debt).  Spectrum Licenses Acquired: Debt levels also increased due to the acquisition of  spectrum in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) AWS-3 spectrum action,  which closed at the end of January 2015. AT&T paid approximately $18.2 billion  to acquire contiguous 10x10 MHz blocks of AWS-3 spectrum covering approximately  96% of the U.S. population. As this spectrum is deployed, it will increase  capacity to support the rapid growth of data services on AT&T's mobile broadband  network. Broadcast TV Spectrum Auction: Potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction, anticipated to begin in March 2016, is not included in  Fitch's assumptions and will be an event-driven consideration. The company has  indicated it will participate in the auction as it is interested in acquiring  10x10 MHz contiguous licenses nationwide but has not committed to spending  levels. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Consolidated revenues rise in the low- to mid-teens in 2016 primarily due to  the full year effect of DIRECTV's results in operations. Thereafter, Fitch  estimates revenue increases will be in the low single digits approximating  Fitch's estimates for GDP growth. EBITDA margins are forecast to be in the low  30% range during the forecast period. --There are no stock repurchases in the forecast as the company is focused on a  three-year period of debt reduction. --In 2016, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be in line with  company guidance of $22 billion, slightly higher than the $20 billion spent in  2015 (total capital investment was $20.7 billion in 2015 inclusive of $700  million invested in Mexico under a vendor financing arrangement). Included in  the $22 billion forecast is approximately $1 billion of capitalized interest.  For the longer term, Fitch estimates capital spending will approximate 15% of  service revenues. --Potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV broadcast auction, currently  anticipated to occur in early 2016, is not included in Fitch's assumptions and  will be an event-driven consideration. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely for  AT&T in the foreseeable future, given the leverage incurred primarily through  the DIRECTV acquisition and spending on spectrum.  Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating  performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower than  anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material debt-financed  acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above  2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a  negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: At Dec. 31, 2015 the company did not have any drawings  on its revolving credit facility (RCF). AT&T entered into a new $12 billion RCF  in December 2015, replacing a $5 billion RCF due 2018 and a $3 billion RCF due  2017. The principal financial covenant for the RCF requires debt-to-EBITDA, as  defined, to be no more than 3.5x. At Dec. 31, 2015, the company's cash and cash  equivalents totalled $5.1 billion.  For 2016, Fitch estimates FCF after dividends is expected to be in the range of  $4 billion-$6 billion, including DIRECTV.  At Dec. 31, 2015, actual total debt outstanding was approximately $126.2 billion  Debt Maturities: Relative to the company's cash, RCF availability, and modest  expected FCF, Fitch believes upcoming debt maturities are manageable. In 2016,  approximately $7.3 billion matures, including $1.8 billion putable to AT&T. Contact: Primary Analyst John C. Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

In April last year, the company launched a new U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc's networks.Google last participated in a 2008 FCC auction but did not buy any airwaves.  ""Like all those interested in improved connectivity and equitable access, we'll be following the upcoming spectrum auction closely. That said, we have not filed to participate,"" the Google spokeswoman said.The FCC will be auctioning off valuable 600 megahertz airwaves that can travel long distances and penetrate buildings. The auction is aimed at wireless carriers and other companies that want to improve existing wireless networks or build new ones. Wireless providers such as Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and T-Mobile and cable operator Comcast Corp have said they will take part in the auction. The FCC's deadline for interested bidders to file applications to participate in the auction ended on Wednesday. The auction will kick off on March 29.

It will deploy 40 megahertz of contiguous airwaves to relay content over its network.""We intend to offer customers a quality pay-TV experience, including top channels, sports and more, with increased value and flexibility of pure online streaming and no need for home installation,” John Stankey, CEO, AT&T Entertainment Group, said in a statement. Stankey will be speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday morning.DIRECTV will continue offering its satellite TV package that can also be streamed through an app on mobile devices, in addition to its U-Verse TV and Internet services, the company said.

575,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO GameStop, one of the most shorted U.S. stocks, has started to attract institutional buyers and dissuade some traders betting against it as it fights off a consumer shift toward downloading video games and its depressed share price stabilizes.Shares of the retailer dropped from $46 to $25 in the two months through mid-January and then recovered to just over $30, where they've hovered steadily in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the number of institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, has jumped 21 percent, according to research firm Morningstar.Over the last two weeks, short sales in GameStop's stock have fallen by $100 million, leaving $1.1 billion in bets against the company on the table, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. Pessimism about GameStop grew after online movies and music drove video rental company Blockbuster and most record stores out of business. Traders have been betting that the same is bound to happen to GameStop as Electronic Arts and other studios push consumers to buy games directly on their videogame consoles instead of at stores.Indeed, GameStop's sales of new video games have fallen sharply over the past four years, but it is making up for that by expanding into new businesses, including selling cellphones.It has dedicated more shop space to action figures and other collectible merchandise, and it recently issued $475 million in debt to fund a tentative purchase of up to 500 AT&T retail stores. That would add to 1,000 AT&T, Cricket Wireless and Simply Mac stores acquired and opened by GameStop since 2013.  Thanks partly to that strategy, analysts on average see revenue on track for a fourth straight year of growth, according to Thomson Reuters data. 'A DUMB SHORT' At the end of 2015, a number of large institutions, including the New Jersey Division of Investment, major hedge and mutual fund manager AQR Capital Management and Vanguard Group, each reported buying a million shares or more. GameStop trades near 8 times expected earnings, below its five-year average of about 9 times earnings. That valuation, along with GameStop's strong free cash flow and 4.7 percent dividend yield, underpin BB&T analyst Anthony Chukumba's ""buy"" rating. ""It's not that I'm ignoring the long-term issues, I just think they're more than priced in at current levels,"" Chukumba said, referring to the threat of game studios bypassing GameStop.The most recent decline in short selling extends a downward trend from the end of last year, when it was often the most shorted stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index. According to Markit, the number of shares on loan, a proxy for short selling, declined from 38 percent a month ago to 33 percent this week, a significant change, although still a relatively high level. Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and return them to their owner. A majority of analysts have ""hold"" or equivalent recommendations on GameStop, including Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joe Feldman, who said he would not upgrade his rating until he saw more evidence that its diversification would lead to consistent growth.On March 24, GameStop reports its fourth-quarter results, which investors will scrutinize for more signs of progress in diversifying. Brad Lamensdorf, a short sale specialist and co-manager of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF, said Gamestop's low price-to-earnings multiple and relatively high dividend make it a better company to own than to short.""It's a dumb short. It's more akin to a value stock,"" Lamensdorf said.

576,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A quiet decision by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to recently sell three TV stations may foreshadow uncertain returns for some selling TV airwaves and lower wireless demand in the U.S. government's upcoming spectrum auction, industry watchers say.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auction, which kicks off on March 29, will sell low-frequency airwaves held by TV broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders.  Blackstone-controlled investment vehicle LocusPoint Networks LLC bought at least 16 stations from San Francisco to Miami, spending $66 million since 2012, according to FCC filings and data from research firm SNL Kagan. Other well-funded buyout firms such as OTA Broadcasting LLC backed by billionaire Michael Dell and NRJ TV LLC, funded by Fortress Investment Group, have also snatched up TV stations in the run-up to the auction.But in late November, shortly before the FCC began accepting applications from TV stations to sell spectrum, Blackstone's LocusPoint agreed to sell three stations in Baltimore, Detroit and Buffalo, New York, for about $24 million, according to FCC filings reviewed by Reuters. The deal closed late last month.That's five times the $4.8 million Blackstone paid, but just 5 percent of the government's $477 million stated opening bid prices for the three stations' spectrum licenses. Its acceptance of the deal for $24 million implies Blackstone lowered its expectations for the auction, even as the government's $477 million opening bid was not realistic,  analysts said. The FCC will first hold a ""reverse auction,"" gradually reducing its offer to the lowest amount participating TV broadcasters will accept. Wireless companies then bid for airwaves. ""There’s a general agreement among broadcasters that the opening bid prices that you see registered are high and that you won’t be getting that,"" said Dr. John MacKerron, professor at Towson University who manages student-run WMJF-CD in Towson, Maryland, one of the three sold to HME.Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner forecasts the 2016 auction proceeds at $20 billion to the low $30 billion range. The FCC's ""AWS-3 auction"" that ended last year saw record  bids of $44.9 billion.""If it would be a massive success, (Blackstone) wouldn’t sell right now, right before (the auction),"" Enter said.  While spectrum in certain geographic areas around metropolitan areas is attractive, there is a glut in secondary markets, analysts said. Moreover, some of the biggest wireless bidders are still digesting their investments from the previous FCC auction that ended last year, they added. Blackstone sold to HME Equity Fund II, owned by U.S. President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, and retired National Basketball Association player Grant Hill, and others, according to filings. Blackstone declined to comment and a lawyer for HME did not respond to requests for comment.  The three stations sold are among those in Blackstone's portfolio with lowest opening bid prices. Stations that LocusPoint has retained in major markets such as San Francisco and Orlando say ""cha-ching,"" Entner said. If HME is unable to sell the licenses, ""they could sell (after the auction) for less than what LocusPoint paid for them,"" SNL Kagan analyst Justin Nielson said.OTA and NRJ have not sold stations ahead of the auction, he added.Top U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc(VZ.N)  and AT&T Inc (T.N) , pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Corp (DISH.O) have filed to participate, but some analysts do not expect them to bid aggressively. T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) has said it needs low-frequency spectrum for network enhancements. Sprint Corp (S.N) will sit out.

580,"   By David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday kicked off an auction of low-frequency spectrum relinquished by television  broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders that are seeking new airwaves to build and improve wireless networks.The so-called ""broadcast incentive"" auction is considered one of the FCC's most complex and ambitious spectrum auctions to date.    The first step is a ""reverse auction,"" where the government recovers spectrum from broadcasters that will voluntarily give up airwaves either to go off the air for a payout or be shifted to another frequency band for a smaller sum.""A successful auction means that spectrum will be repurposed, a huge amount of money will change hands, and technology and spectrum policy will be shaped for the future,"" said National Association of Broadcasters Executive Vice President Rick Kaplan. Of the 1,800 eligible broadcasters, an undisclosed number submitted applications to take part. Eligible broadcasters have until 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday to submit a binding agreement to take part.The reverse auction should be completed by summer and will be followed by a ""forward"" auction, where the government sells to telecommunications operators and other bidders the spectrum, which it will package into new bands. The results of that auction are expected by October.The government plays the middleman in the auction, which is  designed to give broadcasters an incentive to sell at the lowest price and encourage telecommunications companies to buy at the highest price. The government keeps a large part of the difference.The names of the TV broadcasters that are participating in the reverse auction will not be revealed by the FCC during the auction. Last week, the FCC said it saw 104 applications for the forward auction, 69 of them complete and 35 incomplete. Participants included wireless companies Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O).Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a unit Mexican telecommunications provider America Movil SAB (AMXL.MX), rural carriers  and financial companies such as Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital have also filed to take part. Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the $15 billion to $45 billion range, but they said they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC's last auction, the ""AWS-3 auction,"" which ended last year and attracted a record $44.9 billion in bids.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said the FCC has seen strong interest in the auction and will boost wireless data. ""If broadband Internet service is an engine for economic growth, then mobile broadband has been its booster rocket, creating a platform for innovation, competition and new markets,"" he said.

587,"   By Sai Sachin R  EHarmony on Friday launched a recruitment portal, but the online matchmaker's long-promised service will begin to generate revenue only late this year, a company executive told Reuters.The new website, called Elevated Careers, will be offered free for job seekers for now, while companies looking to hire can sign on for free trials, Dan Erickson, director of special projects, said in an interview.""I'd say that real dollars (from Elevated Careers) will be focused on late fourth quarter,"" Erickson said.EHarmony has already signed on at least two big partners for six-month trials - AT&T Inc and American Airlines, Erickson said, adding that organizations with a workforce of around 1,000 would hypothetically pay $10,000 annually once the service is priced. ""Our goal is to have 10 to 20 of those foundational partners on board to help us continue to refine the technology and pricing,"" he said.EHarmony, which will enter the $6 billion-a-year online career market dominated by LinkedIn and Monster, will ""match"" job-seekers and employers using an algorithm that will factor in skills, personality and values and culture. Chief Executive Neil Clark Warren said last year that the company expects its recruitment business to account for about 60 percent of its total revenue within three years.EHarmony had also expected 2015 revenue to grow in ""high and double-digit"" percentages to between $275 million and $350 million. In the online dating space, Los Angeles-based eHarmony competes with Barry Diller-controlled Match Group Inc which owns popular app Tinder and sites Match.com and OkCupid.

596,"   By Georgina Prodhan | HANOVER, Germany  HANOVER, Germany U.S. telecoms provider AT&T is betting it can carve out a significant business in connecting objects with one another, the head of that unit told Reuters in an interview, as it seeks new revenue sources in an oversaturated wireless market.The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast-growing area where industrial and consumer firms and software providers are teaming up to offer smarter ways of doing things such as predicting mechanical problems before they arise, controlling machines at home remotely or integrating municipal services.AT&T already has a strong position in the automotive industry, where it has 10 major carmakers using a platform it has developed to deliver services such as roadside assistance, weather reports or Internet radio to cars on the road.""We're just at the beginning,"" Chris Penrose, senior vice president of AT&T's IoT organization, told Reuters in an interview at the Hannover Messe industry trade fair, adding that more automotive partners were ""in the works"".""It is a top priority of our company to continue to be a leader in the IoT space.""Most Americans already own a mobile phone, and the U.S. wireless industry is turning to connected cars and devices for growth. AT&T's partners include General Motors, Audi (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford. The global IoT market is expected to grow to $1.7 trillion by 2020 from $656 billion in 2014, according to market research firm IDC. In first-quarter results reported on Tuesday, AT&T said it lost subscribers to its TV services and signed up fewer-than-expected monthly wireless customers - highlighting the need to develop new business areas. AT&T is working to avoid the pitfalls of the past - where telecoms carriers largely played the role of ""dumb pipes"" used to convey lucrative services for the likes of Netflix, Google or Apple while bearing the costs of building the wireless networks. ""We have the ability not only to connect things ... we also have the ability to enable the collection and the analytics of the data behind those as well as do it in a secure manner and do it globally,"" Penrose said.But he said AT&T did not insist that customers use its own platforms, rather allowing them to use their preferred technology. ""We want to be the very best collaboration partner,"" he said. ""Sometimes we will provide connectivity and that's OK.""At the Hannover Messe, AT&T announced new deals including one with Otis, in which it will connect data from Otis elevators to Microsoft's Azure cloud, enabling Otis to access real-time equipment performance data. Penrose said in this case AT&T would add value through the security of its connection. In other cases, it might exploit its more mundane but essential expertise in areas like billing - a core competence of wireless carriers.AT&T does not disclose how much revenue it makes from the Internet of Things. Rival Verizon said it made about $690 million in IoT revenue in 2015, up 18 percent year on year, of a total $132 billion in revenue.AT&T has about 26 million connected objects and is connecting more than a million more every quarter, Penrose said.

597,"  MEXICO CITY America Movil said on Wednesday first-quarter profit fell more than 40 percent from a year ago, as mobile competition from AT&T Inc intensified in Mexico and it started paying rent on cell towers after a sweeping regulatory overhaul.The 2013 overhaul was aimed at curbing America Movil's 70 percent market share in Mexico by forcing it to share cell towers and other equipment with rivals, and letting them connect calls to its network for free.The company, which had long dominated Latin American telecommunications, was pressured to spin off its cell towers in 2015 into a new company, which it now pays rent to. AT&T, which had been America Movil's partner for more than two decades, entered Mexico's market on its own in late 2014 by buying up the No. 3 and No. 4 carriers.America Movil, controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim, said in a statement that the margin on its Mexico earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA) hit a new low of 35.7 percent in the first quarter. The margin has fallen every quarter since the reform.Profit of 4.798 billion pesos ($278 million) was less than one-third of the 15.328 billion pesos expected by analysts in a Reuters I/B/E/S poll. In Mexico, revenue was hurt by America Movil's new competitive plans, tower payments to Telesites, and a fall in the Mexican peso, which made dollar-denominated handsets more expensive, the company said.But America Movil said was still winning new mobile subscribers at home, adding more than 1.4 million in the quarter. AT&T said in its earnings release on Wednesday that it added 500,000 new subscribers in Mexico in the quarter.America Movil is also grappling with a deepening economic recession in Brazil, its second-largest market. In the first quarter, it lost more than 6 million wireless subscribers there and overall revenue fell, the company said.

611,"   By Liana B. Baker  Quantenna Communications Inc, a U.S. company that designs Wi-Fi chips used in set-top boxes and wireless routers, has hired investment banks for an initial public offering (IPO) that could come later this year, people familiar with the matter said.Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is the lead underwriter on the IPO, and the company is also working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Barclays Plc (BARC.L), the people said this week. Depending on market conditions, the company could be valued at more than $300 million, the people added. Quantenna is aiming to file its IPO prospectus during the third quarter of 2016 at the earliest, the people said, asking not to be identified because the company's plans are confidential. Quantenna did not respond to a request for comment. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Barclays declined to comment.   If Quantenna moves ahead with its plans, it would be one of the few venture-backed technology IPOs expected this year. Stock market jitters and technology stocks performing poorly have made investors wary of buying growth-oriented IPOs. Reuters previously reported that Talend Inc, a U.S. software firm backed by venture capital firms, had also hired investment banks for an IPO.Quantenna would also be a rare IPO in semiconductors, a capital-intensive sector that has seen venture capital funding dry up over the past decade.  The chip industry has undergone massive consolidation in the past two years, with transactions such as Avago Technologies Ltd buying Broadcom Corp (AVGO.O), one of Quantenna's larger competitors, in a deal that closed in February.Aquantia Corp, a semiconductor company focused on data center and enterprise chips, has also been working on an IPO of its own, a source familiar with the matter said. Aquantia declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported on Aquantia's IPO plans last year. Quantenna has raised about $160 million in funding since it was founded in 2006. The Sunnyvale, California-based company's investors include Sequoia Capital, DAG Ventures, Venrock, Sigma Partners and Australia's Southern Cross Venture Partners.Quantenna sells chips that provide high-performance wireless internet to manufacturers of set-top box makers for cable and telecom providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Bell Canada and Telefonica SA (TEF.MC). It has shipped more than 60 million chips used in more than 90 products. (Reporting by Liana B.

612,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) revealed a more than $1 billion stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a rare foray into the technology sector, which Buffett has largely shunned apart from a poorly performing investment in IBM (IBM.N). Shares of Apple rose 3.7 percent on the news, closing up $3.36 at $93.88. Berkshire made its investment in the first quarter, before the iPhone maker in April reported its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years.The investment was announced amid an increasing view among investors that Apple may deserve a lower valuation because its heady growth days may be over. However, Apple has a strong balance sheet and management, attributes long favored by Berkshire.""It makes sense because it's a consumer company disguised as a technology company with a great business model, strong cash flow and a cheap valuation,"" said Jeff Matthews, author of books about Buffett and a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund. ""It's not a leap of faith.""In a regulatory filing detailing most of its stock holdings, Berkshire said it held 9.81 million Apple shares worth $1.07 billion as of March 31.The value of the stake has since fallen to about $921 million, even with Monday's gain. Berkshire's largest technology bet has been Buffett's roughly $12.1 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp, an investment now more than $1.6 billion in the red.  Apple stock ""is stunningly cheap, and it has a massive pile of cash,"" said Steve Wallman, founder of Wallman Investment Counsel in Middleton, Wisconsin, who has owned shares of Berkshire since 1982 and Apple since 2003. ""Apple is not getting credit for research and development it is doing behind the scenes.""An Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.MIXED VIEWS OF HEDGE FUNDS  The Apple investment was made by one of Buffett's two stockpicking deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his assistant said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. Combs and Weschler, who ran hedge funds before joining Berkshire, each invest about $9 billion and usually make smaller wagers, while Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, makes bigger investments such as IBM.Investors said Combs may have been the Apple buyer. He  invested in chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for Berkshire in 2011.Buffett's assistant did not respond to a request for comment.In April, Apple said revenue for the quarter ended March 26 declined as an increasingly saturated smartphone market hurt iPhone sales, which fell for the first time. Chief Executive Tim Cook is looking to develop other technologies for the Cupertino, California-based company, and last week unveiled a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing.Apple's market value last week dipped below that of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), even though Apple generates roughly triple the revenue and profit. Before Monday, shares of Apple were down by a third from their April 2015 peak. Synovus Trust Company portfolio manager Daniel Morgan, noting that Buffett is known as a value buyer, said; ""That kind of puts the icing on the cake that Apple now is probably considered more of a mature technology company, like we would think of Microsoft, Intel or Cisco.""I don’t think we can put them in the same bracket right now as Google, Amazon (AMZN.O) or Netflix (NFLX.O),” said Morgan said, who owns Apple because of its low price-earnings ratio and high dividend yield.""It's a value stock that has the potential for a big growth,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York who also holds Apple stock.Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is also a fan, and his firm Greenlight Capital on Monday said it boosted its Apple stake by 31 percent in the first quarter.Other prominent investors have retrenched.Last month, billionaire Carl Icahn said he sold his Apple stake on concern about the company's relationship with China. David Tepper's Appaloosa LP sold its stake in the first quarter, while Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates and Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management slashed their stakes. Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors also shed its Apple stake, a person familiar with the matter said.BUFFETT ON YAHOO Despite his traditional aversion to technology sector, Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he offered to help Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, finance a bid for internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).Reuters first reported Buffett's involvement on Friday. While Buffett told CNBC he would not be an equity partner, he could collect dividends or interest on the financing, and perhaps take an equity stake later.""Buffett has always restricted himself from investing in things he doesn't know or understand, and staying within his circle of confidence,"" said Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook & Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham, Alabama, which invests 8 percent of the $350 million it manages in Berkshire.The Apple investment may have been made with proceeds from the sale of AT&T Inc (T.N) stock, as Berkshire exited what had been a $1.6 billion stake.In Monday's filing, Berkshire also reported higher stakes in IBM, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Visa Inc (V.N), and lower stakes in MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

613,"  Sergio Garcia displayed shades of Seve Ballesteros on his way to victory at the AT&T Byron Nelson in Texas on Sunday, matching his late countryman for most career wins by a Spaniard on the PGA Tour.Garcia overcame some poor swings to collect his ninth tour victory, beating American Brooks Koepka in a playoff at the TPC Four Seasons in Irving.""I won a bit a la Seve today. I definitely wasn't really on,"" Garcia said in a greenside interview after finding two water hazards in the final round but still coming through to win.""It means so much (to match Ballesteros). I played really well the last five holes, including the playoff, but other than that I was battling with my swing a little bit, playing hard and chipping great, and made some great putts.""Garcia carded a closing 68, while Koepka shot 71. They finished at 15-under 265, one stroke ahead of American Matt Kuchar.Garcia won with a par at the first extra hole after Koepka yanked his drive into a water hazard. ""I had no idea where the ball was going (the final two rounds) and you can’t play out here when you’re hitting it in the rough,"" said a disappointed Koepka. It is Garcia's first victory on the PGA Tour since 2008, though the 36-year-old has continued to pile up victories outside the U.S.Garcia's win is a big boost to his hopes of making the European team for this year's Ryder Cup, where he hopes to carry on Ballesteros' legacy. Garcia has a huge passion for the biennial team event against the United States. He has played in it seven times, on five occasions on the winning side.""I played nicely this week,"" Garcia continued. ""I know I can play better. Obviously this is going to jump me (up the Ryder Cup rankings), which means a lot to me. ""My swing wasn’t all the way there but I played as hard as I could with what I had."" Five-times major winner Ballesteros played a huge part in making the Ryder Cup competitive back in the early 1980s, after decades of American dominance.Renowned as one of the game's great short game exponents, he died of a brain tumor in 2011 at the age of 54.

621,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Yahoo Inc is set to put together a new shortlist of bidders for its core internet assets after several parties, including Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, made second-round offers, people familiar with the matter said.In a boon to the prospects of AT&T and other bidders in the auction, Verizon's offer was at the low end of those received, despite the synergies it could benefit from thanks to its ownership of media unit AOL, one of the people said.No committed financing was required for second-round bids, and Yahoo will assemble in the coming days a new shortlist of bidders from which it will solicit binding offers, the people said.Earlier on Thursday, CNBC reported, citing sources, that Verizon's bid of more than $3.5 billion was topped by multiple offers at or above $5 billion. It did not name the parties that made the higher offers. A group led by a founder of Quicken Loans Inc, Dan Gilbert, and backed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett also submitted an offer, one of the Reuters sources said.While some buyout firms dropped out of the race over concerns about whether Yahoo's internet assets would be viable as a standalone business, TPG Capital LP and a consortium of Bain Capital Private Equity and Vista Equity Partners Management LLC made offers, according to the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because details of the auction are confidential. Yahoo, Verizon, AT&T, TPG and Bain declined to comment, while Quicken Loans and Vista did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, is primarily interested in Yahoo's advertising technology tools, and has been examining how the other assets up for sale, such as search, mail and messenger, could be combined with the corresponding businesses of AOL, which it acquired last year for $4.4 billion, Reuters reported last month. AT&T, which has been seeking to catch up with Verizon in advertising technology as it seeks to expand in mobile video offerings, has been working with an investment bank on its bid, according to one of the sources.A sale of Yahoo's internet assets would leave the company just owning a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which accounts for most of its value.In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake, after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis.",2016-06-09,T,"Thu Jun 9, 2016 | 6:28pm EDT",AT&T seeks to top Verizon as Yahoo reviews new bids -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/yahoo-ma-verizon-idUSL1N191180?type=companyNews

627,"   By Deborah M. Todd | San Francisco  San Francisco Yahoo Inc's venerable email system could have a better shot at challenging category crusher Gmail if a telecommunications company wins a Yahoo asset auction and presents it to a wider audience.Both Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc are set to make third and final round bids for Yahoo's 'core' business of mail, Web and advertising products, according to people familiar with the matter. A consortium led by Quicken Loans Inc Founder Dan Gilbert and backed by Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett will also make it to the final round, the people added.A telecommunication company could give Yahoo Mail distribution on mobile devices that gives it a fighting chance to compete with Gmail and Apple Mail, which come pre installed on many Android and Apple devices, analysts said. Yahoo's media unit could get a similar boost.Broader distribution would be a 'game changer' for mail and the other older services, raising their value to bidders with mobile reach, said Karsten Weide, an analyst for research firm International Data Corporation.  ""It's not because they have bad content or bad products. They just don't have the distribution,"" Weide said. He said in recent years telcos have been telling manufacturers which apps they want to see pre installed on smartphones as a condition of carrying the products. Telcos in particular can benefit from Yahoo's technology for placing ads. Verizon could become the number three ad tech player after Google and Facebook with the purchase, said Dave McIninch, chief revenue officer of search and performance marketing firm Acquisio. It is not clear whether telcos see extraordinary value in mail. Verizon is focused on Yahoo's ad technology, Reuters has reported, and Needham and Company analyst Laura Martin noted that Verizon acquired AOL for its ad tech and never put AOL mail on phones.In the last year, Yahoo has rolled out new features such as an inbox capable of accessing other email services and a password-free sign-in that verifies users via text message.Yahoo says that consumers are gravitating to its mobile email while Google and Microsoft focus on corporate products. Google and Microsoft said they can satisfy both audiences. Yahoo Mail's new mobile App gets strong reviews on the Apple and Google Play app stores, and Yahoo says daily emails sent and received since 2013 are up 15 percent, while iOS app usage has doubled over the last 18 months. Yahoo declined to discuss profit or revenue at the ad-supported service.Web industry researcher ComScore shows that Yahoo Mail U.S. mobile use doubled to 36.5 million users per month over the three years to March, even as Yahoo mail desktop use nearly halved. That's slightly faster mobile growth in percentage terms than Gmail, but Gmail is adding more users: Gmail had 89.6 million mobile users, more than Yahoo's combined 67.8 million desktop and mobile.

628,"   By Malathi Nayak  Satellite TV operator Dish Network Corp blacked out the National Football League-owned sports channels, NFL Network and NFL RedZone, the first time the league has been dropped by a TV services provider, the NFL said.The NFL channels went dark on Dish's network on Thursday evening, after a disagreement over distribution fees.“Our contract with NFL Network has expired. We remain open to a fair offer that allows us to carry this content at an appropriate value to our customers,"" Dish said in a statement.The NFL said it currently reaches 60 million homes and has set up a website that lists television networks that still carry its channels so viewers can watch games through other providers such as Comcast Corp's  XFINITY and AT&T Inc's DIRECTV. www.iwantnflnetwork.com TRIBUNE DISPUTE Dish is also locked in a battle with Tribune Media Co over fees to carry Tribune-owned stations and cable network WGN America.  Cable and satellite TV distributors are increasingly negotiating hard with programmers, resisting demands for price increases to carry content at a time when viewers are being drawn to Netflix Inc, Amazon Prime and other online services. Such contract standoffs have made blackouts commonplace in the television industry.Dish said on Sunday about 5 million subscribers had lost access to 42 Tribune-owned local channels and cable network WGN America in 33 markets across 34 states and the District of Columbia.On Thursday, Dish asked Tribune to agree to an arbitration process to restore its channels. Dish has said it has been giving customers free antennas to help them gain access to Tribune's programming. In response, Tribune suggested the U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitor contract talks between the two parties. ""Regrettably, we can only interpret Tribune's unwillingness to participate in binding arbitration as an indication that it actually is angling for rates that are above fair market,"" Dish's executive vice president of programming, Warren Schlichting, said in statement on Friday.Tribune has maintained that it is offering Dish the same rate it has under deals with other pay-TV partners.

AT&T said it added 1.4 million new wireless subscribers, including 257,000 postpaid customers, or those who pay monthly bills.However, its total video subscribers were down 49,000 in the quarter.

641,"   By Deborah M. Todd and Jeffrey Dastin | SAN FRANCISCO July 21  SAN FRANCISCO July 21 Former Yahoo executive Dan Rosensweig has not worked at the pioneering internet company in nearly a decade.But last week, as Yahoo Inc prepared to sell its core internet business, he was sporting a Yahoo T-shirt and, in an interview, reveled in memories of the company's heyday, along with the deep impact its alumni had - and still have - in shaping Silicon Valley.He recalled a workforce that believed ""they were doing something that mattered: bringing people information,"" said Rosensweig, the company's chief operating officer from 2002 until 2007. ""I hire as many ex-Yahoos as I can, because I know their commitment, their talent.""Rosensweig - now CEO of the online education company Chegg Inc - is one of scores of executives around Silicon Valley who still ""bleed purple,"" as many Yahoo alums put it, despite the company's more recent instability and decline.In the formative years of the web, Yahoo was the biggest, richest internet upstart in Silicon Valley, and it incubated a generation of executives. Now, as a sale and possible dismemberment of the company looms, a wave of sorrow and nostalgia is reverberating through the Yahoo diaspora.""People are sad,"" said Change.org President Jennifer Dulski, who left Yahoo in 2007 after nearly a decade. ""Until it really is over, a lot of us believe there will be a chance for resurgence.""She compared the emotions surrounding the auction to ""when your parents sell your childhood home.""Launched in 1994 by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the world wide web. The company soared, and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble - and then emerged from the rubble as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits.The peak came in the mid-2000s, many former executives say, with advertisers desperate for a presence in the new online medium filling the company's coffers. But even then, Google  was busily undermining Yahoo's core business - helping people find things on the internet.By 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp and struggling to define its mission. That core question was never really answered, leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities. Google, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and a host of new companies, meanwhile, claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoo's.The auction of the company's core assets - which has drawn bids from Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and others and is expected to conclude by the end of the month - is likely to value them at about a hundredth of what Google-parent Alphabet Inc is worth. The auction does not include Yahoo's valuable stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut, and Yahoo Japan Corp.THE ALUMNI NETWORK Some of the 23 former Yahoo executives interviewed by Reuters carry other emotions, including frustration with all the missed opportunities, and anger over the management dysfunction that has plagued the company for a decade. Still, many former employees remember the Yahoo of a certain era as a special place, pointing to a youthful energy, a culture of learning and the excitement of being on the front lines of the internet revolution.""Working at Yahoo for people who were young in their career was like going to a large research university,"" said Dan Finnigan, a former senior vice president of Yahoo and now president and CEO of Jobvite. ""People who started in media went into sales, people who started in sales went into recruiting, people went from engineering to product. It was highly encouraged.""Luanne Calvert, chief marketing officer at Virgin America Inc, was at Yahoo from 1999 to 2002. She credits the experience with making her career.""It was pretty amazing that you could kind of create your own job"" at Yahoo, as she did. ""I became the queen bee of buzz marketing ... It changed my life in terms of (experience that was) really relevant to the future of marketing.""Many ex-Yahoos are quick to acknowledge that the company eventually lost focus as it grew big and bureaucratic, and came to be dominated internally by endless meetings and powerpoint presentations. By 2010, said Shashi Seth, who arrived that year as a senior vice president, ""people just looked at Yahoo as a job. It wasn't their passion.""Still, even today, the eagerness of ex-Yahoos to work with one another is undiminished. A Meetup group, at least two Facebook groups, a smartphone app called ""xY!z Network"" and a LinkedIn group with more than 15,000 members tie the ex-Yahoos together. For some, connections with fellow Yahoo alumni turned into lasting business relationships.Slack, the red-hot business messaging upstart, was founded by Flickr creator and former Yahoo executive Stewart Butterfield, and financed by former vice president of Yahoo search Andrew Braccia, who is now a general partner at venture capital firm Accel.Accel has also invested in Cloudera, co-founded by former Yahoo engineering VP Amr Awadallah.Ann Crady Weiss, a former director of business development at Yahoo and co-founder of nursery products company Hatch Baby, said the majority of financing she's received since leaving Yahoo and starting two businesses ""came either directly from a Yahoo person or one degree of separation from a Yahoo person.""""For me, that alumni network and those referrals set me on a path for success,"" she said. ""Yahoo was critical to my future.""Rob Solomon, former Yahoo senior vice president of commerce and current GoFundMe CEO, last year published a list of several dozen former Yahoo executives who moved on to become Silicon Valley power players. Some of its other illustrious members include LinkedIn Corp CEO Jeff Weiner, WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, and the late SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg.The power and reach of the Yahoo diaspora, Solomon said, helps dull the pain of the company's decline.""We know each other, we trust each other,"" he said. ""We've been through a lot together and will all help each other out.""(Reporting by Deborah M.

""People are sad,"" said Change.org President Jennifer Dulski, who left Yahoo in 2007 after nearly a decade. ""Until it really is over, a lot of us believe there will be a chance for resurgence.""She compared the emotions surrounding the auction to ""when your parents sell your childhood home."" Launched in 1994 by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the world wide web. The company soared, and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble - and then emerged from the rubble as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits.The peak came in the mid-2000s, many former executives say, with advertisers desperate for a presence in the new online medium filling the company's coffers. But even then, Google (GOOGL.O) was busily undermining Yahoo's core business - helping people find things on the internet.By 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and struggling to define its mission. That core question was never really answered, leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities. Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and a host of new companies, meanwhile, claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoo's.The auction of the company's core assets - which has drawn bids from Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N) and others and is expected to conclude by the end of the month - is likely to value them at about a hundredth of what Google-parent Alphabet Inc is worth. The auction does not include Yahoo's valuable stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.K), the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut, and Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T).THE ALUMNI NETWORK Some of the 23 former Yahoo executives interviewed by Reuters carry other emotions, including frustration with all the missed opportunities, and anger over the management dysfunction that has plagued the company for a decade.Still, many former employees remember the Yahoo of a certain era as a special place, pointing to a youthful energy, a culture of learning and the excitement of being on the front lines of the internet revolution.   ""Working at Yahoo for people who were young in their career was like going to a large research university,"" said Dan Finnigan, a former senior vice president of Yahoo and now president and CEO of Jobvite. ""People who started in media went into sales, people who started in sales went into recruiting, people went from engineering to product. It was highly encouraged.""Luanne Calvert, chief marketing officer at Virgin America Inc (VA.O), was at Yahoo from 1999 to 2002. She credits the experience with making her career.""It was pretty amazing that you could kind of create your own job"" at Yahoo, as she did. ""I became the queen bee of buzz marketing ... It changed my life in terms of (experience that was) really relevant to the future of marketing.""Many ex-Yahoos are quick to acknowledge that the company eventually lost focus as it grew big and bureaucratic, and came to be dominated internally by endless meetings and powerpoint presentations. By 2010, said Shashi Seth, who arrived that year as a senior vice president, ""people just looked at Yahoo as a job. It wasn't their passion."" Still, even today, the eagerness of ex-Yahoos to work with one another is undiminished. A Meetup group, at least two Facebook groups, a smartphone app called ""xY!z Network"" and a LinkedIn group with more than 15,000 members tie the ex-Yahoos together. For some, connections with fellow Yahoo alumni turned into lasting business relationships. Slack, the red-hot business messaging upstart, was founded by Flickr creator and former Yahoo executive Stewart Butterfield, and financed by former vice president of Yahoo search Andrew Braccia, who is now a general partner at venture capital firm Accel.Accel has also invested in Cloudera, co-founded by former Yahoo engineering VP Amr Awadallah. Ann Crady Weiss, a former director of business development at Yahoo and co-founder of nursery products company Hatch Baby, said the majority of financing she's received since leaving Yahoo and starting two businesses ""came either directly from a Yahoo person or one degree of separation from a Yahoo person.""""For me, that alumni network and those referrals set me on a path for success,"" she said. ""Yahoo was critical to my future.""Rob Solomon, former Yahoo senior vice president of commerce and current GoFundMe CEO, last year published a list of several dozen former Yahoo executives who moved on to become Silicon Valley power players. Some of its other illustrious members include LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N) CEO Jeff Weiner, WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, and the late SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg.The power and reach of the Yahoo diaspora, Solomon said, helps dull the pain of the company's decline.""We know each other, we trust each other,"" he said. ""We've been through a lot together and will all help each other out.""   (Reporting by Deborah M.

648,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to AT&T  Inc.'s (AT&T; NYSE: T) senior unsecured exchange notes. AT&T commenced an offer  to exchange up to 21 series of existing senior unsecured notes previously issued  by AT&T and certain operating subsidiaries for new notes and cash.  The first pool of nine series existing notes will be exchanged for up to $2.5  billion principal amount of new notes due 2048, and the second pool of 12  existing notes will be exchanged for up to $2.5 billion of new notes due 2049.  For either maturity, if less than $500 million of new notes would be issued,  then the respective tenders for the corresponding pool will be cancelled and no  new notes issued.  AT&T's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Large Scale and Financial Flexibility: The 'A-' rating assigned to AT&T is  underpinned by the company's diversified revenue mix, its significant size and  economies of scale as the largest telecommunications operator in the U.S., solid  free cash flow (FCF) following the DIRECTV acquisition, and Fitch's expectation  that it will benefit from continued growth in wireless operating cash flow. Deleveraging Expected: AT&T intends to delever to a net leverage target of 1.8x  and to dedicate FCF after dividends and any asset sale proceeds to the reduction  of debt over the three-year period following the completion of the DIRECTV  transaction in July 2015. This and other transactions caused 2015 pro forma net  core telecom leverage (which excludes securitized equipment installment  receivable debt) to rise to approximately 2.3x from 1.8x at year-end 2014. After  2015, Fitch believes core telecom leverage will gradually decline, likely  reaching approximately 2x by the end of 2017, which in Fitch's view is  appropriate for the 'A-' rating. Broadcast TV Spectrum Auction: Potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction, which started in March 2016 or participation in the Request  for Proposals (RFP) process for the FirstNet nationwide public safety broadband  network, is not included in Fitch's assumptions and will be an event driven  consideration. DIRECTV Acquisition: AT&T completed its acquisition of DIRECTV on July 24, 2015  for consideration of $47.1 billion. Consideration consisted of $14.4 billion of  cash and equity of $32.7 billion, based on the value of AT&T's stock. In  addition, DIRECTV had $15.9 billion in net debt for a total transaction value of  $63 billion (about $4 billion less than when proposed due mainly to $2.7 billion  less in net debt). Spectrum Licenses Acquired: In 2015, debt levels also increased due to the  acquisition of spectrum in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) AWS-3  spectrum auction. AT&T paid approximately $18.2 billion to acquire contiguous  10x10 MHz blocks of AWS-3 spectrum covering approximately 96% of the U.S.  population. As this spectrum is deployed, it will increase capacity to support  the rapid growth of data services on AT&T's mobile broadband network. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Consolidated revenues rise in the low- to mid-teens in 2016 primarily due to  the full year effect of DIRECTV's results in operations. Thereafter, Fitch  estimates revenue increases will be in the low-single digits approximating  Fitch's estimates for GDP growth. EBITDA margins are forecast to be in the low  30% range during the forecast period. --Fitch has assumed there are no stock repurchases through 2018given the  company's near-term focus on debt reduction. --In 2016, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be in line with  company guidance of $22 billion, slightly higher than the $20 billion spent in  2015 (total capital investment was $20.7 billion in 2015 inclusive of $700  million invested in Mexico under a vendor financing arrangement). Included in  the $22 billion forecast is approximately $1 billion of capitalized interest.  For the longer term, Fitch estimates capital spending will approximate 15% of  service revenues. For 2016, Fitch estimates FCF after dividends is expected to be in the range of  $4 billion to $6 billion. --Fitch's assumptions do not include potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction or for potential spending on the FirstNet nationwide public  safety broadband network, should AT&T be successful in winning the contract.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely for  AT&T in the foreseeable future, given the leverage incurred primarily through  the DIRECTV acquisition and spending on spectrum. Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating  performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower than  anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material debt-financed  acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above  2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a  negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: At June 30, 2016 the company did not have any drawings  on its revolving credit facility (RCF). AT&T entered into a new, five-year $12  billion RCF in December 2015, replacing a $5 billion RCF due 2018 and a $3  billion RCF due 2017. The principal financial covenant for the RCF requires net  debt-to-consolidated EBITDA, as defined, to be no more than 3.5x. At June 30,  2016, the company's reported cash and cash equivalents totalled $7.2 billion of  which $600 million resides in foreign jurisdictions. At June 30, 2016, reported total debt outstanding was approximately $126.8  billion Debt Maturities: Relative to the company's cash, RCF availability, and modest  expected FCF, Fitch believes upcoming debt maturities are manageable. In the  remainder of 2016, approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt matures. In  2017, approximately $9.5 billion of long-term debt matures, including $1.8  billion of putable debt.

650,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON AT&T Inc will pay $7.75 million in refunds and fines after federal investigators found it allowed unauthorized third-party charges related to phony directory-assistance service on its customers' telephone bills, U.S. regulators said on Monday.The fraud was uncovered by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration while investigating two Ohio companies for drug-related crimes and money laundering, the Federal Communications Commission said.AT&T, the Dallas-based telecommunications giant, allowed ""scammers to charge customers approximately $9 per month for a sham directory assistance service,"" the FCC said. AT&T received a fee from the companies for each charge AT&T placed on its customers’ bills, the FCC added.The settlement includes $6.8 million in refunds and a $950,000 federal fine, the FCC said.AT&T signed a consent decree with the FCC and agreed to cease billing for nearly all third-party products and services on landline bills and adopt procedures to obtain express consent from customers prior to allowing third-party charges. The company also agreed to revise its billing practices to ensure third-party charges are conspicuously identified on bills. AT&T said in a statement it has ""implemented strict requirements on third parties submitting charges for AT&T bills to ensure that all charges are authorized by our customers; indeed, those requirements go beyond the requirements of FCC rules and impose safeguards that the FCC proposed but never adopted.""The FCC said two Cleveland-area companies, Discount Directory Inc and Enhanced Telecommunications Services, were billing thousands of consumers for a monthly directory assistance service on their AT&T landline telephone bills. The companies never provided any directory assistance service, the FCC said. ""A phone bill should not be a tool for drug traffickers, money launderers, and other unscrupulous third parties to fleece American consumers,"" FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said.AT&T said it stopping billing for the two companies in June 2015. ""Unbeknownst to us, two companies that engaged in a sophisticated fraud scheme were apparently able to circumvent those protections,"" AT&T said.AT&T said it plans to send refund checks to consumers within 90 days. In 2014, AT&T agreed to pay $105 million in fines and refunds to current and former wireless customers for unauthorized third-party subscriptions and premium text messaging services as part of a settlement with the FCC, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.

652,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc, the No. 2 U.S wireless provider, said on Wednesday that it would roll out a new data plan that does away with overage fees and reduces data speeds for wireless customers who surpass their data allowance.Beginning Sunday, customers can choose the new Mobile Share Advantage plan and pay for extra data, if needed, or work with slower data speeds instead of paying for overages, the company said in a statement. Its current plan includes a $5 data overage charge per 300 megabytes on its 300-megabyte plan and $15 per 1 gigabyte on other plans.

The move came after AT&T's bigger rival, Verizon Communications Inc, announced a feature last month called ""safety mode"" that protects users against data overages and slows down speeds. ""In a competitive market, Verizon and AT&T cannot afford to ignore each other,"" Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said. ""If one does something, the other one has to follow suit.""Moreover, Verizon and AT&T have been reworking their plans as smaller competitors T-Mobile, which eliminated data overage charges in 2014, and Sprint, which offers half-off dicsounts, are luring customers away to their services, Entner added.  AT&T has also revised prices and data bucket sizes. For instance, its larger 25-gigabyte plan now costs $190 per month for four smartphone lines. It previously cost $235.All the new plans include an access charge of $10 to $40 per month for each device, AT&T said.

655,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON More than 30 major technology and communication companies said on Friday they are joining the U.S. government to crack down on ""robocalls,"" automated, prerecorded phone calls that regulators have labeled a ""scourge."" AT&T Inc (T.N), Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) are among members of the ""Robocall Strike Force"" that held its first meeting with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on ""concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,"" said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group.The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a ""Do Not Originate"" list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. ""This scourge must stop,"" Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. ""The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,"" Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue ""due in large part to industry inaction.""Stephenson emphasized ""the breadth and complexity"" of the problem.""This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,"" Stephenson said. ""Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop."" The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge.The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. ""We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,"" Stephenson said. ""We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.""  Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had ""preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.""Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. ""We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet,"" she said.

665,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON, Sept 7  WASHINGTON, Sept 7 The top U.S. communications regulator plans on Thursday to unveil a revised plan to allow about 100 million pay TV subscribers to replace expensive set-top boxes with less-costly apps that provide access to television and video programs, two people briefed on the plan said.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device.The plan, aimed at breaking the cable industry's long grip on the lucrative pay TV market and lowering prices for consumers, drew fierce opposition from TV and content providers, including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.The FCC has said Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent, the FCC has estimated. The pay TV industry raised concerns over copyright, content licensing and privacy issues and made a counterproposal in June, offering to commit to creating its own apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box.Wheeler's revised plan is expected to include some components of the pay TV industry's proposal, and to exempt some smaller cable providers from the new requirements. The plan is also expected to create a licensing body to oversee the pay-TV apps, according to industry filings with the FCC. The revised application-based proposal is expected to come before the five-member commission for a vote on Sept. 29 at the commission's next meeting, the sources briefed on the matter said.Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, declined to comment. Disney, CBS, Viacom, Time Warner  Inc, Scripps Networks Inc and others met with Wheeler aides last week to discuss ""a revised approach... that would ensure that all of programmers' valuable content would remain inside of, and under the control of, apps developed exclusively by"" cable and other pay-TV providers, according to a filing with the FCC this week.These companies fear that rivals like Alphabet Inc  or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content.Wheeler's January proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to produce a single device or app to gain access to content from providers such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu, Alphabet's YouTube and a pay-TV company.Wheeler has an aggressive agenda in the final months of the Obama administration. He wants the FCC to finalize a proposal to ensure privacy for broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. He also wants to complete reforms of the $40 billion annual market for business data services known as special access lines.

The energy index was off 1.1 percent, while health  was down 0.9 percent. J&J and Merck 1 percent. Exxon's 1 percent decline and Schlumberger's  4 percent drop weighed on the energy index.However, helping limit losses was a record-setting rally in Microsoft and a rise in McDonald's on the back of their strong quarterly reports.Microsoft surged as much as 5.6 percent to an all-time high of $60.45, while McDonald was up 3.1 percent.GE's weak report came on the heels of lackluster results from other heavyweights such as Verizon and Travelers . ""If companies cannot beat estimates in this (low-rate) environment, it raises the question of what will happen when the Fed raises rates in December,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive at Sarhan Capital.At 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 45.02 points, or 0.25 percent, at 18,117.33.The S&P 500 was down 3.46 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,137.88 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 7.53 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,249.36. The persistent strength in the dollar, which affects the overseas income for companies also worried investors. The dollar  hit an eight-month high.""A strong dollar has become the new reality, but the question going forward is how much stronger the dollar is going to get and one of the biggest risks is the Fed raising rates,"" Sarhan said.Eight of 11 major S&P 500 indexes were trading lower, with the telecom services sector falling 2.1 percent.AT&T fell nearly 2.7 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the wireless carrier was in advanced talks to buy Time Warner, whose stock surged 10 percent.Reynolds surged 13.4 percent after British American Tobacco's $47 billion-offer to buy the 58 percent of the tobacco company it doesn't already own.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,556 to 1,281. On the Nasdaq, 1,509 issues fell and 1,113 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed seven new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 33 new lows.

692,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) Jeff Bewkes welcomed AT&T Inc's (T.N) Randall Stephenson for lunch at Time Warner Center in New York in late August, their meeting was supposed to be one of the catch-ups the two chief executives have had over the years.And it certainly started that way, with the two men chatting about the direction of the media, broadband and mobile telecommunications industries, according to accounts given by Stephenson and Bewkes as well as people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. Stephenson and Bewkes discussed how Time Warner could reach more customers through AT&T's mobile network, and how that content could reinforce the loyalty of customers. Some of this could be achieved through closer ties and partnerships. But then Stephenson showed his hand. He proposed an outright merger of the two companies, the biggest shakeup in the U.S. media landscape since U.S. telecommunications giant Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) takeover of media conglomerate NBC Universal in 2011.""The more we talked about it, the more it fell into place, that there would be benefits that might be significant and might allow us to evolve the ecosystem faster,"" Bewkes told reporters on a conference call on Saturday. Comcast's deal had greatly influenced Stephenson's thinking, spurring him to look for media and video acquisitions now that AT&T had the most video subscribers in the U.S. with 25 million. The media companies he first looked at buying, such as Starz (STRZA.O), which later merged with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGF.N), and Scripps Network Interactive Inc (SNI.O), were too small for his liking. Stephenson's problem was that the big media companies he deemed attractive were not easy targets. CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) were family controlled, while Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), with a $150 billion market capitalization, was too big. When Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) made a hostile acquisition approach to Time Warner in 2014, AT&T was awaiting regulatory approval on its deal to buy DirecTV, and couldn't pursue another large deal at the same time. During the year after the DirecTV acquisition closed in July 2015, AT&T had been thinking about going two ways; either a big international acquisition, or a big content deal. Before buying DirecTV, it had looked at combining its business with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) in Europe, according to the sources. But after buying two smaller wireless companies in Mexico, it couldn't find an international acquisition that suited its appetite. More than a year after the DirecTV deal closed however, Stephenson felt he had the firepower to pursue Time Warner with an $85.4 billion cash-and-stock bid, this year's biggest attempted acquisition globally. The deal was referred to within AT&T, in order to prevent leaks, as ""Project Bobtail"", whose aim was to acquire ""Rabbit"", the code name for Time Warner and perhaps a homage to Warner Bros' Bugs Bunny character. AT&T's code name was ""Lily"", the same as the customer service person who appears in their commercials.""This thing just had what I would call gravity, and it seemed to move along on its own and we began negotiating out terms very quickly and it was a very natural process,"" Stephenson said on the media call. TRUSTED BANKERS     Soon after Stephenson proposed the combination to Bewkes, the companies called in their most trusted investment bank advisers.          AT&T decided to work with Woody Young, who had joined boutique bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP in January. He had worked on deals for AT&T for two decades, and most recently advised AT&T on its DirecTV deal in 2014, when he was at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).    Time Warner enlisted Allen & Company LLC banker Ketan Mehta, who had been Time Warner's banker for 12 years and had most recently defended Time Warner from Fox when he was at Citi in 2014. He had also helped defend Time Warner against activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006.    The priority was to keep the deal secret from the media, a challenge given that Time Warner has large fiefdoms in the industry, with HBO in New York, Turner Broadcasting and its news unit CNN in Atlanta and Warner Bros in Los Angeles. Time Warner never reached out to other potential suitors during its talks with AT&T, according to the sources. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), widely speculated as another potential buyer for Time Warner, never showed a strong interest, the sources said, pointing out that after Fox's bid for Time Warner many other companies considered an acquisition but never made any offers.    Large investment banks were brought on for financing in the week leading up to AT&T's and Time Warner's announcement on Saturday. When Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that the two companies had informal conversations about a merger without advisors, Stephenson and Bewkes had already shaken hands on the deal and their boards were close to approving it over the weekend.    To finalize the deal, Time Warner's board met in the offices of law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP's offices in New York and AT&T's board meeting was held at its headquarters in Dallas on Saturday.     The deal was announced Saturday night, which caused Stephenson, an Oklahoma native, to miss a University of Oklahoma college football game. He had to ask a reporter for the score.

698,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc (T.N) said on Saturday it agreed to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) for $85.4 billion, the boldest move yet by a telecommunications company to acquire content to stream over its network to attract a growing number of online viewers. The biggest deal in the world this year will, if approved by regulators, give AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. The tie-up will likely face intense scrutiny by U.S. antitrust enforcers  worried that AT&T might try to limit distribution of Time Warner material. AT&T will pay $107.50 per Time Warner share, half in cash and half in stock, worth $85.4 billion overall, according to a company statement. AT&T said it expected to close the deal by the end of 2017.Dallas-based AT&T said the U.S. Department of Justice would review the deal and that the companies were determining which Federal Communications Commission licenses, if any, would  be transferred to AT&T in the deal.U.S. lawmakers were already worried about cable company Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal, and several argued for close regulatory scrutiny of the AT&T deal. ""Such a massive consolidation in this industry requires rigorous evaluation and serious scrutiny,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senate Judiciary Committee member and former attorney general of Connecticut. ""I will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks.""U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a rally he would block any AT&T-Time Warner deal if he wins the Nov. 8 election. Trump has complained about media coverage of his campaign, especially by Time Warner's CNN. ""It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" said Trump.Representatives of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CONTENT PLUS DELIVERY AT&T, whose main wireless phone and broadband service business is showing signs of slowing, has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse. It bought satellite TV provider DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion.  It had about 142 million North American wireless subscribers as of June 30, and about 38 million video subscribers through DirecTV and its U-verse service. New York-based Time Warner is a major force in movies, TV and video games. Its assets include the HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT networks as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the “Batman” and “Harry Potter” film franchises. The company also owns a 10 percent stake in video streaming site Hulu. The HBO network alone has more than 130 million subscribers. AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told reporters on a conference call that owning Time Warner and all its content will provide a greater competitive advantage than just continuing to license it.Talks between Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes began in August, they said. ""Jeff and I both had a vision that if you put these two together, you could innovate much faster,"" said Stephenson. Bewkes, who rejected an $80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014, will stay on for an open-ended period of time to help with the integration.Stephenson called the deal ""vertical"" rather than ""horizontal"" and played down regulatory hurdles.""There's no competitor being removed from the marketplace,  there's no competitive harm that is being rendered by putting these two companies together,"" said Stephenson. ""So any concerns by the regulators, we believe, will be adequately addressed by conditions, that's our anticipation.""  Time Warner must pay AT&T $1.725 billion if it finds a different buyer. If regulators block the deal, AT&T must pay Time Warner $500 million, according to people familiar with the deal.The telecom and media sectors have been consolidating. In addition to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal, AT&T's wireless rival Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is in the process of buying internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) for about $4.8 billion. FINANCING AT&T said it would finance the cash portion of the purchase with new debt and cash on its balance sheet. AT&T said it has an 18-month commitment for an unsecured bridge term facility for $40 billion.AT&T has only $7.2 billion in cash on hand. Further borrowing could pressure its credit rating as it already had $120 billion in net debt as of June 30, according to Moody's. AT&T said the deal would add to earnings per share in the first year after closing. It said it expected $1 billion in annual run-rate cost savings within three years of closing, chiefly driven by lower corporate and procurement spending.Shortly after the deal was announced, AT&T reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents, the same as in the year-ago period and matching Wall Street's average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It hiked its quarterly dividend by a penny to 49 cents per share. Time Warner said its third-quarter earnings, which have not yet been announced, would show growth in revenue and operating income at each division and double-digit earnings growth.5G IS COMING Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies  bargaining leverage with other content companies as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or switch to watching online. New mobile technology including next-generation 5G networks could make a content tie-up especially attractive for wireless providers. ""We think 5G mobile is coming, we think 5G mobile is an epic game-changer,"" Rich Tullo, director of research at Albert Fried & Co, said in a research note, adding that mobile providers would be in position to disrupt traditional pay-TV services. A previous Time Warner blockbuster deal, its 2000 merger with AOL, is considered one of the most ill-advised corporate marriages on record.Perella Weinberg Partners LP, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co were financial advisers to AT&T, with Bank of America and JPMorgan also offering bridge financing, while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Arnold & Porter LLP provided legal advice.

699,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc (T.N) said on Saturday it agreed to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) for $85.4 billion, the boldest move yet by a telecommunications company to acquire content to stream over its network to attract a growing number of online viewers. The biggest deal in the world this year will, if approved by regulators, give AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. The tie-up will likely face intense scrutiny by U.S. antitrust enforcers  worried that AT&T might try to limit distribution of Time Warner material. AT&T will pay $107.50 per Time Warner share, half in cash and half in stock, worth $85.4 billion overall, according to a company statement. AT&T said it expected to close the deal by the end of 2017.Dallas-based AT&T said the U.S. Department of Justice would review the deal and that the companies were determining which Federal Communications Commission licenses, if any, would  be transferred to AT&T in the deal.U.S. lawmakers were already worried about cable company Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal, and several argued for close regulatory scrutiny of the AT&T deal. ""Such a massive consolidation in this industry requires rigorous evaluation and serious scrutiny,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senate Judiciary Committee member and former attorney general of Connecticut. ""I will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks.""U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a rally he would block any AT&T-Time Warner deal if he wins the Nov. 8 election. Trump has complained about media coverage of his campaign, especially by Time Warner's CNN. ""It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" said Trump.Representatives of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CONTENT PLUS DELIVERY AT&T, whose main wireless phone and broadband service business is showing signs of slowing, has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse. It bought satellite TV provider DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion.  It had about 142 million North American wireless subscribers as of June 30, and about 38 million video subscribers through DirecTV and its U-verse service. New York-based Time Warner is a major force in movies, TV and video games. Its assets include the HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT networks as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the “Batman” and “Harry Potter” film franchises. The company also owns a 10 percent stake in video streaming site Hulu. The HBO network alone has more than 130 million subscribers. AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told reporters on a conference call that owning Time Warner and all its content will provide a greater competitive advantage than just continuing to license it.Talks between Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes began in August, they said. ""Jeff and I both had a vision that if you put these two together, you could innovate much faster,"" said Stephenson. Bewkes, who rejected an $80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014, will stay on for an open-ended period of time to help with the integration.Stephenson called the deal ""vertical"" rather than ""horizontal"" and played down regulatory hurdles.""There's no competitor being removed from the marketplace,  there's no competitive harm that is being rendered by putting these two companies together,"" said Stephenson. ""So any concerns by the regulators, we believe, will be adequately addressed by conditions, that's our anticipation.""  Time Warner must pay AT&T $1.725 billion if it finds a different buyer. If regulators block the deal, AT&T must pay Time Warner $500 million, according to people familiar with the deal.The telecom and media sectors have been consolidating. In addition to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal, AT&T's wireless rival Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is in the process of buying internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) for about $4.8 billion. FINANCING AT&T said it would finance the cash portion of the purchase with new debt and cash on its balance sheet. AT&T said it has an 18-month commitment for an unsecured bridge term facility for $40 billion.AT&T has only $7.2 billion in cash on hand. Further borrowing could pressure its credit rating as it already had $120 billion in net debt as of June 30, according to Moody's. AT&T said the deal would add to earnings per share in the first year after closing. It said it expected $1 billion in annual run-rate cost savings within three years of closing, chiefly driven by lower corporate and procurement spending.Shortly after the deal was announced, AT&T reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents, the same as in the year-ago period and matching Wall Street's average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It hiked its quarterly dividend by a penny to 49 cents per share. Time Warner said its third-quarter earnings, which have not yet been announced, would show growth in revenue and operating income at each division and double-digit earnings growth.5G IS COMING Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies  bargaining leverage with other content companies as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or switch to watching online. New mobile technology including next-generation 5G networks could make a content tie-up especially attractive for wireless providers. ""We think 5G mobile is coming, we think 5G mobile is an epic game-changer,"" Rich Tullo, director of research at Albert Fried & Co, said in a research note, adding that mobile providers would be in position to disrupt traditional pay-TV services. A previous Time Warner blockbuster deal, its 2000 merger with AOL, is considered one of the most ill-advised corporate marriages on record.Perella Weinberg Partners LP, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co were financial advisers to AT&T, with Bank of America and JPMorgan also offering bridge financing, while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Arnold & Porter LLP provided legal advice. Allen & Co LLC, Citigroup Inc and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisers to Time Warner, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP was its legal adviser.

701,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Supantha Mukherjee  Wall Street signaled skepticism on Monday that AT&T Inc would secure the government approvals needed to carry out its planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc, with shares of both companies falling as analysts scrutinized the deal. Time Warner shares were trading some 20 percent below the implied value of AT&T's $107.50 per share cash and stock offer, indicating investors doubt that the companies would be able to complete the transaction.The deal, announced on Saturday, would give AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted assets and reshape the media landscape.Dallas-based AT&T said on Saturday it would need approval of the U.S. Department of Justice and the companies were determining which Time Warner U.S. Federal Communications Commission licenses, if any, would need to transfer to AT&T. Any such transfers would require FCC approval. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Monday he expects government clearances for the deal because it is a so-called vertical integration that will not eliminate a competitor, a situation that is viewed more favorably by antitrust enforcers. ""While regulators will often times have concerns with vertical integrations, those are always remedied by conditions imposed on the merger, so that's how we envision this one to play out,"" Stephenson told CNBC.Despite its big media footprint, Time Warner has only one FCC-regulated broadcast station, WPCH-TV in Atlanta.

The biggest deals to fall apart in 2016 include Office Depot–Staples, Baker Hughes–Halliburton, Allergan–Pfizer and Norfolk Southern–Canadian Pacific Railways. Many of the deals drew objections from the Department of Justice and U.S. Treasury. ""We are unprepared at this point to assign anything higher than a 50/50 probability of deal approval,"" wrote MoffettNathanson Research in a report, downgrading Time Warner to 'neutral' but raising its target price by $8 to $100.The deal's arbitrage spread of more than 20 percent is wider than five other recent deals that regulators subsequently shot down or were withdrawn, including Comcast Corp's planned takeover of Time Warner Cable. That deal had a spread of only 5 percent. The deal, announced just over two weeks before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, was also generating skepticism among both Republicans and Democrats.OTHER QUESTIONS  Others were unnerved by the rationale for the deal and the massive $170 billion debt balance the combined company may hold after the deal closes.“The CEOs couldn’t easily explain the synergies and I can’t clearly understand them,” said Sen, who also expressed concern about AT&T embarking on a new deal so shortly after buying DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion. “How successfully will it integrate these three large and different businesses?” he asked.  Analysts at Cowen & Co said it was a ""struggle"" to understand why the acquisition made sense.

705,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the 'A-' Long-Term Issuer  Default Ratings (IDRs) and outstanding debt of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) (NYSE: T) and  its subsidiaries on Rating Watch Negative. The company's 'F2' Short-Term IDR and  commercial paper rating are affirmed based on the expectation that a downgrade,  if it occurs, will be limited to one notch.  Fitch has affirmed the Long-Term IDRs of Time Warner Inc. and its subsidiaries  at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The rating action affects  approximately $24.5 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016. See the full list of rating actions at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Acquisition of Time Warner: Fitch believes AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner  Inc. provides AT&T a strong foothold in the evolving communications and media  landscape. The acquisition, combined with AT&T's 2015 acquisition of DIRECTV,  offers the potential to capitalize on emerging trends for mobile video and  over-the-top (OTT) video delivery. Other benefits include the diversification of  AT&T's revenue stream, and additional financial flexibility owing to Time  Warner's strong free cash flows.  The Negative Watch for AT&T reflects the increase in leverage for AT&T, pro  forma for the transaction. AT&T currently operates with gross leverage at the  upper end of Fitch's expectations for the current 'A-' rating. At the end of  2018, approximately one year after the expected close of the transaction, Fitch  estimates AT&T's gross leverage will be 2.7x. As currently proposed, the  transaction would potentially lead to a one-notch downgrade for AT&T to  'BBB+'/Stable Outlook. However, the final rating would depend on Fitch's further  analysis of the transaction, an assessment of AT&T's post-acquisition financial  policies, the effect of any additional conditions placed on the transaction by  the regulatory approval process, and an updated view of AT&T's potential  spectrum spending in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) ongoing 600  MHz broadcast spectrum auction. The affirmation of Time Warner reflects its capital allocation strategy, which  includes continued investment in its businesses to strengthen its product  portfolio and maintaining a strong balance sheet (net leverage target of around  2.75x). Under the merger agreement, Time Warner is expected to cease stock  repurchases, with excess cash generation becoming available to reduce net debt  at the time of the transaction close. Additionally, Time Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability,  recurring dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable networks businesses. Fitch expects  these businesses will continue to generate a significant amount of Time Warner's  earnings and cash flow. Fitch believes AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner would provide the combined  company with a strong position to address the threats and opportunities present  in the evolving media landscape, including the growing prominence of alternative  distribution platforms and audience fragmentation within the context of a  stagnant multichannel video subscriber base. Fitch also believes demand for  high-quality content remains strong across all major end markets (broadcast  networks, cable networks and subscription video on demand) and that large,  well-capitalized content providers, such as Time Warner, will remain crucial to  the industry.  Deleveraging Expected: On the announcement of the Time Warner transaction, AT&T  affirmed its commitment to delever to a net leverage target of 1.8x four years  after the close of the transaction as FCF is used to reduce debt. In addition to  the incremental FCF from Time Warner in 2018 and beyond, Fitch's base case for  AT&T on a stand-alone basis incorporates moderate revenue and EBITDA growth,  with additional benefits to EBITDA stemming from the remaining cost synergies  from DirecTV and cost reduction initiatives. In addition, Fitch expects a slight  reduction in capital intensity over time via AT&T's network initiatives.  Broadcast TV Spectrum Auction: Potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction, which started in March 2016, or participation in the Request  for Proposals (RFP) process for the FirstNet nationwide public safety broadband  network, is not included in Fitch's assumptions and will be an event-driven  consideration. KEY ASSUMPTIONS For AT&T, Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case include: --Consolidated revenues rise in the low- to mid-teens in 2016 primarily due to  the full-year effect of DIRECTV's results in operations. Thereafter, Fitch  estimates AT&T's revenue on a stand-alone basis grows in the low-single digits  approximating Fitch's estimates for GDP growth. EBITDA margins are forecast to  be in the low 30% range during the forecast period. --Fitch has assumed there are no stock repurchases through the next several  years given the company's near-term focus on debt reduction. --In 2016, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be in line with  company guidance of $22 billion. Included in the $22 billion forecast is  approximately $1 billion of capitalized interest. Fitch's assumptions reflect  flat capital spending for AT&T after 2016 on a stand-alone basis, with  incremental capital spending for Time Warner following the merger close.  --Fitch's assumptions do not include potential spending in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction or potential spending on the FirstNet nationwide public safety  broadband network, should AT&T be successful in winning the contract.  For Time Warner, Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case include: --Fitch assumes that Turner cable networks businesses' revenues continue to grow  by mid-single digits, driven by higher affiliate fees and stable advertising  revenues. --HBO revenues grow in the mid-single digits driven in large part by an  acceleration of subscription revenue growth.  --The film and television studios grow by low- to mid-single digits during the  forecasted periods. This segment benefits from continued demand for television  content, international expansion, and digital delivery, offset by ongoing  declines in DVDs.  --Stable operating margins due to positive operating leverage of its businesses  and higher-margin profile of digital versus physical delivery are offset  somewhat by higher overall investment in programming and production. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Should the acquisition of Time Warner be terminated,  Fitch would likely affirm AT&T's ratings with a Stable Outlook under the base  case.  Negative Rating Action: The transaction, as proposed, is likely to lead to a  one-notch downgrade of AT&T. A further downgrade from 'BBB+' would result if  AT&T adopted a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven M&A activity  that drives leverage beyond Fitch's 3.5x threshold in the absence of a  creditable de-leveraging plan. Negative rating actions could also result should  Fitch begin to observe a weakening of AT&T's competitive position in its  multiple lines of business. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: At Sept. 30, 2016 AT&T did not have any drawings on  its revolving credit facility (RCF). AT&T has a five-year $12 billion RCF in  place through December 2020. The principal financial covenant for the RCF  requires net debt-to-consolidated EBITDA, as defined, to be no more than 3.5x.  At Sept.30, 2016, the company's reported cash and cash equivalents totalled $5.9  billion (at June 30, 2016, $600 million resided in foreign jurisdictions). At Sept. 30, 2016, reported total debt outstanding was approximately $125.2  billion Debt Maturities: Relative to the company's cash, RCF availability, and modest  expected FCF, Fitch believes upcoming debt maturities are manageable. There are  no material debt maturities in the remainder of 2016. In 2017, approximately  $9.5 billion of long-term debt matures, including $1.8 billion of put-able debt. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: AT&T, Inc.  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. In addition, Fitch has placed the following ratings on Negative Rating Watch: AT&T, Inc.  --Long-Term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --$12 billion revolving credit facility due December 2020 at 'A-'; --$2.286 billion Tranche A three-year term loan facility due 2018 at 'A-'; --$1.869 billion Tranche B five-year term loan facility due 2020 at 'A-'.

Acquisition,http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSFit977963?type=companyNews
706,"   By Michelle Sierra, Lynn Adler and Karen Schwartz  Oct 24 AT&T Inc's plan to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion in the biggest global acquisition of the year will bring the second-largest U.S. bridge loan financing ever to a market hungry for mergers and acquisitions loans.The new $40 billion bridge loan backing the deal is being welcomed by bankers after a deep slump in investment-grade M&A lending in the first nine months of the year, bankers said.The loan will be lucrative for banks, led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) and JP Morgan (JPM), that are arranging the jumbo bridge loan. AT&T's swoop on Time Warner was announced on Saturday.The 18-month bridge loan is expected to be split between a $30 billion commitment to issue bonds and $10 billion of term loan commitments, a banking source said.Lenders will earn $110 million to $130 million in fees for arranging this financing, according to Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services, said via email.""These bridge loans are especially important to banks now, given weakness in the overall investment banking revenue pool,"" according to Nassof.If the acquisition is approved by regulators, AT&T will gain control of media assets including cable TV channels HBO and CNN, as well as film studio Warner Bros. The deal, which combines content with delivery, is an attractive proposition for liquid lenders.""This is a pretty strategic asset, and the financing markets are as strong as they've been in a long time,"" a loan banker said. ""No matter what the outcome of the (US) election is this is a very compelling strategic transaction for both companies."" The $40 billion bridge loan is a large underwriting commitment in volatile markets and the two lead banks are expected to syndicate some of the risk shortly to other relationship banks.""Given the risk and the size and the fact that there is going to be a lot of scrutiny around regulatory issues, JP Morgan and BAML, they're going to want their risk to come down,"" a second loan banker said.Only the $30 billion bridge to bond issues is expected to be syndicated, the first banker said. ""The deal demonstrates banks' continued confidence in the bond markets, even despite the uncertainty around elections and the Fed,"" Nassof said. ""JPM and BAML should be first in line to lead the bond financing to replace the bridge, which could generate another $200 million in underwriting fees down the line.""In the US, AT&T's financing is the second largest bridge loan after a $49 billion bridge loan backing Verizon Communications' acquisition of British telecom Vodafone Group's stake in its U.S. wireless business in 2013.These deals overshadow other large U.S. bridge loans, including a $30.9 billion deal backing pharmaceutical company Actavis' acquisition of specialty pharmaceutical company Allergan in 2014, a $22.5 billion bridge loan backing insurer Anthem's purchase of rival Cigna in 2015 and a $22.5 billion loan that supported drugmakers Pfizer and Wyeth's 2009 combination.AT&T's deal is the second biggest bridge loan globally after a $56.9 billion deal backing German chemical company Bayer's $66 billion acquisition of U.S. seed firm Monsanto which has been allocated. The fact that AT&T has obtained an underwritten bridge loan is a good sign for loan volume, the two bankers said. The bond market has been receptive this year and investment-grade companies have been able to use balance sheet cash or issue bonds to pay for acquisitions and bypass the loan market altogether.Investment-grade M&A lending slid 26 percent to $100 billion in the first three quarters of the year from $135 billion in the same period last year, Thomson Reuters LPC data show, and is far off the full-year total of $181 billion in 2015.  MORE TO COMEAT&T's new bridge loan pays a margin ranging between 75 basis points and 150 basis points, based on ratings.In line with other similar financings, the margin on the loan steps up and becomes more expensive over time, which gives AT&T an incentive to replace the bridge with permanent financing.JP Morgan and BAML declined to comment. AT&T and Time Warner did not immediately return calls and emails for comment.The corporate tie-up is expected by the markets to face regulatory pushback amid a wave of consolidation in the telecom and media sectors.This deal comes on the heels of cable company Comcast Corp's $30 billion purchase of NBCUniversal. Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T's wireless rival, is in the process of buying internet company Yahoo Inc for about $4.8 billion.

710,"   By Aishwarya Venugopal  T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) raised its forecast for customer additions for the year and Chief Executive John Legere said AT&T Inc's (T.N) proposed plan to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) could help T-Mobile to carve out more market share.AT&T on Saturday proposed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a bid to acquire content to stream over its network to attract a growing number of online viewers.""I would say the great news is (AT&T is) going to be further unfocused than they are now and the upside opportunity to continue to acquire businesses in the space for us is tremendous,"" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said.T-Mobile, the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, and smaller rival Sprint Corp (S.N) have been grabbing market share by gaining subscribers from market leaders AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) through heavy discounting and promotions.Legere also said he does not expect regulators to allow AT&T to exclusively deliver Time Warner's content.""AT&T may end up being a provider to us of content as opposed to anybody thinking that there is any possibility that they will exclusively use that content,"" Legere said on a call with analysts. Shares of T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), were up 7.44 at $50.22 in midday trading after touching a nine-year high of $50.41.""We see no need for T-Mobile or Sprint to do anything as a result of (AT&T's) announcement and instead to keep doing what they are doing and that's steal share from AT&T and Verizon,"" Cowen and Company analyst Colby Synesael said in a client note.T-Mobile US said it now expected to add 3.7-3.9 million branded postpaid customers, or customers who pay monthly bills, on a net basis this year, higher than its previous forecast of 3.4-3.8 million. The company added 969,000 postpaid customers in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 890,000 in the second quarter.In contrast, AT&T lost customers in the quarter, while Verizon's subscriber addition was well below analysts' estimates.T-Mobile said it benefited from the launch of Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone 7 and an increase in branded prepaid customer migrating to postpaid plans. T-Mobile's net income surged to $366 million from $138 million, helped by after-tax spectrum gains of $122 million.On an adjusted basis, it earned 27 cents per share. Total revenue rose 17.8 percent to $9.25 billion.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 22 cents per share and revenue of $9.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Wells Fargo said the slight revenue miss was due to lower-than-expected equipment revenue partly due to T-Mobile's ""free"" iPhone 7 promotion.

711,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Many actively managed U.S. mutual funds were cool toward AT&T Inc even before the telecom giant's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.The chilly attitude from professional stock pickers partly explains the lackluster reception for AT&T's planned takeover of Time Warner. Large-cap growth funds, for example, prefer tech companies whose operations require less capital than a regulated telecom operator like AT&T. Even a major benefit to owning AT&T - its juicy 5 percent-plus dividend yield - is a cause for investor concern as higher interest rates may make the return look less attractive.“There will be more options available for other, higher-yielding assets if rates are going up,” said Carrie Tallman, director of research at Parsec Financial, a North Carolina financial adviser that owns shares of AT&T and Time Warner.Approval of AT&T's proposed takeover has provoked broad skepticism as the deal faces some of the toughest regulatory scrutiny in recent U.S. history of mergers and acquisitions.""We are committed to our dividend and to maintaining the financial flexibility for the board to consider future growth in the dividend,"" AT&T spokeswoman Emily Edmonds said in email. “On Saturday we announced we’ll increase our quarterly dividend for the 33rd straight year, even as we announced we’ve secured a $40 billion bridge facility to finance our acquisition of Time Warner.” HUNT FOR YIELD Meanwhile, seven out of AT&T's 10 largest fund investors are passive index funds, which are obligated to buy the stock because they track the S&P 500 Index, or other benchmarks that count AT&T as a component. Overall, more than 600 index funds own nearly 13 percent of AT&T's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is more than actively managed income, value and growth funds combined, which hold about 8 percent of AT&T shares.  By contrast, those types of actively managed funds hold nearly 18 percent of the shares of rival Verizon Communications Inc, according to Thomson Reuters data. Large-cap growth portfolio managers like Fidelity Contrafund's Will Danoff see AT&T as a regulated, capital intensive, slow growth company. Danoff, who oversees about $109 billion for the fund, does not own any AT&T shares, telling investors in recent commentary he has largely avoided telecom stocks.Only 21 out of 181 large-cap growth funds tracked by Lipper Inc held AT&T shares. During the first half of this year, not owning AT&T hurt these funds' relative performance to the S&P 500 because the stock surged 26 percent.  Retail investors piled into AT&T as the hunt for yield intensified against a backdrop of historically low interest rates. AT&T's current dividend yield is 5.3 percent on an annualized basis.    Matthew Benkendorf, chief investment officer of Vontobel Asset Management, a subadviser to Virtus mutual funds, said low rates have undoubtedly driven increased interest in stocks like AT&T. But in recent months, as higher U.S. interest rates appear more likely, AT&T shares have been under pressure. The stock is off 14 percent in the past three months, reflecting interest rate concerns and Saturday's announcement of the Time Warner deal.Questions for investors now include whether Time Warner's TV and film assets can deliver meaningful growth for AT&T, and whether the new conglomerate will continue to satisfy an important base of investors with a healthy dividend payout.Vontobel's Benkendorf said an added wrinkle to those questions is the sustainability of the dividend AT&T is paying.

718,"   By Jessica Toonkel and David Shepardson | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Media companies plan to ask U.S. regulators to force AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc  to share their trove of customer data if the telecom and content companies merge, fearing the combined behemoth would have an unfair advantage selling targeted mobile advertising, a handful of media executives told Reuters this week.Customer data has become a key to the media industry's future as TV networks strive to provide the same kind of advertising as digital companies like Alphabet's  Google and Facebook Inc, which tailor pitches according to what they know about their customers.AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner  would give the media company's networks, such as HBO, Cinemax and Turner, potentially unprecedented data about viewers who have AT&T cell phones and DirecTV accounts.The deal will be reviewed by the U.S. Justice Department, and it is unclear how the enforcement agency would approach customer data access as an antitrust issue since it has not yet arisen as a source of contention in a major U.S. deal.With the rise of online and mobile video streaming services, the promise of sending different ads to different viewers appears attainable, starting a race among established media brands.""With this deal, Time Warner will have access to more data on the content consumption habits than any other media company in the world,"" said Patrick Keane, president of Sharethrough, a platform for buying ""native"" ads.If Time Warner can use AT&T data to target ads to a group such as young, affluent men who watch a specific sports team, it will have a huge new advantage with advertisers, said an executive at a rival media company.""The money will gravitate to the programming with that data,"" the person said, adding that the company would go to regulators. ""We are interested in making sure that we have access to our customer data in the same way that Time Warner will have access to data.""If HBO, which has its own over-the-top streaming video service, gets access to AT&T's data about viewers watching content on competitors like Hulu, Amazon or Netflix, that is also an unfair advantage, said another executive at a separate media company that also plans to ask regulators to act.All the media executives wished to remain anonymous because conversations are early and confidential. READY TO SHARE? AT&T and Time Warner acknowledge that data is a key driver of the deal.""What it allows us to do is just move faster, with more innovation, better consumer offerings, more different price points, more effective advertising, and therefore people are going to see that more of the cost of content can be borne by advertising,"" Time Warner Chief Jeff Bewkes told CNN on Monday.And AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told Reuters at a conference in California that the company is open to allowing other content providers access to customer data. ""To the extent that it keeps their content costs down, we'd be open to it,"" he told Reuters.Rivals are already amassing a significant amount of data from multiple sources. Verizon Communications Inc will be able to tap data from Yahoo Inc's  1 billion monthly users to tailor advertising if it completes its $4.8 billion purchase of Yahoo's core assets.Customer data is a new area for antitrust law, which enforcers will be pressed by media companies to take on in the AT&T case.""This is a structural advantage that AT&T would have over its rivals, and competition authorities should be concerned about the possible effects,"" said John Bergmayer, senior counsel at advocacy group Public Knowledge.First the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which share the work of ensuring that mergers are legal, must decide if there is a problem and then whether there is a solution. ""Enforcers don't quite know yet what that (big data) means for antitrust or what to make of it,"" said Elai Katz, an antitrust lawyer with the law firm Cahill, Gordon & Reindell LLP.Katz said that antitrust enforcers would look at how much data was involved, whether it was available from other companies and whether access was a competitive issue before deciding whether it is worth addressing in the merger.Antitrust enforcers usually prefer that companies who want to merge solve any antitrust problems by selling an asset, like a brewery or a factory, rather than have a behavioral condition on a deal, like requiring licensing data, which is harder to enforce.But such behavioral remedies would ""have to be considered in a case like this,"" Katz said.The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the telecoms industry, still puts behavioral conditions on merger approvals, but it was not clear whether the FCC will consider this deal.If AT&T has to share data with media rivals, that could undercut the value of the deal, advertisers said. But if AT&T can build a platform with addressable advertising and targeted content, it might compete with new media such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat, said Bernard Gershon, president of media and technology consulting firm Gershon Media.""The Holy Grail is advanced advertising and delivering custom content and ads,"" said Gershon. ""It is the data and the direct relationship with the consumer that makes this deal so powerful.""(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and Julia Love in Laguna Beach, California)",2016-10-26,T,"Wed Oct 26, 2016 | 5:44pm EDT",Media companies want U.S. to force AT&T-Time Warner to share customer data,http://www.reuters.com//article/timewarner-ma-att-data-idUSL1N1CW29B?type=companyNews
719,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast is schooling AT&T on media M&A. The $155 billion cable giant now gets more than a third of its revenue from NBC Universal, a deal it concluded in early 2013. The regulatory and political climate was more accommodating and Chief Executive Brian Roberts' strategy sound. AT&T's $85 billion bid for Time Warner, by contrast, is a dog's breakfast.The top line at NBC Universal, home to the Peacock Network, MSNBC and a giant movie studio, jumped 28 percent to $9.2 billion. Granted, the unit got a huge lift from broadcasting the Olympics in the United States. But even after stripping out the sporting event, revenue increased nearly 6 percent thanks to strong growth at its theme parks.Comcast's two-part deal for NBC Universal, which it bought from industrial conglomerate GE, was prudent by today's standards. Regulators insisted on a variety of conditions before approving the deal, including that Comcast take a passive role in its ownership of video-streaming service Hulu. GE's then-huge finance division was also under duress thanks to the financial crisis and the parent was eager to rid itself of media assets that made little sense in its portfolio of jet engines and capacitors. By contrast, AT&T is paying a whopping $20 billion above Time Warner's undisturbed market value. The cost savings cited by AT&T, some $1 billion, barely cover a third of the premium. The telecommunications giant also has little experience in producing TV shows and movies. Roberts himself has learned some hard deal lessons. Comcast's earlier attempt to take over Walt Disney  was a failure. So too was his proposal to buy Time Warner Cable after trustbusters denied the union. AT&T argues it will have no problem sailing through the review process. Based on Time Warner's shares, which are now trading $20 below the offer price of $107.50, AT&T may want to dial down the cockiness.

720,"  (Adds further details on conference call and context)MEXICO CITY Oct 28 Mexican telecoms company America Movil said on Friday that offering content is important, and will become ""very important"" in the future, as rival AT&T Inc  bids for U.S. media powerhouse Time Warner Inc.Asked about AT&T's offer to buy Time Warner, Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a conference call: ""Let's see what's going to happen. ... Content is important right now; it's going to become very important in the future.""Shares in America Movil rose more than 7 percent after the company said that it had swung to a profit in the third quarter, helped by stronger data use and a lower foreign exchange loss. The company, controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim, is dealing with the effects of a sector reform at home designed to curb its dominance, which prompted a price war after AT&T entered the market.America Movil's market share, which is almost 70 percent, has not changed significantly since the reform was enacted. Mexican telecommunications regulator IFT is reviewing the measures it put in place against the company in the new, more competitive environment. Hajj added that there could be a decision by IFT on its review in the first quarter of next year.In Brazil, America Movil's second largest market, speculation has been rife about possible acquisitions of some or all of the operations of struggling rival Oi SA.Hajj said he did not expect to see any consolidation there anytime soon, but said the company was always open to hearing about opportunities.

722,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against AT&T's DirecTV, alleging it acted as a ringleader to illegally swap information with rival pay-TV providers about negotiations over showing Dodgers baseball games in the Los Angeles area.The department said DirecTV, before its 2015 acquisition by AT&T, exchanged confidential information with Cox Communications, Charter Communications and AT&T, to get leverage against Time Warner Cable, which distributes a channel showing Dodgers games in Los Angeles.These companies have refused to carry the SportsNet LA channel, a partnership between the Dodgers baseball team and Time Warner Cable, contending that carriage fees sought by Time Warner Cable were too high.As a result, much of Los Angeles was unable to watch the Dodgers play for the past three seasons, the Justice Department said.The lawsuit comes at a time when AT&T is preparing for an antitrust review of its planned purchase of Time Warner Inc , a separate entity from Time Warner Cable. The Justice Department is expected to scrutinize the deal.While the spat with the Justice Department over the Dodgers channel is legally distinct from the antitrust review of AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner, analysts said the lawsuit was bad timing given the vehement opposition the deal faces from some lawmakers and public policy groups.""It is hard to see how this can help the deal,"" said Spencer Kurn, an analyst with New Street Research.The department said in its complaint that a DirecTV executive assured executives at the other three companies that DirecTV had no plans to strike a deal to show the Dodgers. Cox, Charter and AT&T responded with similar assurances. The result was that the companies knew that they would not lose subscribers to competitors if all of them refused to air the Dodgers channel, the complaint said.The department said DirecTV, as the largest pay-TV provider in the United States with over 25 million video subscribers and a nationwide footprint, had the most subscribers that could watch the Dodgers Channel and without it, competition would not have been harmed.Among other evidence, the complaint cited then DirecTV CEO Mike White's public comments in a May 2014 industry conference, where he said it was important that ""the distributors start to stand together, like most of us have been doing in Los Angeles for the first time ever, by the way, with the Dodgers on outrageous increases and excesses.""The complaint names DirecTV and its owner AT&T as defendants, but not Cox or Charter. AT&T is named because it is DirecTV's parent company. ""Dodgers fans were denied a fair competitive process when DirecTV orchestrated a series of information exchanges with direct competitors that ultimately made consumers less likely to be able to watch their hometown team,"" said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Sallet of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.AT&T said the information trades occurred before its DirecTV acquisition last year, and said it disagreed with the department's action.""The reason why no other major TV provider chose to carry this content was that no one wanted to force all of their customers to pay the inflated prices that Time Warner Cable was demanding for a channel devoted solely to LA Dodgers baseball,"" said David McAtee, AT&T general counsel, in a statement.""We make our carriage decisions independently, legally and only after thorough negotiations with the content owner.

730,"   By Diane Bartz and Olivia Oran | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. corporate dealmakers were likely to put major merger plans on hold as they assess whether President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his populist promises and a threat to block AT&T Inc's  purchase of Time Warner Inc, or act more like traditional business-friendly Republicans.Trump's rhetoric and the personal nature of the campaign, which included little discussion of policy, left many uncertain about the new U.S. leader's plans, including how his administration will handle mega-mergers.Wall Street braced for a drop in deals, with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday projecting a 20 to 30 percent downside for earnings of banks that focus on merger and acquisition advice, and Jefferies saying uncertainty about Trump's policy on trade, healthcare, taxes and energy could hamper underwriting activity and M&A globally.""I think a lot of deals will hit the pause button for a bit until we get some clarity on whether President Trump will moderate or be as disruptive as some expect,"" said a senior Wall Street banker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media.""It's going to be a tough environment for everything until we see how (Trump) behaves as a leader,"" the banker added.Trump said in October that AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio would put too much power in the hands of one company, and that he would block a deal.The gap between Time Warner shares and the implied value of AT&T's cash and stock bid was over 23 percent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, compared with around 22 percent at Tuesday's close, indicating greater investor skepticism that the companies will be able to complete the transaction.In addition to criticizing AT&T's deal with Time Warner, owner of CNN, Trump has said he would look to break up Comcast's deal to buy NBC Universal, which closed in 2013. He has also threatened antitrust action against Amazon, which owns the Washington Post.All three news organizations have had spats with the president-elect, raising concern in Washington that Trump may use antitrust law to avenge personal slights, said an antitrust expert who asked not to be named to protect business relationships.""That's a fear. That's a legitimate fear,"" added Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel, PLLC, who said presidents tended not to weigh in on specific decisions by antitrust enforcers. ""The last president to try to do that was Richard Nixon,"" said Bloom, referring to a Nixon attorney general, Richard Kleindienst, who was convicted of falsely testifying to Congress that the White House had not meddled with an antitrust probe of International Telephone and Telegraph Corp, according to Kleindienst's obituary in the New York Times.POPULIST OR PRO-BUSINESS REPUBLICAN? Still, some investors believed the man who considers himself business friendly would take a more moderate tone once he assumes office in January.""We think Trump will be pretty good for merger and acquisition activity. As a general proposition, he is pro-business and pro-free market,"" said Roy Behren, portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Management. Other big pending U.S. deals also did not see sharp changes in prices on Wednesday, and the spreads of three healthcare deals that have encountered antitrust troubles, Aetna  -Humana, Anthem -Cigna and Walgreens -Rite Aid, actually narrowed, signaling investors may think they are more likely to close under a Trump administration.The president does not directly decide if a merger is illegal under antitrust law. That is done by the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, which divide up the work of assessing mergers. If one of the agencies decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree.AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on Wednesday his company was looking forward to working with Trump and was ""optimistic"" regulators would approve the deal.Time Warner's shares were last down 1 percent to $86.71, after trading as low as $85.60, while AT&T shares were up just under 1 percent at $37.24. The Dow and S&P 500 were both over 1 percent higher in late afternoon trading. MEDIA CONSOLIDATION IN FOCUS The fate of the AT&T deal as well as several other large mergers, including the proposed combinations of Dow Chemical  and DuPont, and Bayer and Monsanto , will ultimately be decided by Trump's nominees to lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department and the FTC.""The deal is now more likely than not to be blocked. After all, it is rare for a presidential candidate to comment on such things during a campaign, but when that happens, the team he assembles generally take such statements as commands,"" New Street analyst Jonathan Chaplin said of the AT&T-Time Warner deal.Chaplin said Trump's concerns appeared to be focused on media consolidation rather than on other sectors, and a failure of the AT&T deal would likely discourage other distribution companies from pursuing takeovers of a media company.""We also believe that Trump may look at antitrust options for addressing consolidation in the tech community. Tech was overwhelming in its support of Clinton, something we suspect Trump knows and will remember,"" Chaplin wrote in a note, referring to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Telecom companies, such as AT&T and Verizon, are seeing their core businesses shrink. That has increased the appetite of telecom companies to buy media firms as they try to get hold of valuable content and diversify their revenue streams.AT&T's plan to buy Time Warner was expected to spark a new round of industry consolidation and give rise to deals that combine digital distribution and content.Trump's protectionist stance also raises the risk that some foreign corporations, including from China, may face higher hurdles in trying to take over American companies, dealmakers said.""If you were thinking about doing a cross-border deal six months ago you weren't considering things like potential trade barriers, protectionism and tariffs. These are things you have to at least develop a view on and factor into the risk assessment of doing an overseas deal now,"" said Johs Worsoe, MUFG's head of investment banking & markets in the Americas.",2016-11-09,T,"Wed Nov 9, 2016 | 6:09pm EST","Trump victory clouds outlook for Time Warner-AT&T, other mergers",http://www.reuters.com//article/time-warner-ma-att-trump-idUSL1N1DA234?type=companyNews

The offerings may violate the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules, the government said.The online video service will cost $35 per month, including mobile streaming costs, and target viewers who shun pay-television subscriptions, AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said last month.The wireless company's streaming video service, which launches late next month, will have more than 100 channels. Last month, AT&T announced plans to acquire Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion and some public interest groups are concerned that the combined company could put rival content providers at a disadvantage.The Time Warner deal gives AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. Time Warner content will be incorporated into the upcoming video service, Stephenson said. Bob Quinn, AT&T's senior executive vice president, said in a statement the service of allowing mobile users to watch video without incurring data charges are ""incredibly popular services that we hope regulators won't take away from the millions of people who enjoy them today.""He said the program makes it easier for consumers to drop cable - and said it will treat rivals equally.

741,"   By Tim Baysinger  Otter Media, the joint venture between AT&T Inc and The Chernin Group, has partnered with Reese Witherspoon to form a new multimedia company, Hello Sunshine, aimed at telling female-driven stories. Witherspoon’s involvement in Hello Sunshine will come via her production company Pacific Standard, which counts films “Wild,” “Gone Girl,” and the upcoming HBO series “Big Little Lies” among its credits. As a subsidiary of Hello Sunshine, Pacific Standard will continue to make TV shows and films, but now will also branch out to include shorter-run digital content tailored for social media.AT&T partnered with longtime media executive Peter Chernin to form Otter Media in 2014 as a way to capitalize on the booming streaming video industry, committing more than $500 million to buy and or launch new companies.The new company could give AT&T an early stake hold in a marketplace currently light on content made both for and by women. A study by USC-Annenberg found that female characters made up only 28.7 percent of all speaking roles in film, while women accounted for just 15 percent of directors.  Witherspoon launched Pacific Standard with her producing partner Bruna Papandrea in 2012 as a means to get more women both behind and in front of the camera in more prominent roles. Papandrea recently left to start her own venture.Otter Media’s portfolio includes digital media company Fullscreen Media (which owns digital studio Rooster Teeth), social marketing agency McBeard, and Gunpowder & Sky, the digital studio launched by former Viacom executive Van Toffler. Otter Media also has invested in the Japanese anime and gaming space with two streaming video services in Crunchyroll and VRV.    Earlier this year, Chernin Group also acquired sports media company Barstool Sports. AT&T has been in the process of acquiring Time Warner Inc, a deal expected to close next year should it pass regularly hurdles. Last week, Time Warner's studio Warner Bros. agreed to acquire all of digital media company Machinima, a competitor to Fullscreen. Kerry Tucker will serve as chief executive of Hello Sunshine. Tucker most recently engineered the sale of The Video Genome Project, a content-recommendation start-up, to Hulu. Seth Rodsky, founding partner of Strand Equity Partners, is partnered with Witherspoon on the deal and will join the Hello Sunshine board.

749,"   By Tim Baysinger  Otter Media, the joint venture between AT&T Inc and The Chernin Group, has partnered with Reese Witherspoon to form a new multimedia company, Hello Sunshine, aimed at telling female-driven stories. Witherspoon’s involvement in Hello Sunshine will come via her production company Pacific Standard, which counts films “Wild,” “Gone Girl,” and the upcoming HBO series “Big Little Lies” among its credits. As a subsidiary of Hello Sunshine, Pacific Standard will continue to make TV shows and films, but now will also branch out to include shorter-run digital content tailored for social media.AT&T partnered with longtime media executive Peter Chernin to form Otter Media in 2014 as a way to capitalize on the booming streaming video industry, committing more than $500 million to buy and or launch new companies.The new company could give AT&T an early stake hold in a marketplace currently light on content made both for and by women. A study by USC-Annenberg found that female characters made up only 28.7 percent of all speaking roles in film, while women accounted for just 15 percent of directors.  Witherspoon launched Pacific Standard with her producing partner Bruna Papandrea in 2012 as a means to get more women both behind and in front of the camera in more prominent roles. Papandrea recently left to start her own venture.Otter Media’s portfolio includes digital media company Fullscreen Media (which owns digital studio Rooster Teeth), social marketing agency McBeard, and Gunpowder & Sky, the digital studio launched by former Viacom executive Van Toffler. Otter Media also has invested in the Japanese anime and gaming space with two streaming video services in Crunchyroll and VRV.    Earlier this year, Chernin Group also acquired sports media company Barstool Sports. AT&T has been in the process of acquiring Time Warner Inc, a deal expected to close next year should it pass regularly hurdles. Last week, Time Warner's studio Warner Bros. agreed to acquire all of digital media company Machinima, a competitor to Fullscreen. Kerry Tucker will serve as chief executive of Hello Sunshine. Tucker most recently engineered the sale of The Video Genome Project, a content-recommendation start-up, to Hulu. Seth Rodsky, founding partner of Strand Equity Partners, is partnered with Witherspoon on the deal and will join the Hello Sunshine board.

AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes will also testify at the meeting of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights.Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks and Landmark Theatres movie chain, has been a vocal supporter of the deal, saying on Twitter and in published interviews that the combined company could be a counterweight to big digital companies like Facebook Inc (FB.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Snapchat Inc. Gene Kimmelman, president and CEO of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a former chief counsel for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, is also expected to testify, the spokesman said.

756,"  NEW YORK AT&T Inc's new streaming television service, DirectTV Now, has so far exceeded expectations, AT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson told investors on Tuesday.Stephenson, speaking at the UBS global, media and communications conference, said the service achieved its subscriber forecast for December on launch day, Nov. 30 and is ""doing very, very well.""He did not provide subscriber numbers.DirecTV Now, which streams live television content to internet-connected devices, was launched to help drive sales in a saturated cell phone market.AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion last year, making it the largest U.S. pay-TV operator with 25.3 million video subscribers, in a push to diversify into the media and entertainment business.AT&T also plans to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) for $85.4 billion to gain control of premium content from networks such as HBO. The wireless company is working on gaining regulatory approval for its Time Warner deal. AT&T expects the regulatory review process to be ""fairly straightforward,"" Stephenson said.""This is a classic vertical merger and the day after we close this deal there will be no fewer competitors in any market in the United States than there are today in distribution or media and entertainment,"" Stephenson said. ""This is a pretty clean deal."" Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, who spoke at a separate session of the UBS conference on Tuesday, said the AT&T-Time Warner deal should close by the end of 2017, if not sooner.Before winning the U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump had said on the campaign trail that the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T would put too much power in the hands of one company.""I don't know what part of it he was referring to,"" Stephenson said while speaking at the Business Insider IGNITION conference. He said he had heard a ""rumor"" that Trump's comments were perhaps connected to the president-elect's criticism of Time Warner's CNN channel.From the perspective of the telecom industry, the shift to a Trump administration is a positive development, as the president-elect's policies seem to promote corporate investment and capital allocation, he said.
