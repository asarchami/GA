1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the credit ratings for  SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) and its subsidiaries SL Green Operating  Partnership, L.P., and Reckson Operating Partnership L.P. as follows: SL Green Realty Corp. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB-' from 'BB+' (as co-obligor); --Perpetual preferred stock to 'BB' from 'BB-'. SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. --IDR to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; --Exchangeable senior notes to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; --Junior subordinated notes to 'BB+' from 'BB'. Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P. --IDR to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB-' from 'BB+' (as co-obligor for certain  issuances); --Exchangeable senior debentures to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Positive. KEY RATINGS DRIVERS The upgrades reflect the company's credit strengths, including its high-quality  New York office portfolio, manageable lease maturity and debt expiration  schedules, growing unencumbered asset pool and the company's improving credit  metrics. These positive rating elements are also supported by expectations for  further strengthening in SLG's fixed-charge coverage ratio. These positive  elements are balanced by concerns regarding the Midtown Manhattan office leasing  environment, which remains somewhat dependent on the growth of large financial  institutions and supporting industries such as law and accounting firms. APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE SLG's leverage ratio is consistent with a 'BBB-' rating for a REIT owning  primarily Midtown Manhattan office assets, as the company's leverage ratio  (excluding the effects of consolidating 388-390 Greenwich Street) was 7.1x as of  June 30, 2014, down from 7.4x and 7.6x as of Dec. 31, 2013 and 2012. Leverage  was 8.5x as of June 30, 2014 when including the debt and net operating income  (NOI) from 388-390 Greenwich Street. Leverage has been aided by the incremental  NOI from repositioning and leasing of assets within the company's growth  portfolio, which consists of value-add properties purchased over the past few  years. Fitch expects that leverage will decline modestly from current levels due  to incremental NOI from the company's redevelopment/growth portfolio. Fitch  defines leverage as net debt divided by recurring operating EBITDA, including  Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from joint ventures.  APPROPRIATE FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE The company's fixed-charge coverage ratio was 2.1x for the 12 months ended June  30, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, up from 1.6x in 2012. The improvement in coverage  has been driven by the reduction in free rent periods offered to tenants,  combined with slightly lower leverage and improved funding costs. Fitch expects  coverage to improve slightly as growth in cash flow is partially offset by a  slowly recovering Manhattan leasing environment in which landlords will continue  to offer attractive tenant improvement packages. Fixed-charge coverage is  defined as recurring operating EBITDA - including Fitch's estimate of recurring  cash distributions from joint ventures - less recurring capital expenditures and  straight-line rents, divided by interest incurred and preferred stock  distributions. STRONG, ALBEIT RELATIVELY CONCENTRATED TENANT BASE The company's portfolio has a modest degree of tenant concentration, with the  top 10 representing 35% of annual base rent. This compares to 32% for the top 20  tenants for Boston Properties, and 23% for Vornado. Despite the concentration,  the largest tenant, Citigroup, Inc. (rated 'A' IDR with a Stable Outlook by  Fitch) contributes 11.2% of SLG's share of annual cash rent. The top three  tenants, and all five of SLG's Fitch-rated top 10 tenants have investment grade  ratings. MANAGEABLE LEASE EXPIRATION PROFILE The company has a manageable lease expiration schedule with only 25% of  consolidated Manhattan rents expiring over the next five years. While  approximately 52% of the company's consolidated suburban property rents expire  over the next five years, the suburban portfolio represents a limited portion of  the company's total assets and only 9% of annualized cash rent. LADDERED DEBT MATURITIES Further supporting the ratings is the company's manageable debt maturity  schedule. Over the next five years, 2017 is the largest year of debt maturities  with 19.9% of pro rata debt expiring, with no other year greater than 14%. The  2017 maturities are primarily made up of $1.1 billion of non-recourse mortgage  debt and $355 million of unsecured debt. In addition, the company's ratios under  its unsecured credit obligation financial covenants do not hinder the company's  financial flexibility at this point in time. SOLID UNENCUMBERED ASSET COVERAGE OF DEBT The ratings are further supported by SLG's unencumbered asset value coverage of  unsecured debt, which gives the company financial flexibility as a source of  contingent liquidity. Consolidated unencumbered asset coverage of net unsecured  debt (calculated as annualized second quarter 2014 unencumbered property net  operating income divided by a stressed 7% capitalization rate) results in  coverage of 2x. This ratio is adequate for the current rating, particularly  given that Midtown Manhattan assets are highly sought after by secured lenders  and foreign investors, resulting in stronger contingent liquidity relative to  most asset classes in other markets. Fitch expects this ratio will improve  modestly as the company unencumbers additional assets with relatively high debt  yields. STRONG MANAGEMENT TEAM The ratings also point to the strength of SLG's management team given their  knowledge of the Manhattan office sector, and their ability to maintain  occupancy and liquidity throughout the downturn. This expertise has also been  demonstrated by the company's ability to identify off-market acquisition  opportunities, and its maintenance and growth of portfolio occupancy and balance  sheet liquidity throughout the downturn and into the current cycle. MIDTOWN LEASING CONCERNS Offsetting these strengths are Fitch's concerns regarding the uncertain Midtown  Manhattan leasing environment. While the New York City leasing environment has  strengthened over the last few years, the company continues to incur significant  costs in the form of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and free-rent  incentives as tenant inducements, which has placed pressure on fixed charge  coverage. A downturn in space demands from the financial services industry,  which accounts for 36% of SLG's share of base rental revenue, may result in  reduced cash flows or values of SLG's properties. Further, emerging competitive  pressure from the Hudson Yards development and newer and redeveloped downtown  assets (i.e. Brookfield Place and World Financial Center assets) could result in  larger tenants vacating Midtown. Despite these headwinds, SLG had maintained  strong leasing volume. LIQUIDITY COVERAGE SHORTFALL The company has weak liquidity under Fitch's base case analysis. For the period  July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2016, the company's sources of liquidity (cash,  availability under its unsecured revolving credit facility, and Fitch's  expectation of retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends and  distributions) covered uses of liquidity (pro rata debt maturities, Fitch's  expectation of recurring capital expenditures, and non-discretionary development  expenditures) by 0.8x. This stressed analysis assumes that no additional capital  is raised to repay obligations; SLG has demonstrated good access to a variety of  capital sources over time, mitigating refinance risk. Under a scenario where the  company refinances 80% of the secured debt it does not intend to repay at  maturity, liquidity coverage improves to 1.1x, which would be adequate for the  rating.  The company's liquidity is also strengthened by its conservative common dividend  policy, which enables it to retain substantial operating cash flow. Fitch  expects SLG's projected AFFO payout ratio to center around 45%, which is low  relative to the broader equity REIT universe and provides the company with  additional financial flexibility, particularly as it will need to fund over $300  million of capital costs related to recently-signed renewal leases for Viacom  and Citibank prior to year-end 2016. RECKSON'S IDR LINKED TO SLG'S Consistent with Fitch's criteria, 'Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage' dated  May 28, 2014, and available on 'www.fitchratings.com', Reckson's IDR is linked  and synchronized with SLG's due to strong legal, operational and strategic ties  between the two, including each entity guaranteeing certain corporate debt of  the other. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES NOTCHING The one-notch differential between SLG's IDR and junior subordinated notes  (trust preferred securities) is consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate  entities with an IDR of 'BBB-'. Based on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and  Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis',  available on Fitch's Web site at www.fitchratings.com, these securities are  senior to SLG's perpetual preferred stock but subordinate to SLG's corporate  debt. Holders of such notes have the ability to demand full repayment of  principal and interest in the event of unpaid interest. PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between SLG's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB-'.  Based on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', also available at www.fitchratings.com,  these preferred securities are deeply subordinated and have loss absorption  elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate  default. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook is driven by Fitch's expectation that SLG will maintain a  strategy and leverage and coverage metrics consistent with a 'BBB-' IDR. While  these quantitative metrics are nominally weaker than most REIT issuers with  investment-grade ratings, it considers that Midtown Manhattan office assets  consistently trade at lower capitalization rates and are more liquid and  financeable in economic downturns than typical office assets. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following may have a positive impact on SLG's Outlook or Ratings: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 7x for several quarters.  (leverage was 8.5x as of June 30, 2014 and 7.1x excluding the effects of 388-390  Greenwich Street); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 2.25x for  several quarters (coverage was 2.1x for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014); --Growth in the size of the unencumbered pool.  The following may have a negative impact on SLG's ratings and/or Outlook:  --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 8.0x for several quarters; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 1.5x for several  quarters; --A sustained liquidity shortfall (base-case liquidity coverage was 0.7x for  July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2016).

Jonathan Rosen, an outside spokesman for SL Green, in a statement said One Vanderbilt has received ""broad"" support because of the project's ""commitment"" to adding office space and improving the commute.""We are already hard at work delivering on those commitments and won't be sidetracked by frivolous litigation,"" he said. Rezoning the Grand Central area for taller skyscrapers was proposed under the administration of de Blasio's predecessor Michael Bloomberg, an independent. De Blasio is a Democrat.Grand Central was the subject of a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the city's landmark preservation law, which  permitted the terminal's owner at the time to generate a ""reasonable return"" on its investment.Penson's companies said that decision still allowed air rights to be sold to owners of nearby properties.The case is Midtown TDR Ventures LLC et al v.

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) for SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) and its subsidiaries SL Green  Operating Partnership, L.P., and Reckson Operating Partnership L.P. at 'BBB-'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end  of the release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of the ratings and Outlook reflects SLG's credit strengths,  including its high-quality New York office portfolio, manageable lease maturity  and debt expiration schedules and growing unencumbered asset pool. These  positive elements are balanced by relatively weak unencumbered asset coverage of  unsecured debt, concerns regarding the midtown Manhattan office leasing  environment, which remains somewhat dependent on the growth of large financial  institutions and supporting industries such as law and accounting firms, as well  as the continuing lag in the suburban office portfolio. APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE SLG's leverage ratio is consistent with a 'BBB-' rating for a REIT owning  primarily Midtown Manhattan office assets, as the company's leverage ratio  (excluding the effects of consolidating 388-390 Greenwich Street) was 7.4x as of  June 30, 2015, down from 7.6x as of Dec. 31, 2014 and level with 7.4x as of Dec.  31, 2013. Leverage has been aided by the incremental NOI from repositioning and  leasing of assets within the company's growth portfolio, which consists of  value-add properties purchased over the past few years. Fitch expects that  leverage will temporarily increase from historical levels due to the recent  acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue, the purchase of which will be largely funded  with proceeds from asset sales. Fitch expects leverage will decline modestly  post-dispositions to the mid-7.0x's (inclusive of 388-390 Greenwich Street) due  to incremental NOI from the Company's redevelopment/growth portfolio. Fitch  defines leverage as net debt divided by recurring operating EBITDA, including  Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from joint ventures. EXCLUSION OF 388-390 GREENWICH FROM LEVERAGE RATIOS The rationale for excluding the consolidating effects of this asset is due to  Citibank having the option to acquire this property from SLG as early as  December 2017. It is Fitch's expectation that it will exercise this option, and  thus the leverage impact for this property is relatively short-term.  APPROPRIATE FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE SLG's fixed-charge coverage ratio was 2.1x for the 12 months ended June 30,  2015, up from 1.9x in 2014 and level with 2.1x in 2013. The improvement in  coverage has been driven by the reduction in free rent periods offered to  tenants, combined with slightly lower leverage and improved funding costs,  particularly with the company's unsecured credit facility. Fitch expects  coverage to remain relatively flat as growth in cash flow is partially offset by  an environment in which landlords will continue to offer attractive tenant  improvement packages. Fixed-charge coverage is defined as recurring operating  EBITDA - including Fitch's estimate of recurring cash distributions from joint  ventures - less recurring capital expenditures and straight-line rents, divided  by interest incurred and preferred stock distributions. LOW UNENCUMBERED ASSET COVERAGE OF DEBT The ratings are hindered by SLG's unencumbered asset value coverage of unsecured  debt (UA/UD). Consolidated unencumbered asset coverage of net unsecured debt  (calculated as annualized 2Q 2015 unencumbered property net operating income  divided by a stressed 7% capitalization rate) results in coverage of 1.6x, down  from 2.1x as of year-end 2012. This ratio is weaker when compared to  similarly-rated companies, particularly given that the stressed capitalization  rate applied to SLG's NOI is the lowest across Fitch's rated universe. However,  when considering that Midtown Manhattan assets are highly sought after by  secured lenders and foreign investors, the results are a stronger contingent  liquidity relative to most asset classes in other markets. Fitch expects this  ratio will improve modestly as the company unencumbers additional assets with  relatively high debt yields; however, should this ratio sustain below 2.0x, this  could have a negative impact on SLG's rating or outlook. STRONG MANAGEMENT TEAM The ratings also consider the strength of SLG's management team given their  knowledge of the Manhattan office sector and their ability to maintain occupancy  and liquidity throughout the downturn. This expertise has also been demonstrated  by the company's ability to identify off-market acquisition opportunities, and  its maintenance and growth of portfolio occupancy and balance sheet liquidity  throughout the downturn and into the current cycle. The management team has also  led the company towards an even greater property focus within Manhattan, not  only within the office segment, but expanding to the potentially highly  profitable retail segment as well. MIDTOWN LEASING CONCERNS Offsetting these strengths are Fitch's concerns regarding the uncertain Midtown  Manhattan leasing environment. While the New York City leasing environment has  strengthened over the last few years and net effective rents are higher, the  company continues to incur significant costs in the form of tenant improvements,  leasing commissions and free rent incentives as tenant inducements, which has  placed pressure on the company's fixed charge coverage. A downturn in space  demands from the financial services industry, which accounts for 33% of SLG's  share of base rental revenue, may result in reduced cash flows or values of  SLG's properties. Further, emerging competitive pressure from the Hudson Yards  development and newer and redeveloped downtown assets (i.e., Brookfield Place  and World Financial Center assets) could result in larger tenants vacating  Midtown. Despite these headwinds, SLG has maintained strong leasing volume and  has improved occupancy. LOW LIQUIDITY COVERAGE SLG has weak liquidity. For the period from July 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016, the  company's sources of liquidity (cash, availability under the company's unsecured  revolving credit facility, and Fitch's expectation of retained cash flows from  operating activities after dividends and distributions) covered uses of  liquidity (pro rata debt maturities, Fitch's expectation of recurring capital  expenditures and non-discretionary development expenditures) by 0.9x. This  stressed analysis assumes that no additional capital is raised to repay  obligations; SLG has demonstrated good access to a variety of capital sources  over time, mitigating refinance risk. Under a scenario where the company  refinances 80% of maturing secured debt, liquidity coverage improves to 1.3x,  which would be adequate for the rating. SLG's liquidity is strengthened by its conservative common dividend policy,  which enables it to retain substantial operating cash flow. Fitch expects the  company's projected AFFO payout ratio to center around 45%, which is low  relative to the broader equity REIT universe. The lower payout ratio should  provide the company with additional financial flexibility, which is of high  importance given it will need to fund significant capital costs related to  recently-signed renewal leases for Viacom and Citibank, and projected growth  redevelopment portfolio costs prior to year-end 2016. ONE VANDERBILT DEVELOPMENT SPEND LOOMING SLG has obtained the approvals necessary to commence its ground-up development  project at One Vanderbilt Avenue, and it has commenced demolition for the  project. The total cost and the company's equity funding commitment for the  project remain uncertain, and the company has stated it may consider joint  venture alternatives to reduce its exposure. The degree and timing of the  company's ultimate funding requirements could have a meaningful negative impact  on the company's liquidity and headline credit metrics. STRONG, ALBEIT RELATIVELY CONCENTRATED TENANT BASE SLG's portfolio has a modest degree of tenant concentration, with the top 10  tenants representing 33.4% of annual base rent. This compares to the  contribution from the top 20 tenants of Boston Properties and Vornado Realty of  30% and 27.8%, respectively. Despite the concentration, the largest tenant  Citigroup, Inc. ('A' IDR with a Stable Outlook by Fitch) comprises 10.5% of  SLG's share of annual cash rent, and all three of SLG's Fitch-rated top 10  tenants have strong investment grade ratings. MANAGEABLE LEASE EXPIRATION PROFILE SLG has a manageable lease expiration schedule with only an average of 5.2% of  consolidated Manhattan rents expiring annually through 2019. While an average of  10.2% of the company's consolidated suburban property rents expire during that  same period, the suburban portfolio represents a limited portion of the  company's total assets and only 9.2% of annualized cash rent. LADDERED DEBT MATURITIES Further supporting the ratings is SLG's manageable debt maturity schedule. Over  the next five years, 2017 is the largest year of debt maturities with 17.5% of  pro rata debt expiring, with no other year greater than 10.4%. The 2017  maturities are primarily comprised of $1.4 billion of non-recourse mortgage debt  and $355 million of unsecured debt. Additionally, SLG's ratios under its  unsecured credit obligations' financial covenants do not hinder the company's  financial flexibility at this point in time. RECKSON'S IDR LINKED TO SLG'S Consistent with Fitch's criteria, 'Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage' dated  May 23, 2015 and available on 'www.fitchratings.com', Reckson's IDR is linked  and synchronized with SLG's due to strong legal, operational and strategic ties  between SLG and Reckson, including each entity guaranteeing certain corporate  debt of the other. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES NOTCHING The one-notch differential between SLG's IDR and junior subordinated notes  (trust preferred securities) is consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate  entities with an IDR of 'BBB-'. Based on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and  Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's Web site at www.fitchratings.com,  these securities are senior to SLG's perpetual preferred stock but subordinate  to SLG's corporate debt. Holders of such notes have the ability to demand full  repayment of principal and interest in the event of unpaid interest. PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING The two-notch differential between SLG's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB-'.  Based on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's Web site at  www.fitchratings.com, these preferred securities are deeply subordinated and  have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the  event of a corporate default. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that SLG will maintain a  strategy and leverage and coverage metrics consistent with the rating. While  these quantitative metrics are nominally weaker than most REIT issuers with  investment-grade ratings, the Outlook considers that Midtown Manhattan office  assets consistently trade at lower capitalization rates and are more liquid and  financeable in economic downturns than typical office assets, bolstering the  contingent liquidity of the company's portfolio. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for SLG include: --Annual same-store NOI increases of between 1.0% - 3.0% for 2015-2017;  --The $2.4 billion acquisition of 11 Madison Avenue is financed by $1.4 billion  in secured debt with the remainder financed via proceeds from asset  dispositions; --$400 million of additional acquisitions in 2015 (not including 11 Madison  Ave.) at a 4% capitalization rate; --$475 million of asset sales in 2016 (not including sales related to 11 Madison  Ave.) at a 5% capitalization rate; --Projected annual recurring capital expenditures of $140 million for the  remainder of 2015, $175 million for 2016, and $165 million for 2017; --2015-2017 secured maturities are refinanced dollar-for-dollar; --Annual unsecured bond issuances between $250 - 350 million at yields between  4.5% - 5.0% during 2015-2017;  --Common equity issuances of $285 million in 2015 and $178 million in 2017 via  the company's ATM/DRIP programs, though Fitch notes issuance is at management's  discretion and the common shares are currently trading at a 12% discount to  consensus mean net asset value according to SNL Financial LC. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SLG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 7x (leverage was 7.9x for TTM  ended June 30, 2015 and 7.4x excluding the effects of 388-390 Greenwich Street); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 2.25x (coverage  was 2.1x for TTM ended June 30, 2015); --Growth in the size of the unencumbered pool. The following factors may have a negative impact on SLG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of UA/UD sustaining below 2.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 8x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 1.5x; --A sustained liquidity shortfall (base case liquidity coverage was 0.9x for the  period July 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016). FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: SL Green Realty Corp.: --IDR at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Perpetual preferred stock at 'BB'. SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. --IDR at 'BBB'-; --Unsecured line of credit at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Exchangeable senior notes at 'BBB-'; --Junior subordinated notes at 'BB+'.
