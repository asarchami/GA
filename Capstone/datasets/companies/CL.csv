4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA-' rating to  Colgate-Palmolive Company's (Colgate) 1.75% $500 million medium-term notes due  March 15, 2019 and 3.25% $500 million medium-term notes due March 15, 2024. The  company plans to use $600 million of the proceeds to repay and retire the 1.25%  $250 million medium-term notes due May 1, 2014 and the 4.75% Eur250 million  medium-term notes due June 13, 2014.  The remainder will be used for general  corporate purposes including repaying outstanding commercial paper (CP)  balances.  As of Dec. 31, 2013, Colgate had no outstanding CP but typically has  significant balances inter-quarter. The new notes are issued under the company's 1992 indenture and may be redeemed  at Colgate's option. Given Colgate's high credit quality, repurchase upon change  of control language has not been included in any notes to date.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Scale, Strong Credit Measures The ratings reflect the company's scale with more than $17 billion in revenues  at Dec. 31, 2013, leading market shares, consistently strong operating  performance, and considerable liquidity. Colgate's adjusted EBITDA margin of  approximately 27% is in the top tier of large personal care manufacturers. The  company generated $1.1 billion free cash flow (cash flow from operations minus  capital expenditures and dividends) last year. Leverage ended at 1.2x, meeting  Fitch's expectations, and has been at this level or less in each of the past six  years. Colgate's leverage is expected to remain in this range through the medium  term.   Geographic Diversification Colgate is one of the most geographically diversified consumer products  companies, generating more than 75% of its revenues outside the United States.  More than half of Colgate's revenues are generated from developing markets.  Latin America (approximately 29% of revenues and adjusted operating profit  before corporate expenses) is a particular stronghold where the company  maintains very high toothpaste and toothbrush shares of more than 40% (Nielsen  Holdings, N.V.). The ratings also encompass volatility in revenues and profits  from developing markets.   Significant Liquidity, Manageable Debt The company is highly liquid with a $1.85 billion un-utilized five-year bank  facility expiring in November 2018, a 364-day $145 million revolver maturing in  November 2014, more than $962 million in cash, and considerable access to the  capital markets. The 364-day revolver is likely to be extended as it provides  additional support to the company's large CP program. During the quarter,  Colgate's CP outstanding can approach total revolver commitments.  For example,  average daily balances during 2013 were $1.7 billion. Debt balances of $5.7 billion increased modestly over last year's $5.2 billion.   Fitch does not expect debt balances to increase markedly. Long-term debt  maturities over the next four years are modest in relation to Colgate's  substantial cash flow with $895 million, the largest amount, due in 2014.  The  bulk of the $895 million is being refinanced with the current issuances.  Less  than $500 million is due annually in 2015 and 2016.  Much of these balances are  expected to be refinanced as the company manages its capital structure. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Future developments that may lead to a positive rating action include:  A positive rating action is not likely as Colgate manages its financial metrics  and performance commensurate with the current category. Fitch notes that Colgate  executes sizeable share repurchase programs and/or medium-sized acquisitions  whenever credit protection measures drift towards a higher rating category.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  A negative rating action is not expected given Colgate's low business risk and  conservative management team. While Colgate's credit protection measures are  solid there is little room for further increases in leverage within this rating  category.  Fitch currently rates Colgate as follows:  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA-'; --Short-term IDR 'F1+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'AA-'; --Revolving credit facilities 'AA-'; --CP program 'F1+'.

9,"  (Adds impact of strong dollar, Colgate earnings, updates shares)By Nandita Bose and Sruthi RamakrishnanOct 24 Procter & Gamble Co on Friday said it would sell its Duracell battery business, probably through a split-off into a separate company, as it looks to focus on faster-growing brands.P&G shares rose about 3 percent as investors shrugged off a marginal fall in quarterly sales and warning that a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings this quarter. A surging U.S. currency, reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars.P&G and Colgate-Palmolive Co, which on Friday reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings forecast, are the latest companies to be hurt by a stronger dollar.Emerging markets generate about 50 percent of Colgate's sales and about 39 percent of P&G's revenue comes from developing markets.The world's No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands in the next two years. Duracell, the world's No. 1 battery business, was widely considered to be one of the largest assets that P&G was likely to divest. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer John Moeller said the company had sold or discontinued 11 brands in the latest quarter and 25 in the last five quarters. Analysts expect it to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products, among others.Demand for Duracell's mainstay non-rechargeable, disposable alkaline batteries has waned while a worldwide explosion in electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries.P&G, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it would first sell its interest in a China-based battery joint venture for an undisclosed amount and then exit Duracell completely.The company said it was looking to split Duracell off into a stand-alone company but would consider alternatives that offer better value to shareholders. Under the split-off, expected in the second half of 2015, P&G shareholders would be able to exchange some, none or all of their stock for shares of Duracell.SALES STRUGGLE  P&G said it expected the percentage growth in its net sales in fiscal 2015 to be little changed or rise in the low single digits, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from a strong dollar.Net income attributable to P&G fell to $1.99 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30 from $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.Core earnings, excluding the currency impact, were $1.07 per share, in line with the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales dipped to $20.79 billion from $20.83 billion due to currency fluctuations and divestitures. Organic sales, excluding those effects, increased 2 percent.Shares of P&G were up 2.6 percent at $85.41 at midday.(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore and Nandita Bose in Chicago; Editing by Kirti Pandey, Jilian Mincer, Lisa Von Ahn and Gunna Dickson)",2014-10-24,CL,"Fri Oct 24, 2014 | 1:17pm EDT",UPDATE 4-P&G to exit Duracell battery business; quarterly sales dip,http://www.reuters.com//article/procter-gamble-results-idUSL3N0SJ4NZ20141024?type=companyNews

21,"   By Nandita Bose and Yashaswini Swamynathan  Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) on Thursday reported a rise in an important sales metric, sending its shares up 6 percent as investors shrugged off a lowered earnings forecast.   The consumer products maker, which controls nearly 45 percent of the global toothpaste business, said fourth-quarter organic sales, which exclude the effects of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments, rose 6 percent because of higher volumes and better pricing. Chief Executive Officer Ian Cook said on a conference call that sales volumes increased in all emerging markets despite the price hikes Colgate took to offset a strengthening dollar.Cook also said Colgate expected gross profit margins to increase by 50 to 100 basis points in 2015 as it benefits from lower prices for oil and other commodities. In the fourth quarter, gross margin fell 30 basis points to 58.8 percent from a year earlier due to higher raw material and packaging costs stemming in large part from unfavorable currency fluctuations. Net sales suffered because of the strong dollar and weak demand in markets such as Brazil and Europe.  Net sales in Latin America, Colgate's biggest market, fell 6 percent. Sales were down 7.5 percent in Europe and 10 percent in Africa but rose 4.5 percent in Asia.Cook said foreign exchange volatility would remain a challenge in 2015.The rise in the dollar over the past nearly nine months has reduced the value of overseas sales. A stronger dollar also makes U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and lowers demand. Rival Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Tuesday that it no longer expected sales and core earnings to grow this year, blaming a strong dollar for its disappointing results and forecast.Colgate's fourth-quarter revenue fell 3.2 percent to $4.22 billion, meeting the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Excluding charges for restructuring and a European competition law matter, Colgate earned 76 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 74 cents.

27,"  * Jobless claims lowest since 2000* Consumer confidence rise in March* Colgate, BorgWarner cite strong dollar* Futures down: Dow 35 pts, S&P 4.25 pts, Nasdaq 20.5 pts   (Adds details, comment, updates prices)By Tanya AgrawalApril 30 U.S. stock futures pared back some losses from earlier in the day on Thursday after data showed jobless claims fell to a 15-year low and consumer spending rose in March, suggesting the economy was regaining some momentum after slowing to a crawl in the first quarter.The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to the lowest level since 2000. The strong data comes a day after the Federal Reserve downgraded its view of the U.S. labor market and economy in a policy statement that suggested the central bank may have to wait until at least the third quarter to begin raising interest rates.""I think we're going to see cleaner data come out in the second quarter and with the jobless claims being at their lowest levels in 15 years, that certainly points towards a strengthening labor market which has been a clear focus point of the Fed,"" said Mark Luschini, chief market strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 4.25 points and their fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a lower open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures fell 35 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures lost 20.5 points.ConocoPhillips fell 0.6 percent to $68.45 in premarket trading after it reported a sharp fall in quarterly profit, hurt by a steep decline in crude oil prices.Companies continue to cite the strong dollar for cutting forecast, which has climbed nearly 9 percent against a basket of major currencies from January to March. Colgate-Palmolive fell 1.7 percent to $67.30 after cutting its full-year profit forecast for the second time, saying the impact of the dollar would worsen.Automotive supplier BorgWarner also cited the dollar for a fall in quarterly revenue. Its stock dropped 4 percent to $58.50.Apple fell 0.6 percent to $127.88 after early adopters of the Apple Watch complained that many key functions are disrupted by their tattoos.Yelp shares slumped 17 percent to $42.75 a day after the operator of consumer review website forecast second-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations.Earnings expected after the close on Thursday include Dow component Visa, insurer AIG and LinkedIn.Data expected later in the day include Chicago factory index numbers for April at 9:45 a.m. (1345 GMT)   (Editing by Savio D'Souza)",2015-04-30,CL,"Thu Apr 30, 2015 | 9:04am EDT","US STOCKS-Futures pare losses on strong jobless claims, consumer spending data",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-usa-idUSL4N0XR6E920150430?type=companyNews

29,"  (Adds details, background, analyst comments, updates markets)* Factory orders rise 2.1 percent on transportation* Orders excluding transportation unchanged* March core capital goods orders revised upBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 4 New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar.The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter's abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather.""It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment.Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February's 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June.The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms. That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter.The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year.The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year.Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices. Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar.The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month.""Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.""We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices.""Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories  rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines.Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-04,CL,"Mon May 4, 2015 | 1:23pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory orders rebound solidly, but trend still soft",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XV0WQ20150504?type=companyNews

Sales in Latin America fell 11 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, while volumes fell 1 percent on the back of a 12 percent hike in pricing. The region accounts for 27 percent of the company's sales.Overall volumes rose 1 percent in the third quarter, their slowest rise in almost five years.The effects of higher pricing needs to work its way through for volumes to improve, which is not likely to happen this year, Chief Executive Ian Cook said on a call with analysts. Foreign exchange had a 13 percent negative impact on total sales, Colgate said on Friday.Colgate relies on international markets for about 77 percent of its oral, personal and home-care sales.The company said it now expected full-year earnings per share to decline by a ""low to mid-single digit"", excluding items, based on current exchange rates. The earlier forecast was for a ""low single-digit"" decline.Colgate extended its 2012 restructuring program by a year to Dec. 31, 2017, and said the funds it received from the sale of its laundry detergent business in South Pacific would be invested in the program.Colgate's total sales fell 8.7 percent to $4 billion in the latest quarter - the fifth straight decline, and slightly below the average analyst estimate.Net income attributable to Colgate rose 34 percent to $726 million, or 80 cents per share, from a year earlier, and included a $120 million gain from the sale of its laundry detergent business.Excluding items, the company earned 72 cents per share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr and Anil D'Silva)",2015-10-30,CL,"Fri Oct 30, 2015 | 12:38pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Colgate sales lose sparkle in Latin America,http://www.reuters.com//article/colgate-results-idUSL3N12U4PZ20151030?type=companyNews

47,"  NEW YORK The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority accused a New York broker of unfairly charging a 72-year-old retiree $376,000 in fees and commissions after he made repeated unauthorized trades of her blue-chip Colgate-Palmolive Co stock. Craig Dima, a broker at K.C. Ward Financial on Long Island, was hit with civil charges on Thursday of making unauthorized and unsuitable trades from 2010 to 2015, including selling and soon after repurchasing nearly all of the client's dividend-paying stock 11 times. The client, whose name was withheld for privacy, had a 28-year-long career at Colgate, and held more than 7,500 shares of the company's stock. A share of Colgate stock was priced at $74.49 when the market closed on Friday. Dima's inappropriate trades cost the client a further $127,000 in lost dividend payments she would have earned if the broker had held her stocks as she requested, and $72,000 in losses from three unauthorized trades where Dima sold her Colgate stock and repurchased it at a higher price, according to the complaint. Dima did not respond to requests for comment.The client's account was the largest Dima managed, and he made roughly 80 percent of his annual commissions from trades on her account, according to the complaint.  When she inquired about the unauthorized trades, Dima told her it was the result of computer glitches and human error, the complaint said.The complaint did not charge Dima with churning, a practice in which a broker excessively buys and sells securities in a client's account to inflate commissions he or she earns.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and  distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to  three days earlier than to print subscribers.
