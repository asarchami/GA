This, along with higher premiums across all of its businesses, helped Allstate to race past Wall Street estimates for the period. With premiums already high after a series of ""dramatic"" price increases, Allstate would focus this year on attracting customers to boost its market share, Chief Executive Thomas Wilson told Reuters.""We do not expect to have to be taking abnormally large price increases in the homeowners business,"" he said.In the fourth quarter, Allstate's home insurance business benefited from the decline in catastrophe losses to record a combined ratio of 66.6 - an improvement of 27.3 points over the corresponding year-earlier quarter.An insurer's combined ratio is the percentage of premium revenue that the company must pay out in claims. The fourth quarter of 2012 included $1.12 billion in losses from superstorm Sandy. Losses from natural disasters fell almost 90 percent to $117 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.Wilson said it would be desirable for Allstate to maintain its underlying combined ratio in the homeowners business in the low 60s.GROWTH IN AUTOS In the auto business, Allstate's existing policies rose versus both the previous quarter and the year-earlier quarter for the second reporting period in succession. The growth in auto policies, aided by strong increases in new issued applications and solid retention, would likely suggest acceleration of policy growth in 2014, UBS Investment Research analyst Brian Meredith wrote in a note to clients.Meredith has a ""neutral"" rating on the stock.Allstate's share of the U.S. auto insurance market in 2012 was about 10 percent, only slightly lower than it was in 2011, according to data from regulatory body the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.Wilson said the company, flush with about $1 billion in excess capital from the sale of its Lincoln Benefit Life unit last year, would look to return capital to shareholders and fund growth.He said the board would decide in the next two months how to deploy this cash.

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+' rating to  Allstate's issuance of preferred stock.  Fitch currently rates Allstate's IDRs 'A-/ F1' with a Stable Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS  Allstate's planned issuance of $650 million of 6.625% fixed rate perpetual  non-cumulative preferred stock (an amount excluding a possible additional 15%  overallotment) is for general corporate purposes.  Based on its rating criteria, Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit to the  preferred stock and has added an additional notch to the rating to reflect more  aggressive loss absorption features.  The security has no stated maturity. Dividends are non-cumulative and Allstate  has the option to defer them at their discretion. In addition, the security has  a mandatory deferral feature that requires deferral if certain capital ratios or  operating results are breached. Fitch believes the mandatory deferral could be  triggered before there is significant stress in the organization. Therefore, it  deems the features as having more aggressive loss absorption.  Debt-to-total capital remained appropriate for the current rating category at  23.4% at Dec. 31, 2013 (22.8% proforma for the preferred stock issue), relative  to Fitch's median guideline of 28%. This ratio was calculated excluding  unrealized investment gains on fixed income securities from shareholders'  equity.  Fitch calculated the run-rate fixed charge coverage to be between 9-11 times  based on $3.8 billion in GAAP EBIT for 2013. GAAP EBIT was divided by annual  interest expense on the debt and pre-tax preferred dividends, totaling  approximately $440 million (including dividends from the new stock issue).  Fitch's median guideline for the rating category is 7.0x.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Growth in surplus leading to an improved capitalization profile measured by  operating leverage approaching 1.1x and a score of 'Strong' or better on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone ratings for Allstate's life subsidiaries could increase if their  consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio falls below 100% and they are able  to sustain a GAAP based Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points.  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital and traditional operating leverage. Specifically,  if operating leverage, excluding the surplus of the life insurance operations,  approached 2.5x it would place downward pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company less than one year's interest expense and  common dividends.  Fitch has assigned the following rating:  --6.625% Series E preferred stock 'BB+'. Contact:  Primary Analyst  Douglas M.

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+' rating to Allstate's  issuance of preferred stock. At the same time, Fitch affirmed the 'A-' Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of The Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty subsidiaries, and the 'A-' IFS ratings of Allstate Life  Insurance Co. and the other life subsidiaries (Allstate Financial). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Allstate issued $250 million of 6.25% fixed-rate perpetual non-cumulative  preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance will go toward general corporate  purposes.  Based on its rating criteria, Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit  to the preferred stock and has added an additional notch to the rating to  reflect more aggressive loss absorption features.  Similar to previously issued preferred stock, the security has no stated  maturity, dividends are non-cumulative, and the company has the option to defer  them at its discretion.  In addition, the security has a mandatory deferral  feature that requires deferral if certain capital ratios or operating results  are breached. Fitch believes the mandatory deferral could be triggered before  there is significant stress noted in the organization.  Therefore, it deems the  features as having more aggressive loss absorption. After the $250 million preferred stock issuance and maturity of $300 million in  senior notes, pro forma financial leverage ratio as of March 31, 2014 was 22%.   Financial leverage remained appropriate for the current rating category relative  to Fitch's median guideline of 28%. This ratio reflects the equity credit  assigned to the new and existing preferred stock as well as excluding unrealized  investment gains on fixed income securities from shareholders' equity. Earnings before interest expense and taxes covered interest expense and  preferred dividends by 8.8x during the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14).  This  level of fixed charge coverage is consistent with Fitch's median guideline of 7x  for the current rating category.  Fixed charge coverage has been relatively  steady, reporting a ratio of 8.3x for the full year 2013. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business deteriorated  modestly but remained solid with a GAAP combined ratio of 94.7% for 1Q'14  relative to 92.0% for the full year 2013. Catastrophe losses accounted for 6.3  percentage points on 1Q'14 combined ratio compared to 4.5 points on 2013's  ratio.  Fitch believes this ratio may deteriorate somewhat in the second quarter  as Allstate announced April catastrophe losses of $280 million from six events  plus some adverse reserve development on prior-period catastrophe losses.   Personal auto accounts for two-thirds of property/liability written premiums and  reported a combined ratio of 96.1% for the first three months of 2014, which was  relatively steady from 95.7% in the comparable period of 2013.  Nearly one-quarter of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from  the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 88.4% for the first three  months of 2014. Catastrophe losses through the first quarter were responsible  for modest deterioration in the homeowners combined ratio from 85.6% in the  comparable period in 2013. Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $18 billion at  year-end 2013. Surplus continues to grow at a modest pace, but remains below  pre-financial crisis levels of $19.1 billion reported at year-end 2006. Stated  net leverage was 3.1x at year-end 2013 and approximately 3.6x excluding life  company capital.   Allstate Financial reported a net income of $162 million for the first three  months of 2014, up modestly from $146 million for the comparable period in 2013.  Allstate Financial's annualized pre-tax operating return on assets was 0.8% for  1Q'14.  Risky assets ratio remains elevated at 178% of total adjusted capital at  year-end 2013. The rating on Allstate's life operations reflects Fitch's assessment of its  limited strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise and view that the  'standalone' IFS rating is in the 'BBB' category. Ratings of the life operations  continue to benefit from the Capital Support Agreement from Allstate Insurance  Co. and its access to the holding company credit facility. The life operations  focus on traditional underwritten products and de-emphasize spread-based  products, which improves its risk profile. Increased earnings at Allstate  Financial could eventually improve its strategic importance within the Allstate  enterprise, but Fitch believes it will take time for a significant increase in  earnings to occur. Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining liquid assets at the holding company level to fund at least one year  of interest expense, preferred and common dividends, as well as upcoming debt  maturities. Allstate has $3.3 billion in holding company assets at March 31,  2014 that could be liquidated within three months, relative to forecasted annual  interest expense, preferred and common dividends of approximately $890 million,  and remaining 2014 debt maturities of $650 million.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's proprietary  capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone ratings for Allstate's life subsidiaries could rise if their  consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio approaches 100% and they are able  to sustain a GAAP-based Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points.  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 4.8x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company reaching less than one year's interest  expense and common dividends.

15,"  New York may have its aggressive, horn-honking drivers but it is a bastion of tranquility and safety compared to Boston, home to the worst drivers of any U.S. big city, according to an insurance industry report. ""A Boston driver, on average, will get into a collision every 4.4 years,"" Kari Mather, a spokeswoman for insurer Allstate Corp, said on Tuesday.The company's annual report, titled ""Allstate America's Best Drivers Report,"" is based on client collision damage data in 2011 and 2012.It found Boston ranked dead last among cities with more than 1 million residents in their metropolitan area. Next was Washington.The large U.S. city that boasts the best drivers is Phoenix, where a driver, on average, will get into a collision every 9.5 years, Mather said. San Diego and Chicago ranked second and third among big cities. The analysis was weighted to consider factors such as population density and precipitation, Mather said. Allstate offers automobile insurance to drivers, who are required in most states to carry coverage for their vehicles in case of an accident. Mather said the report's finding are not used to calculate driver costs, but to raise awareness. ""It's more about a dialogue of encouraging drivers to be safer on the road. It's a wakeup call to them,"" she said.  The full report included 200 cities. Boston ranked 199th, ahead of only Worcester, Massachusetts, an industrial city of 181,000 people 40 miles to the west.Among other large cities, Chicago ranked 139th, New York City 155th, Houston 158th, Los Angeles 188th, San Francisco 190th, Philadelphia 192nd and Washington 198th.

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of The Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+' Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty (P/C) affiliates, and the 'A-' IFS ratings of Allstate Life  Insurance Co. and the other life affiliates (Allstate Financial). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Allstate's ratings are supported by its top-tier market position, improved  profitability in P/C insurance and progress in restructuring its life  operations.  The company continues to report good fixed charge coverage and  financial flexibility.  The capitalization of Allstate's P/C operations is  consistent with the current rating category, but consequently holds the rating  down in the 'A' category.   Allstate is the second-largest personal lines insurance writer in the U.S.  behind State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. Allstate's market  position in private auto slipped to third as rapidly growing Government  Employees Insurance Co. (GEICO) took the second position.  Allstate remains the  second largest writer of homeowners insurance behind State Farm. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business deteriorated but  remained better than Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category  with a GAAP combined ratio of 95.2% for the first three quarters of 2014  relative to 93.1% for the comparable period in 2013. Catastrophe losses  accounted for 8.8 percentage points on the combined ratio for the first nine  months of 2014 compared to 5.5 points in the comparable period in 2013.   Personal auto accounts for two-thirds of property/liability written premiums and  reported a combined ratio of 96.3% for the first three quarters of 2014, which  was relatively unchanged from the comparable period in 2013.  Nearly one-quarter of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from  the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 90.8% for the first three  quarters of 2014. Catastrophe losses through the first nine months were  responsible for deterioration in the homeowners' combined ratio from 82.4% in  the comparable period in 2013. Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $18 billion at Sept.  30, 2014.  Surplus remains below pre-financial crisis levels of $19.1 billion  reported at year-end 2006.  Capitalization at Allstate's P/C operations was  considered 'Strong' as measured by Fitch's Prism capital model, which is  consistent with current ratings.  Stated net leverage was 3.2x at Sept. 30,  2014, and approximately 3.9x excluding life company capital. Allstate Financial reported net income of $423 million for the first three  quarters of 2014, up from a modest net loss of $24 million for the comparable  period in 2013.  Allstate Financial's annualized pre-tax operating return on  assets was 0.9% for the first nine months of 2014. Fitch's 'standalone' assessment of Allstate's life operations is 'BBB' for IFS  and its strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise is considered  'Important.'  The ratings of the life operations continue to benefit from the  Capital Support Agreement from Allstate Insurance Co. and its access to the  holding company credit facility.  The life operations focus on traditional underwritten products and de-emphasize  spread-based products, which improves its risk profile. Increased earnings at  Allstate Financial could eventually improve its strategic importance within the  Allstate enterprise, but Fitch believes it will take time for a significant  increase in earnings to occur. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and taxes covered interest expense  and preferred dividends by 8.2x during the first nine months of 2014.  This  level of fixed charge coverage is consistent with Fitch's median guideline for  the current rating category.  Fixed charge coverage has been relatively steady. Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining liquid assets at the holding company level to fund at least one year  of interest expense, preferred dividends and common dividends as well as  upcoming debt maturities. Allstate had $2.3 billion in holding company assets at  Sept. 30, 2014 that could be liquidated within three months, relative to  forecasted annual interest expense, and preferred and common dividends of  approximately $880 million.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's proprietary  capital model, Prism; --Reduced volatility in earnings from catastrophe losses and better operating  results consistent with companies in the 'AA' rating category; --Standalone assessment for Allstate Life Insurance Co. and the other life  affiliates could rise if their consolidated statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio  reaches approximately 130% and the company is able to sustain a GAAP-based  Return on Assets ratio over 80 basis points; --Ratings for Allstate Life Insurance Co. and the other life affiliates could be  upgraded if its strategic importance changes to 'Very Important' from  'Important.'  Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Substantial adverse reserve development that is inconsistent with industry  trends;  --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital, and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 4.8x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Unexpected and adverse surrender activity on liabilities in the life insurance  operations; --Liquid assets at the holding company of less than one year's interest expense,  and preferred and common dividends. Fitch affirms the following ratings for Allstate and subsidiaries:  The Allstate Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'. The following junior subordinated debt at 'BBB-': --6.125% $259 million debenture due May 15, 2067;  --5.10% $500 million subordinated debenture due Jan. 15, 2053; --5.75% $800 million subordinated debenture due Aug. 15, 2053; --6.5% $500 million debenture due May 15, 2067.

20,"  Ohio State runs wild, stuns Alabama in Sugar BowlNEW ORLEANS -- The Ohio State Buckeyes overcame enormous odds this season, losing two starting quarterbacks before handing the job to a redshirt sophomore who never started a regular-season college game.And now, very suddenly, coach Urban Meyer's Buckeyes are one victory away from an improbable national championship.Sophomore running back Ezekiel Elliott battered Alabama for a Sugar Bowl-record 230 rushing yards, including an 85-yard touchdown burst with 3:24 left, powering No. 4 Ohio State to a 42-35 upset victory over the top-ranked Crimson Tide and a berth in the national championship game against Oregon in Arlington, Texas, on Jan. 12.Alabama entered the game with the nation's third-ranked defense.""That was a sledgehammer game,"" Meyer said after his team advanced to 13-1 with its 12th consecutive victory, Ohio State's first bowl victory over an Southeastern Conference team in 11 tries. ""That was a classic, so we are good enough.""Ohio State was clinging to a 34-28 lead when it took over at its 5-yard line with 5:24 remaining. After the Buckeyes picked up one first down, Elliott, a high school sprinter who was timed at 4.3 seconds in the 40-yard dash, took a handoff off left tackle, broke out of a diving tackle by linebacker Xzavier Dickson and ran unmolested for the score.""I knew going into the game that the Alabama defensive front was going to be very big and physical, and it was going to be hard for our offensive line to get movement,"" Elliott said. ""But (the Ohio State linemen) did a great job. I knew I had to hit the holes hard and break some arm tackles.""The Buckeyes converted the two-point conversion on a pass from quarterback Cardale Jones to wide receiver Michael Thomas, making it 42-28. Alabama wasn't dead, traveling 75 yards in six plays to cut the deficit to 42-35 on a 6-yard pass from quarterback Blake Sims to wide receiver Amari Cooper with 1:59 left.The Crimson Tide had one more chance, getting the ball back at its 18 with 1:33 left and no timeouts remaining. After moving the ball to the Ohio State 42, Sims threw a Hail Mary pass into the end zone, but it was intercepted by safety Tyvis Powell as time expired.Meyer said he offered a silent prayer because he made a tactical mistake on Ohio State's final offensive possession. The Buckeyes recovered the onside kick at their 49-yard line, and Alabama had two timeouts left.Rather than run the ball on first down to force Alabama to use a timeout, Meyer called for a deep pass that fell incomplete, stopping the clock. That helped Alabama get the ball back with extra time remaining.""You start questioning yourself why you threw that ball down the field,"" Meyer said. ""It was my call. Maybe it wasn't the right call. I just kept thinking I screwed this thing up.""Jones, who started the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 6 and led the Buckeyes to a 59-0 rout of Wisconsin, had some early jitters but settled down to finish 18 of 35 for 243 yards with one touchdown pass and one interception. He moved into the starting lineup in the absence of Braxton Miller, lost to a shoulder injury in August, and J.T. Barrett, who broke his right ankle in the regular-season finale.Alabama coach Nick Saban said even with just one game of videotape on Jones, he could tell the 6-foot-5, 250-pound quarterback had a rifle arm. He just didn't know how good it was until he saw it in person.""The new quarterback has a tremendous arm, and they have some very talented receivers,"" Saban said. ""Those things became very apparent in the last two games because of the quarterback. I think they're capable of playing with anybody in the country."" Perhaps the critical play of the game came with Alabama trailing 34-28 and 9:53 left. The Crimson Tide (12-2) took over on the Ohio State 23 after a 21-yard punt out of the end zone by Cameron Johnston.However, instead of having his team push the ball with the run -- running back Derrick Henry (95 yards on 13 carries) was pounding away at the Ohio State front seven -- Saban tried to catch the Buckeyes off guard.He had Sims roll to his right and throw toward the end zone, where his pass for tight end O.J. Howard was badly underthrown and easily intercepted at the goal line by safety Vonn Bell with 9:44 left.""I was anxious to take more shots down the field,"" Saban said. ""I don't think we did that enough early in the game.""Of Ohio State's six scoring drives, none were of the cheap variety, covering 80, 71, 71, 77, 75 and 95 yards.The Buckeyes scored 28 consecutive points after trailing 21-6 late in the second quarter. Ohio State took the lead for good, 27-21, on a 47-yard pass from Jones to wide receiver Devin Smith early in the third quarter. On the play, cornerback Eddie Jackson slipped to the turf at the 10, and Smith was all alone to finish off the TD reception.The Buckeyes scored their fourth consecutive touchdown courtesy of defensive trickery. Facing a third-and-7, Sims thought Cooper was open, but right defensive end Steve Miller dropped into coverage for an interception and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown and a 34-21 Ohio State lead.NOTES: P JK Scott was an unsung hero for Alabama, punting seven times for a 55-yard average and keeping the Buckeyes bottled up. ... Alabama's struggles in the secondary continued against Ohio State. In the first nine games of the season, Alabama yielded just three completions of 25 yards or longer, but in its last four games, it allowed 13. Ohio State had three 25-plus receptions in the first half. ...

35,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of the Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+' Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty (P/C) affiliates. In addition, Fitch affirmed the IFS ratings  of Allstate Life Insurance Co. and its subsidiaries (ALIC) along with American  Heritage Life Insurance Co. (AHLIC) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation is supported by Allstate's top-tier market position in  personal lines insurance, solid underwriting results in P/C insurance, and a  holding company with good financial flexibility.  The capitalization of  Allstate's P/C operations is consistent with the current rating category, but  consequently holds the rating down in the 'A' category.   Allstate has 'large' market position, size and scale that would be consistent  with Fitch's guidelines for a higher rating category.  Allstate is the  second-largest personal lines insurance writer in the U.S. behind State Farm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Allstate's market position in  private auto is third behind Government Employees Insurance Co. (GEICO) and  State Farm, while its homeowners insurance remains the second largest after  State Farm. Underwriting results for Allstate's property/liability business remained better  than Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category despite some  deterioration in auto results.  Allstate reported a combined ratio of 95.8% for  the first nine months of 2015 compared to 95.2% for the comparable period in  2014. Catastrophe losses accounted for 6.0 percentage points (pp) on the  combined ratio for the first nine months of 2015, compared to 8.8pp in the  comparable period in 2014.   Personal auto accounts for approximately two-thirds of property/liability  written premiums and reported a combined ratio of 100.1% for the first nine  months of 2015, deteriorating from 96.3% in the comparable period in 2014.  Increased frequency and severity trends were responsible for the period-to-period deterioration in underwriting results. One-fifth of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from the  homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  continue to be positive, reporting a combined ratio of 82.7% for the first nine  months of 2015, improving from 90.8% in the comparable period of 2014.  Catastrophe losses through the first nine months of 2015 were down to 19.7% of  earned premium, down from 27.9% in the comparable period of 2014.   Consolidated earnings before interest expense and taxes covered interest expense  and preferred dividends by 8.2x during the first nine months of 2015, unchanged  from the comparable period of 2014.  The fixed charge coverage calculation  excludes realized investment gains of $280 million and includes preferred  dividends of $87 million for the first nine months of 2015. Fixed charge  coverage is consistent with Fitch's median guideline for the current rating  category.   Fitch's rating rationale anticipates a continuation of Allstate's practice of  maintaining liquid assets at the holding company level to fund at least one year  of interest expense, preferred dividends and common dividends, as well as  upcoming debt maturities. Allstate had $3.06 billion in holding company assets  at Sept. 30, 2015 that could be liquidated within three months, relative to  forecast annual interest expense, and preferred and common dividends of  approximately $900 million. Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $15.8 billion at  Sept. 30, 2015, down $1.2 billion from year-end 2014, as AIC paid $2.1 billion  in dividends to Allstate, exceeding its $1.1 billion in net income over the  period. Fitch expects surplus to grow in the fourth quarter of 2015, since net  income should greatly exceed the approximately $200 million of AIC's remaining  dividend capacity.  Capitalization at Allstate's P/C operations continues to be considered 'Strong'  as measured by Fitch's proprietary Prism capital model, which is consistent with  guidelines for the current rating category.  Stated net leverage was 3.7x at  Sept. 30, 2015, and approximately 4.6x excluding life company capital. Year-to-date through September 2015, ALIC reported net income of $542 million  compared to $343 million for the same period of 2014. The increase was primarily  due to realized investment gains, as the company has strategically repositioned  its portfolio, selling longer-duration fixed income securities and investing  more in private equities and real estate. The company's pre-tax operating income  fell by $60 million, or 11% over this same time period, primarily due to  declining net investment income.  ALIC's risky assets ratio, which increased to 214% in 2014 from 179% in 2013, is  among the highest in Fitch's universe, and may continue to rise due to its  portfolio repositioning if Total Adjusted Capital (TAC) does not increase at a  commensurate level. AHLIC generated a statutory return on assets (ROA) of 5.8%  through the first nine months of 2015 and has a much cleaner investment profile.  The 'standalone' IFS rating on ALIC is 'BBB' with a three-notch uplift applied  for parent support. Fitch views ALIC's strategic importance within the Allstate  enterprise as 'Very Important' and considers the various strategic actions taken  to strengthen its risk profile. The ratings continue to benefit from the Capital  Support Agreement from Allstate Insurance Co. and its access to the holding  company credit facility.  AHLIC's 'standalone' IFS rating of 'A-' reflects an 'Important' strategic  category within the Allstate enterprise. While Fitch views AHLIC's financial  metrics more favorably than ALIC's, the company is seen as less synergistic to  the Allstate enterprise. Thus, AHLIC receives a one-notch uplift in its rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's Prism  capital model; --No material deterioration in underwriting profitability of the property/casualty operations from current levels.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade for the life operations  include: --Standalone ratings for ALIC could be upgraded if its statutory Risky  Assets/TAC ratio improved to 130% and the company is able to sustain a  GAAP-based ROA over 80 basis points; --Ratings for ALIC could also be upgraded if Fitch's view of its strategic  importance changes to 'Core' from 'Very Important.' --AHLIC's standalone rating is unlikely to be upgraded in the intermediate term,  due to its relatively small size and scale.  --Ratings for AHLIC could be upgraded if Fitch's view of its strategic  importance changes to 'Very Important' from 'Important' or if the agency's view  of parent support merits a greater degree of uplift. Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital, and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 4.8x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Liquid assets at the holding company of less than one year's interest expense,  and preferred and common dividends. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade for the life operations  include: --Standalone ratings for ALIC could be downgraded if its statutory Risky  Assets/TAC ratio deteriorates further or GAAP-based ROA declines to 50 basis  points; --AHLIC's standalone rating could be downgraded if financial performance or  capitalization deteriorates significantly; --Ratings for ALIC and AHLIC could be downgraded if Fitch's view of the  strategic categories weaken. Fitch affirms the following ratings for Allstate and subsidiaries with a Stable  Outlook:  The Allstate Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Preferred stock at 'BB+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'. The following junior subordinated debt at 'BBB-': --6.125% $252 million debenture due May 15, 2067;  --5.10% $500 million subordinated debenture due Jan. 15, 2053; --5.75% $800 million subordinated debenture due Aug. 15, 2053; --6.5% $500 million debenture due May 15, 2067.

43,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of the Allstate Corporation (Allstate) as well as the 'A+' Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Allstate Insurance Co. and its  property/casualty (P/C) affiliates with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also  downgraded the short-term IDR of Allstate to 'F2' from 'F1'. Additionally, Fitch  affirmed the IFS ratings of Allstate Life Insurance Co. and its subsidiaries  (collectively referred to as ALIC) at 'A' and revised the Rating Outlook to  Negative from Stable. Finally, Fitch affirmed American Heritage Life Insurance  Co.'s (AHLIC) IFS rating at 'A' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of P/C affiliates and holding company long-term ratings is  supported by Allstate's top-tier market position in personal lines insurance,  and solid underwriting results in P/C insurance. The capitalization of  Allstate's P/C operations is consistent with the current rating category.  The downgrade of Allstate's short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1' reflects an  increase in the potential need for holding company liquidity. Specifically,  catastrophe losses at the P/C operations could require capital contributions,  since the capital cushion at the operating subsidiaries has deteriorated over  the past couple of years. In addition, greater investment risk at the life  operations along with weakening operating performance could also require the  holding company's liquidity resources. Fitch's revised ALIC's Outlook to Negative as a result of its increasing  investment risk, with its portfolio among the riskiest in Fitch's rated life  universe. Allstate's life operations have a materially lower standalone rating  than the P/C operations given its relatively moderate scale and market position  as well as its lower strategic importance. Consequently, the life operations  receive significant rating uplift as part of the Allstate enterprise. Allstate has a 'large' market position, size and scale that would be consistent  with Fitch's guidelines for a higher rating category. Allstate is the  second-largest personal lines insurance writer in the U.S. behind State Farm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Allstate's market position in  private auto is third behind Government Employees Insurance Co. (GEICO) and  State Farm, while its homeowners insurance remains the second largest after  State Farm. The combined ratio for Allstate's property/liability business averaged 94.1%  over the last four years (2012-2015), exceeding Fitch's median guidelines for  the current rating category. Greater catastrophe losses during the first quarter  of 2016 (1Q16) inflated the combined ratio to 98.4% compared to 93.7% for the  comparable period in 2015. Catastrophe losses accounted for 10.7 percentage  points (pp) on the combined ratio for the first three months of 2016, compared  to 4pp in the comparable period in 2015. Catastrophe losses remain elevated with  $835 million in pretax losses during April and May of 2016, which is comparable  to 1Q16's total. Personal auto accounts for approximately two-thirds of property/liability  written premiums and reported a combined ratio of 99.7% for the first three  months of 2016, up from 98.5% in the comparable period in 2015 and essentially  flat from full-year 2015. Catastrophe losses in the 1Q amounted to 2.7pp of the  combined ratio, masking improvement in the underlying underwriting results.  Nearly one-quarter of Allstate's property/liability written premium comes from  the homeowners line of business. Underwriting results for the homeowners line  were also adversely impacted by catastrophe losses during 1Q16. Homeowners  reported a combined ratio of 94.1% for the first three months of 2016,  deteriorating from 79.2% in the comparable period of 2015. Catastrophe losses in  1Q16 were 33.9pp of earned premium, up from 13.9pp in the comparable period of  2015.  Combined statutory surplus at Allstate's P/C operations was $16.1 billion at  year-end 2015, down $1.9 billion over the last two years as AIC pays dividends  in excess of earnings to support Allstate's share repurchase activity. Further  deterioration in capitalization at the P/C operating company level would place  downward pressure on ratings. Capitalization at Allstate's P/C operations continues to deteriorate when  measured using Fitch's proprietary Prism capital model as well as NAIC  Risk-Based Capital, operating and net leverage ratios. Adjusted net leverage,  excluding life company capital, was 4.5x at year-end 2015, approaching Fitch's  downgrade trigger of 5.0x. In 1Q16, ALIC reported net income of $52 million compared to $153 million for  the prior year period. The decline was driven by realized investment losses and  reduced net investment income, as the company is strategically repositioning its  portfolio by selling longer-duration fixed income securities and increasing its  exposure to private equities and real estate. ALIC's risky assets ratio, which  increased to 241% in 2015 from 212% in 2014, is among the highest in Fitch's  universe, and may continue to rise due to its portfolio repositioning if total  adjusted capital (TAC) does not increase at a commensurate level. AHLIC  generated a statutory return on assets (ROA) of 3.2% in 1Q16 and has a much  cleaner investment profile.  ALIC's 'standalone' IFS rating of has been revised to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'  reflecting the company's elevated investment risk. However, ALIC receives a  four-notch uplift for parent support, elevating its IFS rating to 'A'. Fitch  views ALIC's strategic importance within the Allstate enterprise as 'Very  Important' and considers the various strategic actions taken to strengthen its  risk profile. The ratings continue to benefit from the Capital Support Agreement  from Allstate Insurance Co. and its access to the holding company credit  facility. Based upon its standalone assessment and strategic importance, ALIC's  final rating is capped at one notch below its parent, and any further  deterioration in its standalone assessment will result in a downgrade. AHLIC's 'standalone' IFS rating of 'A-' reflects an 'Important' strategic  category within the Allstate enterprise. While Fitch views AHLIC's financial  metrics more favorably than ALIC's, the company is seen as less synergistic to  the Allstate enterprise. Thus, AHLIC receives a one-notch uplift in its rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to an upgrade include:  --Sustainable capital position measured by net leverage excluding life company  capital below 3.8x and a score approaching 'Very Strong' on Fitch's Prism  capital model; --No material deterioration in underwriting profitability of the property/casualty operations from current levels.  Given its Negative Outlook, Fitch considers an upgrade of ALIC unlikely over the  near- to intermediate-term. The following rating triggers could result in a  revision of ALIC's Outlook to Stable from Negative: --An improvement in statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio to 200% with operating  performance remaining stable; --Fitch's view of its strategic importance changes to 'Core' from 'Very  Important.' Given its relatively small size and scale, AHLIC is unlikely to be upgraded in  the near- to intermediate-term, but the following could result in an upgrade  over the longer term:  --Fitch's view of its strategic importance changes to 'Very Important' from  'Important' or if the agency's view of parent support merits a greater degree of  uplift. Key rating triggers for Allstate that could lead to a downgrade include:  --A prolonged decline in underwriting profitability that is inconsistent with  industry averages or is driven by an effort to grow market share during soft  pricing conditions; --Significant deterioration in capital strength as measured by Fitch's capital  model, NAIC risk-based capital, and statutory net leverage. Specifically, if net  leverage excluding life company capital approached 5.0x it would place downward  pressure on ratings; --Significant increases in financial leverage ratio to greater than 30%; --Liquid assets at the holding company of less than one year's interest expense,  and preferred and common dividends. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade for ALIC include: --Statutory Risky Assets/TAC ratio deteriorates further; --Fitch's view of its strategic importance weakens. Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade for AHLIC include: --Financial performance or capitalization deteriorates significantly; --Fitch's view of its strategic importance weakens. Fitch affirms the following ratings for Allstate with a Stable Outlook:  The Allstate Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Preferred stock at 'BB+'; The following senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+': --6.75% $176 million debenture due May 15, 2018; --7.45% $317 million debenture due May 16, 2019;  --3.15% $500 million debenture due June 15, 2023; --6.125% $159 million note due Dec. 15, 2032;  --5.35% $323 million note due June 1, 2033; --5.55% $546 million note due May 9, 2035; --5.95% $386 million note due April 1, 2036; --6.9% $165 million debenture due May 15, 2038; --5.2% $62 million note due Jan. 15, 2042; --4.5% $500 million note due June 15, 2043.
