0,"  HOUSTON Jan 7 U.S. onshore drilling contractor Helmerich & Payne on Wednesday said rates for its high-tech rigs have tumbled 10 percent from the previous quarter and more softness is expected due to falling crude oil prices.""Drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing are now expected to significantly decline in the U.S.,"" the company said in a presentation filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Crude oil prices have skidded to the lowest level in more than 5 years, as global demand weakens and supplies, especially from shale basins in North America, grow. On Wednesday, crude oil futures rose 23 cents to $48.16 per barrel. Helmerich & Payne, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said it expects spot pricing to continue to soften during the next 30 days, according to the presentation. Since December 11, the idle and available number of its high-tech FlexRigs has risen to 26 from 15. The company expects to see another 40 to 50 FlexRigs become idle. Currently, 286 remain active, the company said. Shares of Helmerich, a company analysts say is best positioned to weather the crude drop, fell 5 percent to $60.35 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.

1,"   By Darshana Sankararaman and Narottam Medhora  Driller Helmerich & Payne Inc (HP.N) said it may cut 2,000 jobs as it begins to idle rigs amid a slide in crude oil prices, following similar cost cuts by top oilfield services providers Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N).Helmerich, which had about 11,901 employees as of Sept. 30, also said it would now build only 2 high-tech FlexRigs per month this year, down from the 4 rigs it had planned.The company's shares fell as much as 10 percent to $54 on Thursday as weak forecast for 2015 margins and revenue overshadowed a better-than-expected quarterly profit.The 2015 forecast ""reflects a severe opening blow from the global downturn"", FBR Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note.  Helmerich has benefited so far from robust shale drilling activity in the United States. The gains extended into the first quarter Dec. 31, but are now eroding.Crude prices have slipped 60 percent since June due to oversupply, including from North American shale fields, and tepid demand growth. In response, oil producers are cutting budgets and slowing exploration activity, hurting Helmerich and other companies that provide rigs and services used in drilling.Helmerich said less than 200 rigs would be active by the end of the current quarter, down from over 297 in the first quarter. ""The rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected,"" Chief Executive John Lindsay said on a post-earnings call. Helmerich said it expects revenue and margins for U.S. land rigs to decrease in the second quarter.The company said it expected rig revenue in its U.S. land drilling unit to average $27,000-$27,500 per day in the second quarter, below the $29,457 it recorded in the first quarter.The company also said current-quarter revenue days would fall by about 25 percent from the first quarter. Helmerich said it expected revenue days to remain flat in its offshore rig business and fall about 10-15 percent in its international land rig unit. Adjusted profit was $1.70 in the quarter ended Dec.31, above the average analyst estimate of $1.52. Total operating revenue rose 18.8 percent to $1.06 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $977.3 million.Helmerich shares were down 5 percent at $56.60 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

4,"  (Adds details from release, background)April 23 Oil drilling contractors Patterson-UTI Energy Inc and Helmerich & Payne Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly profits as demand for their hi-tech rigs remained resilient despite the slump in crude prices.Demand for new, faster rigs continues to be strong as they help oil and gas companies cut costs and operate more efficiently.The strong demand has helped Patterson-UTI and Helmerich & Payne offset a drop in drilling activities due to a near 45 percent fall in crude prices  since June last year.Excluding one-time items, Patterson-UTI earned 6 cents per share in the first quarter, above the average analyst estimate of 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Helmerich & Payne reported adjusted profit of 96 cents per share in the second quarter, beating average estimate of 79 cents.However, both companies said they expected their rig counts to fall in the current quarter. Helmerich & Payne forecast contracted land rigs to fall to 165 rigs in the current quarter from 179 at the end of March.Patterson-UTI said it expects the number of rigs to fall to 101 in the current quarter from 165 in the first quarter. Helmerich & Payne, which recorded gains of about $47 million due to early termination of contracts, said operating revenue fell marginally to $883.1 million.Patterson-UTI, which gained $15.8 million from early termination of drilling contracts, said revenue fell 3 percent to $657.7 million.(Reporting By Shubhankar Chakravorty and Anannya Pramanick in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2015-04-23,HP,"Thu Apr 23, 2015 | 7:23am EDT","UPDATE 1-Patterson-UTI, Helmerich & Payne gain on buoyant demand for hi-tech rigs",http://www.reuters.com//article/patterson-uti-results-idUSL4N0XK45Q20150423?type=companyNews

7,"  (Repeats with no changes)By Ross Kerber and Michael ErmanBOSTON/NEW YORK, March 23 More cash, lower targets and bigger share awards - not all U.S. energy bosses are feeling the full impact of tumbling oil prices in their paychecks.Some oil and gas companies are making it easier for their top managers to meet performance goals or are offering more cash as a prolonged oil slump keeps share prices at lows not seen in five years, filings show.Among the beneficiaries are bosses of both solid performers and struggling companies, and the changes may rankle investors facing losses.Oilfield services company Schlumberger NV, for example, used lower earnings targets for the second half of 2015, which helped its CEO Paal Kibsgaard receive total pay of $18.3 million, only slightly below the 2014 level. The company's shares fell 18 percent last year, about half the decline of its index and have since recovered about 7 percent.Linn Energy, meanwhile, whose shares nosedived 87 percent last year under the weight of its swelling debt and dwindling financing options, announced a new incentive plan last month for its top executives that focuses more on cash rather than stock.Dallas-based oil and gas exploration company Exco Resources Inc will offer its directors restricted stock worth $140,000 a year - about 10 times the value of shares awarded in 2014, according to securities filings, even though its shares fell 43 percent last year.In another example, Halcon Resources Corp - built by its CEO Floyd Wilson, who has made a fortune launching and selling off oil companies - disclosed in a securities filing last week that Wilson received $3 million and three other top executives $800,000 each in exchange for an agreement to stay for at least another year.A representative for Halcon, which has hired financial and legal advisors to navigate the downturn, did not return messages.Schlumberger declined to comment beyond its recent proxy statement. An Exco representative said the new plan makes its director pay more competitive and aligns their compensation with performance of the company.A representative for Linn Energy told Reuters in February the compensation changes were designed to ensure management stayed on to secure the company's future. The company did not respond to requests for further comment. Offering executives financial incentives to stay through upheaval, be it a merger or restructuring, is a common practice.ONE WAY BET? But whatever the merits, frequent changes in incentives ""can absolutely undercut the relationship between pay and performance,"" said Ken Bertsch, head of the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members include big pension funds and asset managers.Anne Simpson, who oversees corporate governance at the $279.5 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System, told Reuters that it planned to take a hard look at pay adjustments in coming months when proxy votes are due. ""Performance is not a one way bet, paying off on the way up, and never going down,"" she said in an e-mailed response.A Reuters analysis of filings through mid-March showed that a number of companies changed their payout plans for leaders in ways that shielded them from the collapse in oil prices, even as they continued to slash other spending and lay off thousands of workers. Since November 2014 Schlumberger alone has laid off 34,000 people, or about a quarter of its workforce.Most companies, however, paid their top executives less in 2015 to reflect falling profits and share prices amid crude's more than 60 percent fall since mid-2014, compensation consultants said. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1Pa5AFT)""A lot of wealth has come off the table for senior executives in the span of 18 months,"" said Mike Halloran, senior partner at consulting firm Mercer.Halloran estimates 2015 executive pay at large energy firms fell by a fifth on average. That compares with a 24 percent drop in the energy sector indexFor example, John Lindsay, CEO of contract driller Helmerich & Payne Inc. saw his total pay drop by nearly a quarter to $3.7 million for the 12 months ended Sept. 30 after the company skipped bonus payments for top executives citing missed performance targets. Exxon Mobil Corp, the largest energy company, has yet to release all details on compensation paid to its CEO Rex Tillerson. However, his total $33.1 million package in 2014 included $21.4 million in 225,000 shares granted on Nov. 25, 2014 and although he received the same number of shares last November, they were worth $3.1 million less.Many publicly-traded energy companies will detail their 2015 pay, including annual bonuses, in proxy filings beginning this month and those that bucked the trend are likely to face particular scrutiny.Schlumberger's 2015 compensation for its CEO Kibsgaard included an incentive payment of $3.3 million. It rose from $2.9 million in 2014 after the company used lower earnings targets for the second half of the year, citing in its recent proxy ""the continued challenges of the industry.""That payment would be roughly unchanged had Schlumberger used the same targets for the whole year, estimated Chris Crawford, president of compensation consultant Longnecker & Associates.At the Houston-based Linn Energy, which warned on March 15 it might have to file for bankruptcy, CEO Mark Ellis is now eligible for cash payments of up to $6.9 million this year. In 2014, when Ellis made $10 million, about the average of recent years, $7.6 million of that was in stock.For its part, Exco, which has hired Credit Suisse as its restructuring advisor to help lighten its debt load, boosted the stock award for its non-employee directors.Exco representative Chris Peracchi said the move aimed to make directors' pay more competitive and was not meant to shield them against the downturn since shares could still lose value.John Groton, director of equity research at Thrivent Asset Management, which has investments in energy companies though not in Exco, questioned the move's rationale. Among other things, he said, the slump has made it easier to find talented people to serve on boards.Exco's new plan, Groton said, was ""just egregious.""(Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Tomasz Janowski)",2016-03-23,HP,"Wed Mar 23, 2016 | 1:00am EDT","RPT-In oil rout, some US energy bosses were spared the pain",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-energy-pay-idUSL2N16U236?type=companyNews
