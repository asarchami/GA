3,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Gene sequencing equipment maker Illumina has teamed up with the U.S. government and academic researchers at the Broad Institute in Boston to train scientists in West Africa to improve tracking of how the Ebola virus is mutating in hopes of fighting it more effectively.The public-private partnership, announced on Wednesday, is designed to extend research on how the Ebola virus is mutating in real time as it spreads among populations in West Africa. Scientists need the information to develop new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to fight the outbreak.Sequencing and patient monitoring facilities will be created first in Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone, and over the longer term in other West African countries, the groups said in a statement. These centers will serve as hubs for the deployment of mobile laboratories to remote districts where large-scale capacity is not available. Illumina, the U.S. Agency for International Development and researchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will train and equip the facilities with state-of-the-art genome sequencing technology. The value of Illumina's investment was not disclosed.Scientists have expressed frustration that they are unable to gain access to blood samples from Ebola patients needed for this kind of research. A team of researchers led by Pardis Sabeti from the Broad Institute has been working with collaborators in Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone for several years, training them to use sequencing and diagnostic technology. In August, Sabeti and colleagues published a study in the journal Science of some of the earliest cases in Sierra Leone. It suggested that the virus is mutating quickly and in ways that could affect current diagnostics and future vaccines and treatments.The new pact will allow researchers to do similar work in Liberia, the country hit hardest by the outbreak.

6,"   By Mike Stone and Julie Steenhuysen  Gene-sequencing giant Illumina Inc, private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC and venture capital firm Sutter Hill Ventures have agreed to invest $100 million to seed a new consumer-facing human genome platform called Helix, according to people familiar with the deal.San Francisco-based Helix aims to provide a new kind of environment that will sequence, store and analyze individuals' genetic data and provide a marketplace of services through various partners, allowing people to explore their geneology or  understand their risk for inherited disease.To accomplish that, Helix plans to create one of the world's largest next-generation DNA sequencing labs and make the data accessible on a secure and protected database.Initial partners are diagnostic testing giant Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) and Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine, which are investing in Helix and will offer services to its customers.Initially, Mayo will help Helix develop applications focused on consumer education and health-related queries. LabCorp will develop and offer analysis and interpretation services through Helix's platform. Customers will control how their data is accessed. Discussions with several other potential partners are underway, according to the sources who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Illumina, Sutter Hill, LabCorp and Mayo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Helix hopes to avoid some of the issues encountered by direct-to-consumer genetic testing company 23andMe, which in late 2013 was barred by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from providing customers with health information. The company still performs genetic testing and offers information on ancestry, and recently won FDA approval for a test for Bloom syndrome. The company intends ""to work extremely closely with the FDA,"" one of the sources said, adding that the platform would include health information, delivered through partners such as Mayo or LabCorp.Helix intends to sequence a much larger swath of the genome than 23andMe, at minimum testing for all the protein coding genes that make up the exome and account for 85 percent of disease. Operations for Helix are expected to kickoff in mid-2016, a source familiar with the deal said.The investment is expected to erode Illumina’s non-GAAP earnings per share guidance by about $0.10 in 2016.New York-based Warburg Pincus, with more than $35 billion under management, has invested in healthcare platforms in the past but this is their first major foray into genomics.

7,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch and Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. biotech shares extended their recent downward spiral on Tuesday as concerns about drug pricing continued to plague the sector while disappointing news from Illumina and other companies added to selling pressure. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index, down 4 percent, has now fallen about 17 percent since just before Hillary Clinton, front-runner to be the Democratic nominee in next year's U.S. presidential election, vowed on Sept. 21 to take steps to curb high drug prices.Concerns about drug pricing were exacerbated by a Wall Street Journal report late Monday on the industry's practice of raising prices to compensate for sluggish demand and rising competition. Of the 142 constituents in the biotech index, just 10 were trading higher, while the S&P 500 health care index was down 2.4 percent.""There's a flurry of things that are coming together to drive a lot of fear and panic,"" said Michael Yee, biotech analyst for RBC Capital Markets. ""Obviously continued concern in headlines around drug pricing, particularly with an article out in the media about significant price increases even for old drugs that are declining in volume.""  Also driving losses in the biotech group was a disappointing profit outlook on Monday from Illumina Inc, whose shares were down 12.4 percent on Tuesday, analysts said.Also issuing disappointing news was Exact Sciences. The company's shares dropped 46 percent to $10.05 after it received a surprise negative reimbursement decision on its colon cancer test, Cologuard. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was off 4.4 percent.

10,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Gene sequencing company Illumina Inc is going after the next big advance in cancer detection, working to develop a universal blood test to identify early-stage cancers in people with no symptoms of the disease.On Sunday, San Diego-based Illumina said it would form a new company, called Grail, with more than $100 million in Series A financing. Illumina will be the majority owner. Key investors include ARCH Venture Partners, Sutter Hill Ventures and Bezos Expeditions, the venture investment fund of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.Grail's test will use Illumina's DNA sequencing technology to scan for bits of cancer genes originating in tumors and circulating in the bloodstream. The hope is to detect many types of newly forming cancers, which could be treated at an earlier stage to increase the chances of survival.Cowen & Co estimates that use of DNA blood tests for cancer screening will exceed $10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Several companies are developing liquid biopsies, mostly for use with patients already diagnosed with cancer.Experts say it will take huge clinical trials to provide the kind of evidence necessary to make DNA blood tests part of routine cancer screening. Direct-to-consumer testing company Pathway Genomics last year launched a DNA blood test for healthy people without having conducted such trials. Illumina, a much bigger player, intends to provide that evidence. Illumina Chief Executive Jay Flatley, who will serve as chairman of Grail, said work on the new test began some 18 months ago.""We've made tremendous progress, which gives us the confidence that we can get to the endpoint that we expect,"" Flatley said in an interview. He believes it will take at least an additional year of research and development to refine the test. Grail will then conduct clinical trials of the test on as many as 300,000 human genomes, which could take another two years.         Illumina aims to have its test on the market by 2019 and hopes the cost of DNA sequencing will have dropped enough to price the cancer screening test around $500 each, low enough to make it widely accessible, Flatley said.PiperJaffray analysts estimated that as many as 38 companies are developing cancer blood tests using DNA sequencing, but most of these so-called ""liquid biopsies"" use the tests in patients already diagnosed with cancer to see how they are responding to treatment or to check for mutations or drug resistance. Critics said there is not enough evidence yet that a blood test can screen for cancer in healthy people. Pathway Genomics' screening test claiming to detect 10 cancers in healthy people drew the ire of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year, which sent the company a letter saying the test ""had not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health.""Flatley said Grail will consult early on with the FDA to see what evidence the agency needs for the test and will likely seek its approval. He said the company has not yet decided whether the test will be offered directly to consumers, but it is possible. Illumina's investment will result in a hit to earnings, but Flatley would not say how much at this point. ""The actual economics of Grail will be fully disclosed in our financials,"" he said.
