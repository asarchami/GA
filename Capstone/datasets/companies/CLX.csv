0,"  Feb 4 Clorox Co, known for its namesake bleach, posted a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday, hurt by rising commodity and manufacturing costs, and the company lowered its full-year sales and profit forecasts for the second quarter in a row.     Clorox earned $115 million, or $0.87 per share, in the fiscal second quarter that ended Dec. 31, down from $123 million, or $0.94 per share a year earlier. Including only continuing operations, it posted a profit of 88 cents per share.     Sales edged up 0.4 percent to $1.33 billion. Overall sales volume rose 1 percent.     Clorox lowered its sales forecast for the fiscal year by one percentage point and now expects growth 1 percent to 2 percent for the year.      It also lowered its profit forecast for the year by 5 cents per share to $4.45 to $4.60, citing the devaluation of the Argentine peso, sluggish growth in some categories and higher commodity costs.     Shares were down 1 percent in premarket trading.

1,"   By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Major U.S. companies including Clorox and Kraft are favoring more bonds in the mix for their employees' defined benefit pension plans, even amid signs the three-decade bull run in bonds is on its last legs.The $2.5 trillion U.S. corporate pension market enjoyed a robust recovery in 2013, paced by stocks, as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose the most since 1997. That helped pension funds close a funding hole that opened after the global credit crisis of 2008, so that the average corporate pension was funded at about 95 percent at the end of 2013, compared with 75 percent at the end of 2012, Mercer Investments data show.Now that they're more confident that they have the money to meet their pension obligations, corporate pension managers are pulling back from the perceived risk of the stock market and buying U.S. government and corporate bonds, even though many expect bond prices to fall in coming years.""Even if interest rates rise more than the market predicts, you do get the income component that offsets the price loss of those bonds,"" said Gary Veerman, managing director of U.S. Client Solutions Group at BlackRock in New York, which has $4.4 trillion under management, of which two-thirds are retirement-related assets. Veerman's group advises corporate treasurers how to manage their pensions.The allocation to bonds by the top 100 publicly-listed U.S. companies in their defined benefit pension plans increased to a median of 39.6 percent in 2013 from 35.9 percent in 2010. Stock allocation in the plans fell to 40.9 percent in 2013 from 44.6 percent in 2010, according to global consulting firm Milliman.""Now they're in a position to say: 'I don't need all those equities because my funding status is in the mid- to low-90s,'"" said Dan Tremblay, director of institutional fixed-income solutions at Fidelity unit Pyramis in Merrimack, New Hampshire, which manages more than $200 billion.Because many defined benefit plans are closed to new workers, managers are more concerned with having a steady stream of income every year to meet their annual payout than generating an above average market return or even meet the historical 6% - 8% returns on equities. Retirement plans offered to new workers are mainly 401(k) plans in which the worker is responsible for making investment allocation decisions.Federal Reserve data show private pensions began reducing risk in the second half of 2013, shedding $11.3 billion in stocks and loading up on more than $100 billion in Treasuries, agency debt and corporate bonds. Tremblay believes this trend could last for a decade. COLLECTIVE DEFICIT The collective pension deficit for 1,500 U.S. companies fell to $103 billion at the end of 2013, down from a record of $689 billion in July 2012, based on data from consulting firm Mercer.By shifting to bonds, pension funds help preserve their funding levels even if stocks plunge. The move is a product of increased reliance on liability-driven investing (LDI), which focuses on matching investments with liability needs rather than beating an index.""It makes sense to de-risk it,"" said Andy Catalan, managing director and head of liability-driven investing strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management in Boston. ""Get out of risky assets, get into fixed income, have the assets and liabilities move in tandem, effectively removing that volatility."" Standish relies on LDI strategies for more than $13 billion of the more than $160 billion in bond assets it manages for clients.By the end of last year, 19 U.S. companies of the 100 Milliman studied had bond allocations of 50 percent and higher, compared with 10 in 2010. TRW Automotive Holdings Corp TRW.N, which has a $7 billion pension plan, had the highest at 73.5 percent.One LDI strategy involves exiting assets such as equities and buying long-dated bonds, even if the market environment makes this seem counterintuitive. For Clorox Corp (CLX.N), embracing LDI amid signs rates may rise wasn't easy.""We did this over time,"" said Chip Conradi, treasurer at Clorox in Oakland, California, at a webcast in March. ""Ultimately, it got to a point where the Clorox pension committee was comfortable with it. They accepted the notion of a glide path ... which would take emotion out of the decision."" Kraft Foods Group Inc. KRFT.O said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters it is aiming for 80 percent bond exposure in its $7 billion pension plan, up from 43 percent in late 2013, to be phased in over the next several years. The strategy is to first fill the fund with enough money to meet future obligations, and then try to make sure another big hole doesn't open up as a result of a tumble by equities.DISMAL 2013 FOR BONDS Loading up on bonds is not without risks. It has been a growing view that bonds might already be at the start of a prolonged slump after a 30-year run of steady returns, marked by record low yields set in 2012.While stocks soared last year, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index lost 2 percent, the third-worst year in four decades. Historically, though, bonds have stood out even when the Federal Reserve raises short-term rates. From 2004 to 2006, when the central bank lifted rates by 4 percentage points, bonds produced an average return of 3.7 percent, according to Barclays.So far in 2014, the Barclays index is up 1.71 percent. Even if rates rise, treasurers can still see a benefit as long as the higher-yielding bonds the plans own produce more income than what is lost from the drop in price.""It's an opportunistic time for plans to be moving down the de-risking glide path,"" said BlackRock's Veerman. ""You are taking the largest risk in your portfolio off the table.""(Reporting by Richard Leong and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss.

25,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to The  Clorox Company's (Clorox) $500 million 10-year senior unsecured notes to be  issued today. Proceeds will be used mainly to repay all or a portion of the  outstanding $575 million 5% notes due in January 2015.   The notes will be issued under the fourth supplement to the October 2007  Indenture. They contain the customary provision of a change of control  triggering event if approximately 50% of Clorox's ownership changes or  substantially all of its assets are transferred and ratings fall below  investment grade. If those conditions are met, the company must make an offer to  repurchase the notes at 101% plus accrued interest. KEY RATING DRIVERS: Consistent Performance: The Clorox Company's focused strategy of having branded  products with large or leading market shares in midsized categories results in a  very stable operating performance. The company's financial performance has been  consistent for more than seven years. EBITDA has shown little variance at  approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion and is likely to remain in historical  ranges.  Moderate Leverage: Clorox's commitment to operating with leverage of 2.0x-2.5x  is a key support to its rating. The company has been at the low end of its  target for much of the past three years and ended at 1.9x at the last 12 months  ended Sept. 30, 2014. A stable business model and solid free cash flow (FCF)  generation provide the flexibility to invest in its operations and comfortably  execute moderate discretionary activities within its leverage target. There is  room for up to $700 million in additional debt with limited impact to its  ratings as long as the current operating profile remains.  Intermittent Input Cost Pressures: Commodities used in the manufacturing process  such as resin can experience periods of price volatility, and pressure margins.  Clorox's leadership position has allowed it to adjust prices quickly, and  ongoing cost-savings programs have offset some inflationary pressures.  Therefore, margin compression has typically been short-term in nature.  Mature Categories: Clorox's categories span the gamut from household cleaning  products to charcoal briquettes and food. However, given the company's primarily  domestic orientation and high household penetration, volume increases have  averaged 1%, with much of the company's organic growth rate of approximately 4%  driven by pricing initiatives. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Management Actions Are Likely Driver: The company has the financial flexibility  to manage its credit metrics at higher levels given stable cash flows. Operating  with leverage of less than 2.0x and demonstrating a commitment to staying within  that band while maintaining its current business momentum would support upward  migration of Clorox's rating. Clorox is currently operating at these levels;  however, the company is likely to do bolt-on acquisitions and take other  shareholder-friendly measures such that operating with leverage under 2.0x is  not likely to be sustained over the medium term. Downward migration is likely to be triggered by a change in financial strategy  to operate with higher leverage or completing a large debt-financed share  buyback or acquisition. None of these actions are expected as Clorox has proven  to be very disciplined as well as committed to maintaining strong ratings.  Fitch currently rates Clorox as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --$1.1 billion revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured Notes at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper program at 'F2'.

26,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings affirms The Clorox Company's  (Clorox) ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --$1.1 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper (CP) program at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  Clorox's RCF, $50 million of outstanding CP at Sept. 30, 2014 and approximately  $2.2 billion in unsecured senior notes, is affected by this action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Business Risk:  The Clorox Company's focused strategy of having branded products with large or  leading market shares in midsized categories results in a very stable operating  performance. Financial performance has been consistent for more than seven years  with EBITDA showing little variance at approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3  billion.  Fitch expects EBITDA to remain in its historical ranges.  SG&A to  sales is consistently in the 14% range, an efficient metric in the sector.   Moderate Leverage:  Clorox's commitment to operating with leverage of 2.0x-2.5x is a key support to  its rating. The company has been at the low end of its target for much of the  past three years and ended at 1.9x at the last 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2014.  Clorox's free cash flow (FCF) has averaged $200 million over the past four years  and Fitch expects it to remain in this range over the next two years.  A stable  business model and solid FCF generation provide the flexibility to invest in its  operations and comfortably execute moderate discretionary activities within its  leverage target. There is room for up to $700 million in additional debt with  limited impact to its ratings as long as the current operating profile remains. Intermittent Input Cost Pressures:  Commodities used in the manufacturing process such as resin can experience  periods of price volatility, and pressure margins. Clorox's leadership position  has allowed it to adjust prices quickly and, in combination with ongoing  cost-savings programs, margin compression has typically been short-term in  nature.  Given the marked decline in the price of oil of late, Fitch would  expect the cost of oil-related commodities such as diesel fuel to become a  tailwind to margins in the near term. Mature Categories:  Clorox's categories span the gamut from household cleaning products such as  Tilex to Kingsford charcoal briquettes and Hidden Valley ranch salad dressings.  However, given the company's primarily domestic orientation and high household  penetration, organic growth rates over the past four years have been less than  3% with about one-third driven by pricing initiatives.  Strong Financial Flexibility:    The company has $1.45 billion in liquidity, comprising primarily its $1.1  billion RCF which matures in 2019 and $455 million in cash at Sept. 30, 2014.   Over the past three fiscal years approximately 50% of the company's cash  balances were held by non-U.S.-dollar functional currency subsidiaries and the  repatriation of some of these cash balances could result in additional tax  costs.  As such, Fitch views roughly half of Clorox's cash as restricted.   Clorox issued a $500 million note in December 2014 to refinance a $575 million  note due in January 2015.  Excluding this, debt maturities are moderate with a  $300 million, 3.55% note due in November 2015 and a $400 million, 5.95% note due  in October 2017.  These are likely to be refinanced to maintain the company's  capital structure.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: The company has the financial flexibility to manage its credit metrics at higher  levels given stable cash flows. Operating with leverage of less than 2x and  management's commitment to staying within that band while maintaining its  current business momentum would support upward migration of Clorox's rating.  Clorox is currently operating at these levels; however, the company is likely to  do bolt-on acquisitions and take other shareholder-friendly measures such that  operating with leverage under 2x is not likely to be sustained over the medium  term.   Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: Downward migration is likely to be triggered by a change in financial strategy  to consistently operate with leverage of more than 2.5x.  This could occur with  a large debt-financed share buyback.  A large acquisition could also result in  pro forma leverage well above these levels.  However, if the company has clear  and achievable plans to return to pre-acquisition credit protection measures  within an 18-24-month timeframe there could be minimal impact to ratings. None  of these actions are expected, since Clorox has proven to be very disciplined as  well as committed to maintaining strong ratings.  Additionally, meaningful market share losses in two or more of the Glad, bleach  or Kingsford charcoal categories, which collectively represent more than 30% of  revenues, would be of concern.

27,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed and withdrawn the  following ratings for The Clorox Company (Clorox):  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --$1.1 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper (CP) program at 'F2'. Fitch has withdrawn Clorox's ratings for commercial reasons. Fitch reserves the  right in its sole discretion to withdraw or maintain any rating at any time for  any reason it deems sufficient.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Moderate Leverage:  Clorox's commitment to operating with leverage of 2.0x-2.5x is a key support for  its ratings. The company has been below the low end of its target in each of the  past three years and ended at 1.8x at the last 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2015.  The company has a strong cushion for discretionary activities within its  publicly stated leverage targets.  Stable Operations: The company is lean and efficient with selling and administration to sales  steady at 14%. This is one of the best metrics in the sector. EBITDA has seen  little variance at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion over the past five years with  EBITDA margins improving modestly each year from 20% to 22%.  Intermittent Input Cost Pressures:  Commodities used in the manufacturing process such as resin can experience  periods of price volatility and pressure margins. Clorox's leadership position  has allowed it to adjust prices quickly, and, in combination with ongoing  cost-savings programs, margin compression has typically been short-term in  nature.  Mature Categories:  Clorox's categories span the gamut from household cleaning products such as  Tilex to Kingsford charcoal briquettes and Hidden Valley ranch salad dressings.  However, given the company's primarily domestic orientation and high household  penetration, organic growth rates averaged around 3% over the past five years  mainly driven by pricing initiatives. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Organic top line growth of 2% annually;  --SG&A/Sales remaining in the 14% range; --Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures less  dividends in the $300 million range; --Leverage at or below 2.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating withdrawals. LIQUIDITY The company has $1.4 billion in liquidity, comprising primarily its $1.1 billion  RCF which matures in 2019 and nearly $400 million in cash at Sept. 30, 2015. The  company has $2.2 billion in debt. Maturities are modest with only one note  coming due in the next five years - a $400 million, 5.95% note due in October  2017.  Clorox's free cash flow has averaged $290 million over the past three years, and  Fitch expects it to remain in this range for the fiscal year ending June 2016.
