0,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Florida, Indiana and other U.S. states are reviewing food distributor Sysco Corp's proposed deal to buy rival US Foods Inc, offices of state attorneys general said on Thursday.Sysco said in December that it would buy US Foods for about $3.5 billion from its private equity owners in a deal that would combine the two largest U.S. food distributors and create a company commanding at least a quarter of the $235 billion North American market.""We are a member of the multistate group that is currently reviewing this merger in coordination with federal agencies,"" the Florida attorney general's office said in a statement. A spokesman declined further comment. Indiana said it was also looking at the deal.""We are aware of the merger and are working with other states as we examine the potential impact in Indiana,"" said Bryan Corbin, a spokesman for the Indiana attorney general's office. The state attorneys general will work with either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, both of which review proposed mergers, to ensure the deal complies with antitrust law. The agencies can decide to approve a transaction, file a lawsuit to stop it or require companies to sell assets to win approval.Sysco, with annual revenue of about $44 billion, is the largest operator in the U.S. food distribution business, with US Foods in the No. 2 spot. Both companies distribute foods to restaurants, hotels, hospitals, schools and other institutions.US Foods and Sysco both said they had no comment.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Peter Cooney and Steve Orlofsky)",2014-01-16,SYY,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 5:16pm EST","Exclusive: Florida, Indiana, others probing Sysco, US Foods deal",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usfoods-sysco-antitrust-exclusive-idUSBREA0F1Q720140116?type=companyNews
1,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The antitrust battle over whether food giant Sysco Corp (SYY.N) will be allowed to buy rival US Foods Inc USFOO.UL will likely focus on whether the merger will drive up costs for thousands of restaurants, hospitals and hotels that they supply on nationwide contracts.The Federal Trade Commission will examine Sysco's $3.5 billion deal to buy debt-ridden US Foods from private equity, which was announced in December and would combine the only two food suppliers with a nationwide reach.While the review is in early stages, the mega-merger has already rattled customers who rely on the companies for everything from pre-scrambled eggs for school meals to truffle mousse desserts for high-end restaurants.One source said some restaurants and school districts have begun to discuss how to oppose it, and hospital food providers are ""buzzing"" about the proposed transaction, according to a second source.The main concern is that national buying groups that negotiate for perhaps hundreds of hospitals or hotels will no longer be able to play Sysco and US Foods off against each other to get the best contracts for their members.""If there's a problem here, it's in the national market place,"" said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel of the U.S. Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. ""There is a potential for a problem even if the (overall) market share isn't that large.""Bloom also said a national-level problem could be fixed if the companies agreed to sell off enough warehouses, food distribution centers or other assets to build a regional competitor up into a national competitor.Restaurants, schools, hospitals and hotels spend $223 billion annually buying food and other products to serve meals for their customers, according to industry data experts Technomic.Sysco is by far the biggest food distributor, with revenues of $39 billion in 2012. US Foods, the only other company with nationwide reach, is No. 2, with $21 billion in revenue. Following the giants are Performance Food Group ($12 billion in revenues); Reinhart Foodservice ($6 billion) and Gordon Food Service Inc at $5 billion, according to consulting firm Technomic. The FTC will approve the merger if it complies with antitrust law, but can try to stop it or require asset sales if it would severely damage competition or drive up costs.The agency held meetings with regional competitors, including Performance Food Group, on Thursday and Friday of this week, according to a source, who was not authorized to speak on the record.In addition, the Florida and Indiana attorneys general have acknowledged that they are part of a ""multi-state group"" reviewing the deal. There are 11 attorneys general in the group, the source said.John Briggs, an antitrust expert with Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider, said the deal could live or die depending on what national customers tell officials about the likely price effect on them. ""I think there's a chance that the deal won't happen,"" Briggs said. GROWING MARGIN Sysco defends the merger as efficient and good for customers. ""Sysco operates in a highly competitive and fragmented space,"" the company said in a statement this week.

US Foods would receive $300 million in a termination fee if the deal is scrapped.Diana Moss, an antitrust expert who teaches economics at the University of Colorado, said it's hard to see how divestitures would resolve this deal's problems.""I'd be skeptical that the way the market is structured, that they could easily pull that off,"" said Moss, who believes that the deal should be stopped.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Karey Van Hall and Tom Brown)",2014-01-31,SYY,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 4:54pm EST","Sticker shock key to antitrust approval for Sysco, US Foods deal",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usfoods-sysco-antitrust-idUSBREA0U1UA20140131?type=companyNews

4,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 21 The Dutch retailer Ahold  on Wednesday agreed to pay $297 million to settle U.S. class-action litigation accusing its former U.S. Foodservice distribution unit of defrauding thousands of hospitals and restaurants through overcharges.Ahold said it will take a 215 million euro charge in the first quarter for the settlement in principle, which requires approval by U.S. District Judge Alvin Thompson in Hartford, Connecticut.It remained liable even after selling U.S. Foodservice, now known as U.S. Foods, in 2007 to a group led by private equity firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The settlement came after the U.S. Supreme Court on April 28 refused to hear U.S. Foods' appeal of the class action, which covered about 75,000 customers. U.S. Foods is based in Rosemont, Illinois and employs about 25,000 people. Sysco Corp agreed in December to buy the company for $3.5 billion, combining the two largest U.S. food distributors.According to the lawsuit, U.S. Foodservice used shell companies, sham transactions and phony invoices to inflate prices it charged ""cost-plus"" customers from 1998 to 2005.With Ahold's approval, the shell companies pretended to buy and then resell food to U.S. Foodservice at a higher ""invoice cost,"" which would be passed on to customers, the lawsuit said. Richard Wyatt, a Hunton & Williams partner representing the plaintiffs, said he believes the settlement is among the largest to resolve civil racketeering claims under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.He called the settlement ""eminently fair"" and believes it represents ""a very high percentage of the improper overcharges."" Lodewijk Hijmans van den Bergh, Ahold's chief corporate governance counsel, in a statement said the accord lets the company avoid further costly and time-consuming litigation.In Sept. 2010, U.S. Foodservice agreed to pay $30 million to settle U.S. Department of Justice accusations that it overbilled on government contracts. The company denied wrongdoing.Ahold's U.S. brands include Giant supermarkets in mid-Atlantic states, Stop & Shop supermarkets in northeast states, and the online grocery delivery service Peapod.The case is In re: US Foodservice Inc Pricing Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 07-md-01894.

11,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Food distributor Sysco Corp (SYY.N), fighting to complete a merger with US Foods Inc [USFOO.UL], is attempting to craft a package of potential asset sales weighty enough to convince U.S. antitrust regulators to approve the deal.The proposed tie-up is seen as problematic because Sysco and US Foods are the only companies with the geographic reach to offer nationwide contracts to deliver a wide range of goods to customers ranging from hotel chains to fast food restaurants.Sysco and US Foods, which is owned by private equity companies including KKR & Co (KKR.N), announced the $3.5 billion deal in December.The Federal Trade Commission, which can approve the deal or file a lawsuit to stop it, remains concerned about the loss of the only national competitor to Sysco, according to two sources with knowledge of the commission's viewpoint. Three big regional players, Reinhart Foodservice, Performance Food Group and Gordon Food Service, have been negotiating with Sysco to buy certain divested assets.Sysco is the biggest food distributor and US Foods is No. 2.  Performance, Reinhart and Gordon are major regional players, but each is concentrated on the eastern United States, leaving a wide swath of the west less covered. None of them serves Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington state, Utah or Wyoming, according to the companies' web sites.The FTC is waiting to see what kind of asset sales Sysco and US Foods can put together to overcome ""serious concerns,"" said one person familiar with the regulators' thinking.Three others familiar with the FTC's thinking said no decision had been made on whether a lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal would be filed. All four asked not to be named since they did not have authorization to speak on the record. An official for one of the handful of big, nationwide customers said his company generally preferred national contracts but could work with regional contracts if needed.""The FTC, ultimately what they're focusing on is the impact on the consumer and I think one of the main things that they're looking at is alternatives on a national level,"" said the official, who asked that he and his company not be named because of business sensitivities.The official said that his company had been offered a chance to oppose the proposed deal but had not done so.

24,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Dec 24 The proposed merger of Sysco Corp and US Foods Inc hinges on the top two U.S. food companies helping to turn a far smaller rival into a national player to ease antitrust concerns, but the gap may be too big, analysts said.Sysco and US Foods, the only two companies with national distribution to hospitals, restaurants and schools, have been discussing the sale of assets such as distribution centers to No. 3 Performance Food Group. Many of those centers are in the western United States, where Performance has little or no presence.The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing the $3.5 billion deal announced one year ago.But non-geographic gaps cannot be addressed through the divestitures, antitrust experts said. Sysco offers about 400,000 different food service items, and US Foods has 350,000, while PFG has 150,000, according to data  provided by the companies.""That seems like a big discrepancy,"" said Andre Barlow of Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, pointing to the companies' products, itemized as stock keeping units (SKUs). ""If you want to restore that lost competition, you want someone to also provide those SKUs.""The gap in product offerings makes a major difference to restaurant managers and chefs. Brenda Langton, a co-owner of Spoonriver restaurant in Minneapolis, would prefer to work with a smaller supplier but uses US Foods because only the two largest ones have the particular tuna needed for her menu.""Basically this is not a company that I would even choose to do business with, but they're the only ones that carry some products that I need in restaurant sizes,"" said Langton. Carl Hittinger, an antitrust expert with the law firm Baker Hostetler, said the product gap would likely be a concern for FTC as it considers whether the deal preserves choice for consumers.""They will take this seriously,"" he said.Some food industry experts said Performance Foods could still ramp up its product offerings, and has done so in the past. ""If it's an available item, a powerful enough customer can pull the product through the system,"" said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of the consulting firm Technomic. ""It's all about leverage.""Sysco and Performance Food Group declined to comment. Sysco executives have said in investor calls that it is trying to reduce the number of items it stocks to reduce duplications and be more efficient.

In extensive talks with the FTC, Sysco said it has argued the deal would benefit customers.""Unfortunately, the FTC has taken a different view of the potential competitive impacts of the merger,"" Sysco Chief Executive Bill DeLaney said in a statement. ""We believe this divestiture package fully addresses its concerns.""Company executives and the five FTC commissioners are to meet this week and next to discuss Sysco's divestiture offer. ""If there's one thing that the FTC and we do agree on is that it's time to move this process forward,"" Delaney said in a conference call with industry analysts.The distribution centers offered to Performance Group generated $4.6 billion in revenue in US Foods' latest fiscal year, Sysco said.The facilities include three in California - Corona, San Francisco and San Diego - as well as centers in Denver, Kansas City, Kansas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Cleveland, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. Performance Food Group is owned by investment firm Blackstone Group LP.Sysco also reported on Monday a 7.5 percent rise in quarterly sales to $12.1 billion, above estimates.Sysco's net income fell 25 percent to $158 million, or 27 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 27, due to higher dairy and meat prices.Excluding items, the company earned 41 cents per share, in line with Wall Street estimates. Analysts had expected revenue of $11.93 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's share price had risen 14 percent since it announced the deal in December 2013 through last Friday's close. The shares were down 2.5 percent at $38.19 on Monday.

57,"   By Diane Bartz  Lawyers for Sysco Corp and the U.S. government argued on Tuesday over whether the largest U.S. food distributor should be allowed to merge with its No. 2 rival, with the two sides relying heavily on confidential information to make their case. In opening arguments by Sysco's Richard Parker of O'Melveny & Myers and the FTC's Stephen Weissman, the two sides disagreed on whether there was a national market for food distribution, whether ""broadline companies"" selling a wide range of goods constitute a separate market, and whether a long list of local markets were competitive.

59,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Food distributor Sysco Corp said on Friday that a record U.S. outbreak of avian flu would limit its chicken and egg supply for nine to 18 months, based on information provided to the company by its suppliers.Sysco is the biggest U.S. food distributor, whose clients include restaurants, hotels and hospitals. The company is discussing options with its customers, including creating alternative menu items during the period, a Sysco spokesman said in an email. It is too soon to tell whether the supply squeeze will have a material impact on financial results, spokesman Charley Wilson said. Poultry accounted for 10 percent of Sysco's revenue in 2014, according to filings. The U.S. poultry and egg industry is grappling with the country's biggest outbreak on record of avian influenza, which has proven highly infectious and deadly for poultry. Governors in Nebraska, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa have declared a state of emergency, and the outbreak has shown few signs of waning. Earlier this week, Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] said it has implemented increased biosecurity measures at its facilities receiving liquid egg tankers and shell eggs from impacted states and that it is working with egg suppliers to ensure they are employing measures to prevent spread of the flu.  Meanwhile, on Thursday, Post Holdings Inc, calling the flu a ""force majeure event,"" said it now estimates that 25 percent of its egg supply has been affected. Sysco is a major customer for Post's Michael Foods business, which sells egg products, according to filings. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher Growe expects Post's previous estimate of a $20 million financial impact in 2015 to at least double, according to a research note.  Growe said that Post's contracts require the company to go to the open market and to third parties to replace the lost supply at high prices. ""We believe that by declaring force majeure, the company will be able to either pass higher prices onto customers or be relieved from the mandatory supply requirements,"" he wrote.

60,"   By Diane Bartz and Greg Roumeliotis | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Sysco Corp (SYY.N) will be left with a bill of around $1 billion if the U.S. government kills its $3.5 billion merger with US Foods, regulatory filings show, underscoring the perils of doing deals that have a good chance of being blocked by antitrust regulators.    Sysco, the biggest U.S. food distributor, has spent more than $400 million so far on a combination of integration planning, financing charges and on defending the transaction in court, based on a Reuters analysis of its filings. To put that into context, Sysco's net profit for its fiscal year ended June 28, 2014 was $932 million.    If the Federal Trade Commission, which filed a lawsuit to block the merger in February, eventually has its way, Sysco will have to pay US Foods, its No. 2 rival, $300 million as a termination fee. Separately, up to $25 million would go to Performance Food Group, which has agreed to buy assets to be divested as part of the Sysco-US Foods deal.    Furthermore, if the deal does not close by Oct. 8 or is terminated by then, Sysco would likely incur another $265 million in losses, which includes the cost of redeeming $5 billion in bonds set to be used for the acquisition, as well as associated financing costs that have not been booked yet on its balance sheet, filings show.    Even a successful deal would come at a hefty price, as prolonged delays led to higher financing charges and legal advisory fees to fight the government in court. The company had forecast it would close the transaction in the third quarter of 2014 when it announced the deal in December 2013.    Arguments between the FTC and Sysco on whether the deal is legal will conclude with closing arguments on May 28.

In fiscal 2015, the company's operating profit was $1.2 billion. “What we’re looking to do is grow our cases and to accelerate our case growth with the locally managed customers we have.”Sysco said an estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of the operating income growth will come from reducing administrative costs. Sysco has already eliminated about $700 million in annual costs over the past three years. “Now what we need to do is go in a little more surgically and kind of look at all of our processes and all of our work streams and identify more,” he said.In August, Sysco said it added activist investor Nelson Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management, and Josh Frank, a Trian partner, to its board. Trian disclosed a 7 percent stake in Sysco earlier in the month, becoming its largest shareholder.  The move represented the latest instance of an activist taking a stake in a U.S. food company. In August, billionaire investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund disclosed that it spent $5.5 billion for a 7.5 percent stake in Mondelez International Inc in what was seen by Wall Street as an attempt to push the company to increase its margins further or potentially sell itself. In July, ConAgra Foods Inc agreed to add two members to its board as part of an agreement with Jana Partners after the hedge fund disclosed a 7.2 percent stake in the company.DeLaney said that giving Trian two board seats was ""the right decision"" given the size of its stake. Industry watchers expect Trian’s presence on the board to increase Sysco’s focus on reducing expenses. “Obviously, they’re a big shareholder, and they’re on our board, so we’re certainly going to listen to all of that,” DeLaney said. “We need to take costs out, but one of the things we’ve learned over the years is if you do it the wrong way or if you do it before you’re really ready to execute it well, there can be ramifications on the customer side, which you don’t want to have.

In August, billionaire investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund disclosed that it spent $5.5 billion for a 7.5 percent stake in Mondelez International Inc in what was seen by Wall Street as an attempt to push the company to increase its margins further or potentially sell itself. In July, ConAgra Foods Inc agreed to add two members to its board as part of an agreement with Jana Partners after the hedge fund disclosed a 7.2 percent stake in the company.DeLaney said that giving Trian two board seats was ""the right decision"" given the size of its stake. Industry watchers expect Trian's presence on the board to increase Sysco's focus on reducing expenses.""Obviously, they're a big shareholder, and they're on our board, so we're certainly going to listen to all of that,"" DeLaney said. ""We need to take costs out, but one of the things we've learned over the years is if you do it the wrong way or if you do it before you're really ready to execute it well, there can be ramifications on the customer side, which you don't want to have. It just needs to be executed well.""

82,"   By Michael Flaherty and Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Early in August, a call came into Sysco Corp (SYY.N) from Trian Fund Management LP, warning the food distributor that the activist hedge fund was about to disclose a large stake in the company.Trian, run by veteran investor Nelson Peltz, unveiled its 7.1 stake in Sysco on Aug. 14, and asked for board representation and for the Houston-based company to improve its profitability and return money to shareholders.    Six days later, Sysco awarded two board seats to Trian. For Sysco, it was better to reach a quick agreement than risk a drawn-out battle, a sentiment increasingly felt across Corporate America. ""That's a significant amount of shares (owned by Trian), and we're at a key point in the business right now, and really, they have a history of bringing value to corporations,"" said Sysco Chief Executive Bill DeLaney in an interview, recounting the Trian approach to Reuters. ""We didn't want to have a lot of disruption and a lot of uncertainty in the business.""In the case of Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.N), Carl Icahn needed just 18 days to clinch a deal for two board seats after the activist bought 8.2 percent of the liquefied natural gas company in August. ConAgra Foods Inc agreed to a board settlement with Jana Partners in July, three weeks after the activist investor scooped up shares of the processed food company.While not all companies are as quick to cut a deal as Sysco and Cheniere, data reviewed by Reuters shows that corporate management teams are reaching agreements with activists at the fastest pace since the financial crisis.The average number of days it takes companies to reach a settlement with activists threatening a proxy contest from the time of disclosure is 56, according to media and research firm Activist Insight, down from 83 days in 2010 - the furthest back the firm's data on the subject goes.The quickening pace of activist settlements shows how dissident shareholders are reshaping the way chief executives manage their businesses and their boardrooms. Backed by powerful institutional investors, activists are moving from outside agitators to influential insiders.    Some investors worry that companies are bowing to activists' demands too easily, to the detriment of their long-term shareholders' interests.""Boards have become quick on the trigger to grant seats to activist investors just to avoid a proxy fight,"" said Scott Stringer, New York City's Comptroller, who called the trend ""disturbing.""When decisions are made before shareowners can weigh in with a vote, ""companies run the risk of prioritizing short-term expediency at the expense of long-term value,"" said Stringer, who runs the $165.5 billion New York City Employees’ Retirement System.      SELF-EXAMINATION Activists typically acquire chunks of companies, and then push the company's management team to make changes to boost shares, such as buying back stock, selling poorly performing units, or restructuring the business. The most effective way for an activist to effect change is by being on the board of directors.Companies previously could depend on large institutional investors, such as pension and mutual funds, to back their management teams in the event of a proxy fight. That guarantee has steadily faded.According to Proxy Insight, the percentage of dissident proxy cards that BlackRock, T.Rowe Price and Vanguard have voted to support - meaning they supported at least one dissident board candidate - has increased every year since 2011. For T. Rowe Price, the percentage has doubled to 50 percent, the Proxy Insight data show. Last October, activist Starboard Value LP won an standoff with Darden Restaurants Inc, convincing shareholders to replace the entire board of the Olive Garden parent – with BlackRock and State Street voting in support of the dissident slate. Darden shares have jumped 36 percent since the board's ouster. Advisors to companies on activist situations say that, while some settlements may look fast based on when activists go public with their stake, some occur after lengthy, behind-the-scenes discussions with companies and their other shareholders. These advisors also concede that executives will still fight if necessary, especially against smaller upstart funds that have less clout.In the case of Sysco, the company was up against a board nomination deadline and one of its industry's most venerable investors. Peltz has agitated at several food and beverage companies. He was instrumental, for example, in carving out snacks maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) from Kraft Foods Inc in 2011.Sysco unveiled last week a three-year plan to achieve at least $400 million in annual operating income growth through efficiencies and cost cuts. It said it was working on the plan before Trian showed up.""I think companies are starting to conduct a type of self-examination when they receive a phone call or letter from an activist,"" said Francis Byrd, an independent corporate governance consultant in New York. ""Where companies are doing their homework, they will say, 'maybe these folks might have a point'"".  DISRUPTIVE BATTLES  When chemical conglomerate DuPont (DD.N) won its proxy fight against Trian in May, its victory was seen as a potential blow to activists that could embolden more boards to fight dissidents to the bitter end. But 2015 has been marked more by truces than battles.One reason is the increasing aversion toward a proxy fight.A study published last month by professors at the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs Business School referred to research that said the average cost of a proxy fight for both sides is around $10.7 million. DuPont, which spent $15 million to fight Trian, has seen its stock drop 33 percent since the May win, shedding almost $21 billion in market value.For furniture company Ethan Allen, which is under siege by Sandell Asset Management, such a proxy cost is more significant. If the $824 million company spends the average amount of money to fight Sandell, it would equal about one-third of Ethan Allen’s free cash flow, according to Thomson Reuters data. Beyond the price tag, companies are seeking to avoid the distraction of an activist campaign that gets nasty.Activists are also becoming more successful in winning the support of other shareholders, such as mutual, index and pension funds, which in turn are putting pressure on companies to settle. For their part, companies no longer see giving one or two seats to an activist as particularly dilutive to their board. Peltz, for example, is known for his food industry expertise and for working closely with management teams rather than against them.While every proxy fight is different, the overall odds are not favorable to companies itching to fight, and this can also make them reluctant to participate in a protracted dispute. In proxy fights where board seats were sought at U.S. corporations, the dissident shareholders' success rate rose to 73.1 percent last year, compared to less than half in 2012, according to data from research firm FactSet.""What would happen in the past, the board would say, 'thanks-but-no-thank you,'"" said Byrd.

Sysco had bid for Brakes in 2007, when Bain bought it for about $2.8 billion, but walked away at an early stage.Sysco said on Monday its latest offer for Brakes included the repayment of about $2.3 billion of Brakes's debt.Brakes put plans to list on the London Stock Exchange on hold in January due to a slump in the global stock markets, the Guardian had reported. (bit.ly/1WMIIT3) Brakes, which started as a poultry supplier in 1958, has operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Sweden, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg.The combined company is expected to generate annualized sales of about $55 billion, Sysco said.Sysco generated $806.4 million, or a little less than 2 percent, of its revenue from outside North America last year. Brakes had revenue of nearly $5 billion in fiscal 2015. Sysco said it expects the deal to close before July and immediately add to its earnings after that.Deutsche Bank Securities advised Sysco, while Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and Ernst & Young LLP acted as legal and due diligence advisers.Goldman Sachs International and Baker & McKenzie LLP were Bain Capital's and Brakes's financial and legal advisers.

90,"   By Diane Bartz and Ernest Scheyder  The U.S. Justice Department will file a lawsuit as soon as this week to stop oilfield services provider Halliburton Co from acquiring smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The antitrust lawsuit could potentially scupper the deal that was first announced in November 2014 to combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies. Since then, oil prices have fallen by more than 55 percent. Faced with opposition from the Justice Department, the companies may either cancel the planned tie-up or fight the government in court. The deal is one of several that antitrust enforcers have rejected as illegal during the recent wave of mergers of large, complex companies.Share prices for Baker Hughes closed down 5.1 percent at $39.36 Tuesday while Halliburton ended up 1.2 percent at $34.40.Halliburton and Baker Hughes both declined comment.The two sides had been discussing asset sales aimed at saving the deal, which was originally valued at $35 billion but is now valued at about $25 billion based on the decline in Halliburton shares.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings.The proposed deal also has hit headwinds in Europe, where the European Union's competition authority was concerned that the proposed merger would reduce competition and innovation in more than 30 product markets. Regulators in Australia also flagged concerns about the massive tie-up.As far back as July 2015, Reuters reported that there were concerns in the U.S. government that the merger would lead to higher prices and less innovation.The Justice Department's worry then focused on two areas. One was that the drilling technology businesses that were divested would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other was that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Baker Hughes in particular has been aggressive in developing new oilfield technologies, part of its appeal to Halliburton from the beginning. Baker Hughes developed smartphone apps to help customers in the field decide in real time how best to hydraulically fracture new wells. Furthermore, uniting Halliburton and Baker Hughes would create a dominant leader in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking.Lower oil prices had given investors hope that the companies' best path forward was together, especially as demand for their products and services evaporate as customers slashed budgets. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop a surprising number of deals in the past 18 months.The FTC stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc in 2015, and is currently in court fighting Staples' merger with Office Depot.The Justice Department, working with the Federal Communications Commission, stopped Comcast Corp from buying Time Warner Cable in 2015. It also stopped Electrolux from buying GE's appliance business and halted a merger of tuna sellers Bumble Bee and Thai Union, which owns Chicken of the Sea.The Justice Department also is reviewing two controversial insurance deals -- Aetna Inc's purchase of Humana and Anthem Inc's decision to buy Cigna Corp  -- amid concern they would reduce the number of national insurers from five to three.

92,"  (Adds US Foods statement, background)By Lauren HirschMay 25 US Foods Holding Corp, a U.S. private equity-owned food distributor, raised $1.02 billion on Wednesday in this year's second-largest U.S. initial public offering thus far, as new stock market flotations pick up pace.US Foods, which followed real estate investment trust MGM Growth Properties LLC's $1.2 billion IPO last month, has been followed closely by buyout firms because it is the first major leveraged buyout going public since stock market jitters put such debt-laden offerings on ice at the end of last year.The IPO also offers a path for US Food's private equity owners - Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC and KKR & Co LP - to sell their shares in the company after their attempted outright sale of US Foods to larger peer Sysco Corp for $8.2 billion, including debt, fell apart last year when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission moved to block it. US Foods was valued at roughly $5.1 billion in its IPO, including debt. Two more private equity-owned, albeit much smaller, companies priced their IPOs on Wednesday. Cotiviti Holdings Inc, owned by Advent International Corp raised $237.5 million, while GMS Inc, owned by AEA Investors, raised $147 million.US Foods priced 44.4 million shares at $23, within its previously indicated $21 to $24 range, the company said in a statement.The source asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. US Foods did not respond to a request for comment. For fiscal year 2016, US Foods reported about $23 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $875 million, according to its IPO prospectus. It has roughly $5 billion in debt, and it will use the IPO proceeds to pay that down.Last year, several highly indebted IPO aspirants were given the cold shoulder by investors. Grocery retailer Albertsons Cos Inc and luxury retailer Neiman Marcus delayed their IPO, while U.S. payment processing company First Data Corp downsized its IPO. When credit markets are weak, investors have concerns about a company's future ability to efficiently pay down debt. US Foods is only the third private equity backed IPO to have raised more than $1 billion since the start of 2015.Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and KKR bought US Foods from European grocery Royal Ahold NV in 2007 in a transaction valued at $7.1 billion.Based in Rosemont, Illinois, US Foods is scheduled to list its shares on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol 'USFD'.Goldman Sachs & Co, Mogan Stanley and J.P Morgan are among the underwriters for the offering.
