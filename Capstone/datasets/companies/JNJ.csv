0,"   By Bill Berkrot  An independent committee recommended a late stage trial of a cancer drug developed by Pharmacyclics Inc and Johnson & Johnson be stopped early as it became clear it helped patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) live longer, paving the way for additional approval of the medicine.The announcement of the study's early success by Pharmacyclics on Tuesday sent its shares soaring 20 percent higher and took J&J shares up by nearly 2 percent.The independent monitoring committee, upon reviewing interim results of the trial called Resonate, unanimously recommended it be stopped as ibrutinib was deemed assured of meeting both the primary goal of significantly delaying progression of the disease and the secondary goal of extending survival in patients with relapsed CLL compared with those taking GlaxoSmithKline's Azerra (ofatumumab).The committee also recommended that ibrutinib be made available to patients taking the Glaxo drug in the study. Ibrutinib was approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November to treat a rare form of blood cancer called mantle cell lymphoma under the brand name Imbruvica. But some analysts and investors were disappointed the agency did not simultaneously approve it for CLL, instead setting an approval decision date of February 28.""We believe the IDMC move to stop the study early will resonate quite profoundly with the FDA,"" Roth Capital Partners analyst Joseph Pantginis said in a research note.Ibrutinib had received the FDA's new breakthrough therapy designation given to experimental drugs deemed to be potentially important advances in treating serious diseases. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Matthew Andrews said in a note that the monitoring committee decision ""may provide FDA with additional regulatory leeway to approve Imbruvica (for CLL) before February 28.""Independent monitoring committees regularly conduct interim analyses of clinical trials and can either recommend the study continue as planned or be stopped early due to safety concerns or because data shows the study drug will clearly succeed in meeting the goals of the trial. Pharmacyclics said it has informed the FDA of the committee's recommendations, while J&J was providing the information to European health regulators.The safety of the drug in the Phase III trial of 391 patients who had failed to be helped by prior therapy was consistent with that seen in prior studies, the company said.Pharmacyclics shares were up $20.86, or 19.8 percent, at $125.92 in midday trading on Nasdaq, while J&J shares were up $1.62, or 1.7 percent at $93.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.(Additional reporting by Vrinda Manocha in Bangalore; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Stephen Powell)",2014-01-07,JNJ,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 12:52pm EST","J&J, Pharmacyclics leukemia drug improves survival in study",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pharmacyclics-cancerdrug-idUSBREA060M620140107?type=companyNews
1,"  Jan 7 Pharmacyclics Inc said its cancer drug, Imbruvica, met its main goal of increasing patients' survival without their cancer worsening in a late-stage trial.The company's stock rose 5 percent at $110.60 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq after the company said an independent safety committee recommended an early halt of the trial. The drug was being tested in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a rare form of blood cancer that primarily affects people aged 65 and older.  Pharmacyclics said it informed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the committee's recommendations, while its partner, Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen had informed the European regulators.

6,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Food and Drug Administration appears skeptical that data submitted by Johnson & Johnson proves its anticoagulant Xarelto is effective in reducing the risk of further heart problems in patients who have recently suffered a heart attack.The agency questioned the way in which J&J analyzed clinical trial data, and said there was no convincing proof the drug confers significant benefit or fills an unmet medical need, given that there are other therapies on the market.The review was posted on the FDA's website on Tuesday, two days ahead of a meeting of outside experts who will discuss the drug, also known as rivaroxaban, and recommend whether it should be approved.Xarelto is already used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms and to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with an irregular heart beat that is not caused by heart problems.Now the company is hoping it will also be approved for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), an umbrella term covering any condition brought on by a sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart, including heart attack and chest pain.Some analysts are doubtful. ""Based on our review of this material, we continue to have low expectation of approval,"" Larry Biegelsen, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a research note. However, he expects sales of the drug to rise to $1.2 billion in 2015 from an estimated $703 million in 2013 based on the indications for which it is approved.""We expect the ACS potential to be modest even if approved,"" he said.J&J originally filed for approval of Xarelto in ACS at the end of 2011. The FDA rejected the application, saying efficacy data was not strong enough to support approval. The company provided additional information but the FDA once again declined to approve the drug, prompting J&J to appeal the decision.The FDA denied the appeal but said limiting the duration of use to one month might be a pathway forward because efficacy was more evident and the risk of bleeding, a side effect of the drug, was lower during this period. J&J filed a new application seeking a treatment duration of 90 days. The FDA's latest review suggests the agency remains skeptical.""It is unclear how to choose the metric for determining when the benefit of rivaroxaban is greatest,"" the review found. ""Not only does the effect of rivaroxaban not appear to be greater earlier, but an effect in the first 90 days or so is not apparent at all.""Dr. Paul Burton, vice president of clinical development at Janssen Research and Development, a J&J unit, defended the drug, saying the company believes that when added to standard treatments it ""delivers a strong incremental benefit by significantly reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, including death, at a time when patients are at the highest risk."" The FDA's review also questioned whether the benefit of the drug outweighs the heightened risk of bleeding since two other drugs, Eli Lilly & Co's Effient and AstraZeneca Plc's Brilinta, are currently approved for ACS.J&J's proposed prescribing information would warn that treatment in combination with the Effient, known also as prasugrel, and Brilinta, also known as ticagrelor, has not been studied and is not recommended because of the risk of bleeding.Xarelto would therefore only be available as an add-on to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's antiplatelet Plavix, or clopidogrel.""There are no data demonstrating that ACS patients treated with clopidogrel plus rivaroxaban will have superior outcomes compared to treatment with prasugrel or ticagrelor,"" the review said.

16,"  Jan 17 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)A proposed transaction between Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and The Carlyle Group  is viewed as strategically sound, according to Fitch Ratings. We believe the margins and long-term growth opportunities for this business had been lower versus those for the total firm. While the sale will incrementally improve JNJ's total profitability, it should only modestly  reduce the diversification of its portfolio, given that the diagnostics business  accounts for roughly only 2.7% of total firm sales. JNJ this week announced that The Carlyle Group has offered to buy its  Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business for $4.15 billion in cash. The transaction  is expected to close mid-year 2014, assuming various regulatory approvals and  stakeholder agreements. JNJ had previously announced that it was evaluating  strategic options for the business. JNJ had roughly $25.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and a net cash  position of $10.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2013. In addition, leverage (total  debt/EBITDA) for the latest 12-month period was 0.65x.  As such, Fitch believes  the company has solid liquidity and ample discretionary headroom regarding how  it uses the anticipated proceeds from the transaction. Fitch believes JNJ, as well as other large branded pharmaceutical firms, will  continue to strategically evaluate their portfolios. We anticipate that other  potential divestitures in the sector will be generally neutral to ratings, as  the possible reduction in portfolio diversification will be mitigated by the  prospects for improved growth and profitability.Fitch's issuer default rating for JNJ is 'AAA' with a Stable Rating Outlook.",2014-01-17,JNJ,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 8:35am EST",RPT-Fitch: JNJ's diagnostics divestiture makes strategic sense,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-jnjs-diagnostics-divestiture-makes-idUSFit68489120140117?type=companyNews
17,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) cautioned Tuesday that prescription-drug sales would likely lose some momentum this year and forecast 2014 earnings at the lower end of Wall Street expectations, sending its shares down almost 2 percent.Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso cautioned that the growth rate of prescription drug sales will ""decelerate"" this year, from impressive 11 percent gains in 2013 that were fueled by use of newer treatments for psoriasis, arthritis and cancer.The company announced the outlook during a meeting with investors to review its fourth-quarter financial results, which beat Wall Street expectations on strong drug sales and an upturn in sales of consumer products.""Things looked solid in the quarter,"" said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark. ""Pharmaceuticals have been strong for a while, but medical devices and diagnostics also picked up steam versus Wall Street's expectations.""J&J said it expects to earn $5.75 to $5.85 per share in 2014, excluding special items, compared with analysts' forecasts at the top end of that range.""The guidance was a little disappointing, but management tends to be conservative with their initial forecast,"" gradually raising its profit views during the year, Clark said.Sanford Bernstein analyst Derrick Sung said concerns about J&J's forecast were ""overdone,"" and he cited ""a very strong operational performance"" by the company in the fourth quarter. Caruso said price pressures on J&J's array of products, particularly in Europe, would crimp company profit margins this year by 0.5 percent, as was the case last year. But he said an additional $1 billion in accrued cost cuts over the next three years would help offset that negative trend.Sales of prescription drugs have been ""exceptional,"" Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said in a meeting with industry analysts.

Analysts, on average, expected $1.20 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Global company sales rose 4.5 percent to $18.36 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $17.95 billion. They would have risen 6.3 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets.Remicade sales jumped 13.8 percent to $1.71 billion. Simponi sales soared 40 percent to $254 million, while Stelara sales jumped 55 percent to $417 million. But sales of Concerta, a treatment for attention deficit disorder that is now facing cheaper generics, tumbled 31 percent to $169 million. Sales of consumer products, including Listerine, Aveeno skin care products and over-the counter medicines such as Tylenol and Motrin, grew almost three percent in the quarter to $3.75 billion, after relatively flat sales in the prior quarter.The company's other big business, of medical devices and diagnostics, posted a 1 percent decline in sales to $7.3 billion, against a 2 percent decline in the prior quarter.""There are early signs of improvement in areas like orthopedics,"" Gorsky said, adding he remained confident in long-term growth of the business.J&J's DePuy orthopedics business is struggling to regain its footing following costly recalls of its defective artificial hips.

28,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. health regulators have again declined to approve proposed wider uses of Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson's lucrative blood clot preventer Xarelto, the drugmakers said on Friday.The companies had sought approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market the blockbuster pill for prevention of new heart attacks and strokes, and death, in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and also to prevent clogging of heart stents.ACS is an umbrella term covering any condition brought on by sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, including heart attack and chest pain.Xarelto's biggest current approved use is to prevent blood clots and strokes in patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. The condition occurs mainly in the elderly. An advisory panel to the FDA concluded in January that Xarelto should not be approved to prevent new heart attacks or strokes, a use referred to as secondary prevention. The medicine is co-marketed by J&J and Bayer.Clinical data from a single J&J trial was not strong enough to justify approval to market Xarelto to prevent further heart problems, especially since some data was missing, the panel found. J&J originally filed for approval of Xarelto in ACS in late 2011. The FDA rejected the application, citing missing data. The company retrieved some missing data but the FDA once again declined to approve the drug, prompting J&J to appeal the decision.After the FDA denied the appeal, J&J filed a revised marketing application. But panelists in January said the additional data did not alter their view that the benefit of the drug was not shown to outweigh an increased risk of bleeding.

45,"  (Adds detail on competitors in hepatitis C market)LONDON, March 21 European regulators have recommended approval of a new pill for hepatitis C from Johnson & Johnson, underscoring the rapid development of oral treatment options for the liver-destroying disease.The green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for J&J's Olysio, also known as simeprevir, follows U.S. approval for the treatment in November.The drug, which was developed in collaboration with Sweden's Medivir, is one of several that is vying for a share of a major new market in treatments for hepatitis C. The new wave of pills cut the need for debilitating interferon injections. Gilead's hepatitis C pill Sovaldi is already on sale in the United States and has been recommended for approval in Europe, while other companies including AbbVie are also working on promising oral treatments.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also said on Friday it had backed new drugs from Eli Lilly, Takeda and Endocyte. Eli Lilly and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim received a recommendation for their diabetes medicine Jardiance, or empagliflozin, which failed to win U.S. approval earlier this month because of manufacturing issues. Japan's Takeda, meanwhile, secured a recommendation for Entyvio, or vedolizumab, as a treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.The EMA also gave its backing to Vynfinit, or vintafolide, together with companion diagnostics, from Endocyte and Merck & Co, for ovarian cancer patients, plus another J&J drug for multicentric Castleman's disease, a rare blood condition.Recommendations for marketing approval by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months.

47,"   By Bill Berkrot  An experimental Johnson & Johnson drug for moderate to severe psoriasis proved significantly better at clearing the scaly, uncomfortable skin patches associated with the disease than a placebo, according to data from a midstage study presented on Saturday.The J&J biologic medicine, guselkumab, achieved the main goal of the Phase II study at all five dosing regimens tested by clearing or reducing the psoriasis to a minimal measure after 16 weeks of treatment in a far greater percentage of patients than in the group that received a placebo. It also appeared to be as good as or more effective than AbbVie's big selling Humira at four of the tested doses.""The efficacy of guselkumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis looks promising according to these Phase IIb study results,"" Dr. Kristina Callis Duffin, one of the study's investigators, said in a statement.Results were determined using Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scores - a zero to 5 scale in which 0 indicates the disease has been cleared, 1 represents minimal disease and 5 indicates the most severe symptoms.Guselkumab led to scores of 0 or 1 in as high as 86 percent of patients who received 100 milligrams of the drug every eight weeks, and in 83 percent of patients who were injected with 200 mg of the J&J medicine at the start of the trial and at week 4 and then every 12 weeks.At the lower end, 34 percent of patients who got 5 mg of the drug to start and at week 4 and then every 12 weeks achieved PGA scores of 0 or 1. That was still deemed to be statistically significant compared with 7 percent for those who got a placebo. In the Humira (adalimumab) group, 58 percent had scores of 0 or 1 after 16 weeks of treatment.Results of the 293-patient trial, dubbed X-Plore, were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) meeting in Denver. J&J has not yet said which of the treatment regimens would be advanced to larger, pivotal Phase III trials.Guselkumab, which would be a follow-up treatment to J&J's Stelara, works by blocking interleukin-23, or IL-23, a protein that has been associated with chronic inflammation and is believed to play a role in psoriasis. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the drug ""is really under the radar right now."" He currently sees sales reaching about $500 million several years after approval, but said estimates could change if later Phase III data were impressive.In addition to the primary goal, significantly higher proportions of guselkumab patients achieved at least a 75 percent improvement in psoriasis as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 16. Those results ranged from 44 percent of patients taking the lowest dose up to 81 percent at higher dosing regimens. That compared with 5 percent for placebo and 70 percent for Humira.A 90 percent improvement was seen in as high as 62 percent of patients who got 100 mg of guselkumab every eight weeks. The results remained consistent or showed additional improvement after 40 weeks of treatment, the company said.After a year of treatment, serious adverse side effects were reported in 3 percent of those treated with guselkumab and 5 percent for Humira.There were no cases of tuberculosis or opportunistic infections. One guselkumab patient reported a malignancy and there were three major adverse heart events, including one fatal heart attack, in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors, the company said.Psoriasis, an immune-system related disease that causes an overproduction of skin cells resulting in patches of thick inflamed skin covered with silvery scales, affects 125 million people worldwide and about 7.5 million Americans, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2014-03-22,JNJ,"Sat Mar 22, 2014 | 11:31am EDT",Experimental J&J psoriasis drug shows promise in study,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jj-psoriasis-idUSBREA2L0GX20140322?type=companyNews

49,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ)  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and long-term debt at 'AAA'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this press  release. Key Rating Drivers: --The rating action reflects Fitch's expectation that JNJ will continue to  generate strong operational and financial performance, supported by all three of  its business segments. --The company's agreement to sell its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business for  $4.15 billion makes strategic sense and preserves its broad-based business  model. --Favorable mix trends and ongoing efforts at cost control should provide  support to gross and operating margins, despite some operational headwinds. --Fitch forecasts free cash flow (FCF) generation of $7.4 billion - $7.7 billion  in 2014, driven by 4%-6% sales growth and relatively stable margins. --Fitch anticipates that JNJ will continue to invest in long-term growth and  operate with leverage and liquidity consistent with its 'AAA' rating. Durable Growth: JNJ's recently launched pharmaceutical businesses and an expanding pipeline in  its pharmaceutical and medical device businesses support the prospects for  continued low single-digit growth. In addition, strong demand for many of the  company's products in developing markets should more than offset dampened  performance of a few of JNJ's U.S. consumer and medical device franchises. Other Operational Headwinds to Persist: The expectation for continued weak economic and employment environment will  moderate growth to varying degrees in most of the company's franchises. In  addition, austerity measures in Europe will likely weigh on the company's  revenues and margins in that region. Fitch expects these issues will persist at  least through 2014. Sensible Strategic Pruning: In January 2014, the company received a binding offer from The Carlyle Group to  acquire the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business for $4.15 billion. Fitch  believes the margins and long-term growth opportunities for this business had  been lower versus those for the total firm. While the sale will incrementally  improve JNJ's total profitability, it should only modestly reduce the  diversification of its portfolio, given that the diagnostics business accounts  for roughly only 2.7% of total firm sales. Margin Support: Fitch expects JNJ's improving sales mix and continued focus on costs will  support margins. The company's recently approved pharmaceutical products line  and continued expansion of its medical device segment will support faster growth  for these segments relative to JNJ's lower-margin consumer business. In  addition, Fitch expects that JNJ's management will continue to focus on  generating greater operational efficiencies in administration, manufacturing and  distribution. Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets. Moderate growth  and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate $6.5 billion of  FCF [cash flow from operations ($17.4 billion minus capital expenditures ($3  billion) and dividends ($7.3 billion)] during the LTM period ended Dec. 29,  2013. On Dec. 29, 2013, JNJ had approximately $29.2 billion in cash plus  short-term marketable securities and access to $10 billion in short-term  borrowings.  Debt Structure   JNJ had approximately $18.2 billion in debt, with approximately $4.8 billion  maturing in 2014, $2.1 billion in 2016, $1 billion in 2017 and $1.5 billion in  2018. Debt increased by about $2 billion during the LTM period, as the company  took advantage of a continuing favorable long-term interest rate environment.  Resulting TD/EBITDA remained essentially flat at 0.77x, primarily because of the  growth in EBITDA. JNJ's current capital structure is supportive of its 'AAA'  rating given a number of measures, including the following three credit metrics  that Fitch uses as criteria for a an issuer such as JNJ as of Dec. 29, 2013.  Rating Sensitivities: While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its four-year forecast  horizon, a negative rating action could occur if some combination of  deteriorating operational performance and leveraging transactions stress the  company's credit profile. Fitch believes the company's broadly diversified  health-care related franchises make it more likely that a negative rating action  would be prompted by a leveraging transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Key rating metrics include the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0 times (x) gives no flexibility; --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x gives no flexibility; --Net debt of $4 billion - $5 billion gives no flexibility. On Dec. 29, 2013, latest 12 month (LTM) selected credit metrics were as follows: --Total debt/FCF was nearly 2.8x. --Total debt/EBITDA was 0.77x. --JNJ had a net cash position of $11 billion. Fitch has affirmed JNJ's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'AAA'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA';    --Subordinated debt at 'AAA'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $18.2 billion of debt. Contact: Primary Analyst Bob Kirby Director  +1-312-368-3147  Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

In recent weeks, momentum names - stocks seen by investors as having high growth potential - have been under pressure after a meteoric rise in their prices took valuations to levels that appeared to be unsustainable.Tesla Motors Inc fell 5.5 percent to $187.25 and NetFlix Inc dropped 4.5 percent to $316.82 to rank among the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 index. The Global X Social Media index, whose components include Facebook, LinkedIn and Yelp,  fell 2.7 percent. The exchange-traded fund, designed to measure the performance of companies in the social media industry, has dropped nearly 22 percent since the end of February. The Nasdaq Biotech index dropped 2.8 percent. The index, whose components include Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idex, has lost more than 20 percent over the past six weeks. Those losses put both indexes in bear market territory, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 20 percent from a peak.""They reached a level where the pricing was absurd in terms of the valuation of these companies, and for whatever reason, the market has woken up to the fact and is now correcting to get them back down to a reasonable valuation,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.""And suddenly everyone realizes the emperor has no clothes.""Coca-Cola Co shot up 3.3 percent to $40.01 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after the U.S. soft drink maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Strong sales in China more than offset a drop in Europe and flat volumes in North America, Coca-Cola said. Fellow Dow component Johnson & Johnson rose 1.1 percent to $98.24 after the company posted quarterly earnings well above Wall Street's expectations. Brisk sales of new prescription drugs balanced weak sales of consumer products, according to J&J, which slightly raised its full-year profit view.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.90 points or 0.40 percent, to 16,109.34.

67,"   By Siddharth Cavale  Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) said it plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one for batteries and other household products and the other for personal care brands such as Schick razors and Stayfree female hygiene products.Shares of the company, known for its Energizer and Eveready batteries, jumped more than 17 percent in morning trading.Energizer said it expects the separation to help the businesses intensify focus on commercial priorities and better allocate resources.""We're surprised by the decision to split the company, but think it makes sense,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty said. ""The personal care segment may realize a higher valuation if it is not bound to the battery business.""The households products business's contribution to Energizer's revenue declined from 70 percent in 2006 to 45 percent last year.Battery sales have declined amid increasing competition and growing demand for rechargeable batteries used in mobile devices.Household product sales fell 15.8 percent to $373.4 million, mainly due to the loss of two U.S. retail customers and higher promotional spending, in the second quarter ended March 31.Larger rival Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), home to Duracell batteries and Gillette razors, is also trying to streamline its businesses. The company said earlier this month that it would sell its pet food business to Mars Inc for $2.9 billion. The loss of two big U.S. retail customers, whom Energizer didn't name, will hurt sales by 6 percent each in the first three quarters of 2014, the company said.Energizer shut manufacturing facilities, cut input expense and fired staff under a cost-saving program last year.The company said on Wednesday the cost-cutting will continue through the separation process.Energizer expects the personal care business, which also makes Wilkinson Sword shavers and Banana Boat sunscreen, to be a consumer product company aimed at growing through scale and innovation.The business reported revenue of about $2.6 billion in the year to March 31 and current Chief Executive Ward Klein is slated to be the executive chairman of the business. The sum-of-the-parts multiple of Energizer's businesses is about 9.5 times — 15 percent higher than its current enterprise value multiple of 8.3 times forward EBITDA, Bernstein research analyst Ali Dibadj said.""This split may provide further operational benefits and increases the chance of mergers and acquisitions,"" he added.The planned tax-free spin-off is expected to be completed in the second half of the year ending September 2015.The company expects the household products business, which brought in $1.9 billion in revenue in the year ended March 31, to generate strong margins and cash flows. Alan Hoskins, the chief executive of Energizer Household Products, will continue to lead the business post-split.Energizer also reported that its second-quarter net income rose 16 percent to $98.5 million, or $1.57 per share. Excluding items, it earned $1.88 per share.Sales fell 3.1 percent to $1.06 billion. Personal care sales rose 5.6 percent to $689 million, benefiting from its acquisition of the feminine care business from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in July.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $1.08 billion, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S. Energizer shares were up 16 percent at $113.37 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.The stock has risen 2.2 percent in the year to Tuesday's close, lagging the wider S&P 500 Index .SPX which has risen 17.87 percent in the same period.(Editing by Joyjeet Das)",2014-04-30,JNJ,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 11:28am EDT","Energizer to split into battery, personal care companies",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-energizer-hldgs-split-idUSBREA3T0CL20140430?type=companyNews

73,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON As Pfizer's (PFE.N) pursuit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) provokes uproar, another big U.S. healthcare group is taking a much quieter path into the heart of UK bioscience from an inconspicuous office off London's Oxford Street.Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) life science ""innovation centre"", which opened a year ago, represents a different approach to drug development based on building networks and scouting for small deals, rather than mega-merger consolidation.Its team of two dozen scientists-cum-dealmakers, operating in the shadow of the Debenhams department store, struck 16 agreements last year for promising new treatments from universities and biotech companies in Britain and across Europe.Rival drugmakers are also putting an increased emphasis on doing external deals for early-stage science, but J&J has gone further than most in decentralizing the decision-making process. It has set up similar talent-spotting innovation offices in Shanghai, Boston and Menlo Park, California, in the past 12 months.""Other companies have two or three scouts in certain countries, but they need to call head office to get a decision, which means going to one committee and then another,"" said Patrick Verheyen, who heads up J&J's innovation operation in London.His team, by contrast, have autonomy to strike deals and see projects right through until the ""proof of concept"" stage of clinical testing.For many in the pharmaceutical industry, this outward-looking approach represents the future, because tapping into external science is vital if large corporations are to keep up with fast-moving developments in basic science and biotechnology. And that leaves some analysts wondering whether Pfizer's $106 billion attempt to buy AstraZeneca - a move rejected by the British firm - is actually focused on better drug discovery or really all about tax and cost savings, as many critics charge.""Pharma companies need to spend fewer biodollars internally and externalize more, yet Pfizer seem to be arguing they can succeed by pooling more intellectual capital in-house,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities.ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS LESS THAN TWO AstraZeneca, for its part, says the notion that smashing together two Big Pharma research departments leads to improved productivity has been debunked by past large-scale mergers in the sector. ""When you bring two huge organizations together, our industry tells us that it is hugely disruptive in terms of site closures, role closures,"" Mene Pangalos, the British group's head of early drug development, told a parliamentary panel on Wednesday. ""Overall, one plus one doesn't equal two - one plus one equals one point something.""Still, the situation is not black and white.Pfizer itself also does early-stage research deals - it struck a tie-up with UK universities in rare diseases just last week - and J&J has not shied away from some big acquisitions, with its medical devices unit buying Swiss-based Synthes for $20 billion in 2012. But J&J's business development work in pharmaceuticals is primarily focused these days on acquiring individual experimental medicines, whether at an early or late stage of testing. As a result, about half of J&J's drug pipeline now comes from outside the company, against an industry average of around a third.Interestingly, AstraZeneca also has a large proportion of experimental drugs that were invented externally, following a deal-making splurge by the company in the past few years, which was designed to plug a gap left by patent expiries and a run of in-house pipeline failures.With his small team in London - plus satellite partnering offices in Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester and Cardiff - Verheyen knows his operation is just one cog in the larger J&J research and development machine, which has interests spanning drugs, medical devices and consumer health products.But after years working on mergers and acquisitions within the U.S. group's pharmaceuticals division, he sees a clear rebalancing of the R&D model across J&J and the wider industry.""There is a shift to external research, absolutely. Most of the innovation is happening outside the walls of our organization,"" he said.""We as taxpayers fund a lot of academic research, so if we can help to make something from that academic research and help bring products closer to market then that is good for everybody.""(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Will Waterman)",2014-05-14,JNJ,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 7:42am EDT",J&J taps British science quietly where Pfizer storms in,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-jj-idUSBREA4D09T20140514?type=companyNews

81,"   By Deena Beasley | CHICAGO  CHICAGO A new drug for the most common form of leukemia in adults  improves survival for patients whose disease has worsened despite standard treatment, according to late-stage study findings released on Saturday.Ibrutinib, sold by Pharmacyclics Inc and Johnson & Johnson under the brand name Imbruvica, was approved by U.S. regulators for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in February.The therapy ""beat the pants off"" of ofatumumab, or Arzerra, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline Plc, in the Phase 3 trial, said Dr. John Byrd, the study's lead investigator and a professor of medicine at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus, Ohio.JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said the trial results, along with the fact that the drug is a pill that does not need to be combined with another therapy, could help propel sales.Pharmacyclics said earlier this month that it expected Imbruvica revenue of $295 million this year, which disappointed some investors.The trial involved 391 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that had progressed after two or more prior therapies. Standard treatment for such patients is a combination of chemotherapy and an antibody drug, such as Arzerra. The results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting on Saturday in Chicago.At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, the study found that ibrutinib lowered the risk of death by 57 percent compared with ofatumumab. Researchers said they expect the trial to result in median overall survival in the range of several years.At median follow-up, 86 percent of patients on ibrutinib had responded to the drug and were continuing treatment with minimal side effects, compared with response rates between 35 percent and 40 percent for standard therapies, Dr. Byrd said. Side effects associated with ibrutinib included diarrhea, minor bleeding and heart arrhythmias.  ""These results provide a compelling new treatment option for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including older adults with this disease, and will significantly change (physicians') practice,"" Dr. Olatoyosi Odenike, a leukemia expert at the University of Chicago said in an ASCO statement. Odenike was not involved in the study.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February approved Imbruvica as a secondary treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It was previously approved for mantle cell lymphoma patients who have tried other therapies.  Studies are also under way to test the drug as an initial treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Imbruvica is an oral drug designed to target an enzyme known as Bruton's tyrosine kinase and block the function of certain cancerous cells.Drugs in a similar class are under development by companies including AbbVie and Gilead Sciences Inc.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a slowly progressing form of blood cancer, is diagnosed in about 16,000 Americans and will kill around 4,600 every year, according to the American Cancer Society.

84,"  LONDON, June 12 Johnson & Johnson has linked up with ViiV Healthcare - a specialist HIV company majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline - to develop a new AIDS medicine combining two drugs in a single tablet.The decision to study and commercialise a tablet containing J&J's non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Edurant, or rilpivirine, and ViiV's integrase inhibitor Tivicay, or dolutegravir, promises a simpler alternative to current three-drug therapies.The idea is to use the two-drug combination tablet once a patient's level of virus has been suppressed and stabilised. Studies included in the new development programme are expected to begin by the first quarter of 2015 and will investigate the new combination as an HIV maintenance therapy for patients already virally suppressed on a three-drug regimen. The deal expands ViiV's portfolio of regimens based on Tivicay, which is viewed by analysts as an important future revenue driver for GSK. Pfizer and Shionogi hold minority stakes in ViiV.

But while overall pharmaceutical sales soared, helped also by treatments for blood clots and prostate cancer, the company's medical devices and consumer products posted weak sales gains.Olysio, which U.S. regulators approved in November, chalked up sales of $831 million for the second quarter and $1.19 billion for the year to date.    Many doctors use the pill with Gilead Sciences Inc's (GILD.O) Sovaldi, which was approved in December to treat the hepatitis C liver virus and has achieved even higher sales than Olysio.

93,"  Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it plans to ask doctors to return its power morcellators, a controversial surgical device that may inadvertently spread cancer in women being treated for uterine growths called fibroids.J&J's Ethicon unit in April suspended sales and distribution of the devices while their role in treating symptomatic fibroid disease is reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the medical community. The FDA had advised doctors not to use the devices pending further review.On Thursday, J&J will take the further step of reaching out to customers to ask them to return the devices they have already purchased in what it is calling ""a worldwide market withdrawal"" of all Ethicon morcellation devices that remain on the market, an Ethicon spokesman said. The morcellators are used to cut up the uterine growths so they can be more easily removed using non-invasive procedures.

94,"  July 30 Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it plans to ask doctors to return its power morcellators, a controversial surgical device that may inadvertently spread cancer in women being treated for uterine growths called fibroids.J&J's Ethicon unit in April suspended sales and distribution of the devices while their role in treating symptomatic fibroid disease is reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the medical community. The FDA had advised doctors not to use the devices pending further review.On Thursday, J&J will take the further step of reaching out to customers to ask them to return the devices they have already purchased in what it is calling ""a worldwide market withdrawal"" of all Ethicon morcellation devices that remain on the market, an Ethicon spokesman said. The morcellators are used to cut up the uterine growths so they can be more easily removed using non-invasive procedures. They are also used in hysterectomies. However, the masses may sometimes be malignant, which is often not detected prior to surgery, and the spinning blade of the morcellators could spread deadly cancer and worsen patient outcomes, the FDA had warned.

95,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO Aug 4 For healthcare, gray is the new black.The fastest-growing segment of the global population is aged 60 and over, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. That slice of humanity is expected to increase by 45 percent by 2050.The surge in the older population has contributed to a wave of new product introductions in biotechnology, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and expansion of healthcare services.In addition, healthcare is a remarkably durable sector for investors, soldiering on despite periodic market downturns, like the one seen last week when the S&P 500 index had its worst week since 2012.Overall, there's a bounty of money being spent on healthcare that's unlikely to be impacted by other economic trends.One of the best ways to own the biggest players in the healthcare industry is through the Vanguard Health Care ETF , which holds global giants like Johnson & Johnson , Pfizer Inc. and Merck and Co.. Charging 0.14 percent in annual management expenses, the Vanguard fund, which is almost entirely invested in U.S.-based stocks, gained 20 percent for the 12 months through Aug. 1, compared with 15 percent for the S&P 500 Total Return Index. Long-term, the Vanguard fund has been a solid performer, averaging 10.5 percent annually for the decade through Aug. 1. That compares with an average 7 percent return for the MSCI World NR stock index.For more non-U.S. exposure, consider the iShares Global Healthcare ETF, which charges 0.48 percent for annual expenses.The iShares fund has about 60 percent of its portfolio in North American stocks, with the remainder in European and Asian-based companies such as Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG and GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The fund gained 19 percent over the 12 months through Aug. 1. For a more focused play on leading-edge biotech and genomic companies, the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech Index ETF  samples some of the hottest companies in that sub-sector. Holdings include industry leaders Gilead Sciences Inc., Biogen Idec Inc. and InterMune Inc..The First Trust fund was up nearly 25 percent for the 12 months through Aug. 1; it charges 0.60 percent in annual expenses.GOOD VALUATIONS AVAILABLE  Since most institutional portfolio managers have seen the merits of healthcare stocks for years, there are probably few bargains available, although some sectors are pricier than others. Biotech stocks, in particular, are in high demand, although they experienced a sell-off earlier this year.""On the other hand,"" Fidelity Investments analyst Eddie Yoon said in a recent report, ""some large-cap, stable growth companies across the (healthcare) sector continue to appear attractive, based on their stable underlying business fundamentals.""Unlike other sectors such as consumer discretionary that are directly tied to overall economic conditions, healthcare is often insulated from broader economic trends. When the S&P 500 index dropped 37 percent in 2008, the Vanguard fund only lost 23 percent; the First Trust fund was off 18 percent. While biotech stocks tend to be volatile, the mainstream healthcare companies are seen as defensive holdings and more immune to broader market pressures and poised for bankable growth.Long term, the more volatile biotech stocks of today may be tomorrow's winners. The growing science of genomics will allow biotech companies to customize drugs to a patient's genetic make-up. Just three years ago it cost $95 million to sequence a human genetic code. Now it costs about $4,000, with the price dropping every year. That will translate into more precise treatments with fewer side effects.There are several concurrent waves of innovation in health information technology, diagnostics and delivery of services. More patients can be monitored and treated at home with the improvement in information technology. Diseases are being discovered and treated earlier, which means fewer hospitalizations.In the United States alone, healthcare spending is buoyed by the $3 trillion spent annually on Medicare patients. While policymakers say this number is unsustainable and must be reined in, that does not change a key fact: Some 10,000 Baby Boomers are turning 65 every day. They will continue to demand the best drugs and treatments.

101,"   By Ben Hirschler | Sept 4  Sept 4 Scientists will fast-track tests on another Ebola vaccine, this time from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, in another sign that the world's worst outbreak of the virus is mobilizing research into the deadly disease.J&J said on Thursday that clinical trials of its new vaccine, which includes technology from Danish biotech firm Bavarian Nordic BAVA.CO, would commence in early 2015.The move follows a decision to begin initial human testing of a GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L vaccine this month and plans to test one developed by Canadian government scientists, which has been licensed to NewLink Genetics NLNK.O, in the autumn. Human tests on the J&J vaccine were previously not expected to start until late 2015 or early 2016.J&J's long-term goal is to develop a vaccine that can protect against both the Zaire and Sudan strains of Ebola, as well as a related condition called Marburg disease. But the program has been simplified in light of the current outbreak.“Because of the emergency we decided to focus on the Ebola Zaire strain, which is the one in the West Africa outbreak, and that’s why we can accelerate the program significantly,” Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters. As with the GSK and NewLink programs, J&J is working on the clinical trials with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of National Institutes of Health.“The crisis is so important here, and still expanding, that more than one approach is warranted, in case the epidemic doesn’t come under control in the coming months,” Stoffels said.All of the initial Phase I trials will enroll healthy volunteers with the goal of determining whether the experimental vaccines are safe and whether they provoke a protective immune response. Stoffels said it had not yet been decided where trials on the J&J vaccine would be conducted or how many subjects would be involved.The race to develop new drugs and vaccines has been spurred by a World Health Organization ruling that it is ethical to use experimental products in the current epidemic, given the high death toll. Governments and aid organizations have scrambled to contain the disease, which according to the United Nations agency has killed more than 1,900 in West Africa since March. J&J said its vaccine, which was developed by its Crucell unit in the Netherlands, provided complete protection against the Zaire strain of Ebola when tested on macaque monkeys.Like a number of other experimental vaccines against various diseases that are now in development, it uses a common cold virus, called an adenovirus, to carry its payload. Immunization with the J&J vaccine consists of two injectionsone to prime the immune system and a second to boost the response. They were given two months apart in the monkey tests. By contrast, researchers are testing just a single shot of GSK's vaccine.How safe and effective J&J's product will be in humans remains to be seen, but more than 1,000 people have already received similar experimental vaccines from Crucell in clinical trials for other diseases with no apparent ill effects, offering some reassurance.Bavarian Nordic, meanwhile, has used a similar approach in producing a smallpox vaccine that has been stockpiled around the world and tested on more than 7,300 people.J&J is also stepping up research into potential drugs for Ebola by undertaking an intensive review of known biological pathways used by the virus to see if previously tested medicines might help.",2014-09-04,JNJ,"Thu Sep 4, 2014 | 12:18am EDT",J&J Ebola vaccine to start clinical trials in early 2015,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-health-ebola-johnson-johnson-idUSKBN0GZ0AA20140904?type=companyNews
102,"   By Jessica Dye  A federal jury in West Virginia on Friday awarded a woman $3.27 million in one of 33,000 lawsuits that accuse Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc unit of selling defective transvaginal mesh devices. Following a nearly two-week trial, jurors found Ethicon liable for selling faulty devices and failing to warn patients and their doctors that users were at risk from side effects that include pain, bleeding and infection. It was the second case to go to trial among thousands that have been consolidated in West Virginia federal court, after the first ended in February with a win for Ethicon. The company had previously been hit with an $11 million verdict in a mesh trial in New Jersey state court last year, and a $1.2 million verdict following a trial in Texas state court in April. The plaintiff, Jo Huskey, was 52 when she was implanted with a Gynecare TVT Obturator, or TVT-O, transvaginal mesh device in 2011 to treat stress urinary incontinence, according to her lawyer, Fidelma Fitzpatrick of Motley Rice. Huskey and her husband sued the next year, claiming problems with the device led to serious side effects including pelvic pain.  Fitzpatrick said the Huskeys were thrilled with the verdict. “I think it sends a very clear message to Ethicon that these products and these cases are extremely serious,” she said. “These women are very seriously injured from these products.”A spokesman for Ethicon, Matthew Johnson, said the company was disappointed with the verdict and intends to appeal. “Ethicon’s TVT-O midurethral sling was properly designed, and Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of the product,” he said in a statement. While the Huskey verdict is not binding on thousands of other Ethicon mesh cases, it will help both sides assess the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation as a whole as they decide whether to press forward with more trials or consider a settlement.  Ethicon is among seven companies facing a wave of litigation over mesh devices. Other defendants include C.R. Bard  Inc and Boston Scientific Corp. Boston Scientific recently won the first two mesh cases to go to trial against it in Massachusetts state court. Last year, C.R. Bard was hit with a $2 million verdict in the first mesh trial in West Virginia federal court. In April, Endo International’s American Medical Systems [ENDPAM.UL] subsidiary became the first major manufacturer to largely bow out of mesh litigation, agreeing to pay $830 million to resolve thousands of these cases.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said earlier this year that it was considering proposals to tighten safety standards for transvaginal mesh devices used to treat pelvic organ prolapse. If finalized, the proposals would require manufacturers to submit data proving the devices’ safety and effectiveness before allowing them to be sold. The case is Huskey v.

105,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Leaders of some of the biggest U.S. corporations, from Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), unveiled a campaign on Tuesday to reduce the nation's healthcare costs, urging their peers to embrace wellness programs to improve employee health.The newly-formed group, called The CEO Council on Health and Innovation, said it came together ""to lead the U.S. business community"" in improving employee and community health and reducing costs.The council's members also include Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Walgreen Co WAG.N, McKinsey & Co, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and the Institute for Advanced Health. Combined, the group said its healthcare benefits cover 150 million people.In a report released at a press conference in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the council called on employers to accelerate the adoption of wellness programs to improve nutrition and weight management, promote physical activity, help employees quit smoking and manage chronic diseases.    Several council members described successful wellness initiatives at their own firms and urged others to follow suit. ""Today is about a call to action,"" said Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. The company's sugary soft drinks have been the target of public health advocates who argue they contribute to obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are popular because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses. Some employers, including Bank of America, offer financial incentives for employees to get screened, while others have begun to penalize workers who don't participate in wellness requirements. Despite the rising popularity of such programs, some independent research has shown that wellness campaigns do not always cut costs as hoped. A long-running workplace wellness program at PepsiCo (PEP.N), for example, helped reduce costs for workers with chronic diseases by cutting down hospital admissions. But the savings for employees who were urged to make preventive changes to their lifestyle were negligible, according to a report published in the journal Health Affairs in January. Still, Dr. Fikry Isaac, vice president of global health services at J&J, said the company's own research showed that every dollar it spent on wellness programs yielded a potential $2 to $4 return on investment.""We believe it does work and we have the ability to show quite a bit of evidence,"" he said.One J&J study that lasted more than six years showed a $565 dollar saving per employee per year, Isaac said, adding that healthcare costs for J&J over the period rose just 1 percent, compared to a gain of 4.7 percent for its peers.

107,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON, Sept 16  WASHINGTON, Sept 16 Leaders of some of the biggest U.S. corporations, from Coca-Cola Co to Johnson & Johnson, unveiled a campaign on Tuesday to reduce the nation's healthcare costs, urging their peers to embrace wellness programs to improve employee health.The newly-formed group, called The CEO Council on Health and Innovation, said it came together ""to lead the U.S. business community"" in improving employee and community health and reducing costs.The council's members also include executives from Verizon Communications Inc, Aetna Inc, Bank of America Corp, Walgreen Co, McKinsey & Co, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and Institute for Advanced Health. Combined, the group said its healthcare benefits cover 150 million people. In a report released at a press conference in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the council called on employers to accelerate the adoption of comprehensive wellness programs that aim to improve nutrition and weight management, promote physical activity, help employees quit smoking and manage chronic diseases.The group also called on employers to make more use of  incentives to increase employee adoption of wellness programs and to modify their health benefits in a way that would encourage workers to take preventive measures to improve health. Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are a favorite of the business community because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses.Some employers offer their workers monetary incentives to adhere to the plans, while a smaller group of companies and organizations are introducing penalties for not complying with wellness initiatives. Several chief executives on the council described their wellness initiatives and cited success in reducing costs for both the employees and the company.But some research has shown such programs do not always cut costs as hoped.A long-running workplace wellness program at PepsiCo , for example, helped reduce costs for workers with chronic diseases by cutting down hospital admissions. But the savings for employees who were urged to make preventive changes to their lifestyle were negligible, according to a report published in January.

108,"   By Jessica Dye and Marice Richter  An executive at Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy Orthopaedics Inc unit on Monday defended the company’s assessment of safety risks associated with metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants in a Dallas court from a lawyer who said the company had neglected to perform critical safety testing.Pamela Plouhar, the worldwide vice president of clinical research at DePuy, was grilled by a lawyer for plaintiff Kathy Herlihy-Paoli during the first trial among more than 6,000 lawsuits over the Pinnacle hips that have been consolidated in Dallas federal court. The outcome of this so-called bellwether case could have an impact on DePuy's decision to continue fighting the cases in court or consider a settlement. Herlihy-Paoli and other plaintiffs claim the company failed to understand and warn patients and doctors about the device’s risks, instead marketing them as safe. On Monday, Herlihy-Paoli’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, pressed Plouhar over what studies DePuy had performed on the implants, in an attempt to show jurors that the company had been negligent in gathering clinical data on the devices before they were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000. Plouhar said there was “no human study that looked at” the health effects of metal debris for the Pinnacle hips before 2001. Lanier said that research as early as 1974 suggested problems with the metal-on-metal devices. During testimony last week, Lanier pointed to documents that showed that Thomas Schmalzried, a Los Angeles surgeon who had consulted with DePuy on the hips, said in 2001 that more information was needed to assess the risks of metal debris in Pinnacle devices.On Monday, Plouhar insisted DePuy had followed industry standards. When asked by Lanier whether the company had done the ""necessary studies"" on the metal-ion issue to prove the hips were safe, she said they had. The safety record of metal-on-metal implants and whether DePuy properly vetted the devices have been key themes so far during the trial, which entered its third week on Monday.  Herlihy-Paoli's lawyers have said the failure rates for the implant were unacceptably high - more than 14 percent over seven years.Herlihy-Paoli, a 58-year-old woman from Montana, received two Pinnacle hips in 2009, and said in her 2012 lawsuit that defects in the devices led the level of cobalt in her blood to skyrocket to 85 times the normal level.  While the Pinnacle implant has not been recalled, the company stopped selling metal liners for the devices last year. In a statement, DePuy spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said the company undertook a comprehensive review of scientific and clinical information on metal-on-metal hips before launching the Pinnacle metal-on-metal device, including two FDA-approved clinical trials, and continued to monitor the device’s safety after its launch. Last year, DePuy agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip systems, which were recalled in 2010.

114,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson reported strong quarterly earnings on surging sales of a new treatment for hepatitis C, but the company said it had sharply reduced prices for its artificial hips and warned that profits could be hurt next year by the stronger dollar. Sales of the J&J (JNJ.N) drug, called Olysio and approved in November, reached $796 million in the third quarter. As with other hepatitis C drugs that began with rapid ascents, however, its commercial success is expected to be short-lived. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover predicted 2015 sales of Olysio will plunge more than 50 percent due to the approval on Friday of a new pill called Harvoni from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) that can rid patients of the liver-destroying viral infection within as little as 8 weeks.Conover said strong quarterly sales of other relatively new J&J drugs, including its Zytiga treatment for prostate cancer and blood clot preventer Xarelto, bode well for J&J and the drug industry over the long term.""The core drugs are doing well, with a lot of strength from newer brands, and that signifies a healthy environment for pharmaceutical stocks,"" Conover said.J&J's global drug sales jumped 18 percent to $8.3 billion, a slowdown from 21 percent growth in the second quarter. But sales of J&J's medical devices fell 5.2 percent to $6.6 billion, after the recent divestiture of the company's Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics unit and a 5 percent price cut for its artificial hips.J&J Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso told analysts on a conference call that J&J cut prices of the hip implants as it attempted to renew contracts with hospitals and other customers.On another cautionary note, Caruso said the strengthening dollar could hurt 2015 earnings by 15 to 20 cents per share. Sales of company consumer products, including Tylenol, slipped 0.6 percent to $3.6 billion in the quarter.The company earned $4.75 billion, or $1.66 per share. That compared with $2.98 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the year-earlier period, when J&J took special charges for legal expenses and merger-related costs.  Excluding special items, J&J earned $1.50 per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A net gain from after-tax items of about $500 million was seen, mostly due to tax benefits from the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics divestiture.

119,"   By Jessica Dye and Marice Richter  A lawyer for a Montana woman on Tuesday urged jurors in a U.S. court to find Johnson & Johnson's DePuy Orthopedics unit liable for failing to warn patients that metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defective at the close of the first trial over the device.During the seven-week trial in Dallas, lawyers for Kathleen Herlihy-Paoli accused the company of concealing the safety risks of the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants she received in 2009. They said the company failed to warn doctors and patients that the device could shed metal ions into the bloodstream, infecting surrounding tissue and causing the level of metals such as cobalt in the blood to soar. DePuy has vigorously fought back against Herlihy-Paoli’s claims and said the device did not fail and the plaintiff's lawyers never identified a specific flaw that caused her injuries.   The jury began deliberating Tuesday evening and will continue Wednesday. The case is before U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in the Northern District of Texas. The outcome of Herlihy-Paoli’s case will weigh on more than 6,000 other cases over Pinnacle hip implants that have been consolidated in the same Dallas federal court, and could impact Johnson & Johnson’s willingness to settle the lawsuits or continue to try cases in hopes of beating plaintiffs’ claims.  In his closing argument Tuesday, a lawyer for Herlihy-Paoli, Mark Lanier, said DePuy aggressively pushed the metal-on-metal devices for younger patients with active lifestyles, saying they could last longer than versions made with other materials such as ceramic or polyethylene, a type of plastic.But in doing so, Lanier said, the company ignored years’ worth of data suggesting that metal-on-metal hips failed at an abnormally high rate, putting thousands of patients at risk. ""Send a clear message that holds them accountable,"" Lanier told jurors. He asked them to award at least $1.4 million for Herlihy-Paoli's medical costs and an additional, unspecified amount in punitive damages.  Throughout the trial, DePuy has maintained that the devices are safe when properly used, and that plaintiffs’ lawyers unfairly tried to target Pinnacle for problems linked to different metal-on-metal hip implants, including DePuy’s ASR implant, which was recalled in 2010. Last year, DePuy agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hips. Richard Sarver, a lawyer for DePuy, said Herlihy-Paoli’s two Pinnacle hips may have been improperly positioned, and that her active lifestyle may have exacerbated any problems.  “If you place a cup in the wrong position, which is what happened here, bad things happen,"" Sarver said.  A spokeswoman for DePuy, Mindy Tinsley, said the company is committed to “vigorously defending itself against the claims” made in Pinnacle lawsuits. The case is Herlihy-Paoli v.

Some 500 volunteers are due to take part in countries including the United States, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Mali, Gabon and Kenya.The tests will generate safety and immune-response data in December. The vaccines can then be rolled out early next year to groups including frontline healthcare workers, said Marie-Paule Kieny, the WHO assistant director-general for health systems and innovation.""These data are absolutely crucial to allow decision-making on what dose level should go into efficacy testing in Africa,"" Kieny told a news briefing.Determining the dosage will dictate the yield or overall amount of vaccine available for the large clinical trials in Africa, she said. ""There is still a possibility that it will fail, but everybody is putting things in order in order for being able to move to West Africa in January,"" Kieny said. ""When I say deployed, I am not talking about mass vaccination, I am talking about utilisation in the tens of thousands of doses in the first couple of months of the year.""West Africa's Ebola outbreak, which began in March, has killed 4,546 out of 9,191 known cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to WHO, which has declared outbreaks in Senegal and Nigeria over.There have been a handful of Ebola cases in Spain and the United States, which on Monday issued stringent new protocols for health workers treating Ebola victims. FUNDING THE ROLL-OUT Vaccine makers and regulatory authorities are moving quickly to speed up trials and approval for the vaccines, Kieny said. Donors stand ready to help finance the roll-out, expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, she added.""The funding scenario has not been worked out.

Jurors needed about two days to deliberate, after a seven-week trial. Plaintiffs' lawyers selected Herlihy-Paoli's lawsuit to be among the first to go to trial out of more than 6,600 lawsuits over the Pinnacle hips. The unanimous win for DePuy is expected to affect its approach to the rest of the lawsuits, which are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade.DePuy spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said the company was pleased with the verdict and was committed to the ""long-term and vigorous defense"" of the litigation. The metal-on-metal device ""was appropriately developed, thoroughly tested and responsibly marketed,"" she said in a statement.  A lawyer for Herlihy-Paoli, Mark Lanier, called the case ""the first skirmish in what is likely to be a long war.""""We still plan to press on with fierce dedication to clients we believe have been tragically wronged,"" he said. Herlihy-Paoli said she required multiple surgeries to fix and replace her implants after the surrounding tissue became infected and the level of the metal cobalt in her blood soared to 85 times the normal level.  Her 2012 lawsuit said the device’s metal components rubbed together, shedding metal ions. At trial, lawyers for Herlihy-Paoli accused DePuy of aggressively marketing the devices to more active people, while concealing abnormally high failure rates.DePuy’s lawyers countered that the devices were safe when used and implanted properly. They also said Herlihy-Paoli unfairly targeted DePuy for problems linked to different metal-on-metal hips, such as the company’s ASR devices. Last year, DePuy agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over the ASR devices, which it recalled in 2010.  DePuy stopped selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013. Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, called the verdict surprising and said jurors may have responded to DePuy’s argument that the hips may have been improperly positioned. “They can take some comfort in this verdict,” he said, referring to DePuy. “But I’m sure there will be more.""The case is Herlihy-Paoli v.

142,"  (Repeats without changes to headline or text)By Joseph AxNEW YORK Nov 19 Nearly a decade after losing a bidding war for device maker Guidant to Boston Scientific Corp , Johnson & Johnson finally has a chance for payback at a multibillion-dollar trial set to begin on Thursday.A federal court judge in New York will hear the case without a jury and decide whether Guidant, through its successor Boston Scientific, should be held liable for breaching a contract with J&J.J&J seeks in excess of $5 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific, a potentially massive judgment against a company that as of Tuesday had a market capitalization of $17.8 billion.The two-part trial before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan is expected to go into December as lawyers revisit the details, and the aftermath, of the nine-year-old Guidant battle. Underscoring the stakes, Boston Scientific has brought in well-known litigator David Boies. Johnson & Johnson will answer with a high-profile lawyer of its own, Sean Coffey, perhaps best known for winning a $6 billion judgment against big banks in the wake of WorldCom's collapse.The companies declined to comment ahead of the trial.Jefferies Group analyst Raj Denhoy said in a note that the case ""represents a major near-term risk"" for Boston Scientific. J&J and Guidant, which made cardiovascular devices, struck a deal to combine in 2004 and later agreed to a $21.5 billion price. To satisfy antitrust concerns, J&J said it would sell a portion of Guidant's business to Abbott Laboratories.The deal included a ""no-solicitation"" clause that prohibited Guidant from seeking better offers, though it was permitted to consider unsolicited bids.Before the merger closed, Boston Scientific made a $25 billion offer and also said it would sell assets to Abbott. J&J became convinced that Guidant had provided due diligence to Abbott as it worked on the Boston Scientific offer, in violation of its agreement. Without that move, J&J says, Abbott would not have signed on, leaving Boston Scientific unable to win what became a bidding war. Boston Scientific eventually bought Guidant for $27 billion, while J&J received a $705 million termination fee.J&J sued Guidant and Abbott in 2006, claiming breach of contract. Abbott has since been dismissed as a defendant.Boston Scientific plans to argue that Guidant did not knowingly violate the agreement, according to court papers.It has also questioned whether J&J can prove it lost money. J&J's stock has soared since, while Boston Scientific's has fallen, in part over problems with the Guidant deal. In pretrial filings, Boston Scientific cited a Fortune magazine article that called it the ""biggest M&A blunder since AOL/Time Warner.""J&J will counter that its deal would have succeeded, given its superior resources. It will also point to documents that it says show Guidant knew at the time that its actions were in breach of the agreement.

145,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 19 Nearly a decade after losing a bidding war for device maker Guidant to Boston Scientific Corp , Johnson & Johnson finally has a chance for payback at a multibillion-dollar trial set to begin on Thursday.A federal court judge in New York will hear the case without a jury and decide whether Guidant, through its successor Boston Scientific, should be held liable for breaching a contract with J&J.J&J seeks in excess of $5 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific, a potentially massive judgment against a company that as of Tuesday had a market capitalization of $17.8 billion.The two-part trial before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan is expected to go into December as lawyers revisit the details, and the aftermath, of the nine-year-old Guidant battle.Underscoring the stakes, Boston Scientific has brought in well-known litigator David Boies. Johnson & Johnson will answer with a high-profile lawyer of its own, Sean Coffey, perhaps best known for winning a $6 billion judgment against big banks in the wake of WorldCom's collapse. The companies declined to comment ahead of the trial.Jefferies Group analyst Raj Denhoy said in a note that the case ""represents a major near-term risk"" for Boston Scientific.J&J and Guidant, which made cardiovascular devices, struck a deal to combine in 2004 and later agreed to a $21.5 billion price. To satisfy antitrust concerns, J&J said it would sell a portion of Guidant's business to Abbott Laboratories. The deal included a ""no-solicitation"" clause that prohibited Guidant from seeking better offers, though it was permitted to consider unsolicited bids.Before the merger closed, Boston Scientific made a $25 billion offer and also said it would sell assets to Abbott. J&J became convinced that Guidant had provided due diligence to Abbott as it worked on the Boston Scientific offer, in violation of its agreement. Without that move, J&J says, Abbott would not have signed on, leaving Boston Scientific unable to win what became a bidding war.

147,"   By Olivia Oran, Anjuli Davies and Martinne Geller | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to explore a sale of its artificial sweetener brand Splenda, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Such a move would let Johnson & Johnson, maker of prescription drugs, medical devices and baby shampoo, exit a business beset by weakened soft drink sales and intense competition.    The process is at an early stage, with prospective buyers signing non-disclosure agreements, one of the sources said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is private. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  The business, which has annual revenue of around $300 million, could attract interest from private equity buyers because it generates strong cash flows and good margins, according to the sources.  ""But there is no obvious strategic buyer (from the food or ingredients sectors) because high-intensity sweeteners are not that attractive at the moment,” according to one of the sources.  Splenda, an artificial sweetener made from sucralose, was jointly developed by J&J subsidiary McNeil Nutritionals and British ingredients firm Tate & Lyle (TATE.L), which continues to supply the sucralose.Tate, which also declined to comment, in September forecast sucralose prices would be down about 25 percent this year, saying it had to renegotiate supply contracts at lower prices to protect market share from cheaper Chinese rivals.  At the same time, sucralose sales have been pressured by declining demand for carbonated soft drinks in markets such as the United States, due to changing consumer tastes and greater health consciousness. ""I'd imagine those kinds of businesses wouldn't attract a huge (price) multiple in today's environment,"" said Declan Morrissey, an analyst at Davy Research, which follows Tate & Lyle but not J&J. ""You can use carbonated soft drink volumes as a proxy for sucralose volumes and they've been falling by low single-digits for the last 12 to 24 months. So you've got a top-line volume component that's struggling and then pricing that's off 20 to 30 percent."" One potential bright spot for the sweetener market is in natural sweeteners such as stevia, derived from a South American shrub. Coca-Cola (KO.N) and PepsiCo (PEP.N) have recently launched stevia-sweetened versions of their flagship colas.  Merisant, maker of rival sweetener products Equal and Canderel, was in October sold to licorice ingredients maker Flavors Holding for an undisclosed sum.

148,"   By Brendan Pierson  The top U.S. patent appeals court has thrown out a $176 million award for healthcare company Covidien Plc  in a dispute with a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary over surgical instruments.Judge Sharon Prost of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., ruled on Thursday that Covidien's patent claims, which involve surgical cutting tools that use ultrasonic technology, were invalid.Dublin-based Covidien in 2010 sued Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc, a subsidiary of New Jersey's Johnson & Johnson, claiming it sold surgical tools that violated several patents issued in the 1990s.

159,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Johnson & Johnson has started clinical trials of its experimental Ebola vaccine, which uses a booster from Denmark's Bavarian Nordic, making it the third such shot to enter human testing.The initiation of the Phase I study in Britain, which had been expected about now, marks further progress in the race to develop a vaccine against a disease that has killed more than 8,000 people in West Africa since last year. Two other experimental vaccines, one from GlaxoSmithKline and a rival from NewLink and Merck, are already in clinical development. However, the J&J vaccine offers a different approach, since it involves two separate injections.U.S.-based J&J said on Tuesday it had produced enough vaccine to treat more than 400,000 people, which could be used in large-scale clinical trials by April, and a total of 2 million courses would be available in 2015. Previously, J&J expected more than 1 million courses this year.It also now predicts it can make enough vaccine for 5 million treatments, if required, over a 12- to 18-month period.Just how much Ebola vaccine will be needed depends on how quickly the epidemic in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea is brought under control and declines. Currently, experts project demand at anywhere between 100,000 and 12 million doses.""As long as there are still Ebola patients, there is the risk that it will continue to go around the region,"" Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, told reporters.  ""Does it come too late? That's going to be answered when we are there. I don't think so.""'PRIME-BOOST' The first volunteers have received initial injections in Oxford, where 72 healthy subjects will get different regimens involving various combinations of the vaccine components or a placebo.  Additional clinical studies are planned in the United States later this month and soon after in Africa, where volunteers will receive the vaccine in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.Phase I trials are designed primarily to test safety but may also indicate whether vaccines produce a good immune response. In all, some 300 subjects will be involved in Phase I testing, after which J&J hopes to move rapidly into larger studies, with final-stage Phase III trials planned for the second quarter of 2015. The J&J and Bavarian vaccine uses a so-called ""prime-boost"" approach of giving a first shot to stimulate the immune system, followed by a second booster a few weeks later.  The GSK and NewLink vaccines have been tested initially as single shots, although there is growing debate as to whether two-stage vaccination might be a more strategic option, since it is likely to provide better protection. The downside is that it would make mass immunisation more complicated. ""What we are doing with prime-boost is going for maximal protection, as well as long-term protection,"" Stoffels said.Importantly, tests have shown the J&J vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge for several months, rather than needing special freezing, which is difficult in rural Africa.Shares in Bavarian Nordic, which received investment from J&J last year to accelerate production, rose 3.9 percent to their highest level in four years.Although it is too early to say how much a vaccine might cost, the GAVI global vaccines alliance announced last month it was committing up to $300 million to buy Ebola shots.

176,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) surprised investors by detailing the degree to which a strong dollar will hurt sales abroad this year, and industry watchers say Wall Street is underestimating the likely hit to other U.S.-based rivals such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N).J&J, the first large U.S. drugmaker to report fourth-quarter results, on Tuesday said sales fell 0.6 percent to $18.25 billion, but would have risen 3.9 percent if not for the stronger dollar. The 4.5 percent foreign exchange hit compared with an average 0.9 percent headwind in the first three quarters of the year. The diversified healthcare company now expects a foreign currency hit to earnings in 2015 of as much as 42 cents per share, versus the 15 cents to 20 cents it forecast in October.""Foreign exchange will be a focal point for the whole drug group"" in the fourth quarter and 2015, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. He predicted the stronger dollar will take a bigger bite out of other drugmakers' earnings than many expect, and said Pfizer and Merck are among the most vulnerable because they both derive more than 60 percent of their sales outside the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment, saying the company will discuss the impact of foreign exchange when it reports quarterly results on Jan 27. Merck officials could not immediately be reached for comment.J&J shares fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday, while the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of U.S. and European drugmakers was little changed.

177,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Jan 20 Johnson & Johnson surprised investors by detailing the degree to which a strong dollar will hurt sales abroad this year, and industry watchers say Wall Street is underestimating the likely hit to other U.S.-based rivals such as Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co.J&J, the first large U.S. drugmaker to report fourth-quarter results, on Tuesday said sales fell 0.6 percent to $18.25 billion, but would have risen 3.9 percent if not for the stronger dollar. The 4.5 percent foreign exchange hit compared with an average 0.9 percent headwind in the first three quarters of the year.The diversified healthcare company now expects a foreign currency hit to earnings in 2015 of as much as 42 cents per share, versus the 15 cents to 20 cents it forecast in October.""Foreign exchange will be a focal point for the whole drug group"" in the fourth quarter and 2015, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. He predicted the stronger dollar will take a bigger bite out of other drugmakers' earnings than many expect, and said Pfizer and Merck are among the most vulnerable because they both derive more than 60 percent of their sales outside the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment, saying the company will discuss the impact of foreign exchange when it reports quarterly results on Jan 27. Merck officials could not immediately be reached for comment.J&J shares fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday, while the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of U.S. and European drugmakers was little changed.

180,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 21 For more than eight years, Johnson & Johnson has pursued billions of dollars in damages against Boston Scientific Corp after the latter won a controversial - and ultimately ill-fated - bidding war for device maker Guidant.Now the dispute lies in the hands of a federal judge after lawyers for both companies made final presentations on Wednesday at the close of a non-jury trial in New York federal court.J&J is seeking more than $7.2 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific as Guidant's successor, an amount that one analyst has characterized as a ""major near-term risk"" for a company with a market capitalization of about $19 billion as of Wednesday.U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who oversaw the trial, did not indicate when he would rule.The dispute stems from 2005, when J&J agreed to buy Guidant for $21.5 billion. Under the deal, Guidant was permitted to consider unsolicited competing bids.In late 2005, Boston Scientific announced its intention to make an offer, which was contingent on selling some of Guidant's assets to Abbott Laboratories to satisfy antitrust concerns. J&J claims Guidant knowingly violated their contract by providing due diligence directly to Abbott. Without that breach, J&J argues, Abbott would have walked away from the deal, scuttling Boston Scientific's bid and leaving Guidant with no competing offers.""What made the breach material was that Boston Scientific was not going to make an offer if Abbott was not involved,"" said Harold Weinberger, a lawyer for J&J.David Boies, a lawyer for Boston Scientific, said Guidant relied on the advice of its attorneys in sharing information with Abbott. Boston Scientific eventually acquired Guidant for $27 billion and paid J&J a $705 million termination fee. The deal has since been widely panned as too expensive, prompting Boston Scientific to argue that J&J dodged a bullet by failing to complete the acquisition and cannot now claim any damages, even if a breach occurred.""They have not presented any evidence that they would have been better off,"" Boies said.Sullivan pressed both sides during more than two hours of closing arguments. At one point, he questioned why J&J did not aggressively challenge Guidant as soon as they became aware that Abbott had been given information in January 2006, instead of making subsequent higher bids. ""There's a glaring absence of the sorts of emails and documents you would expect if you thought you had just been hosed on a multibillion-dollar deal,"" he said.Weinberger said J&J was not fully aware of what had occurred until weeks later, after the bidding war ended.Sullivan also told Boies it seemed likely Guidant shareholders would have had no other option but to accept J&J's bid absent a formal offer from Boston Scientific.Boies argued, however, that the deal might still have fallen through, citing dissatisfaction among some shareholders over the price.The case is Johnson & Johnson v.

183,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Lawyers for thousands of women suing Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc over transvaginal mesh devices are fighting back against the company’s claim that illegal phone solicitations may have resulted in baseless lawsuits.Plaintiffs’ lawyers said in a court filing late Thursday there was “no evidence of fraud” tainting nearly 23,000 federal mesh injury lawsuits, which have been consolidated before U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in the Southern District of West Virginia. The filing came in response to a motion last week from Johnson & Johnson asking Goodwin to allow an investigation into whether women are being illegally solicited to join mesh litigation by unknown callers, some of whom seemed to have knowledge of private medical data. The company said it was concerned the calls may have resulted in bogus claims. J&J has asked Goodwin to make plaintiffs offer proof they had been injured by an Ethicon device, and have their lawyers answer questions under oath about any knowledge of solicitation calls. While strongly denouncing the “rogue call center’s shenanigans,” lead plaintiffs’ lawyers said J&J was using the calls to justify imposing unnecessary and burdensome measures that “would grind this litigation to a screeching halt.”Lead plaintiffs’ counsel said they had raised a similar issue more than a year ago with Goodwin, after several clients told them they had received, unsolicited, a letter from a call center bearing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s logo and promising $25,000 in compensation. They turned the letter over to the judge and asked him to investigate, the filing said. “We thought it was improper at the time, and still do,” said plaintiffs’ lawyer Henry Garrard in an email.  J&J could show no direct link between the calls and plaintiffs’ firms, the filing said. Furthermore, random sampling of the Ethicon cases last year showed that plaintiffs had all been implanted with mesh, although a handful had mistakenly identified the maker of their device, the filing said. Ethicon spokeswoman Samantha Lucas said the company was still reviewing the filing. “Based on the reports we received, we were compelled to report these activities to the judge,” she said in a statement. Ethicon is one of seven companies that collectively face more than 70,000 suits before Goodwin over transvaginal mesh devices, used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Women claim the devices were defective, resulting in painful complications like infection, nerve damage and bleeding.

186,"   By Mike Collett | LONDON  LONDON FIFA have rejected suggestions that major sponsors were cutting their ties with the organization because it was a ""toxic brand"", saying on Friday that they were in advanced negotiations with new sponsors eager to replace the old.Britain's Daily Telegraph revealed on Friday that three major sponsors, Continental, Castrol and Johnson & Johnson, were not renewing their contracts with world soccer's governing body.Emirates Airlines and Sony announced last year that they were also severing their ties with FIFA.But FIFA's marketing director Thierry Weil told Reuters on Friday that those companies contracts with FIFA were always due to expire at the end of last year and new ones were negotiating to take their place.""Rotations at the end of a sponsorship cycle are commonplace in the sports industry and have continuously occurred since the commercialisation of the FIFA World Cup began,"" Weil said.""It is natural that as brands’ strategies evolve they reassess their sponsorship properties. The contracts were always planned to run until the end of 2014.""As in previous FIFA World Cup cycles, we are now in advanced negotiations with a number of companies related to sponsorship agreements in all three of our categories. TOXIC BRAND  But not everyone is convinced that FIFA, who have been buffeted by one crisis after another over the last few years, is still a name sponsors want to be associated with.Damian Collins, the British MP and the guiding light behind the pressure group New FIFA Now which was launched in Brussels on Wednesday, said he believed sponsors were cutting ties as a result of the scandals and controversies that continually surround FIFA. ""FIFA is a toxic brand,"" Collins was quoted as saying in the Daily Telegraph.""I think that's why companies who care about their reputation don't want to be considered with it.""Sponsors bring in at least $1.5 billion in revenue over each four-year cycle.  Castrol had been a World Cup sponsor since 2008, Continental Tyres since 2010 and Johnson & Johnson signed a deal for a single cycle in 2011. Meanwhile the sportswear company SKINS, whose chairman Jamie Fuller was a delegate at the launch of New FIFA Now, launched a light-hearted ""non-sponsorship"" relationship with the governing body.In a statement on Friday the company said: ""The non-multi-million pound, announcement allows the company to highlight unshared brand values and confirms SKINS' contempt for an organisation which has been constantly shrouded in allegations of corruption and controversy, yet is potentially preparing to re-elect its President Sepp Blatter for an unprecedented fifth term in office.""This anti-FIFA stance is intended to be fun and engaging but it carries a very serious message in support of newfifanow.org.""(Refile to fix lit in third-last par (light-hearted sted heated)) (Editing by Mitch Phillips)",2015-01-23,JNJ,"Fri Jan 23, 2015 | 6:17am EST",New sponsors ready to replace old say beleaguered FIFA,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-soccer-fifa-sponsors-idUSKBN0KW17020150123?type=companyNews
187,"   By Natalie Grover  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the expanded use of Imbruvica, sold by Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics Inc, to treat Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare form of blood cancer for which no specific pharmaceutical therapy exists.The decision, announced more than two months before the scheduled review date, marks the fourth indication for the drug.  WM, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, was discovered more than 70 years ago. It usually worsens slowly over time and causes abnormal blood cells, known as B lymphocytes (B-cells), to grow within the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver and spleen.Imbruvica works by blocking the enzyme that allows abnormal B-cells to grow and divide.Since WM was first described, doctors have had to rely on therapies borrowed from similar cancers, said Steven Treon, who led the trial that led to the approval for expanded use. The FDA granted Imbruvica breakthrough therapy designation for WM, a status given to drugs seen as important advances in the treatment of serious diseases, but it added a warning that it could cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).TLS is a potentially life-threatening disorder that occurs when a treatment kills cancer cells so quickly that the kidneys cannot expel the breakdown products from the blood.Since its initial approval in late 2013, the number of safety warnings associated with Imbruvica have increased, said Elliot Favus of Favus Institutional Research, adding that the number of cases of TLS for Imbruvica had risen in the past year. ""We're learning a lot more about the safety of the drug and it's not as good as people originally thought when it was first approved,"" Favus said.In contrast, a potential rival drug being developed by AbbVie Inc and Roche Holding AG, ABT-199, has reduced the number of TLS cases in recent trials, he said.Imbruvica is already used to fight chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Mantle cell lymphoma. The approval for WM highlights the strength of the franchise, although the disease occurs only in up to 1,500 patients in the United States each year, Roth Capital Partner's Joseph Pantginis wrote in a note.Pharmacyclics anticipates U.S. net product revenue of about $1 billion for the drug in 2015, up from $492 million in 2014, the company said earlier this month.Pharmacyclics shares closed 1.25 percent higher at $167.47, while J&J's stock ended up about 0.9 percent at $102.38.

196,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 17 (Fitch) Boston Scientific Corp.'s (NYSE: BSX) ratings are  unaffected by its recent settlement with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) regarding  litigation associated with BSX's acquisition of Guidant in 2006, according to  Fitch Ratings.  The settlement calls for BSX to pay $600 million to JNJ during 2015. BSX will  make two $300 million dollar payments, primarily using balance sheet cash  without taking on any additional long-term debt. The agreement removes any  further litigation regarding this matter. While Fitch views the settlement as a positive development in terms of reducing  the uncertainty surrounding the potential financial liability from the lawsuit,  the $600 million dollar payment will reduce the availability of cash in the  short term. Nevertheless, Fitch believes that BSX will maintain adequate  liquidity through FCF generation, balance sheet cash and access to its revolving  credit facility. As such, BSX will be able to operate competitively with  expected improving operations and without stressing its balance sheet. In the lawsuit against BSX, JNJ alleged that Guidant knowingly violated their  acquisition agreement with JNJ by providing due diligence activities to Abbott  Laboratories (Abbott), particularly regarding its drug eluting stent platform.  JNJ stated that BSX would not have succeeded in acquiring Guidant, had Guidant  not provided that information to Abbott. Both sides presented their arguments in  U.S. District Court and were awaiting the judge's decision. The uncertainty  regarding the judge's ruling the prospects for a continued legal battle likely  helped motivate both sides to settle the dispute. The $600 million cash settlement is within the range of Fitch's forecasts and  was incorporated in the company's current credit rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Continued operational improvements that support long-term positive revenue  growth and margin stability/improvement; --An operational profile that could lead to significant and durable increases in  FCF; --Cash deployment policy and resulting capital structure that would durably  sustain leverage below 2.2 times (x)-2.3x. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following:  --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF; --Persistent increase in leverage approaching 3.0x; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Large legal settlement(s) that would need to be funded with significant debt  issuance(s). RATINGS: Fitch currently rates Boston Scientific Corp. as follows: --Long-term IDR 'BBB-'; --Unsecured bank credit facility 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

215,"   By Jessica Dye  A California jury on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon Inc unit to pay $5.7 million in the first trial over injuries blamed on the TVT Abbrevo, one of numerous transvaginal mesh products that are the subject of thousands of lawsuits.  Following more than three days of deliberations in Kern County, California, jurors found Ethicon liable for problems with the TVT Abbrevo's design and for failing to warn about its risks, according to a lawyer for plaintiff Coleen Perry. Perry was awarded $700,000 in compensatory damages and an additional $5 million in punitive damages after jurors in the Bakersfield court found Ethicon's conduct amounted to ""malice,"" her lawyer said. The verdict is the fourth win for plaintiffs suing Ethicon over transvaginal mesh. More than 36,000 lawsuits have been filed against Ethicon in state and federal courts over the devices, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Abbrevo, one of Ethicon’s newer models of mesh products, was cleared for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010 to treat stress urinary incontinence. Perry, who was implanted with it in 2011, said she began experiencing a “pulling-type” pain almost immediately after surgery.  Perry said the mesh began to erode in her body, causing pain that she said she expects to last the rest of her life, according to testimony Reuters saw on Courtroom View Network. Ethicon’s lawyers said the product was thoroughly vetted before it hit the market and that doctors considered the mesh used in the Abbrevo to be the “gold standard” for incontinence treatment.  Peter de la Cerda, a lawyer for Perry, said the verdict sent a ""clear message to Ethicon"" about its ""improper conduct in designing and marketing the Abbrevo."" Ethicon spokesman Matthew Johnson said the company believed it has strong grounds for appeal. Ethicon stands behind the safety and effectiveness of the Abbrevo, as well as its development and marketing, he added. Ethicon won one trial over mesh in federal court in West Virginia, where another trial over its mesh products started on Monday.  Ethicon, Boston Scientific Corp and C.R. Bard are among seven companies facing more than 70,000 mesh injury lawsuits in federal court and thousands of additional cases in state courts. The case is Perry et al v.

Perry, who was implanted with it in 2011, said she began experiencing a ""pulling-type"" pain almost immediately after surgery.Perry said the mesh began to erode in her body, causing pain that she said she expects to last the rest of her life, according to testimony Reuters saw on Courtroom View Network. Ethicon's lawyers said the product was thoroughly vetted before it hit the market and that doctors considered the mesh used in the Abbrevo to be the ""gold standard"" for incontinence treatment.Peter de la Cerda, a lawyer for Perry, said the verdict sent a ""clear message to Ethicon"" about its ""improper conduct in designing and marketing the Abbrevo."" Ethicon spokesman Matthew Johnson said the company believed it has strong grounds for appeal. Ethicon stands behind the safety and effectiveness of the Abbrevo, as well as its development and marketing, he added.Ethicon won one trial over mesh in federal court in West Virginia, where another trial over its mesh products started on Monday.Ethicon, Boston Scientific Corp and C.R. Bard  are among seven companies facing more than 70,000 mesh injury lawsuits in federal court and thousands of additional cases in state courts.The case is Perry et al v.

220,"   By Lindsay Dunsmuir | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A Johnson & Johnson  subsidiary pleaded guilty on Tuesday to selling liquid medicine contaminated with metal and agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the case, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday.The subsidiary, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, pleaded guilty to one federal criminal charge in the case.In 2010, the company launched mass recalls of certain children's over-the-counter-medicines, including Infants' Tylenol and Children's Motrin, made at its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania plant. It was the latest in a series of recalls at the time. There were far-reaching multiple recalls from 2008 to 2010 involving hundreds of millions of bottles and packages of consumer brands such as Tylenol, Motrin, Rolaids, Benadryl and other products due to faulty manufacturing. The recalls kept widely used products such as Children's Tylenol off pharmacy shelves and seriously tarnished J&J's once-sterling reputation.In addition to metal particles getting into liquid medicines, there were moldy odors and labeling problems. For example, the label for Sudafed allergy tablets incorrectly repeated the word ""not"" to say ""do not not divide, crush, chew or dissolve the tablet."" In the case involving metal particles, the troubles began in May 2009 when a consumer complained after noticing ""black specks"" in the bottom of a bottle of Infants' Tylenol. The specks were found to be nickel and chromium particles. In 2010, Johnson & Johnson's U.S. consumer product sales fell by more than 19 percent, a decrease of $900 million. The rash of consumer medicine recalls in 2009 and 2010 were largely responsible for the first back-to-back years of company sales declines since World War Two.Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for McNeil Consumer Healthcare, said the plea agreement ""closes a chapter"" and that the company has ""been implementing enhanced quality and oversight standards across its entire business.""As part of the agreement, McNeil also agreed to further safety measures before reopening its Fort Washington facility.

The S&P 500 energy index jumped 1.77 percent.Norfolk Southern Corp dropped 4.18 percent to $100.49 a day after it forecast a surprise drop in its first-quarter earnings and revenue.A strong dollar, cheap oil and poor weather in the eastern United States in recent months have investors bracing for a difficult March-quarter earnings season.First-quarter profits for S&P 500 companies are seen falling 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. On Jan. 1, analysts had been looking for growth of 5.3 percent. Those lowered expectations mean that companies can now more easily impress investors, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. ""This may be one of most hated earnings seasons I remember,"" Hogan said. ""We've taken those three negative headwinds and plowed them as far as we can into the worst-case scenario."" Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co rose 1.6 percent after the biggest U.S. bank by assets reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.

Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, as well as the dollar and softer global demand have been a constraint.""This provides some confirmation on the disappointing growth performance in the first quarter. The absence of a lift in the other forward-looking indicators suggests that the U.S. economic recovery is struggling to regain any traction,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Fed said. March's decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop.A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent in March, marking the third straight month of declines in mining output. Crude oil has lost more than half of its value since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity. Companies in the oil field are also either postponing or cutting back on capital expenditure projects.Separately, the Fed in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide said investment in oil and gas drilling had declined and related layoffs were reported by ""multiple"" regions.Caterpillar Inc early this year cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.Last month, utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, also weighing on industrial production.""We do not see the emerging picture as supporting the hand of those who have been arguing for an earlier Fed rate hike,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.Most economists have pushed back their expectations for the first rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe monetary policy will only be tightened in 2016. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008. Data including for retail sales, housing starts, inventories, trade and manufacturing suggest the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December quarter.U.S. Treasury prices rose as the data supported bets the Fed was likely to wait longer to raise rates. Stocks rose while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.WEAK MANUFACTURING For the first quarter, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009. Oil and gas well drilling and servicing, which tumbled at a 69.8 percent rate, accounted for the bulk of the drop in industrial output in the first quarter.While manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent in March, the first gain since last November, it fell at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, the first decline since the second quarter of 2009.The soft trend could persist for a while. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index fell to -1.19 in April from March's 6.90. This was the first negative read for the index since December.The weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been attributed to the buoyant dollar, bad weather and supply chain disruptions from the ports dispute.Softer growth in Europe and Asia, especially China where the economy expanded at its slowest pace in six years in the first quarter, has also been a drag.The dollar has gained 13 percent against the United States' main trading partners since last June, which economists say is equivalent to a 0.5 percentage point interest rate hike.""The dollar's strength may be taking some of the oomph out of factory production, which had been on a tear until December last year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at  MUFG Union Bank in New York.""Time will tell whether this is real weakness or simply a bump on the road to prosperity. Our guess remains the economy comes back strong later on this spring.""Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned  the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-04-15,JNJ,"Wed Apr 15, 2015 | 2:22pm EDT","WRAPUP 3-Mining, utilities sink U.S. industrial production",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL2N0XC10B20150415?type=companyNews

245,"   By Bill Berkrot  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned that a widely used newer class of type 2 diabetes drugs sold by AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly in partnership with Boehringer Ingleheim may cause dangerously high levels of blood acids that could require hospitalization.The oral drugs belong to a class known as SGLT2 inhibitors that work by causing blood sugar to be secreted in the urine. They include AstraZeneca's Farxiga (dapagliflozin), J&J's Invokana (canagliflozin) and Jardiance (embagliflozin) from Lilly and Boehringer.The FDA, in a warning on its website, said the medicines may lead to ketoacidosis, a serious condition where the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones.The FDA said its Adverse Event Reporting System database identified 20 cases of acidosis reported as diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors between March 2013 to June 6, 2014. It said all the affected patients required emergency room visits or hospitalization to treat the condition. Since June 2014, the agency said it had continued to receive additional adverse event reports of diabetic ketoacidosis and ketoacidosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.The FDA warning also listed three combination type 2 diabetes treatments that include an SGLT2 drug as one of its two components, J&J's Invokamet, Xigduo XR from AstraZeneca and Lilly and Boehringer's Glyxambi.The medicines became popular in part because in addition to controlling blood sugar levels, they led to modest weight loss and slightly lower blood pressure. Obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes and some older treatments cause weight gain. But the new FDA warning could help boost sales of alternative medicines, such as Merck & Co's Januvia.""Inasmuch as there will be heightened awareness of this new safety issue with the SGLT2s, it could benefit other oral diabetes drug classes such as the DPP4 inhibitors,"" Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. ""The biggest of the DPP4s, by a wide margin, is Merck's Januvia."" Januvia, which had sales of about $6 billion in 2014, is Merck's top-selling product.A series of heart safety studies, for which data recently became available, appears to have absolved the DPP4 class of concerns that had been constraining their sales.

The FDA said its Adverse Event Reporting System database identified 20 cases of acidosis reported as diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors between March 2013 to June 6, 2014. It said all the affected patients required emergency room visits or hospitalization to treat the condition.Since June 2014, the agency said it had continued to receive additional adverse event reports of diabetic ketoacidosis and ketoacidosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. The FDA warning also listed three combination type 2 diabetes treatments that include an SGLT2 drug as one of its two components, J&J's Invokamet, Xigduo XR from AstraZeneca and Lilly and Boehringer's Glyxambi.The medicines became popular in part because in addition to controlling blood sugar levels, they led to modest weight loss and slightly lower blood pressure. Obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes and some older treatments cause weight gain. But the new FDA warning could help boost sales of alternative medicines, such as Merck & Co's Januvia.""Inasmuch as there will be heightened awareness of this new safety issue with the SGLT2s, it could benefit other oral diabetes drug classes such as the DPP4 inhibitors,"" Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. ""The biggest of the DPP4s, by a wide margin, is Merck's Januvia.""Januvia, which had sales of about $6 billion in 2014, is Merck's top-selling product.A series of heart safety studies, for which data recently became available, appears to have absolved the DPP4 class of concerns that had been constraining their sales.

Invega was first approved in 2006, to be taken once a day. Three years later, the FDA approved Invega Sustenna, a longer-acting injectable version, to be taken once a month.Together, these versions raked in sales of more than half a billion in the first quarter ended March 29. A study of the third formulation, Invega Trinza, showed that more than 90 percent of patients suffering from schizophrenia did not relapse after being given the drug. The FDA had granted priority review status for Invega Trinza. The drug is expected to be commercially available by mid-June, Janssen said.Before starting on Invega Trinza, patients must be given the once-a-month treatment for at least four months, the company said.(Reporting by Vidya L Nathan in Bengaluru, Editing by Simon Jennings)",2015-05-19,JNJ,"Tue May 19, 2015 | 8:45am EDT",FDA approves longer-acting version of J&J's schizophrenia drug,http://www.reuters.com//article/johnsonjohnson-fda-idUSL3N0YA49D20150519?type=companyNews

257,"  (Adds consumer sentiment, factory data, updates markets)* First-quarter GDP revised down to show contraction* GDP shrinks at a 0.7 percent annual rate* Trade, inventories account for bulk of revision* Strong dollar weighs on Q1 corporate profitsBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 29 The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter as it buckled under the weight of unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, but activity already has rebounded modestly.The government on Friday slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month.A larger trade deficit and a smaller accumulation of inventories by businesses than previously thought accounted for much of the downward revision. There was also a modest downward revision to consumer spending.With growth estimates for the second quarter currently around 2 percent, the economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. The economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been erratic.Weak data on consumer sentiment and factory activity in the Midwest on Friday suggested that while the economy has pulled out of its first-quarter soft patch, the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production.But reports on housing and business spending plans have indicated momentum could be building, which would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Economists caution against reading too much into the slump in output. They argue the GDP figure for the first quarter was held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have cast doubts on the accuracy of GDP estimates for the first quarter, which have tended to show weakness over the last several years.They argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving ""residual"" seasonality. The government said last week it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it.""Obviously the economy is weaker than we would like it to be, but the first quarter overstates that,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. ""We're going see enough growth to keep job creation in place and allow the Fed to maintain their lift-off schedule for September.""When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up slightly and business spending on equipment was much stronger than previously estimated, taking some edge off the slump in output.U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street fell. DOLLAR, ENERGY DRAG Apart from the statistical quirk, the economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, was hammered by a sharp decline in investment spending in the energy sector as companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton  responded to the plunge in crude oil prices.Spending on mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a 48.6 percent pace in the first quarter, the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009.Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February chopped at least one percentage point from growth.Trade was hit both by the strong dollar and the ports labor dispute, which weighed on exports through the quarter and then unleashed a flood of imports in March after it was resolved. That resulted in a trade deficit that subtracted 1.90 percentage points from GDP, the largest drag in 31 years, instead of the 1.25 percentage points reported last month.The GDP report also showed after-tax corporate profits declined 8.7 percent. That was the largest drop in a year and the second quarterly fall, as the strong dollar burdened multinational corporations and oil prices hurt domestic firms.Multinationals like Microsoft Corp, household products maker Procter & Gamble Co and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.Unlike 2014, when growth snapped back quickly after a dismal first quarter, the dollar and investment cuts by energy companies continue to hamstring activity.But growth could accelerate as the year progresses.The value of inventory accumulated in the first quarter was revised down to an increase of $95 billion from the lofty $110.3 billion rise reported last month.That meant inventories contributed 0.33 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.74 percentage point, suggesting warehouses are not bulging with unwanted merchandise and businesses have latitude to order more goods from factories.While consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent rate, it could finally get a lift from the considerable savings households amassed because of cheaper gasoline.Personal savings increased at a robust $726.4 billion pace.""The outlook for the economy is very encouraging,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-05-29,JNJ,"Fri May 29, 2015 | 11:56am EDT",WRAPUP 4-U.S. economy contracts in Q1; dollar hurts corporate profits,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSLNNTGEBB220150529?type=companyNews
258,"  COPENHAGEN, June 8 Shares in Genmab  rose almost 3 percent on Monday after partner Johnson and Johnson's announcement late on Friday that the companies have applied to U.S. authorities for a licence to market their blood cancer drug daratumumab.The multiple myeloma treatment received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, which SydBank analyst Soren Lontoft said could reduce the licence approval process to four months from the more usual six months.Breakthrough status is granted by the FDA when a drug shows significant improvement over available treatment of life-threatening illnesses. Friday's statement said that the biologics licence application (BLA) would be supported mainly by Phase II study data, which is allowed for treatments given breakthrough status, and additional research can be submitted during the process.Analysts at Jyske Bank said on Monday that Phase II results presented to the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting on May 30 boosted their confidence in daratumumab's potential. ""We believe the presented Phase II results on daratumumab in multiple myeloma for patients who have run out of options were very encouraging,"" the bank wrote in a research note. Genmab granted Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, an exclusive worldwide licence to develop and sell daratumumab.Monday was the first day of trading on the Copenhagen stock exchange since Friday's announcement. Genmab shares were up 2.8 percent at 1236 GMT, outperforming a 0.9 percent fall for the Danish benchmark index.

259,"  (Adds details, housing data, updates markets)* Industrial production falls 0.2 percent in May* Manufacturing output slips 0.2 percent* Mining production drops 0.3 percent* New York state factory activity gauge falls in JuneBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, June 15 U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May as manufacturing and mining activity remained weak, a sign that a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector continued to constrain economic growth.The softness in the production side of the economy contrasts starkly with recent upbeat data on retail sales, employment, consumer and small business confidence, which have pointed to a growth pickup after a sluggish start to the second quarter.""Signs of spring remain largely absent in the industrial sector. The challenges of the stronger dollar and drop in energy  prices linger,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.Industrial output slipped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Industrial production has been weak since December, and  economists had expected output to rise 0.2 percent last month.The data was likely to get the attention of Fed policymakers who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists said.The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at this week's policy meeting, but rather to wait until later this year. Industrial production last month was held down by a 0.2 percent drop in manufacturing output. Manufacturing has been whacked by a strong dollar, which has eroded the profits of multinational corporations.Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.The dollar has gained about 13.2 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June largely on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy.U.S. financial markets were little moved by Monday's data as investors kept a wary eye on Greece, which inched closer to defaulting on its debt. U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt rose. WEAK ORDERS Although motor vehicle production, machinery, and computer and electronic products increased last month, it was not enough to offset the drag on manufacturing output from declines in the production of electrical equipment, appliances and components, fabricated metal products and wood products.Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and more than 72 percent of industrial production, was also weighed down by falling output of nondurable goods such as food and petroleum products.It is likely to remain weak in the months ahead.In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index dropped to a reading of minus 1.98 in June from 3.09 in May.That was the weakest reading since January 2013 and the second negative reading in the past three months. A gauge of new orders contracted, while shipments edged down. Though a measure of unfilled orders increased last month, it remained in contraction territory, indicating order books remained weak. ""Manufacturers will continue to struggle with the impact of the dollar's rise for some time yet,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.But given manufacturing's small share of the economy and recent signs of a sharp pickup in growth in the non-factory sectors, Ashworth said ""there is every reason to believe that GDP growth will average between 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent annualized over the rest of this year.""That upbeat assessment was bolstered by a third report showing confidence among homebuilders vaulted to an eight-month high in June, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining traction. Housing is expected to take up some of the slack from weak manufacturing.GDP contracted in the first quarter, slammed by bad weather, port disruptions, dollar strength and energy sector spending cuts.Last month, mining production fell 0.3 percent, the fifth straight monthly decline, as oil and gas well drilling and servicing fell 7.9 percent after plunging 14.5 percent in April.That took the cumulative drop since the end of 2014 to 51.8 percent. But the pace of decline in oil and gas well drilling and servicing is moderating, suggesting the worst of the spending cuts is over.Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year.Oil and gas production, however, increased 0.5 percent in May. Unseasonably warm weather last month lifted demand for air conditioning, leading to a 0.2 percent increase in utilities production.The amount of industrial capacity in use last month fell to its lowest level since January 2014.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao)",2015-06-15,JNJ,"Mon Jun 15, 2015 | 1:35pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. industrial output hurt by weakness in manufacturing, mining",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0Z10NV20150615?type=companyNews

269,"   By Ben Hirschler  Johnson & Johnson has begun a clinical trial of a two-shot Ebola vaccine in Sierra Leone, underlining its determination to push ahead with development, even as the epidemic fades out in West Africa.The new study will investigate the experimental product's safety and its ability to provoke an immune response to the disease, which the World Health Organization says has killed more than 11,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Last week, for the first time since the Ebola outbreak was declared in March 2014, there were no new confirmed cases of the deadly disease in those countries, according to the U.N. agency.Some survivors still suffer long-term effects from the virus, which can persist in parts of the body after clearing the blood, including a Scottish nurse taken ill in Sierra Leone last year who is now back in hospital for more treatment.The world already has one successful Ebola vaccine, with Merck and NewLink Genetics' product proving 100-percent effective in a clinical study in Guinea in July. But scientists and drug companies are continuing to research the potential of alternatives, since different kinds of vaccines may be better suited for different population groups. ""Both regulators and governments around the world have encouraged us to continue,"" Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, told Reuters.Campaign groups such as Medecins Sans Frontieres are also keen to see multiple manufacturers in order to have competition in the vaccine market to ensure lower prices and ample supply. J&J, which is working with Bavarian Nordic in developing its vaccine, said on Friday that trial recruitment was underway in Sierra Leone and the first volunteers had received their initial vaccine dose. This is the first study conducted of the so-called prime-boost vaccine regimen in a West African country affected by the recent Ebola epidemic.J&J's vaccine uses a combination of two components to strengthen the immunity and make it last longer. The U.S. healthcare company said it had scaled up production to more than 800,000 two-shot doses and had the capacity to produce 2 million if needed. Scientific experts believe the success of Merck and NewLink's vaccine suggests other products in trials should also prove effective.Although these alternatives may not be tested in preventing Ebola cases, given the current lack of disease, they could still be licensed and readied for use in future outbreaks based on human immune response results and data from non-human primate experiments.GlaxoSmithKline is also working on an Ebola vaccine.

272,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said the proven ability of Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) rival Jardiance diabetes drug to save lives in a large clinical trial is a benefit that will likely be seen in the entire class of drugs, including J&J's own approved Invokana treatment.Dominic Caruso, J&J's chief financial officer, on Tuesday gave his optimistic view of the new drug class, called SGLT2 inhibitors, during a conference call with industry analysts to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings.Lilly last month said that a three-year study showed Jardiance slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack and stroke - a finding that could make it a mainstay diabetes treatment.""We do think there's a positive effect to the overall class as a result of the cardiovascular data that Lilly shared,"" Caruso said. J&J expects to learn whether Invokana also saves lives by 2017, when it completes its own large cardiovascular 'outcomes' trial, showing whether its pill also prevents fatal heart attacks and strokes.U.S. regulators require drugmakers to conduct large cardiovascular safety trials for diabetes drugs. The studies, which take years, are typically started long before the medicines are actually approved. The safety studies are also able to determine unexpected benefits of a medicine.  Global sales of Invokana almost doubled in the quarter to $340 million, making it by far the market leader and putting the new medicine on track to become a blockbuster product. Invokana in 2013 became the first approved member of the SGLT2 class in the United States, followed in 2014 by Jardiance and AstraZeneca Plc's (AZN.L) Farxiga.The drug class works by increasing excretion of excess blood sugar from the kidneys. The drugs have also been associated with slight reductions in blood pressure and body weight, factors which researchers say could not have alone accounted for the surprisingly robust survival benefit seen in Jardiance's large study. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May warned that SGLT2 inhibitors can cause a dangerous buildup of acid in the bloodstream, called ketoacidosis.Louise Mehrota, J&J's head of investor relations, said on the conference call that Invokana sales have grown sharply despite the FDA warning and that ketoacidosis had only been seen in about 0.1 percent of patients who took Invokana in late-stage trials.

278,"   By Jessica Dye  Oct 16 - Johnson & Johnson has lost its bid to keep three lawsuits that bring together claims from more than 200 plaintiffs alleging a link between talcum-powder products and ovarian cancer from returning to state court in St. Louis. All three cases had been removed by J&J to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, and the company had argued that they were ""mass actions"" that belonged in federal court. But the federal judges overseeing those suits agreed that because plaintiffs' counsel had never formally proposed trying all three together, they were not ""mass actions"" and could stay in the state court where they were filed.

284,"  A long-acting two-drug injection given once every eight weeks worked as well as three daily pills in suppressing HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to a clinical trial backed by Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline.Paul Stoffels, J&J’s head of pharmaceuticals, said the finding offered a potentially ""transformational"" way to fight HIV, if the result is confirmed in larger final-stage trials. He believes the combination could be on the market by 2020.The mix of J&J's rilpivirine and cabotegravir, from GSK's HIV unit ViiV Healthcare, proved just as good as taking three daily pills at maintaining minimal viral levels in HIV-infected patients when given either monthly or every two months.Patients getting injections every month had viral suppression of 94 percent after 32 weeks, while the suppression rate was 95 percent for those receiving treatment every eight weeks. By comparison, patients on tablets had a suppression rate of 91 percent. During a research and development update for investors in New York on Tuesday, GSK said ViiV's cabotegravir was one of the highlights of its new-drug pipeline.  GSK has a majority stake in ViiV, alongside minority holders Pfizer and Shionogi.A late-stage study of a second combination, J&J's rilpivirine and ViiV's dolutegravir, has already begun.

291,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson and Alphabet Inc's life sciences unit have formed an independent company to create far smaller, smarter and less costly robotic-assisted systems for surgery than those sold now by other companies, J&J said on Thursday.Creation of the new company, Verb Surgical Inc, follows an announcement in March by J&J and Google Inc of their plans to pool their technologies and expertise to create robotics for the operating room. Google has since changed its name to Alphabet, and its life sciences unit is now called Verily.J&J's Ethicon division, world leader in equipment for general surgery, designed a basic prototype of the robot last year and expects it to be a ""disruptive"" alternative to existing products, Gary Pruden, global chairman of J&J's medical devices group, said in an interview. Current robotic systems, including those sold by market leader Intuitive Surgical Inc, are the size of a compact car and require the surgeon to sit at a control panel about 10 feet from the patient, Pruden said.Verb's robot will be about 20 percent the size, allow the surgeon to work closer to the patient and likely be considerably less expensive than current systems, which can cost $2 million or more, he said. And while robots today are used largely to remove cancerous prostate glands and in gynecological surgery, Verb's system would be designed for wider use, including thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and bariatric weight loss procedures, J&J said.It would come loaded with technologies from Alphabet, including ""machine learning,"" in which the robot could analyze a video library of images from hundreds of previous surgeries in order to instruct the surgeon where to cut. Pruden said further development of Verb's robot will take a few more years. ""Our goal is to have a lower-cost product, with the smallest footprint, with greater capability, that helps to raise the standard of care,"" Pruden said. ""That would be a market disruption.""Scott Huennekens, former chief executive of medical imaging company Volcano Corp, has been named CEO of Verb, which will be headquartered in Mountain View, California. Verily already has several projects in the works, including the development of a smart contact lens in partnership with  Swiss drugmaker Novartis that has an embedded glucose sensor. It would allow diabetics to monitor themselves continuously by measuring the blood sugar in their tears.

295,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Eli Lilly and Co's new Jardiance diabetes treatment has begun stealing market share from rival drugs in its class, the company said on Tuesday, bolstered by clinical trial data showing it slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with Type 2 diabetes.In a three-year study whose results were released last summer, Jardiance became the first diabetes therapy to show robust ability to reduce cardiovascular death. Jardiance, which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson's $1.3 billion-a-year Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc's Farxiga. They flush excess blood sugar from the kidneys.Jardiance now accounts for 25 percent of new U.S. patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, up from a 15 percent share before the Jardiance trial data were released in August, Lilly said on Tuesday. In addition, use of sulfonylureas, a class of inexpensive generics that patients typically try before being moved to a costlier newer drug, has declined as Jardiance sales have taken off, Lilly said in a conference call describing its 2016 earnings expectations.     Johnson & Johnson was not immediately available for comment.The positive results of the trial have not yet been included in the drug's label and it could take medical societies another year or longer to draft new treatment guidelines incorporating the data.""Once we get the label (change), we believe Jardiance will become the leader in the SGLT2 class,"" Lilly diabetes head Enrique Conterno said in an interview on Tuesday. The details about Jardiance helped lift Lilly shares on Tuesday as much as 3 percent.There has been a push away from the sulfonylureas because of the risk of hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, said Dr. Jason Gaglia of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.Some insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have placed Jardiance ahead of Invokana on their lists of preferred covered treatments known as formularies, Gaglia said. Guggenheim Partners analyst Tony Butler said some payers have discouraged use of Jardiance, whose $4,000 annual cost greatly exceeds that of inexpensive generics that are mainstays of early treatment.But Butler said he expects them to relent once the label change is made and medical societies endorse the drug. Jardiance could generate annual sales of up to $5 billion, he said, with Lilly splitting profits with its partner, Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany.Data from Invokana's long-term heart safety study is not expected until 2017, followed by Forxiga's data in 2019.

""That could involve acquisitions, but it will also involve investing in our own internal programs."" The company's consumer medical devices, vision care and diabetes care will not be affected, J&J said. (www.investor.jnj.com/MDFAQ)J&J's medical device sales approached $19 billion in the first nine months of 2015, but fell 10.4 percent, making the wide array of products its poorest-performing segment. The company expects pretax restructuring charges of $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion in connection with these plans, of which about $600 million will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.""It's about realigning resources around priority platforms,"" Gary Pruden, head of J&J's medical device unit, said in an interview.Pruden said J&J is not satisfied with demand for its artificial knees, devices for trauma and some surgical products and wants to improve them with greater attention and resources. He said the company will ""de-emphasize"" other device areas, but declined to identify them. Leerink analysts said the announcement meant that an acquisition was still in the cards for J&J, given that it had about $37 billion in cash as of the end of the third quarter.""We continue to believe JNJ is an active acquirer with a focus likely heavily weighted toward its lagging medical devices business,"" they wrote in a note.J&J also reiterated its full-year 2015 forecast, and said the restructuring in the devices business would not affect the $10 billion share repurchase program. The restructuring is expected to produce annualized pretax cost savings of $800 million to $1 billion, J&J said. Most savings are expected by the end of 2018, including about $200 million in 2016.J&J employs about 60,000 within its devices unit, representing almost half its global workforce of about 127,000.

They had urged the court to hear the case in order to clarify what constitutes ""clear evidence"" that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would have rejected a label warning about the diseases at issue in the lawsuit. If regulators did not think a warning was necessary, they argued, companies should not be liable for failing to warn consumers about that risk.Reckis and her parents sued J&J and McNeil in 2007, claiming they were not warned about the link between the active ingredient in Children's Motrin, ibuprofen, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, two rare, related skin conditions. Reckis said she developed toxic epidermal necrolysis when she was 7 years old after receiving several doses of Children's Motrin, leading her to lose 95 percent of the top layer of her skin and suffer other serious injuries, including heart failure, stroke and an aneurysm.A Massachusetts jury found J&J and McNeil liable for failing to warn Reckis about those side effects and awarded her and her parents $63 million. With interest, the judgment totals $140 million. J&J said the case should have been dismissed because the FDA had declined to grant a petition from several doctors and consumers seeking to add the names of those skin conditions to the warning label because they are unfamiliar to most consumers, and instead referenced potential redness, rash and blisters that are symptoms of those conditions.The company said this constituted ""clear evidence"" that such warnings were unnecessary.

A Massachusetts jury found J&J and McNeil liable for failing to warn Reckis about those side effects and awarded her and her parents $63 million. With interest, the judgment totals $140 million. J&J said the case should have been dismissed because the FDA had declined to grant a petition from several doctors and consumers seeking to add the names of those skin conditions to the warning label because they are unfamiliar to most consumers, and instead referenced potential redness, rash and blisters that are symptoms of those conditions. The company said this constituted ""clear evidence"" that such warnings were unnecessary. But the Massachusetts Supreme Court disagreed, saying the FDA's past actions did not indicate how it would rule on proposed changes from J&J, and affirmed the verdict last year. A J&J spokeswoman said the company sympathized with the plaintiff but was disappointed with the high court's decision not to hear the appeal. A lawyer for the Reckises, Michael Bogdanow, said they were grateful and relieved the Supreme Court had affirmed the judgment.

312,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Artisan Partners, a major shareholder in Johnson & Johnson, has urged several activists to pressure the consumer products giant to consider major changes that include a potential split, according to sources and documents.             Artisan has asked Johnson & Johnson’s management to consider separating its three divisions – consumer products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices – into standalone companies in hopes of unlocking up to $90 billion in enterprise value, said sources familiar with the matter. Artisan, which manages nearly $100 billion, also suggested that Johnson & Johnson consider replacing board members, and reviewing standards for executive pay and financial reporting, documents seen by Reuters showed.In a presentation to Johnson & Johnson last year that was seen by Reuters, Artisan said the firm has significantly underperformed its peers across each of its major divisions, due partly to opaque financial reporting and flawed executive compensation.    It also said the company’s conglomerate structure has caused the it to trade at a substantial discount relative to more focused peers.          The heightened pressure on Johnson & Johnson comes as rival healthcare companies increasingly focus on a handful of areas of competitive advantage, while exiting other areas through divestitures or spin offs.Johnson & Johnson posted fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat forecasts, but gave a 2016 revenue outlook that was below analysts' estimates. The firm also said earlier in January that it was slashing 3,000 jobs in its struggling medical device division. A Johnson & Johnson spokesperson declined to comment, and referred to remarks that the firm made in an investor presentation on Tuesday.    “Because of our broad base across healthcare, we are uniquely positioned to be a partner of choice,” Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson & Johnson, had said on Tuesday.  “This broad-based structure has helped us deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance.”     In 2006, rival pharmaceutical giant Pfizer sold its consumer products division to Johnson & Johnson for $17 billion, becoming a focused play on drugs. Pfizer is now considering separating its patented drugs from its generics division.

322,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORKThe $72 million verdict this week against Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in a U.S. case alleging links between talc-based powder and ovarian cancer has prompted global headlines, social media buzz and calls to lawyers from would-be plaintiffs.But the attention-grabbing judgment is no guarantee future plaintiffs will be able to convince juries the company's products caused their illnesses.About 1,200 similar cases are pending, primarily in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, but the facts are different in every one.And even in cases with similar evidence and expert testimony, juries in mass personal-injury litigation cancome to different conclusions. While the survivors of Jacqueline Fox were awarded $72 million by a St. Louis jury Monday, jurors in a federal court action in South Dakota - the only other talc case to go to trial - found in 2013 that J&J had been negligent but declined to award damages to plaintiff Deane Berg.Like Fox, Berg alleged her ovarian cancer was caused by her decades-long use of J&J's talc-powder products for feminine hygiene, and jurors in both cases heard testimony about studies linking talc to cancer risks. But, unlike Fox, who passed away several months before the trial began, Berg was in remission at the time of the trial, according to court documents. In addition to factual differences among cases, venue can affect outcomes. Some state courts are considered more plaintiff-friendly than federal courts, which have stricter rules for the admission of evidence and expert testimony, said lawyers involved in the litigation. One juror in the Missouri case, Jerome Kendrick, said in an interview with Reuters that he and other jurors were especially swayed by testimony from plaintiffs' medical experts and  documents showing J&J employees discussing talc powder's possible cancer risk. ""The problem I had is that, according to inter office documents, J&J was aware of the potential concerns,"" Kendrick said. ""And it really looked like instead of trying to investigate, they started talking about how to combat what would eventually be a court case.""J&J has said that ""decades of sound science"" prove that talc is safe. The company on Tuesday issued a statement expressing sympathy for Fox’s family but disagreeing with the verdict. It also said it is exploring its post-trial options.  UNDER THE RADAR Talc litigation got its start in 2009, when Berg filed her lawsuit. The Fox lawsuit was selected by plaintiffs' lawyers as the first to go to trial in Missouri, to serve as an early bellwether of how similar cases in that venue might fare.The litigation flew largely under the public’s radar until jurors returned the award for the family of Fox, who died in October at 62. The plaintiffs said Fox used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder for feminine hygiene daily for 35 years before she was diagnosed three years ago with ovarian cancer.  It has resonated with the public far more than the Berg case, which “didn’t get headlines because they didn’t award any damages,” said R. Allen Smith, a Missouri-based lawyer who represented both the Fox family and Berg. More cases may be filed soon, and lawyers at several plaintiffs’ firms who worked on the Fox case said they are investigating thousands of additional claims. Still, the talc cases represent a relatively small portion  of the tens of thousands of lawsuits J&J is facing over its many products. For instance, it is the target of more than 44,000 cases from women who say they were harmed by pelvic mesh devices made by its Ethicon unit, and more than 8,000 against its DePuy subsidiary regarding Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip systems. The next J&J talc trial is set for April in St. Louis, and additional trial dates have been set for later this year. To be successful, plaintiffs must make both a general link between talc and ovarian cancer and show that J&J's products - as opposed to something else - are to blame for their cancer. In spite of the increased interest in the litigation following the Fox verdict, attorney Danielle Mason of Beasley Allen, who was part of the team representing the Fox family at trial, said she expected J&J to fight hard to defend itself in upcoming trials.

The Phase 3 study showed Stelara induced remissions in moderate to severe Crohn's disease patients who had previously failed to benefit from TNF inhibitors, a leading class of medicines for the inflammatory bowel disease. Those treatments include J&J's own Remicade and AbbVie Inc's Humira.J&J presented the favorable data on Friday at the 11th Congress of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization in Amsterdam.

Stelara is now awaiting U.S. approval as a treatment for the condition, based on results of that earlier trial.  The drug, which works by blocking two inflammation-causing proteins called IL-12 and IL-23, is one of J&J's biggest, with sales last year of almost $2.5 billion. It is approved in the United States for adults with moderate to severe psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition caused by an overactive immune system.Crohn's is a chronic inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss and fever.

It can lead to complications such as infections, fractures and kidney dysfunction.In 2012, about 39,000 people suffered from multiple myeloma in the European Union, according to the EMA.

345,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK After lagging a six-year healthcare sector run fueled by fast-growing biotech companies, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares have beaten the group in 2016 as investors turn to safety in rocky equity markets.But with the stock price now hovering near its $110.35 record high, that strategy may be in doubt. J&J shares already have risen to the level that the average analyst has targeted for them, and sell at a healthy premium to large pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer (PFE.N) and Merck (MRK.N). Relative to their own future earnings, the shares are more expensive than they have been in more than a year.""What I am more concerned at this juncture is, do we see more follow-through or do we see profit taking?"" said Arthur Henderson, portfolio manager of the global healthcare equity fund at the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System, where he has recently sold some J&J shares so they account for a smaller part of the fund's holdings.J&J shares could build on their gains if investors rekindle worries about the broader economy or continue to hide from concerns facing the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, and some analysts are optimistic about the company’s pipeline of experimental medicines. But, ultimately, the company will have to produce enough earnings growth to justify the higher prices.On that front, the company faces a fresh competitive threat to its biggest drug franchise. U.S. regulators earlier this month approved a rival version of the company's Remicade treatment for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. J&J's first-quarter report, due on April 19, is expected to show earnings up 6 percent over the same quarter a year ago, on a 0.6 percent increase in sales, according to Thomson Reuters data. Wall Street analysts are predicting fairly consistent annual earnings growth between 5 percent to 6 percent over the next few years.In January, the company projected that its calendar year 2016 profits would ultimately be up 5 percent to 8 percent over 2015 and it would aim to significantly increase its operating margins.""Most pharmaceutical companies have cut fat over the past years and my sense is what it implies is they can cut some extra fat,"" said Tony Butler, analyst at Guggenheim Securities. J&J's product diversity makes it more immune than other drug stocks to political pressures on the cost of medicines.The company's pharmaceutical unit accounted for 45 percent of its $70 billion in sales last year, with medical devices totaling more than a third and over-the-counter medicines and other consumer products making up the rest.The shares are up 7 percent in 2016 against a 3-percent decline for the S&P healthcare sector .SPXHC. The company's shares had underperformed the sector every year dating back to 2009 as J&J also grappled with a slew of product recalls and manufacturing setbacks for its consumer division. At 16.6 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the stock is still slightly cheaper than the valuation for the overall S&P 500 .SPX.Investors also are drawn to J&J's 2.7-percent dividend yield, which nonetheless lags Merck and Pfizer, which both yield more than 3 percent.""People right now are paying up quite a bit for that safety piece of it,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who puts fair value for the shares at $102. ""I think it’s overvalued, but I do think there are characteristics in the economy and political landscape that bode well for J&J.""

349,"   By Jessica Dye  April 22 - Five plaintiffs suing Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy unit over Pinnacle hip implants have asked a federal judge in Texas to let them collect the full $360 million in punitive damages they were awarded last month, calling a state cap that could reduce it to less than $10 million unconstitutional. In a brief filed Thursday, lawyers for the five plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in the Northern District of Texas to ignore the cap because it is based on a formula that takes into account the economic damages awarded to plaintiffs for things such as lost earning potential.

350,"   By Jessica Dye  Jurors in Missouri heard closing arguments Friday following a three-week state court trial over claims that Johnson & Johnson's talc-based powders caused a woman to develop ovarian cancer. The case brought by Gloria Ristesund, who said she used J&J talc powder for feminine hygiene for decades, is the second to go to trial this year in St. Louis, where most of the more than 1,200 similar cases are pending.

351,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) was ordered by a U.S. jury on Monday to pay $55 million to a woman who said that using the company’s talc-powder products for feminine hygiene caused her to develop ovarian cancer.The verdict, which J&J plans to appeal, was the second straight trial loss for the company, which is facing about 1,200 lawsuits accusing it of not adequately warning consumers about its talc-based products' cancer risks. Following a three-week trial in Missouri state court, jurors deliberated for about a day before returning a verdict for Gloria Ristesund. She was awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages. J&J spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc. The company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products' safety, she said. Ristesund said she used J&J’s talc-based powder products – which include the well-known Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder – on her genitals for decades. According to her lawyers, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a hysterectomy and related surgeries. Her cancer is now in remission.Jere Beasley, whose firm represents Ristesund, said his client was gratified with the verdict. The jury's decision should ""end the litigation"" and compel J&J to settle the remaining cases, he said. J&J shares were down 18 cents in after-hours trading to $112.57.The verdict followed a $72 million jury award from the same court in February to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer after years of using talc powder for feminine hygiene. That verdict, which J&J is appealing, sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits among plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as consumers familiar with J&J's powder products. But scientists have told Reuters the evidence of a real danger is inconclusive.Plaintiffs in talc litigation, which is concentrated in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, have accused J&J of failing for years to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer. J&J has said it acted properly in developing and marketing the products. The only other case to be tried involving talc powder and ovarian cancer resulted in a mixed verdict in South Dakota federal court in 2013. While those jurors found J&J was negligent, they awarded no damages to the plaintiff, whose cancer was in remission at the time of the trial. Reuters viewed the proceedings on Courtroom View Network.

In February, just before jurors in state court in St. Louis, Missouri awarded $72 million to the family of Jacqueline Fox - whose lawsuit claimed J&J failed to warn about the risks that using talc powder for feminine hygiene can cause ovarian cancer - plaintiffs' firms and other mass-tort advertisers spent just $16,000 to air 96 television ads about talc powder and ovarian cancer. The next month, spending had jumped to more than $865,000 for 1,400 ads, according to data about television advertising provided to Reuters by X Ante.

353,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'AAA' rating to Johnson &  Johnson's (JNJ) euro notes offering. The Rating Outlook is Stable. JNJ intends  to use the net proceeds from the issuance for share repurchases, debt reduction  and general corporate purposes. A complete list of JNJ's ratings follows at the  end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The company's 'AAA' rating reflects the following: --JNJ continues to generate strong operational and financial performance,  despite select near-term headwinds. --Biosimilar competition for Remicade in Europe, potential U.S. biosimilar  competition for Remicade in late-2016/early-2017 and adverse foreign exchange  movement will weigh on revenues during 2016, but the company's operating and  financial trends remain positive. --Fitch expects that JNJ will maintain a commitment to deploying cash for  acquisitions, collaborations and internal investment opportunities that it  believes will support long-term profitable growth. --Fitch believes JNJ will operate with leverage consistent with its 'AAA' rating  and with solid liquidity supported by significant cash balances and ample access  to credit markets. Growth Despite Headwinds: Fitch expects that JNJ will continue to generate  moderate intermediate-term top-line growth, despite facing a number of  challenges during 2016 and beyond. The company continues to bring innovative new  products to market and expand the utilization of established products and  franchises. Nevertheless, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and competition in  select franchises will likely dampen reported sales growth during 2016. Remicade  faced biosimilar competition in Europe during 2015, which modestly reduced  year-over-year sales in those affected countries. Fitch expects this trend to  continue during at least the four-year forecast period. In addition, biosimilars  could challenge Remicade in the U.S. as early as late-2016/early-2017. Innovation-Driven Long-Term Organic Growth: JNJ pursues innovation across all  three of its business segments, which provides it with favorable long-term  growth prospects, as well as opportunities to support margins. Research and  development (R&D) intensity is greatest in its biopharmaceutical business,  followed by the medical device segment. The company also pursues collaborations  and outright acquisitions to supplement its internal new product development  efforts. This strategy has produced a significant number of innovative,  value-added medical therapies and products. While the consumer business is not  as R&D intensive, innovation is still a key component in defending and advancing  JNJ's franchises in this segment. Broad Portfolio Mitigates Risk: JNJ operates with three business segments and a  large diversified product portfolio, reducing its operational and financial  reliance on any individual product. It employs a decentralized business model  with its various franchises to promote receptivity to their respective markets,  while maintaining a strong cultural-centric philosophy driven by its  longstanding credo. The company develops and manufactures consumer  healthcare-related products, medical devices and pharmaceutical/biologic  therapies. Its diverse business model also enables JNJ to pursue a broad array  of treatment advancements that offer growth opportunities. JNJ's largest selling product, Remicade, accounts for roughly 9.6% of sales. It  is also a biologic, which typically faces patent slopes as opposed to patent  cliffs like traditional, small-molecule drugs. This dynamic mitigates the risk  of generic/biosimilar competition. The next three largest products, in total,  account for less than 10% of company sales. In addition, Fitch views the  company's patent expiration risk as manageable. Free Cash Flow (FCF) for Growth and Shareholder Returns: Fitch anticipates that  JNJ will produce strong annual FCF during the forecast period of $6 billion -  $6.5 billion. Moderately improving margins, aided by an improving sales mix and  a continued focus on costs should support solid FCF, despite near-term  operational challenges.  JNJ will likely remain acquisitive, focusing on targets or products that offer  innovation and growth in the health care sector. Fitch expects the company to  finance its transactions within the context of its 'AAA' credit profile.  Shareholder-focused activities, such as dividend increases and share repurchases  will likely continue, and Fitch believes the company will largely finance these  with FCF. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for JNJ's 'AAA' rating include  the following: --Low-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 and 2017, improving incrementally in  the following three years. --Margin improvement driven by favorable product mix and an ongoing focus on  cost control during the intermediate term. --Annual FCF of $6 billion - $6.5 billion during 2016 and 2017.  --Leverage to range between 0.7x and 0.9x with moderately increasing levels of  debt.  --Capital deployment priorities balanced between acquisitions and share  repurchases, with the mix depending on the availability and valuation of  strategically appropriate targets. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its four-year forecast  horizon, a negative rating action could occur because of some combination of a  deteriorating operating performance and leveraging transactions. Fitch believes  the company's broadly diversified healthcare-related franchises make it more  likely that a negative rating action would be prompted by a leveraging  transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Three key rating metrics for JNJ's 'AAA' rating are the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0x gives no flexibility (reported Jan. 3, 2016 at 2.5x); --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x gives no flexibility (reported Jan. 3, 2016 at  0.84x); --Net debt of $4 billion - $5 billion gives no flexibility (reported Jan. 3,  2016 at a net cash position of $19.1 billion). LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets.  Moderate growth and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate  $7.6 billion of FCF during the LTM period ended Jan. 3, 2016. JNJ had  approximately $38.4 billion in cash plus short-term marketable securities and  access to $10 billion in short-term borrowings on Jan. 3, 2016.  Debt Structure: JNJ had approximately $19.3 billion in debt, including $4.6  billion in short-term debt on Jan. 3, 2016, with approximately $2.4 billion of  long-term debt maturing in 2016, $1.8 billion in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2018.  Fitch expects that the company will refinance the vast majority of its upcoming  maturities.

J&J said in a statement that the lawsuit was ""unjustified"" and could discourage women from seeking treatment for incontinence symptoms.""The evidence will show that Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the marketing of our pelvic mesh products,"" said spokeswoman Samantha Lucas. J&J is one of several manufacturers that sold the devices to treat conditions like stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women. Those companies are facing tens of thousands of individual lawsuits from plaintiffs who said they were injured by the mesh's poor design and substandard materials, which plaintiffs say led to serious complications that require surgery to repair.According to California's attorney general, J&J sold more than 787,000 pelvic mesh devices in the United States from 2008 until 2014, including more than 42,000 in California. Also on Tuesday, Washington state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, filed a similar consumer-protection lawsuit against J&J over its marketing of pelvic mesh devices.Over the past several years, the devices have come under increasing scrutiny by regulators as well as private litigants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it has received thousands of reports of complications in connection with mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse.Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration said it was reclassifying mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse transvaginally from class II, or moderate risk, to class III, for high-risk devices, which will require manufacturers to submit extensive data to establish the devices' safety.

367,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson's therapy for advanced multiple myeloma sharply reduced the risk of disease progression when taken with two standard treatments for the blood cancer, according to research the company hopes will pave the way for wider use of the treatment.The drug, Darzalex, received U.S. approval in November for use by itself among patients who had received at least three prior treatments for myeloma, a cancer of infection-fighting white blood cells. Data from a late-stage trial involving 498 patients who had previously undergone one or more myeloma treatments was released on Sunday. In the study, one group received Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's Velcade and the steroid dexamethasone, while the other group received Darzalex in combination with those two drugs. After more than seven months, 61 percent fewer patients taking the Darzalex combination experienced a worsening of their disease compared with those taking the standard two-drug regimen, meeting the trial's main goal. The median time to progression of disease has not yet been reached for the Darzalex group, compared with 7.2 months for patients taking the two-drug combo.The study was stopped in March after an independent data monitoring committee found the Darzalex regimen showed a statistically significant benefit. Some 19 percent of patients in the Darzalex group showed no further sign of disease, versus 9 percent of those taking  Velcade and dexamethasone. Significant disease reduction was seen in 83 percent taking the Darzalex regimen, versus 63 percent in the two-drug combination.The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in Chicago.The infused medicine, which has a list price of $135,000 for the first full year of treatment, blocks the CD38 protein found on myeloma cells. It was approved based on favorable data from two smaller trials, including a study in which tumors shrank in 29 percent of patients. Dr. Antonio Palumbo, the study's lead researcher, said in an interview that overall toxicity in the Darzalex regimen was similar to that seen with the two standard treatments. That may help the J&J drug become a second-line treatment, in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone, he said.The most common side effects for both drug combinations included low blood platelets, diarrhea and anemia.  Palumbo, melanoma unit chief at the University of Torino, Italy, said data from another late-stage study of Darzalex is expected later this month and will probably mirror strong results seen in his own study. In that trial, patients received Darzalex in combination with Celgene Corp's leading Revlimid (lenalidomide) treatment and with dexamethasone.Mark Wildgust, global head of hematology at J&J, said the company hopes the trial results will allow it to market Darzalex as an earlier treatment, and in combination with standard medicines.The National Cancer Institute estimates there are 26,850 new cases of multiple myeloma each year in the United States. The average life expectancy is four years.

373,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ)  Issuer Default Rating at 'AAA'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of  Fitch's rating actions follow at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The company's 'AAA' rating reflects the following: --Potential biosimilar competition for Remicade in the U.S. in  late-2016/early-2017 and adverse foreign exchange movement will weigh on  revenues during 2016, but Fitch expects the company's operating and financial  trends to remain positive. --JNJ will likely maintain a commitment to deploying cash for dividends,  acquisitions, collaborations and internal investment opportunities that it  believes will support long-term profitable growth. --Fitch believes JNJ will operate with leverage consistent with its 'AAA' rating  and with solid liquidity supported by significant cash balances and ample access  to credit markets. Current leverage leaves the company little flexibility to  take on additional debt. Innovation-Driven Growth Despite Headwinds: Fitch expects that JNJ will continue  to generate moderate intermediate-term top-line growth, despite facing a number  of challenges during 2016 and beyond. The company continues to bring innovative  new products to market and expand the utilization of established products and  franchises. Nevertheless, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and competition in  select franchises will likely dampen reported sales growth during 2016. Remicade  faced biosimilar competition in Europe during 2015, which modestly reduced  year-over-year sales in those affected countries. Fitch expects this trend to  continue during at least the four-year forecast period. In addition, biosimilars  could challenge Remicade in the U.S. in late-2016/early-2017. JNJ pursues innovation across all three of its business segments, which provides  it with favorable long-term growth prospects, as well as opportunities to  support margins. Research and development (R&D) intensity is greatest in its  biopharmaceutical business, followed by the medical device segment. The company  also pursues collaborations and outright acquisitions to supplement its internal  new product development efforts. This strategy has produced a significant number  of innovative, value-added medical therapies and products. While the consumer  business is not as R&D intensive, innovation is still a key component in  defending and advancing JNJ's franchises in this segment. Broad Portfolio Mitigates Risk: JNJ operates with three business segments and a  large diversified product portfolio, reducing its operational and financial  reliance on any individual product. It employs a decentralized business model  with its various franchises to promote receptivity to their respective markets,  while maintaining a strong cultural-centric philosophy driven by its  longstanding credo. The company develops and manufactures consumer  healthcare-related products, medical devices and pharmaceutical/biologic  therapies. Its diverse business model also enables JNJ to pursue a broad array  of treatment advancements that offer growth opportunities. JNJ's largest selling product, Remicade, accounts for roughly 9.6% of sales. It  is also a biologic, which typically faces patent slopes as opposed to patent  cliffs like traditional, small-molecule drugs. This dynamic mitigates the risk  of generic/biosimilar competition. The next three largest products, in total,  account for less than 10% of company sales. In addition, Fitch views the  company's patent expiration risk as manageable. Free Cash Flow (FCF) for Growth and Shareholder Returns: Fitch looks for JNJ to  produce strong annual FCF (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2016-2017 of $8.5 billion-$9.4 billion. Moderate organic sales  growth and incrementally improving margins, aided by an improving sales mix and  a continued focus on costs, should support solid cash flow from operations,  offset by manageable capital expenditures and dividends. Fitch expects JNJ will  prioritize cash deployment for dividends, internal/external growth opportunities  and then for share repurchases. JNJ will likely remain acquisitive, focusing on targets or products that offer  innovation and growth in the health care sector. Fitch expects the company to  finance its transactions within the context of its 'AAA' credit profile.  Shareholder-focused activities, such as dividend increases and share repurchases  will presumably continue, and Fitch believes the company will finance these  primarily with FCF. As of April 3, 2016, JNJ had repurchased a total of $2.6  billion in shares since the inception of the $10 billion repurchase program was  announced on Oct. 13, 2015. Current Leverage/Limited Flexibility: Fitch believes JNJ will operate with  leverage consistent with its 'AAA' rating and with solid liquidity supported by  significant cash balances and ample access to credit markets. However, current  leverage of 1.0x leaves the company little flexibility to take on additional  debt. The company should be able to use some of the roughly $39.9 billion of  cash and short-term investments to fund targeted and larger acquisitions. JNJ,  however, likely holds the vast majority of cash outside of the U.S. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for JNJ's 'AAA' rating include  the following: --Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 and 2017. --Margin improvement driven by favorable product mix and an ongoing focus on  cost control during the near term. --Annual FCF of $8.5 billion-$9.4 billion during 2016-2017.  --Leverage to range between 0.8x and 1.0x with moderately increasing levels of  debt.  --Capital deployment priorities focused on dividend and then balanced between  acquisitions and share repurchases, with the mix depending on the availability  and valuation of strategically appropriate targets. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its four-year forecast  horizon, a negative rating action could occur if some combination of  deteriorating operational performance and leveraging transactions stress the  company's credit profile. Fitch believes the company's broadly diversified  health care related franchises make it more likely that a negative rating action  would be prompted by a leveraging transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Three of the key rating metrics for JNJ's 'AAA' rating that Fitch believes  investors should consider are the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0x (reported April 3, 2016 at 3.7x); --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x reported April 3, 2016 at 1.0x); --Net debt of $4 billion-$5 billion (reported April 3, 2016 at a net cash  position of $16.6 billion). LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets.  Moderate growth and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate  $6.3 billion of FCF during the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended April 3, 2016.  JNJ had approximately $39.9 billion in cash plus short-term marketable  securities (STMS) and access to $10 billion in short-term borrowings on Jan. 3,  2016.  Debt Structure: JNJ had approximately $23.3 billion in debt, including $523  million in short-term debt on April 3, 2016, with approximately $3 billion of  long-term debt maturing in 2016, $1.7 billion in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2018.  Fitch expects that the company will refinance the vast majority of its upcoming  maturities. FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Johnson & Johnson --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA';  --Subordinated debt at 'AAA'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'.

374,"   By Brendan Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. jury on Friday awarded $70 million to the family of a boy who developed breasts after taking Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals' antipsychotic drug Risperdal.The jury in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas found that the company failed to warn the boy's healthcare providers about the risk of gynecomastia, which is breast growth in men or boys caused by a hormonal imbalance, and that it intentionally falsified, destroyed or concealed evidence in the case, according to a copy of the verdict form provided by a spokesman for the law firm Arnold & Itkin.Andrew Yount, of Tennessee, developed gynecomastia at the age of five as a result of taking Risperdal, his lawyers say.Yount's case is one of many similar cases consolidated in the Philadelphia court. Several others have resulted in jury verdicts, but Friday's verdict dwarfs the next largest of $2.5 million. Other cases are also expected to go to trial, Yount's attorney, Jason Itkin, said in his statement.Johnson & Johnson and Janssen are facing more than 12,000 claims over Risperdal, according to Johnson & Johnson's most recent quarterly report. Janssen spokeswoman Kristina Chang said in an emailed statement that the verdict was ""clearly excessive"" and that the company would ask the court and, if necessary, an appeals court to review it.Risperdal was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 to treat schizophrenia, but was not cleared for use in children until 2006. In 2013, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and several other drugs.Prosecutors said that from 1999 to 2005, Janssen promoted Risperdal for uses not approved by the FDA, including behavioral disturbances in elderly people with dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism in children, despite knowing of its risks.

381,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK, July 8  NEW YORK, July 8 Shares of many U.S. companies that produce prescription medicines have been under pressure this year, but the picture has been rosier for makers of pacemakers, knee replacements and other medical devices.While biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies endure scrutiny over drug costs, medical device companies have avoided that glare. Their sterling first-quarter results have also helped draw investors seeking safety in healthcare.The stocks have risen enough that they now look relatively expensive, trading as a group at 19 times the next 12 months earnings estimates compared to a five-year average of 15.8 times.But drug prices could remain an issue through the U.S. presidential election in November, and some investors say medical device companies will keep their appeal if they report solid second-quarter revenue and profits this month.""You still don't know how nasty this is going to get on the campaign trail,"" said Teresa McRoberts, portfolio manager at Fred Alger Management in New York. ""There are times when things trade at premiums for reasons beyond fundamentals, and right now one of them is the headline risk that I think is going to keep medtech doing OK.""This year, the S&P 500 Health Care Equipment index  has surged about 15 percent, trouncing the roughly 1.5 percent rise for the overall S&P 500 healthcare sector . The eight best-performing stocks in the broader S&P healthcare index in 2016 are medical device companies, including orthopedics company Stryker, heart device makers Edwards Lifesciences and Boston Scientific, and diversified manufacturer C R Bard.Large medical device companies on average posted organic first-quarter revenue growth of 4.8 percent from a year earlier, their best result in at least two years, Barclays analysts said in a recent report.Since then, executives have been generally positive about U.S. volume trends, the Barclays analysts said.Bihag Patel, senior research analyst at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis, said if the companies can sustain mid-single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, the stocks should maintain their positive momentum. Intuitive Surgical kicks off reporting season for medical device companies on July 19, followed by Abbott Laboratories on July 20 and Stryker on July 21.""It's a group that's in favor right now, and if you want to be exposed to healthcare it's very safe right now,"" Patel said.Biotech and pharmaceutical shares face heightened risks from criticism over pricing. Last fall, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shook the market with a tweet about ""price gouging."" The approaching Republican and Democratic conventions could put more pressure on the shares, McRoberts said. ""I don't know if good earnings even get rewarded if it's right around when you see whatever verbiage comes out of the convention,"" McRoberts said.In medtech, Nuveen's Patel said he liked several cardiovascular device makers including Boston Scientific. He also said shares of orthopedics company Zimmer Biomet Holdings  are relatively cheap.Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, in Rye, New York, favors Abbott, whose shares have lagged this year. But Jonas has been selling some holdings in Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson, which have run up.""I think there are still pockets of value out there but broadly speaking the sector is expensive,"" said Jonas.Another hazard for medtech, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro, would be if investors look more favorably at biotech stocks, fueled by exciting clinical data for experimental medicines or by more large-scale acquisitions of biotech companies, similar to Sanofi's recent bid for Medivation.""The number one risk to medtech stock performance really is a rotation back into biotech,"" Novarro said.

384,"   By Carl O'Donnell  TPG Capital LP, one of the world's largest private equity firms, has agreed to acquire Beaver-Visitec International, a U.S. maker of tools used in eye surgery, from buyout firm RoundTable Capital Partners.The acquisition, the value of which was not disclosed, provides TPG with a platform that it can use to rapidly scale up its presence in the ophthalmology space. Beaver-Visitec was created by RoundTable in 2010 through a combination of the opthalmic product businesses of three separate companies: Becton Dickinson and Co (BDX.N), Medtronic (MDT.N) and Aspen Surgical. Since then, RoundTable has built out Beaver-Visitec through multiple small acquisitions.In recent years, TPG Capital has exited businesses in several other healthcare-related areas. In 2015, TPG sold Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, a purveyor of generic drugs, to Endo International Plc (ENDP.O) for $8 billion. The same year, TPG sold Envision Pharmaceutical Services, a pharmaceutical benefits manager, to pharmacy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $2 billion. In 2013, TPG launched a nearly $1 billion initial public offering of Quintiles Transnational Holdings, a contract research organization.  Quintiles recently merged with healthcare data and analytics company IMS Health (IMS.N).In buying Beaver-Visitec, TPG is entering a sector with a number of well established strategic competitors. Some of the biggest names in the space include Alcon, which is owned by Novartis AG (NOVN.S), Bausch and Lomb, owned by Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO), and Vistakon, owned by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N). Since 2007, TPG has invested more than $8 billion in its healthcare portfolio. This year has been a relatively slow year for M&A in the medical devices sector, with one very large, notable exception in Abbott Laboratories' (ABT.N) $25 billion agreement to acquire rival St. Jude Medical (STJ.N) in April. Abbott also agreed to acquire diagnostics company Alere Inc (ALR.N) earlier in the year for nearly $6 billion.

""... We expect today's results to drive further upside and, given investor preference for safer names with good dividend yields in the current market environment, we think it bodes well for the stock over the near term,” said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan.Strong demand for the company's Imbruvica cancer drug and Xarelto blood thinner boosted pharmaceutical sales, which jumped 8.9 percent to $8.7 billion in the quarter. Sales of autoimmune drug Remicade, J&J's biggest product, rose 6.7 percent to $1.78 billion. The company, which is the first major U.S. drugmaker to announce quarterly earnings, raised its 2016 sales forecast to a range of $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion, from $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion previously. J&J expects sales to grow at a faster rate than the global healthcare market, which it sees increasing by 3 percent to 5 percent annually over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky said on a conference call. The maker of a variety of products from Tylenol to Band-Aid bandages to Acuvue contact lenses also increased its adjusted profit range to $6.63 to $6.73 per share, from $6.53 to $6.68. Investors have been concerned about potential competition to Remicade in the United States. U.S regulators earlier this year approved Inflectra, a cheaper version developed by Celltrion Inc (068270.KQ) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), but a patent battle between J&J and Celltrion has delayed its introduction.   J&J said its sales outlook assumes no new U.S. competition for Remicade in 2016. New Jersey-based J&J is also restructuring its medical device business to focus on areas such as artificial knees and devices for trauma surgery.Worldwide device sales inched up about 1 percent to $6.4 billion in the quarter, buoyed by higher demand for its advanced surgery products.

391,"   By Brendan Pierson  Two former executives of Acclarent Inc, a medical device company bought by Johnson & Johnson in 2010, were convicted on Wednesday by a U.S. jury on charges of promoting a product for an unapproved use.Former Acclarent Chief Executive William Facteau and former Vice President of Sales Patrick Fabian were found guilty in federal court in Boston of 10 misdemeanor counts of violating the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, federal prosecutors said in a statement. The counts each carry a maximum prison sentence of one year.The jury acquitted the men of more serious felony counts of wire fraud and conspiracy, finding they did not act with intent to defraud or mislead.Facteau's attorney, Reid Weingarten, and Fabian's attorney, Frank Libby, said in a statement they would move to overturn the convictions.The verdict came after legal setbacks in recent years for regulators' attempting to curb the promotion of drugs and devices for unapproved uses, known as off-label marketing. In an indictment unsealed last April, federal prosecutors said that beginning in 2006 or earlier, Facteau, 47, and Fabian, 49, promoted Acclarent's Relieva Stratus Microflow Spacer device to deliver steroid medications to patients' sinuses, though it was only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for keeping sinuses open.Prosecutors said Facteau and Fabian had hoped to increase the company's revenue to make it an attractive acquisition target, and concealed the off-label marketing from potential buyers, including J&J unit Ethicon Inc.Ethicon bought California-based Acclarent in early 2010 for about $785 million. Facteau and Fabian received compensation worth about $30 million and $4 million, respectively, from the deal, according to the indictment.  Facteau and Fabian stayed with the company until 2011 and told the sales force to sell the device as a way to deliver steroids, even after Ethicon executives told them to stop promoting it at all, according to the indictment.Facteau is currently CEO of hearing aid company Earlens.Drug companies have successfully argued in court that some off-label marketing is legal. In March, a Manhattan federal judge ruled that Amarin Corp could promote its fish oil-based pill Vascepa off-label, finding it had the right under the First Amendment to make non-misleading statements about its products.In 2012, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the conviction of a drug salesman for promoting Jazz Pharmaceuticals' narcolepsy drug Xyrem off-label, also on First Amendment grounds.The case is USA v.

394,"  AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, driven by demand for its flagship drug Humira, and raised its earnings forecast for the year.Humira - the world's biggest-selling drug - generated about $14 billion in sales last year and accounted for about 64 percent of AbbVie's net revenue in the quarter.The drug, used to treat forms of arthritis and Crohn's disease among other conditions, generated sales of $4.15 billion in the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $3.93 billion, compiled by Evercore ISI.Humira's main patent lapses in December, opening the drug up to potential competition from cheaper biosimilars being developed by companies including Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), Coherus Biosciences Inc (CHRS.O) and Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim.Amgen, as the first to seek U.S. approval, could end up first to market, after an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration backed its copycat version earlier this month.AbbVie, however, has said numerous other patents will stave off the introduction of biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022. ""Much of the debate around AbbVie is on the longer-term durability of Humira and on that point we expect nothing to really change despite the strong quarter,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.To be sure, AbbVie has been diversifying its portfolio to reduce its overwhelming dependence on Humira. The company said in April it would buy cancer drug developer Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion.Last year, the suburban Chicago drugmaker bought Pharmacyclics Inc and its half-ownership of cancer drug Imbruvica for $21 billion. AbbVie sells the drug with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and said it brought in quarterly sales of $439 million, exceeding the consensus estimate by $9 million.AbbVie's hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak, which competes with drugs from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), brought in sales of $419 million, versus the consensus estimate of $411 million.AbbVie raised its adjusted full-year profit forecast to $4.73-$4.83 per share from its previous projection of $4.62-$4.82. For the second quarter ended June 30, net revenue rose 17.8 percent to $6.45 billion. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $6.43 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.2 billion.Excluding special items, AbbVie earned $1.26 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.The drugmaker's stock was up about 1.4 percent in early trading on Friday.

398,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Ankur Banerjee  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), beating out numerous other bidders, said it agreed to buy U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion in cash, adding its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi to the company's growing oncology roster.Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at $80.42, just shy of the offer price of $81.50 per share. Shares of Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, were down 0.4 percent at $34.84. The offer is a 55-percent premium to Sanofi SA's (SASY.PA) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in April, which pushed the San Francisco-based company to put itself up for sale. It represents a 118-percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition.   The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2.2 billion-a-year Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica.Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics.  Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio.The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer's M&A strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal - to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments.Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by year-end whether to split into separate companies selling either low-growth generics or patent-protected brand medicines.  ""The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded-drug portfolio.A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business. Pfizer's biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) in developing immuno-oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively.Xtandi generated U.S. net sales of $330.3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period. Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists.""The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle,"" Read predicted. Some analysts, including BMO's Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi's potential for earlier treatment in coming years.Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck, Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation.   ""Given the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi ...  we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible,"" RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement.     Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a ""disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders."" Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter.Shares of other cancer drug companies, including Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about  more dealmaking in the sector. Pfizer's financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel. J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore were Medivation's financial advisers, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisers.

The company expanded its medical device and diagnostics businesses this year with a $25 billion deal for St. Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) and a $5.8 billion deal for Alere Inc (ALR.N).Abbott Medical Optics, which the company acquired for nearly $1.4 billion in 2009, reported sales of $1.1 billion for 2015, J&J said on Friday.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Abbott was in talks to sell the business to J&J.""We've been actively and strategically shaping our portfolio, which has recently focused on developing leadership positions in cardiovascular devices and expanding diagnostics,"" Abbott Chief Executive Miles White said. The Alere deal has run into rough weather with the target company filing a lawsuit in August, accusing Abbott of dragging its feet on key antitrust submissions to sabotage the deal. To make matters worse, St. Jude is facing allegations that its pacemakers and defibrillators have cyber security flaws that hackers could exploit to harm patients. The company has sued short-selling firm Muddy Waters and cyber security firm MedSec Holdings Inc who raised the allegations.   Wells Fargo analysts said Abbott was likely selling the eye care business because it was less of a strategic fit once it acquired St Jude and the company would need to reduce debt after the two deals. Abbott had long-term debt of about $6 billion as of June 30. For Johnson & Johnson, the deal would help expand its eye care portfolio with products in cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health units.The World Health Organization estimates that about 20 million people are blind from age-related cataracts and that there are at least 100 million eyes with compromised visual acuity caused by cataracts, J&J said.

413,"  The following is the text of a letter mailed to patients on Monday by Johnson & Johnson's Animas diabetes unit describing a cyber security vulnerability in its Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump:""Dear Valued Animas® OneTouch® Ping® Pump User, Since 2008, the OneTouch® Ping® insulin pump system has been helping people with diabetes perform at their best, and we are committed to providing our customers with safe and reliable products. We have been notified of a cybersecurity issue with the OneTouch® Ping®, specifically that a person could potentially gain unauthorized access to the pump through its unencrypted radio frequency communication system. We want you to know that Animas has investigated this issue and has worked with the appropriate regulatory authorities and security experts, as we are always evaluating ways to further ensure patient safety and security. We also want to assure you that the probability of unauthorized access to the One Touch® Ping® System is extremely low. It would require technical expertise, sophisticated equipment and proximity to the pump, as the OneTouch Ping® system is not connected to the internet or to any external network. In addition, the system has multiple safeguards to protect its integrity and prevent unauthorized action.  If you are concerned about unauthorized access for any reason, the pump’s radio frequency feature can be turned off, which is explained in Chapter 2 of Section III of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet. However, turning off this feature means that the pump and meter will no longer communicate and blood glucose readings will need to be entered manually on the pump. If you choose to use the meter remote feature, another option for protection is to program the OneTouch® Ping® pump to limit the amount of bolus insulin that can be delivered. Bolus deliveries can be limited through a number of customizable settings (maximum bolus amount, 2-hour amount, and total daily dose). Any attempt to exceed or override these settings will trigger a pump alarm and prevent bolus insulin delivery. For more information, please see Chapter 10 of Section I of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet. We also suggest turning on the Vibrating Alert feature of the OneTouch® Ping® System, as described in Chapter 4 of Section I. This notifies the user that a bolus dose is being initiated by the meter remote, which gives the patient the option of canceling the bolus.  The bolus delivery alert and the customizable limits on bolus insulin can only be enabled on the pump and cannot be altered by the meter remote. This is also true of basal insulin. We also remind you that any insulin delivery and the source of the delivery (pump or meter remote) are recorded in the pump history, so you can review the bolus dosing. The OneTouch® Ping® System continues to be safe and effective for helping you manage your diabetes. If you have any questions, please contact Animas Customer Technical Support at RA-ANMUS-CustomSupp@its.jnj.com or 1-877-937-7867.  Sincerely, Animas Corporation""  (Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Jonathan Weber and Grant McCool)",2016-10-04,JNJ,"Tue Oct 4, 2016 | 8:30am EDT",Johnson & Johnson letter on cyber bug in insulin pump,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-johnson-johnson-cyber-insulin-pumps-t-idUSKCN12414G?type=companyNews
414,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON (Due to inaccurate data in Fidelity's original filing, this October 5 story corrects to show that Fidelity's venture arm's investment in Adaptimmune rose to $41 million, not $270 million; that Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio paid at least four times more than rivals for shares, not 24 times; and that the venture arm got its Adaptimmune shares for about $3.54 each, not 59 cents each.)The mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, founded seven decades ago and run ever since by the Johnson family, has won the trust of tens of millions of investors.The company’s tradition of putting clients’ interests “before our own is a big part of what makes Fidelity special,” the fund firm says in its mission statement.In at least one lucrative field, however, the Johnson family’s interests come first. A private venture capital arm run on behalf of the Johnsons, F-Prime Capital Partners, competes directly with the stable of Fidelity mutual funds in which the public invests. It’s an arrangement that securities lawyers say poses an unusual conflict of interest.That conflict can be seen in the case of Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc, a promising biotech start-up. In 2011 and 2012, the Johnsons’ F-Prime Capital invested a total of $11 million on Ultragenyx before the start-up made an initial public offering of its stock.The pre-IPO investment effectively prevented Fidelity mutual funds from making the same play. If both the private fund and Fidelity’s ordinary funds had invested, they would have violated U.S. securities laws, which prohibit affiliated entities from buying substantial stakes in the same companies at the same time.The managers of Fidelity’s public funds eventually did purchase Ultragenyx shares, but not until after the stock price skyrocketed in the firm’s January 2014 initial public offering. The Fidelity funds bought about 1.1 million Ultragenyx shares in the second quarter of 2014. The average price for the stock was $41.17 during that three-month period - 12 times higher than the $3.55 a share paid by F-Prime Capital.By the end of June 2014, the Johnson family and an elite circle of Fidelity insiders were sitting on a gain of $128 million - or about 1,000 percent - on the Ultragenyx investment. Several of Fidelity’s mutual fund rivals, including American Funds and BlackRock Inc, did just as well or better on the Ultragenyx play by investing at about the same time as the Johnsons, U.S. regulatory filings show.GRAPHIC: A 6,101-percent gain: tmsnrt.rs/2dr0vAD Fidelity declined to comment on the specific investments examined by Reuters and declined to detail how it balances the interests of Fidelity funds and the Johnsons’ F-Prime funds in cases where they might compete for the same investment.Fidelity’s chief executive, Abigail Johnson, declined to comment for this story.Yale University law professor John Morley said Fidelity runs the risk of losing investors by competing with the funds that serve them.“What they’re doing is not illegal, not even unethical,” Morley said. “But it’s entirely appropriate for mutual fund investors to take their money elsewhere because Fidelity has made a decision to take away some of their potential returns.”Alan Palmiter, a business law professor at Wake Forest University, called the arrangement more problematic because it directly pits the interests of Fidelity fund investors against those of Fidelity’s owners and elite managers.“It’s hard to imagine a clearer corporate conflict of interest,” Palmiter said.SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns said the agency could not comment on a specific company.Reuters analyzed 10 pre-IPO investments since the beginning of 2013 by the Johnson-led venture capital arm. The analysis found that, in six of those cases, Fidelity’s mass-market mutual funds made major investments later and at much higher prices than the insiders’ fund, resulting in lower returns for Fidelity fund shareholders. In the other four cases, Fidelity funds did not invest at all in companies in which the Johnson-led venture arm already had a sizable stake. Fidelity’s internal guidelines prevent such investments when the Johnsons’ venture holdings are “substantial,” a standard that Fidelity declined to define to Reuters. The Reuters examination also found:• Over the past three years, U.S. regulatory filings show, the Johnson-led venture arm has beaten Fidelity mutual funds to some of the hottest prospects in tech and bioscience - including the best performing IPO of 2015.• Fidelity mutual funds became one of the largest investors in six bioscience and tech companies backed by F-Prime Capital after the start-ups became publicly traded. Legal and academic experts said that major investments by Fidelity mutual funds - with their market-moving buying power - could be seen as propping up the values of the Johnsons’ venture holdings.• Key compliance executives have held dual roles overseeing investments by Fidelity and F-Prime Capital. For three years until September, the chief compliance officer for Fidelity mutual funds, Linda Wondrack, also served as chief compliance officer for Impresa Management LLC, the advisory firm that manages the investments of F-Prime Capital. Fidelity’s James Curvey also wears two hats: He chairs a board of trustees that oversees many Fidelity stock mutual funds, and also serves as a trustee for one of the owners of Impresa. Curvey has been involved with the Johnsons’ private investments for more than 20 years and has made millions of dollars from them.• Some portfolio managers for Fidelity’s mass-market funds receive lucrative partnership interests in the private F-Prime funds. Star portfolio manager Will Danoff, for instance, donated $4 million worth of Alibaba Group stock to Harvard University in 2015 that he received through the venture arm for $3,432, according to his family’s charitable foundation.Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said Fidelity executives declined to grant interviews for this story. In a written statement, Fidelity said it follows the law relating to potential conflicts of interest between its mutual funds and the venture capital arm.“We strictly adhere to all legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our management of our mutual funds and other client accounts and our proprietary venture capital investments,” Fidelity said. “Where there is the potential for such investments to overlap, we apply internal guidelines designed to ensure that our mutual funds comply with relevant legal and regulatory restrictions on their ability to acquire securities issued by companies in which Fidelity has a pre-existing proprietary investment.”Fidelity declined to comment on whether its mutual funds were interested in making the same pre-IPO bets as F-Prime Capital.Over the past three years, however, the mutual funds have been among the nation’s biggest investors in pre-IPO companies, U.S. regulatory filings show. The pressure on Fidelity to produce market-breaking returns has never been higher. Since the end of 2008, investors have pulled nearly $100 billion from Fidelity’s actively managed mutual funds, while net deposits into Vanguard Group’s index funds approached $700 billion, according to Morningstar Inc data.Fidelity’s two top rivals, BlackRock and Vanguard, said they do not operate separate investment arms that might compete with their mutual funds. Vanguard Chairman and CEO William McNabb goes a step further, investing almost all of his personal financial assets in Vanguard funds, because he wants to ensure his interests are aligned with those of his customers, said company spokesman John Woerth.Fidelity Investments is owned by privately held FMR LLC, which is controlled by the Johnson family. The family, along with a small group of FMR employees and shareholders, are also investors in F-Prime Capital, the private venture capital arm.GRAPHIC: Investing for the elite. tmsnrt.rs/2dprVdt Johnson family members and Fidelity insiders also own Impresa Management, which runs partnerships and investments on F-Prime’s behalf, overseeing about $2.6 billion in assets, according to SEC disclosures. Impresa’s strategy is to bet on promising bioscience and tech start-ups.If F-Prime controls 5 percent or more of a private company’s voting stock, then that ownership prevents the Fidelity mutual funds from buying the same security before or during an IPO, according to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Fidelity told Reuters that it concurs with that reading of the law, which is enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission.SEC rules aim to ensure that the interests of mutual funds are on at least equal footing with the interests of affiliates, said Joseph Franco, a law professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. The rules seek to prohibit a situation where, for instance, a mutual fund might invest in a pre-IPO company at an above-market price with the intent of boosting the value of an earlier, lower-priced investment by an affiliated entity.The rules also seek to ensure that mutual fund managers are not influenced by the interests of an affiliated entity, such as Fidelity’s in-house venture operation, Franco said.The law would not prevent purchases of stock owned by an affiliated entity after an IPO, in the open market. But Fidelity said it applies its own guidelines, which prevent such purchases when there is a “substantial"" level of ownership by F-Prime. The guidelines are meant to address potential conflicts of interest and questions of fairness for investors in Fidelity mutual funds, the company said.John Bonnanzio, an editor at Fidelity Monitor & Insights, which makes independent recommendations on Fidelity funds, said the Johnson-led venture investing has been a good way to reward and retain star portfolio managers such as Danoff.“Hedge funds have siphoned off a lot of good portfolio managers from mutual fund companies,” Bonnanzio said. HEIR APPARENT Founded in 1946 by Abigail Johnson’s grandfather, Edward Johnson II, Fidelity’s mutual fund business manages $1.2 trillion in assets. Privately held Fidelity is still controlled by the family and has been the linchpin of their fortune. The clan’s net worth is estimated at $26 billion by Forbes magazine, making them the 9th-richest family in the United States.The founder eventually turned the reins over to his son, Fidelity’s chairman, Edward “Ned” Johnson III, who is now 86. Today, Abigail Johnson, 54, is heir apparent. The oldest of Ned’s three children, Abigail spent her career preparing for the top job, starting at Fidelity as an intern before moving on to portfolio manager and now CEO. She lives in the home once owned by her grandfather.Abigail and her younger siblings, Elizabeth and Edward Johnson IV, are investors in F-Prime Capital, according to disclosures by the venture fund.The family’s private investments sometimes dovetail with members’ personal interests. In 1985, Ned Johnson used venture funding to launch a limousine service after it took too long to hail a taxi at Boston’s airport, according to accounts in the Boston Globe. Abigail Johnson’s husband, Christopher McKown, co-founded a healthcare start-up, Iora Health, that has received multiple rounds of investment from F-Prime.OPPORTUNITY COSTS Over the years, F-Prime and other venture investing entities have generated billions of dollars in gains for the family and company insiders, according to financial disclosures made by Fidelity.Ned Johnson has used part of his wealth to amass a collection of antiquities worth nearly $260 million through his nonprofit Brookfield Arts Foundation, according to the charity’s 2014 annual report. The nonprofit’s purchases include a 200-year-old Chinese merchant house that Johnson had moved from that country and reassembled at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. The house and its contents are worth $17 million, according to Brookfield’s 2014 disclosure to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.Other beneficiaries of the venture investments include top Fidelity officials such as Peter Lynch, the legendary Magellan fund manager and Fidelity vice chairman, and current portfolio managers such as Danoff, who manages about $109 billion in assets at Fidelity’s Contrafund. The Ultragenyx investment illustrates the opportunity cost Fidelity investors face when a mass-market fund encounters a conflict of interest with F-Prime.TIMELINE: Owners vs. investors. tmsnrt.rs/2dr0kFIUltragenyx was hardly a hidden gem. Several of Fidelity’s rivals, including American Funds, BlackRock and Columbia Management, also got in on the early action before the company’s initial public offering. Columbia’s Acorn Fund, for example, invested $10 million at the same time as F-Prime and had an unrealized gain of nearly 1,100 percent, or $108 million, in mid-2015 before unwinding part of its position, U.S. regulatory filings show.In the third quarter of 2014, Fidelity funds boosted their collective stake in Ultragenyx by 3.3 million shares to become the biotech firm’s largest mutual fund investor, with nearly 4.6 million total shares. By then, the average closing price of the stock had moved up to $50.24 from $41.17 in the second quarter. During the same quarter, F-Prime unwound most of its stake in Ultragenyx by distributing the stock to limited and general partners, U.S. regulatory filings show.Asked about F-Prime, Fidelity said in a statement that its mutual funds get priority over the Johnson family's interests.“When both our proprietary venture capital group and our funds express interest in investing in the same private companies, the funds always prevail,” the company said in a statement.    CONFLICTED REFEREES One person who has been refereeing potential conflicts between Fidelity and Johnson family investments is Linda Wondrack. Until September, she doubled as chief compliance officer for the mutual funds and for Impresa Management, which manages the F-Prime assets. She served in both capacities for three years.In September - after Reuters asked whether Wondrack’s dual role presented a conflict of interest - Fidelity hired another executive to replace Wondrack in one of the two positions. The fund appointed a company veteran, Chuck Senatore, as chief compliance officer of Impresa Management.A single person could not effectively perform both jobs, said Wake Forest University’s Palmiter, who called the arrangement “nearly laughable.”Wondrack would have felt feel pressure to side with the venture capital arm because her ultimate boss is Abigail Johnson, said Palmiter, who has written extensively on the fund sector and is a critic of its governance standards.Wondrack, 52, is paid as an employee of Fidelity, U.S. regulatory filings show. She joined Fidelity in 2012, after working at mutual fund company Columbia Management.Loporchio, the Fidelity spokesman, said the company identified the need for a change in a “periodic review of its processes.”Another key overseer of Fidelity fund investors’ interests, however, continues to serve in a similar dual role.James C. Curvey - a long-time top lieutenant of Fidelity Chairman Ned Johnson - is chairman of the board of trustees for a number of Fidelity mutual funds, including ones that invest in the same companies as F-Prime.Fund trustees are responsible for protecting the interests of investors. Ned Johnson chose Curvey for the role when Johnson gave up his duties as chairman of the board of trustees for individual Fidelity funds. Curvey also serves a trustee for one of the owners of Impresa Management LLC, the manager of the F-Prime Capital’s venture investments. It’s not clear exactly who Curvey represents in that role; the stake is held in a trust, whose owners are not disclosed. But other filings indicate that Impresa is owned by the trusts of Johnson family members and Fidelity insiders.Curvey’s history with the Johnsons’ private investing entities dates back more than two decades. In 1996, along with Abigail and Ned Johnson, Curvey sought and received an SEC exemption in 1996 that gave Impresa more latitude to invest on behalf of high-ranking Fidelity employees, SEC records show.Partnership distributions to Curvey from venture investing have made him a lot of money.  Curvey, for example, made millions of dollars from the venture capital arm’s investment in Britain’s COLT Telecom. In 2000, he donated some of those gains, nearly $3 million, to his family’s charitable foundation, according to an annual filing with the IRS.Curvey and Wondrack declined to comment for this report. Fidelity declined to comment on the potential conflict of interest in their dual oversight roles.THE YEAR’S BEST-PERFORMING IPO Shareholders in the regular Fidelity mutual funds include millions of investors saving for retirement as well as employee 401(k) plans at top corporations such as Facebook, IBM and Oracle.Those mom-and-pop investors missed out on 2015’s best-performing IPO. Fidelity funds stayed on the sidelines as shares of Aclaris Therapeutics Inc skyrocketed after the drug maker listed its stock in October 2015.F-Prime invested $16.3 million in Aclaris before the IPO - a stake whose value soared to $83.2 million in the first three months after the public offering, U.S. regulatory filings show.Even if Fidelity fund managers had wanted to buy Aclaris shares after the IPO, in the open market, F-Prime’s stake of nearly 20 percent stake may have prevented them from doing so because of Fidelity’s guidelines on investing in companies in which the venture arm has a “substantial” stake.Aclaris was 2015’s top public debut, its shares appreciating 145 percent over the $11 IPO price, according to Renaissance Capital, an IPO research and management firm.At the end of June, F-Prime still held nearly 2.8 million Aclaris shares, a 13 percent stake, worth $51.5 million, according to Fidelity’s latest quarterly holdings disclosure. Fidelity funds did not own any Aclaris shares.Fidelity fund competitors had no restraints on investing in Aclaris. Franklin Templeton funds bought nearly 1.2 million shares in the company in the month of the IPO, Franklin disclosures show. The Fidelity competitors, including the Franklin Small Cap Growth Fund, saw their combined initial stake of $17.3 million more than double in less than two months.The Johnson-led venture arm scored another big payday when Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc went public in May 2015. F-Prime’s $8 million pre-IPO investment in the bioscience company surged in value to more than $41 million in the weeks after the IPO, Fidelity disclosures show.Investors in the American Funds SmallCap World Fund, a Fidelity competitor, capitalized, too. The SmallCap World Fund made a similar-sized pre-IPO investment and saw a similar return, American disclosures show.The Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio bought about 1.5 million Adaptimmune shares the month after the IPO. But the biotech fund paid at least four times more for its shares than rivals did, Fidelity Select disclosures show.As pre-IPO investors, F-Prime and the rival SmallCap World Fund got their Adaptimmune common stock, on a converted basis, for about $3.54 each, disclosures show.The exact amount paid by the Fidelity biotech fund was not disclosed. But it was at least $14 a share, which was the low point for Adaptimmune shares the month of the IPO.Adaptimmune traded recently at nearly $7 a share, which represents a big loss for the mass-market Fidelity biotech fund but a rich gain for the Johnsons’ F-Prime.PILING IN In the six cases Reuters examined where Fidelity bought into investments that were already held by F-Prime, Fidelity funds became the largest or one of the largest shareholders.In general, newly minted public companies need long-term shareholders such as mutual funds in order to ride out the ups and the downs of the stock market, especially right after a public debut, said Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of Allegis Capital, a venture firm based in San Francisco.An investment by Fidelity - the third-largest mutual fund firm in the United States - is a boost for any new public company. A big fund’s investment broadens the shareholder base and makes it easier for venture capital investors to exit their investment at a profit.“It’s a validation of the company and the exit strategy, especially if it’s a huge amount,” said Hans Tung, managing partner at GGV Capital. “It’s a good validation that a company has a lot of long-term growth potential ahead.”Fidelity said there has never been a situation where F-Prime has directed a Fidelity mutual fund to make an investment in one of F-Prime’s portfolio companies.Corporate governance and securities law specialists say that big Fidelity investments in companies owned by F-Prime could be interpreted as propping up the family’s interests and helping F-Prime’s exit strategy.“It does raise a potentially serious question,” said James Post, a professor emeritus of markets, public policy and law at Boston University. “The uniqueness of the Fidelity arrangement requires the highest level of integrity.”*** METHODOLOGY: How we analyzed the Johnsons’ tradingReuters combed through public securities filings to explore overlap between the investing activities of Fidelity Investments, which serves some 20 million clients, and proprietary investment vehicles of the family that controls Fidelity, the Johnsons. Reuters identified 10 investments in which F-Prime Capital Partners, controlled by the Johnsons, was competing on the same turf as Fidelity mutual funds. The examination covered a three-year period, from 2013 to the present. During this time, Fidelity mutual funds began ramping up their strategy of investing in pre-IPO start-up companies. It is possible that the examination missed other relevant examples among F-Prime Capital’s many investments.

415,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON (Due to inaccurate data in Fidelity's original filing, this October 5 story corrects to show that Fidelity's venture arm's investment in Adaptimmune rose to $41 million, not $270 million; that Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio paid at least four times more than rivals for shares, not 24 times; and that the venture arm got its Adaptimmune shares for about $3.54 each, not 59 cents each.)The mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, founded seven decades ago and run ever since by the Johnson family, has won the trust of tens of millions of investors.The company’s tradition of putting clients’ interests “before our own is a big part of what makes Fidelity special,” the fund firm says in its mission statement.In at least one lucrative field, however, the Johnson family’s interests come first. A private venture capital arm run on behalf of the Johnsons, F-Prime Capital Partners, competes directly with the stable of Fidelity mutual funds in which the public invests. It’s an arrangement that securities lawyers say poses an unusual conflict of interest.That conflict can be seen in the case of Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc, a promising biotech start-up. In 2011 and 2012, the Johnsons’ F-Prime Capital invested a total of $11 million on Ultragenyx before the start-up made an initial public offering of its stock.The pre-IPO investment effectively prevented Fidelity mutual funds from making the same play. If both the private fund and Fidelity’s ordinary funds had invested, they would have violated U.S. securities laws, which prohibit affiliated entities from buying substantial stakes in the same companies at the same time.The managers of Fidelity’s public funds eventually did purchase Ultragenyx shares, but not until after the stock price skyrocketed in the firm’s January 2014 initial public offering. The Fidelity funds bought about 1.1 million Ultragenyx shares in the second quarter of 2014. The average price for the stock was $41.17 during that three-month period - 12 times higher than the $3.55 a share paid by F-Prime Capital.By the end of June 2014, the Johnson family and an elite circle of Fidelity insiders were sitting on a gain of $128 million - or about 1,000 percent - on the Ultragenyx investment. Several of Fidelity’s mutual fund rivals, including American Funds and BlackRock Inc, did just as well or better on the Ultragenyx play by investing at about the same time as the Johnsons, U.S. regulatory filings show.GRAPHIC: A 6,101-percent gain: tmsnrt.rs/2dr0vAD Fidelity declined to comment on the specific investments examined by Reuters and declined to detail how it balances the interests of Fidelity funds and the Johnsons’ F-Prime funds in cases where they might compete for the same investment.Fidelity’s chief executive, Abigail Johnson, declined to comment for this story.Yale University law professor John Morley said Fidelity runs the risk of losing investors by competing with the funds that serve them.“What they’re doing is not illegal, not even unethical,” Morley said. “But it’s entirely appropriate for mutual fund investors to take their money elsewhere because Fidelity has made a decision to take away some of their potential returns.”Alan Palmiter, a business law professor at Wake Forest University, called the arrangement more problematic because it directly pits the interests of Fidelity fund investors against those of Fidelity’s owners and elite managers.“It’s hard to imagine a clearer corporate conflict of interest,” Palmiter said.SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns said the agency could not comment on a specific company.Reuters analyzed 10 pre-IPO investments since the beginning of 2013 by the Johnson-led venture capital arm. The analysis found that, in six of those cases, Fidelity’s mass-market mutual funds made major investments later and at much higher prices than the insiders’ fund, resulting in lower returns for Fidelity fund shareholders. In the other four cases, Fidelity funds did not invest at all in companies in which the Johnson-led venture arm already had a sizable stake. Fidelity’s internal guidelines prevent such investments when the Johnsons’ venture holdings are “substantial,” a standard that Fidelity declined to define to Reuters. The Reuters examination also found:• Over the past three years, U.S. regulatory filings show, the Johnson-led venture arm has beaten Fidelity mutual funds to some of the hottest prospects in tech and bioscience - including the best performing IPO of 2015.• Fidelity mutual funds became one of the largest investors in six bioscience and tech companies backed by F-Prime Capital after the start-ups became publicly traded. Legal and academic experts said that major investments by Fidelity mutual funds - with their market-moving buying power - could be seen as propping up the values of the Johnsons’ venture holdings.• Key compliance executives have held dual roles overseeing investments by Fidelity and F-Prime Capital. For three years until September, the chief compliance officer for Fidelity mutual funds, Linda Wondrack, also served as chief compliance officer for Impresa Management LLC, the advisory firm that manages the investments of F-Prime Capital. Fidelity’s James Curvey also wears two hats: He chairs a board of trustees that oversees many Fidelity stock mutual funds, and also serves as a trustee for one of the owners of Impresa. Curvey has been involved with the Johnsons’ private investments for more than 20 years and has made millions of dollars from them.• Some portfolio managers for Fidelity’s mass-market funds receive lucrative partnership interests in the private F-Prime funds. Star portfolio manager Will Danoff, for instance, donated $4 million worth of Alibaba Group stock to Harvard University in 2015 that he received through the venture arm for $3,432, according to his family’s charitable foundation.Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said Fidelity executives declined to grant interviews for this story. In a written statement, Fidelity said it follows the law relating to potential conflicts of interest between its mutual funds and the venture capital arm.“We strictly adhere to all legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our management of our mutual funds and other client accounts and our proprietary venture capital investments,” Fidelity said. “Where there is the potential for such investments to overlap, we apply internal guidelines designed to ensure that our mutual funds comply with relevant legal and regulatory restrictions on their ability to acquire securities issued by companies in which Fidelity has a pre-existing proprietary investment.”Fidelity declined to comment on whether its mutual funds were interested in making the same pre-IPO bets as F-Prime Capital.Over the past three years, however, the mutual funds have been among the nation’s biggest investors in pre-IPO companies, U.S. regulatory filings show. The pressure on Fidelity to produce market-breaking returns has never been higher. Since the end of 2008, investors have pulled nearly $100 billion from Fidelity’s actively managed mutual funds, while net deposits into Vanguard Group’s index funds approached $700 billion, according to Morningstar Inc data.Fidelity’s two top rivals, BlackRock and Vanguard, said they do not operate separate investment arms that might compete with their mutual funds. Vanguard Chairman and CEO William McNabb goes a step further, investing almost all of his personal financial assets in Vanguard funds, because he wants to ensure his interests are aligned with those of his customers, said company spokesman John Woerth.Fidelity Investments is owned by privately held FMR LLC, which is controlled by the Johnson family. The family, along with a small group of FMR employees and shareholders, are also investors in F-Prime Capital, the private venture capital arm.GRAPHIC: Investing for the elite. tmsnrt.rs/2dprVdt Johnson family members and Fidelity insiders also own Impresa Management, which runs partnerships and investments on F-Prime’s behalf, overseeing about $2.6 billion in assets, according to SEC disclosures. Impresa’s strategy is to bet on promising bioscience and tech start-ups.If F-Prime controls 5 percent or more of a private company’s voting stock, then that ownership prevents the Fidelity mutual funds from buying the same security before or during an IPO, according to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Fidelity told Reuters that it concurs with that reading of the law, which is enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission.SEC rules aim to ensure that the interests of mutual funds are on at least equal footing with the interests of affiliates, said Joseph Franco, a law professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. The rules seek to prohibit a situation where, for instance, a mutual fund might invest in a pre-IPO company at an above-market price with the intent of boosting the value of an earlier, lower-priced investment by an affiliated entity.The rules also seek to ensure that mutual fund managers are not influenced by the interests of an affiliated entity, such as Fidelity’s in-house venture operation, Franco said.The law would not prevent purchases of stock owned by an affiliated entity after an IPO, in the open market. But Fidelity said it applies its own guidelines, which prevent such purchases when there is a “substantial"" level of ownership by F-Prime. The guidelines are meant to address potential conflicts of interest and questions of fairness for investors in Fidelity mutual funds, the company said.John Bonnanzio, an editor at Fidelity Monitor & Insights, which makes independent recommendations on Fidelity funds, said the Johnson-led venture investing has been a good way to reward and retain star portfolio managers such as Danoff.“Hedge funds have siphoned off a lot of good portfolio managers from mutual fund companies,” Bonnanzio said.

416,"   By Bill Berkrot  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday it will begin shipping its biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in late November at a 15 percent discount to current wholesale prices.The Pfizer drug, to be sold under the name Inflectra, is already available in Europe and other overseas markets and would be the second biosimilar medicine available in the United States.As it is not possible to produce exact copies of biotech drugs made from living cells, the cheaper versions - referred to as biosimilars rather than generics - are intended to provide cost savings compared with pricey biologic medicines.Remicade is J&J's biggest selling drug with U.S. sales of about $5 billion a year.J&J's forecasts for 2016 had assumed no competition from a Remicade biosimilar this year. Its shares slipped nearly 0.5 percent to $118.00 in after-hours trading.J&J said in an emailed statement that it considers any sales by Pfizer of a Remicade biosimilar to be an ""at risk launch."" That could entitle the company to triple damages if Pfizer is found in court to have infringed Remicade patents. A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company could not comment on ongoing litigation.Pfizer's pricing for the drug below Remicade wholesale costs does not take into account discounts to health insurers, distributors or other purchasing organizations, the company said.JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein, in a research note, forecast a Remicade revenue decline of just over $1 billion in 2017, costing J&J 20 cents in earnings per share. ""Inflectra's 15 percent discount should provide enough of an incentive to help attract new patients ... but probably won’t be enough of a discount to entice stable patients to switch over,"" Weinstein said.J&J said it expects to be competitive with the Remicade biosimilar.""We intend to compete through a variety of innovative contracting options, discounts and rebates to payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers to ensure Remicade remains an affordable option for patients and physicians,"" a J&J statement said.

They are intended to provide less expensive alternatives to pricey biologic medicines.

424,"   By Brendan Pierson  After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Oct. 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court.All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits.The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link.In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women's lawyers have denied J&J's claim.The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments.John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs' experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative.In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week's $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May.The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013.Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. ""If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases,"" he said.  LARGE VERDICTS Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007.   Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015.Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on.""Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement,"" said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J's case is somewhat different.A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J's liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled.Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market.""This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos,"" Erichson said. ""This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.

427,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV.Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV.The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, evaluated monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey version of HIV, and showed the treatments were much more effective when used together than separately.All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three of them, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for six months after antiretroviral therapy or ART drugs were stopped.The study is part of ongoing efforts to develop a so-called functional cure for HIV that would allow people infected with the virus to stop taking daily antiretroviral therapy. [L1N1CJ134] ""Current antiretroviral drugs, although they're lifesaving, do not cure HIV. They merely hold it in check. We are trying to develop strategies to achieve ART-free, long-term viral suppression,"" said study author Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.For the study, the team used what is known as a ""kick and kill"" approach. The two-punch strategy is designed to lure dormant HIV-infected immune cells out of hiding places in the body and then attempt to eradicate them.The trial evaluated a therapeutic vaccine called Ad26/MVA, which J&J and partners are testing in early-stage human trials. The vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity. They combined this with Gilead's experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body's initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients.In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo.Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead's TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group.

428,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV.Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV.The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, evaluated monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey version of HIV, and showed the treatments were much more effective when used together than separately.All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three of them, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for six months after antiretroviral therapy or ART drugs were stopped.The study is part of ongoing efforts to develop a so-called functional cure for HIV that would allow people infected with the virus to stop taking daily antiretroviral therapy. [L1N1CJ134] ""Current antiretroviral drugs, although they're lifesaving, do not cure HIV. They merely hold it in check. We are trying to develop strategies to achieve ART-free, long-term viral suppression,"" said study author Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.For the study, the team used what is known as a ""kick and kill"" approach. The two-punch strategy is designed to lure dormant HIV-infected immune cells out of hiding places in the body and then attempt to eradicate them.The trial evaluated a therapeutic vaccine called Ad26/MVA, which J&J and partners are testing in early-stage human trials. The vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity. They combined this with Gilead's experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body's initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients.In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo.Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead's TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group. In this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound.“If all the animals' viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,” said Barouch. “But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that’s a solid base hit.

(bloom.bg/2g8UTe3)Actelion declined to comment. J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Swiss lung disease specialist has been seen as a takeover target. Any confirmation of talks by J&J or Actelion would probably prompt competing bids, ""most likely from"" larger Swiss peer Novartis, one investment banker told Reuters. Another source close to Novartis, however, said the drugmaker was not very impressed by Actelion's drug development pipeline.Actelion shares surged by 18.8 percent at one point to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They were up 13.9 percent by 1249 GMT, virtually matching the share's total gains this year up to Thursday's close. Eric Le Berrigaud, an analyst at brokerage Bryan Garnier, also expected big Swiss drugmakers to express interest in Actelion if either Actelion or J&J confirm their talks.""We should then see many other (companies) interested (in Actelion). That will probably include at least one of the two other Basel-based companies,"" Le Berrigaud said, referring to Novartis and Roche.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid could be worth up to 220 francs or 250 francs per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast growing businesses. Actelion's Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated 1.4 billion this year.Actelion's recently launched drugs would be attractive to big pharmaceutical companies with deep pockets, but its co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake, could put up a fight as he has repeatedly said he wants the company to remain independent. In 2011, he managed to rally shareholders against activist investor Elliott's campaign to put the biotech firm on the auction block. The shares have more than tripled since then.""We continue to believe that management, as quoted on many conference calls and public presentations, remains committed to Actelion as an independent company,"" Barclays analysts said.J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash in September and Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments.J&J had derived about half its revenue from acquired products, he said.In October, Actelion raised its earnings guidance for the third time this year as sales from Opsumit and Uptravi for the first time surpassed those of Tracleer, its decade-long mainstay that lost U.S. patent protection last November.

Analysts estimate a deal could be as high as 250 Swiss francs ($247) per share, valuing Actelion at around $26 billion, or $6 billion more than its current price even after the share's 17 percent surge on Friday.Having fended off reported approaches by Shire in 2015 and hedge fund Elliott Advisors in 2011, Clozel, a French-born cardiologist, has repeatedly asserted his desire to go it alone, with his three main PAH drugs and with pipeline medicines he hopes will create a broad-based biotech company.This hard-to-get approach, coupled with the high value of recent deals in the sector, will drive up Actelion's takeover price, analysts said. ""Similar deals have been at a 40-plus percent premium and we view 240 Swiss francs as a possible floor takeout value,"" Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said.Analysts at Bryan Garnier suggested a bid price of up to 250 francs.In another recent biotech takeover, Pfizer paid $14 billion for cancer specialist Medivation, or double its pre-deal value. Switzerland's Roche in 2014 paid $8.3 billion for InterMune, a 63 percent premium.  Clozel and his pediatrician-wife, Martine Clozel, Actelion's chief science officer, own 5 percent of the company they founded in 1997. Close ties with Actelion's Swiss shareholder base suggest they can mobilize support, should an offer not live up to their expectations, Welford said.If J&J fails to strike a deal, a rival like Sanofi could well step in, analysts said. Actelion's PAH portfolio is a potentially nice fit for the French drugmaker's Genzyme rare disease unit.Sanofi, which lost out to Pfizer in the battle for Medivation, has said it is still looking for deals. A spokesman for Sanofi declined to comment on the company's possible interest in Actelion. NEW DRUGS While the patent for Actelion's PAH blockbuster Tracleer expired last year, Clozel's two newer PAH drugs, Opsumit and Uptravi, are expected to take up the slack. Opsumit's annual sales are set to hit 1.9 billion francs by 2020, according to Reuters data. Uptravi sales could top 2.5 billion francs.Clozel plans to use the cash to fund his late-stage pipeline, which includes medicines for treating diarrhea-causing clostridium difficile, as well as the multiple sclerosis drug ponesimod. Stefan Schneider, a Bank Vontobel analyst in Zurich, doubts a deal will go through and said any sign that a potential buyer will tinker with Clozel's prized pipeline to cut costs could be a deal killer. ""We don't see how the CEO would part from the pipeline where he sees the value for Actelion to transform into the first European large-cap biotech company,"" Schneider said.Actelion's shares have risen six-fold to nearly 190 francs since the start of 2012, just after Elliott tried to wrest control - on the grounds the company's stock should fetch 70 francs. As retirement edges closer, analysts said it is possible Clozel is more receptive to handing over the reins, especially if a buyer agrees to retain Actelion's presence in Basel where the company, however successful, still plays second fiddle to giants Roche and Novartis.""Actelion's shares have risen 400 percent based on the strength of the PAH portfolio alone,"" Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said. ""Even when Clozel has always made the case for independence, it's possible a stock price at its zenith, combined with his 61 years, could prompt a change of heart.""

445,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies | LONDON  LONDON U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson has raised its offer for Actelion, a source told Reuters on Tuesday, stepping up pressure on the Swiss biotech firm to accept a takeover deal.J&J had increased its offer, which has not yet been made public, after nearly two months of informal talks which have so far not resulted in a deal, the source added.The main stumbling block is that Actelion wants J&J to become a major shareholder in a new entity combining the Swiss group with some of J&J's activities, whereas the U.S. company wants a straightforward takeover, the source said.Actelion shares closed up 10 percent at 209 Swiss francs, just off a record high, following news of the higher offer.J&J has become one of the world's biggest healthcare companies through hundreds of acquisitions, in which it has nearly always bought entire companies or drugs outright.Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel has fended off previous attempts to wrest the Swiss firm from him, including a reported takeover approach by Shire last year and an activist campaign in 2011 by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Advisors.Clozel and his wife Martine, who is Actelion's chief scientific officer, founded the business in 1997. They have been trying to expand its portfolio, which consists of three main drugs focused on treating PAH, a deadly buildup of pressure in blood vessels between the heart and lungs. Earlier, Bloomberg News reported that Actelion had rejected an offer of 246 francs per share, valuing the Swiss company at around 26.5 billion Swiss francs ($26 billion). The Clozels, both physicians who worked at Roche before setting up Actelion, still own more than 3 percent of its shares.  Recent pharma deals have commanded significant premiums, with Pfizer paying $14 billion for cancer specialist Medivation, double its pre-deal value.RARE DISEASES Actelion, whose rare-disease focus makes it an attractive target because its drugs face less price pressure than more widely used medicines, was not available for comment.  A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson declined to comment. The companies had confirmed last week they were in talks about a possible transaction.Citigroup is advising J&J, while Bank of America is working with Actelion, two sources said. Both banks declined to comment. Acquiring the Swiss company would boost J&J's drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. Its biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc.. Actelion is also growing. Although its blockbuster Tracleer's patent has expired, its new treatment Opsumit's annual sales are set to hit 1.9 billion francs by 2020, according to Reuters data, while just-introduced Uptravi sales could top 2.5 billion francs.The talks between the two companies began in October, the first source said.The companies had originally discussed a transaction without a big premium, focusing on some form of share deal or an asset swap, the source said.John Rountree, director with London-based consultancy Novasecta, said a structured transaction allowing Actelion to benefit from J&J's scale without losing its independence could work for both sides.One option might be for J&J to mimic Roche, which bought 60 percent of Genentech in 1990, leaving it to operate independently, before acquiring the rest of the biotech in 2009.

450,"   By John Miller and Anjuli Davies | ZURICH/LONDON  ZURICH/LONDON Some Actelion shareholders would be attracted by a $27 billion bid for the Swiss biotech company from Johnson & Johnson, leaving Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel with some explaining to do if he turned down an offer around that level. One source familiar with the matter has told Reuters the two companies are discussing a bid close to that price, or 250 Swiss francs per share. That would be a 60 percent premium to Actelion's market value before the companies confirmed last week they were in talks, and tempting for shareholders who would prefer to cash in now rather than bet on an uncertain future.""If I look at the (drugs) pipeline that Mr. Clozel is excited about, I am perhaps less excited about it and see perhaps a greater risk than reward,"" said Eleanor Taylor Jolidon, a fund manager at Union Bancaire Privee in Geneva, which is among the top 40 investors in Actelion and holds 0.23 percent of outstanding shares, according to Reuters data.An offer around 250 francs per share would be ""something we could start looking at"", Taylor Jolidon said. Should Clozel reject such a price, she added, ""he would have a lot of explaining to do."" Clozel has, in the past, guarded Actelion's independence, helped by fellow shareholder Swiss billionaire Rudolf Maag and a  supportive Swiss investor base.In 2011, for example, he fended off a campaign by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Advisors to put the company up for sale. At the time, Elliott suggested Actelion was worth 70 francs per share, about a third of its current price. And in 2015, Clozel reportedly saw off bid interest from British drugmaker Shire.The source familiar with the matter said Johnson & Johnson (J&J) had increased its offer - which has not yet been made public - after nearly two months of informal talks.  The main stumbling block is Actelion wants J&J to become a major shareholder in a new entity, while the U.S. firm favors a straightforward takeover, the source added.Citigroup is advising J&J, while Bank of America is working with Actelion, two sources said. Both banks and firms have declined to comment on the talks.GOOD TIMING  Since Actelion's founding in 1997, Clozel and his wife, Chief Scientific Officer Martine Clozel, have built up a world-leading drug portfolio to treat deadly pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and have been lauded for building Europe's biggest biotech from scratch. They aim to expand in drugs for multiple sclerosis and diarrhea-causing clostridium difficile, but regulatory approvals for those are years away.The company is also counting on its new PAH treatments Opsumit and Uptravi, which combined are forecast to bring in nearly 4.5 billion francs ($4.4 billion) in annual sales by 2020, according to Reuters data.The 61-year-old CEO and Maag together own just over 8.5 percent of Actelion stock.Some investors think J&J has timed its approach well.  ""At this juncture and at his age, Mr. Clozel might be willing to consider new opportunities for Actelion,"" said Alexandre Stucki of AS Investment Management in Geneva, who owns Actelion stock in a portfolio worth ""several hundred million Swiss francs"".""If J&J is willing to offer 200 francs or more per share, they probably see good value in the pipeline as well.""Another investor, who declined to be named, said that if J&J offered 250-270 francs per share, Actelion would ""have to sell.""At 1405 GMT (09:05 a.m. EDT), the stock was down 2.3 percent at 204.3 francs.An offer that values the company at nearly $10 billion more than it was worth just last week could cause even Clozel loyalists to jump ship, given questions about its pipeline.""At the right price, Actelion management might have to engage with a deal – or will face having to justify to shareholders why the long-term direction is more valuable in their hands,"" Barclays analyst Olivia Capra wrote.($1 = 1.0151 Swiss francs) (Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler, Pamela Barbaglia and Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Mark Potter)",2016-11-30,JNJ,"Wed Nov 30, 2016 | 9:35am EST",Rejecting J&J could leave Actelion with 'lot of explaining to do',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-actelion-m-a-johnson-johnson-investor-idUSKBN13P1VP?type=companyNews
451,"   By Maiya Keidan and John Miller | ZURICH  ZURICH Actelion's silence speaks volumes to the dozens of event-driven hedge funds piling into the Swiss biotech firm, betting that Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) (JNJ.N) approach will result in an outright takeover and handsome returns. A source familiar with the matter has told Reuters the two companies are discussing a bid of close to $27 billion, or 250 Swiss francs ($248) per share, which is 25 percent above Actelion's current share price. Both companies have confirmed that U.S. diversified healthcare group J&J - maker of Pizbuin sun screen, surgical tools and arthritis drug Remicade - has approached Actelion about a potential takeover, but kept mum on details. Co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel and fellow shareholder Rudolf Maag have in the past been outspoken defenders of an independent Actelion, which has built a $2 billion business by focusing on a debilitating lung disease. But they have made no public comment since the companies confirmed the talks a week ago, and Clozel would have some explaining to do if he rejected an offer with such a big premium, fund managers with a more conventional investment approach told Reuters.""This time it's different. It has not been outright rejected. That's an indication that you can go a little bit bigger,"" said Michael Wegener, managing partner at Hong Kong-based event-driven hedge fund Case Equity Partners.He has staked 1 percent of his fund's net assets under management on Actelion, but did not disclose the size of his assets, and is prepared to stock up if J&J tables a more detailed takeover proposal.""We don't think Clozel is going to fight,"" said another hedge fund manager, who asked not to be named.  Clozel holds about 5 percent in the biotech firm, according to its annual report, while his wife Martine Clozel, co-founder and chief scientific officer, also owns an undisclosed stake.No detailed data is available on share purchases by event-driven funds - who typically go after deal targets available for a discount to a mooted takeover offer - but Reuters journalists have been in contact with scores of fund managers who have discussed their tactics.Daily turnover in Actelion shares has on average jumped more than fourfold since media reports of a J&J approach emerged on Nov. 24, from their three-month average. The shares were trading at 200 francs as of 1603 GMT on Friday, up 27 percent since Nov. 24.  FACE-SAVING OFFER Many investors are counting on J&J to structure a deal that would grant shareholders a cash payout and award Clozel a face-saving departure that honors the value of the firm's development pipeline of experimental drugs. Some analysts argue J&J, or any rival suitor, will pay up for Actelion's launched products - two new drugs alone are seen generating combined peak sales of well above $4 billion - but have little appreciation for its drug development projects. Analysts at brokerage Brian Garnier on Friday suggested Clozel could be offered to keep control of the experimental drugs portfolio and cash in on the rest.   ""A stand-alone Actelion going forward would therefore consist of a pipeline company with limited or no revenues."" Rudolf Maag, another linchpin investor, who according to Thomson Reuters data holds 5.1 percent, has previous ties to J&J: he made much of his near $2 billion fortune when he sold his stake in medical device maker Synthes-Stratec to J&J four years ago.Maag declined to comment this week, a departure from five years ago when he and Clozel defended Actelion against an attempt by U.S.-based hedge fund Elliott Advisors to get the biotech firm to put itself up for auction.Hedge funds see Maag playing a critical role in a J&J deal, potentially persuading Clozel the offer is too good for shareholders to pass up.""We are monitoring the situation very actively,"" said one hedge fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""I would strongly assume pretty much every other event-driven fund in the world is doing the same. I have heard of event-driven funds who already have several $100 million worth of stock.""

452,"   By Erica Teichert  A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants.The jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks.J&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices.The six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials.Both companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices.According to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. Verdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards.J&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims.The verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014  Lanier said Thursday's verdict was ""a message loud and clear"" that J&J has ""a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up."" The company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said.The plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. In its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. “Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney.He said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects.DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. J&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. J&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading.

454,"   By Carl O'Donnell  U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to incentivize U.S. companies to repatriate their swelling overseas cash piles could spur a new wave of dealmaking in a pharmaceutical industry seeking to buy its way into growth.For years, big U.S. drugmakers have turned to acquisitions of foreign companies to put their overseas cash to work, rather than bring it home at a 35-percent tax rate. Trump has proposed allowing repatriation of this cash at a 10-percent tax rate, hoping some of it will be spent on hiring and investing in their businesses.However, drugmakers are much more likely to spend this money on acquisitions that could revive their drug development pipeline by acquiring smaller peers with promising offerings, as opposed to risking more of their own dollars on research and development, corporate executives and dealmakers say. Some of these deals could even result in job cuts as companies seek to eliminate overlaps.     ""Would we consider to repatriate the cash? I would say yes, and what we would look at would be first to maintain the lowest weighted average cost of capital for the company,"" Amgen Inc chief financial officer David Meline told analysts and investors on the company's most recent earnings call in October.""Then we would look at certainly deploying cash towards external opportunities, but in that instance we would certainly lead with other strategic opportunities that make sense where we could get a return for our own shareholders from such investments.""Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the potential impact of his proposed tax holiday on the drug industry.   Corporate America had $1.3 trillion, or 74 percent of its total cash, stashed overseas in 2016, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc. That's up from an estimated $1.2 trillion, or 72 percent of total cash, a year earlier.    While the top five overseas cash holders are technology companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, the pharmaceutical industry accounts for a big chunk of that cash.      The five U.S. pharmaceutical companies with the largest cash piles, namely Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson, Amgen and Eli Lilly and Co, hold nearly $250 billion in overseas funds, according to data from U.S. non-profit research and advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice. At the same time, big pharma is in hot pursuit of the next blockbuster drug. Many of the industry's most successful franchises, from Gilead's Hepatitis C cure and Biogen Inc's multiple sclerosis treatments, to AbbVie Inc's arthritis drug Humira, are all bracing for declining revenues as patents age and competition heats up.      Valuations of biotechnology companies that could be acquisition targets for major drug firms are still hovering near historic lows after being dragged down by election-season political criticism of high drug prices.    ""Tax repatriation is a more likely situation now, benefiting large biotechs and (pharmaceutical companies) with significant offshore cash and a desire to buy mid-cap companies,"" RBC Capital equity analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research note.    The last time tax considerations fueled a wave of dealmaking in the pharmaceutical industry was in 2014, when companies sought to redomicile abroad through acquisitions, referred to as corporate inversions. But U.S. President Barack Obama subsequently announced curbs to limit inversions, culminating in Pfizer abandoning its $160-billion agreement to acquire Allergan Plc, the biggest attempted merger of all time.     Pharmaceutical M&A involving U.S. companies has been around $90 billion year-to-date, down from nearly $270 billion the year before.         ON THE HUNT     Executives at Pfizer, which has already said it is looking to do more deals after its $14-billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker Medivation Inc, have told investors in private meetings that its M&A appetite would grow even bigger if it could bring home its more than $70 billion in overseas cash, according to people familiar with the matter.     Pfizer could potentially use its newfound firepower to buy a company as large as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, a $92-billion market capitalization cancer drugmaker that fueled takeover speculation after a disappointing drug trial in August sent its stock down more than 25 percent.     Bristol-Myers Squibb's blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo could compliment Pfizer's plan to become a leader in immuno-oncology, which seeks to use the body's own defenses to treat cancer, industry bankers said, without suggesting that any deal is in the works.    Pfizer declined to comment, while Bristol-Myers Squibb did not respond to a request for comment.    Another cancer drug company that could attract takeover interest following a cash repatriation is Incyte Corp, as it could make an attractive target for Gilead Sciences Inc if it was able to bring home its nearly $25 billion in overseas cash, bankers said.     Gilead has been under pressure to find a new blockbuster because of declining sales from its aging Hepatitis C franchise and the recent failure in clinical trials of a cancer drug that would have competed with Incyte's successful blood cancer drug, Jakafi.     Gilead declined comment; Incyte did not respond to a request for comment.    Beyond cancer drug makers, other biotechnology companies that could attract takeover interest include those specializing in neurology companies, such as Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc, that have promising treatments for ailments such as Alzheimer's psychosis and migraine.     Acadia did not respond to a request for comment.    ""We believe the vast majority of investors have been underweight biotech all year,"" said Yee in his note.

455,"  French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) is considering a bid for Swiss biotech company Actelion (ATLN.S), rivaling an offer made by U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Bloomberg reported.Sanofi is working with advisers to assess its options, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/2h8qooh)Sanofi has made its interest known to Actelion but has not decided if it will proceed with a bid, added the Bloomberg report.Asked to comment on the report, a Sanofi spokeswoman said the company did not comment on market speculation, while Actelion also declined to comment on the situation.Actelion shares were seen opening up by around 4 percent, according to traders' pre-market indications. To gauge potential interest for Actelion, advisers have also reached out to other drugmakers including Switzerland's Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the Bloomberg report said.J&J said last month it was in preliminary talks with Actelion about a takeover of Europe's largest biotech firm, which was then valued at about $20 billion. Lung disease specialist Actelion, which confirmed the J&J move then, had warned that there was no certainty of a deal.In October, Sanofi said that a planned 3.5 billion euro  ($3.8 billion) share buyback would not suppress its appetite for deals.

456,"   By Erica Teichert  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of $1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its  Pinnacle hip implant.Although legal experts think J&J faces an uphill battle, both they and investors believe the Texas jury's penalty, the largest product liability verdict so far this year, is unlikely to stand.In the two-month trial, five separate people from California argued that design flaws in the metal-on-metal implant made by J&J subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics caused tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries.It is the second large verdict against J&J in the Pinnacle implant litigation, which has been consolidated before U.S. District Court Judge Edward Kinkeade in Texas. In July, another jury awarded six Texas plaintiffs $500 million. Both cases were so-called bellwethers, intended to gauge the value of claims for more than 9,000 other pending implant cases.J&J said in a statement it was confident in its appeal prospects and would not settle. It also said it stood by the safety of its product.Last Thursday's verdict has had little impact on J&J stock. Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with ESquared Asset Management, said investors assume large health products companies will occasionally be sued and lose and that the costs are ultimately manageable. J&J said it will ask Kinkeade to reduce or throw out the jury award before appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. According to the company, the multi-plaintiff format stacked the deck against it by parading a series of victims in front of the jury and exaggerating the number of complaints about the implant. The company won the first bellwether trial in a case involving a single plaintiff in 2014. The next is scheduled for September 2017, and Kinkeade has not decided how many plaintiffs will be involved in that trial.These results ""perfectly illustrate the distortions and confusion inherent in multi-plaintiff trials and underscore the extent of the legal errors that have been repeated,"" said J&J defense lawyer John Beisner.But several legal experts said such a challenge faced long odds. Lynn Baker, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted trial judges are normally given great leeway in managing their cases and multi-plaintiff trials were a long-established means of clearing dockets faster. ""I would not expect J&J to succeed on a claim that they were prejudiced by the multi-plaintiff bellwether format,"" she said.J&J also said the judge allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to present inflammatory and prejudicial testimony to the juries, raising bribery accusations against the company and claims that the metal-on-metal implants could cause cancer. University of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias said an appeals court was unlikely to overturn the verdict on such grounds though. ""Unless there is clear prejudice on the part of the jury, you’ve got to defer to the factfinder,"" he said. But even without showing its trial was unfair, the professors said J&J's case was strong for having the $1 billion award reduced on the grounds that it is excessive. Kinkeade cut the $500 million July verdict to $151 million.Andrew Bradt, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted the U.S. Supreme Court has held punitive damages should be no more than 10 times compensatory damages. The $1.041 billion award was mainly punitive, with just $32 million in compensatory damages.Bradt said the final award could be even lower than $320 million, since the high court has also said punitive damages awards should be closely tied to plaintiffs' injuries rather than as a broader deterrent.
