0,"  Feb 11 Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King mobile refrigeration units, forecast first-quarter profit below analysts' estimates, hurt partly by weak U.S. construction spending in a colder-than-usual winter.The diversified U.S. manufacturer forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of 23-28 cents per share, below the average analyst forecast of a profit of 34 cents per share.Construction spending barely rose in December and U.S. manufacturing activity slowed sharply in January on the back of the biggest drop in new orders in 33 years.""Most investors have expected a conservative guide from IR (Ingersoll-Rand) at this point, though this may be a little lower than expected,"" Jefferies & Co analyst Steve Volkmann wrote in a note. Ingersoll is more sensitive than other U.S. industrials to the housing and commercial construction markets as they account for about 60 percent of the company's annual revenue.A recovering U.S. housing market and strong construction spending in October and November boosted demand for Ingersoll's heating and cooling systems in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Revenue at the company's climate solutions business rose 8 percent to $2.32 billion.Total revenue rose 6 percent to $3.10 billion. Analysts on average had forecast $3.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders more than halved to $77.7 million, or 26 cents per share, from $162.1 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items related to the spin-off of its security business, Allegion Plc, Ingersoll earned 61 cents per share, in line with estimates.Ingersoll's shares were down 1 percent at $58.40 before the bell on Tuesday. They have risen 3.6 percent since Ingersoll completed the spin-off on Dec. 1, compared with a 0.33 percent decline in the broader S&P 500 index in the same period.",2014-02-11,IR,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 9:18am EST",UPDATE 1-Ingersoll's profit forecast misses as construction slows,http://www.reuters.com//article/ingersollrand-results-idUSL3N0LG33C20140211?type=companyNews
1,"  (Adds quote, details)By Emi Emoto and Taiga UranakaTOKYO Dec 21 Japanese electronics maker Panasonic Corp is set to buy U.S. refrigeration firm Hussmann for over 186.6 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in a deal it says will leverage its technology and help it break into the U.S. food distribution industry. Panasonic, like several domestic peers, has been moving away from unprofitable smartphones and plasma television sets, focusing instead on higher margin products, such as high-end cold storage, LED lighting and remote monitoring.Under the deal, announced on Monday after a Reuters report, Panasonic will buy full control of Hussmann from private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, the majority owner, and industrial group Ingersoll Rand, which retains a 36.7 percent stake after selling off a stake in 2011. Panasonic has said it is targeting 2.5 trillion yen of sales from its offerings for businesses, rather than consumers, in 2018, 300 billion of which will come from food distribution. To date, it has mostly been present in Asia, and has sought ways to break into the United States, the industry's largest market. ""We want to make (this acquisition) a trigger to accelerate our global business,"" Kazuhiro Tsuga, Panasonic Chief Executive, told reporters at a news conference. ""We are likely to actively pursue overseas acquisitions.""Hussmann, which will become a fully-owned subsidiary of Panasonic, has a leading share in the U.S. market, manufacturing and maintaining refrigerated and freezer display cases.
