0,"  (Corrects to clarify Howard Hughes Corp was spun off by General Growth Properties Inc, add details on liability in 12th paragraph)By Patrick Temple-WestWASHINGTON Feb 13 A California homebuilder has prevailed in U.S. Tax Court in a case involving an accounting method that could help builders and developers defer taxes, industry experts said on Thursday.Handing a defeat to the Internal Revenue Service, the court ruled that Shea Homes LP could defer payment of taxes on home sales until 95 percent of the homes in its huge, gated-community developments were sold.The IRS had argued Shea should pay taxes as it sold each home and not wait until its developments, including thousands of properties, were nearly filled, court filings showed.The Tax Court, which hears most disputes between taxpayers and the IRS, found that Walnut, California-based Shea's use of the ""completed contract method"" of accounting was appropriate. The company ""properly used a permissible method of accounting,"" Judge Robert Wherry said in an 82-page opinion.Shea Homes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The IRS declined to comment on Thursday. The tax agency has challenged companies for years over the completed contract method. The Shea decision will give more certainty to companies that use the method, experts said.""This is a huge case, not only because of the money involved but because of the definitions,"" said Alan Clark, an accountant in Atlanta and chairman of the Construction Financial Management Association, a construction industry trade group.""This case should help developers. It should help spur investments,"" Clark said. Shea's dispute involved $23.7 million in taxes for 2004 and 2005. The housing developments at the center of the dispute were in Arizona, California and Colorado. The case was being watched by other home developers, including Howard Hughes Corp.Howard Hughes is challenging the IRS over a $144.1 million tax bill over a completed contract method dispute involving home sales. That case, filed in Tax Court, went to trial in November 2012 and is awaiting a decision. Activist investor William Ackman is chairman of Howard Hughes.Dallas-based Howard Hughes was spun off from General Growth Properties Inc. Though Howard Hughes is the company in court, General Growth Properties is liable for the tax payments if the IRS wins, according to the spinoff agreement. A spokesman for General Growth Properties declined to comment on Thursday.The case is Shea Homes, Inc and subsidiaries et al v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Docket No. 1400-10.

1,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Mike Stone  Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) has been exploring an acquisition in recent months of General Growth Properties Inc (GGP) (GGP.N), the U.S. mall operator with a market value of $24 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.A potential deal would illustrate how major property investors such as Brookfield view publicly listed real estate assets as cheap, as concerns over U.S. economic growth weigh on the valuations of several real estate investment trusts.Brookfield, a Canadian asset management firm that through several entities owns around 34 percent of GGP, has approached several potential investment partners, including sovereign wealth funds, to discuss possibly taking GGP private, the sources said this week.The preliminary deliberations have not advanced, according to the sources, who cautioned there was no certainty Brookfield would make an offer to GGP. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Brookfield declined to comment while GGP did not respond to requests for comment. GGP shares jumped as much as 6.5 percent on the news and ended trading at $27.56, up 1.5 percent.GGP has 131 properties, mainly in the United States, including the planned development of the Ala Moana Center in Hawaii. GGP's tenants include car maker Tesla (TSLA.O), jeweler Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) and retailer Macy's Inc (M.N).A deal for GGP would be similar to a related transaction that Brookfield is pursuing. Earlier this month, it offered to purchase the remainder of mall operator Rouse Properties Inc RSE.N that it does not already own. Rouse was spun off from GGP in 2012 and currently has a market value of $1 billion. It has said it is considering Brookfield's offer. Brookfield has also partnered with co-investors in the past. It has been a major backer of GGP since its emergence from bankruptcy in 2010. In November, GGP reported in its third-quarter results that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization had increased 5.6 percent to $526 million from $498 million in the same period from a year earlier. GGP's stock has traded down about 13.4 percent in the last 12 months, though the company had increased its quarterly dividend to $0.19 from $0.17 over the same time period. In March 2015, rival mall owner Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) offered to buy peer Macerich Co (MAC.N) for $14.4 billion in cash, in a deal that would have joined the No. 1 and No. 3 U.S. shopping mall owners. Macerich spurred Simon's overtures.
