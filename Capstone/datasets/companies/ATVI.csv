But it was the fifth installment of a critically acclaimed series that had become an indelible component of popular youth culture.RECORD BY ANY NAME Some analysts estimate that Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of ""Grand Theft Auto,"" spent over $260 million to develop, produce and market the fifth installment, though it's unclear whether that's comparable with Activision's own $500 million figure.GTA is on track to reach $2 billion in retail sales, according to analysts. ""Bungie's very ambitious plan is designed to unfold over a 10-year period, ""said an Activision spokesperson. ""The depth of creative content, scope and scale is unprecedented and is required to bring Bungie's vision to life.""The spokesperson added that investment in the next generation engine and a ""robust backend infrastructure are upfront expenditures that should reduce future product development costs.""""Over the long term, we expect the ultimate product costs to be roughly in line with other Triple-A titles.""Activison's big bet comes as hits are getting harder to come by. The industry is struggling with a years-long sales slump, the result of increasing competition from free-to-play games on smartphones and tablets. Video game software sales plummeted 11 percent last year from 2012. Sales of Activision's 2013 title, ""Call of Duty: Ghosts,"" proved weaker than its 2012 installment.Over time, Activision's ""Destiny"" could hit large numbers ""but there's no way they would come close to Grand Theft Auto,"" said Mike Hickey, an analyst at the Benchmark Company.Still, Activision's executives say they see franchise potential in its new game.""We expect 'Destiny' to be Activision Publishing's next billion-dollar franchise,"" Kotick said when the company released its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 6.The company, which reports first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, saw earnings slide 12 percent to $1 billion in 2013. Its revenues dropped to $4.6 billion, from $4.9 billion the year before.It generates significant revenue from its franchise properties, but many of those are several years old. ""Call of Duty"" has had a decade-long run while ""World of Warcraft"" was first released in 2004.Franchises enable game publishers to generate steady revenue from several iterations, as well as digital sales from additional downloadable content.Activision could use another money-making shooter game franchise, said Hickey, the Benchmark Company analyst.""It's up to management to create new experiences to drive forward growth over a game that could be aging a bit,"" he said. ""I'm not saying 'Call of Duty' is like that, but everyone is concerned about fatigue and competition.""

17,"   By Andrew Chung  Former dictator Manuel Noriega may be serving time in a Panamanian prison for the killing of political opponents, but that doesn't mean he likes being portrayed in a video game as a murderer.Noriega, 80, has filed a lawsuit against video game publisher Activision Blizzard Inc, saying the company is using his image in its wildly popular ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" game without his permission, in an effort to “increase the popularity and revenue” from the title. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. In the complaint, Noriega said he had been damaged by Activision’s portrayal of him as “the culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes,” including kidnapping and murder, adding that Activision was using his likeness to heighten the game’s realism and increase sales. Noriega is seeking unspecified restitution as well as lost profits.  ""Call of Duty” is one of the video game industry’s biggest successes, racking up more than $1 billion in sales just 15 days after its release in 2012. Neither Noriega’s attorneys nor a representative of Activision were immediately available for comment. Noriega was military dictator of Panama from 1983 to 1989. He was an informant for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, according to historical accounts. He also worked with Colombian drug cartels and was eventually indicted in the United States on drug and racketeering charges. A U.S. military invasion in 1989 ended his rule and brought him to the United States. Noriega was convicted in the United States in 1992 and served a prison sentence until 2010, when he was extradited to France to serve a sentence there. France then sent him to Panama, where he remains in jail for crimes committed during his rule. Noriega is not the only public figure to sue video game makers for the use of their image. Earlier this month, actress Lindsay Lohan sued the makers of ""Grand Theft Auto V"" in New York Supreme Court.

28,"   By Andrew Chung  A U.S. judge has dismissed former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega's lawsuit against Activision Blizzard Inc over his depiction in the popular videogame ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II.""Judge William Fahey of Los Angeles Superior Court granted Activision's special motion to strike the case, under a California statute that seeks to prevent lawsuits stifling free speech. Monday's ruling was made public on Tuesday.  Noriega filed suit in July, saying Activision had portrayed him as ""the culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes,"" including kidnapping and murder, to heighten the game's realism and increase sales. He said the company had infringed his right to his own publicity, and sought unspecified damages. Activision said the use of the character was protected under the right to free speech, and Fahey agreed. He said Noriega's right of publicity was outweighed by the defendants' First Amendment right to free expression, and that there was no evidence of harm to Noriega's reputation.  ""Indeed,"" Fahey said, ""given the world-wide reporting of his actions in the 1980s and early 1990s, it is hard to imagine that any such evidence exists."" Activision had warned that if Noriega prevailed, it would have a chilling effect on movies and works of art that portray historical and political figures. Noriega's character, one of 45, appeared in two of 11 missions in the game, which is set in both the Cold War and in the future.  Noriega said in court documents that he was unaware that his image was being used without his consent until he was advised by his grandchildren. Noriega was the military dictator of Panama from 1983 to 1989, when his rule ended with a U.S. invasion. He was later indicted in the United States on drug and racketeering charges. He was convicted in 1992 and imprisoned until 2010, when he was  extradited to France to serve a sentence there. France then sent him to Panama, where he remains in prison for crimes committed during his rule.Activision was represented in the case by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

29,"   By Andrew Chung  Oct 28 A U.S. judge has dismissed former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega's lawsuit against Activision Blizzard Inc over his depiction in the popular videogame ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II.""Judge William Fahey of Los Angeles Superior Court granted Activision's special motion to strike the case, under a California statute that seeks to prevent lawsuits stifling free speech. Monday's ruling was made public on Tuesday.Noriega filed suit in July, saying Activision had portrayed him as ""the culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes,"" including kidnapping and murder, to heighten the game's realism and increase sales. He said the company had infringed his right to his own publicity, and sought unspecified damages.Activision said the use of the character was protected under the right to free speech, and Fahey agreed. He said Noriega's right of publicity was outweighed by the defendants' First Amendment right to free expression, and that there was no evidence of harm to Noriega's reputation.""Indeed,"" Fahey said, ""given the world-wide reporting of his actions in the 1980s and early 1990s, it is hard to imagine that any such evidence exists."" Activision had warned that if Noriega prevailed, it would have a chilling effect on movies and works of art that portray historical and political figures. Noriega's character, one of 45, appeared in two of 11 missions in the game, which is set in both the Cold War and in the future.Noriega said in court documents that he was unaware that his image was being used without his consent until he was advised by his grandchildren. Noriega was the military dictator of Panama from 1983 to 1989, when his rule ended with a U.S. invasion. He was later indicted in the United States on drug and racketeering charges. He was convicted in 1992 and imprisoned until 2010, when he was  extradited to France to serve a sentence there. France then sent him to Panama, where he remains in prison for crimes committed during his rule.Activision was represented in the case by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.The case is Noriega v.

30,"   By Malathi Nayak | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) raised its full-year 2014 forecast after posting better-than-expected third-quarter results on robust sales of ""Destiny"" and a jump in ""World of Warcraft"" subscribers.Shares of Activision were up about 4 percent in after-hours activity after closing at $19.95 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.Activision, also known for its ""Skylanders"" and ""Diablo"" games, raised its 2014 non-GAAP revenue forecast to $4.8 billion and said it expects non-GAAP earnings of $1.35 per share. It had previously announced a forecast of $4.7 billion in non-GAAP revenue and $1.29 per share of non-GAAP income.""We expect to deliver double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth year-over-year and record non-GAAP earnings per share” in 2014, Chief Executive Bobby Kotick told analysts on a conference call. Sci-fi shooter game ""Destiny,"" which set a record by touching $500 million in sales on its launch day in September, is expected to deliver strong sales through the holiday season and beyond, executives told analysts on the call. The title has seen a $500 million investment from the company. The company said ""World of Warcraft"" subscribers in the quarter were more than 7.4 million compared with 6.8 million in the second quarter. This was driven by a surge in players returning to the game ahead of the Nov. 13 release of ""Warlords of Draenor,"" the next expansion pack in the World of Warcraft series, executives told analysts on the conference call. The Santa Monica, California-based company reported a 78 percent jump in non-GAAP net revenue of $1.17 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $657 million a year earlier. This beat analysts' expectations of $1.005 billion.The company's third-quarter non-GAAP income, adjusted for the deferral of digital revenue and other items, was 23 cents per share, up from 8 cents per share a year earlier. This also surpassed Wall Street's average estimate of 13 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Activision's holiday offerings include the just-launched ""Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare"" title from its hit military-action game franchise and ""Skylanders Trap Team"" that was released last month as part of its billion-dollar game franchise for children.In a bid to expand its footprint in Asia, the company will launch its ""Call of Duty"" title as a free-to-play online game in China next year, executives said on the conference call.

33,"   By Tom Hals  Nov 19 Videogame maker Activision Blizzard reached a record $275 million settlement over a lawsuit by a shareholder who opposed the company's 2013 deal to acquire its stock that was held by Vivendi SA.The owner of the ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Call of Duty"" games said in a statement Wednesday the money would be paid by insurance companies and unidentified defendants.The payment settles a class action and what is known as a derivative lawsuit in which a shareholder sues on behalf of the company. As a result, the money will be paid to Activision rather than Activision's shareholders.No party acknowledged wrongdoing, according to Activision. The settlement is the largest of a shareholder derivative lawsuit, topping last year's $139 million settlement involving News Corp.Other large derivative lawsuit settlements include a $122 million settlements paid by Oracle Corp's Chief Executive Larry Ellison in 2005.The lawsuit by Activision shareholder Anthony Pacchia was prompted by the $8 billion deal in 2013 in which Activision and an investor group known as ASAC bought the videogame maker's stock from Vivendi, a French media-focused conglomerate. Pacchia said that Activision Chief Executive Bobby Kotick and Co-Chairman Brian Kelly breached their fiduciary duties for their role in the deal as participants in the ASAC group. ASAC bought 172 million Activision shares from Vivendi alongside the 429 million purchased by Activision.Pacchia said that Kotick and Kelly negotiated a transfer of control from Vivendi to themselves, rather than a repurchase of control by Activision. According to the fifth amended complaint, they also negotiated for themselves to receive 25 percent of the price gains on ASAC's Activision stock once certain thresholds are met, even though they only contributed 6 percent of the equity of ASAC.Pacchia also named as defendants Activision directors, Vivendi and the ASAC investor group.As part of the settlement, two unaffiliated directors will be added to the Activision board and ASAC's voting rights will be cut to 19.9 percent from 24.9 percent, according to a letter filed with the court.The parties anticipate the settlement will be filed by the end of next week. The agreement requires court approval by Delaware Court of Chancery judge Travis Laster.

42,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del.  WILMINGTON, Del. A Delaware judge on Wednesday approved a $275 million shareholder settlement involving videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc and awarded the small law firms that brought the case a $72.5 million fee.The owner of the ""Call of Duty"" game agreed to the settlement last year, which ended a shareholder lawsuit challenging Activision's $8 billion deal to acquire its stock held by French conglomerate Vivendi SA. The lawsuit alleged that Activision's chief executive and co-chairman benefited unfairly from the deal, and the settlement barred them from gaining control of Activision.On Wednesday, Travis Laster, a judge on Delaware's Court of Chancery, overruled an objection to the settlement and to the fee award. The lawsuit was led by the four-attorney firm of Friedlander & Gorris in Wilmington, Delaware, and the six-lawyer firm of Bragar Eagel & Squire of New York. ""This case involved true contingency risk,"" wrote Laster, in a 90-page opinion approving the fee and settlement. He noted the partners of the firms involved took out personal loans to fund the case and turned away other work.The fee award works out to $9,500 an hour, according to court records. ""While the size of the award implies a generous hourly rate, in this case it is justified by the effort,"" wrote Laster. The fee award was opposed by two shareholders who said their attorneys had contributed to ultimate settlement by opposing an attempt to strike an early deal in the case. They sought $7.25 million for lawyers at Levi & Korsinksy of New York and Smith Katzenstein & Furlow of Wilmington.Laster rejected that argument and noted ""they can claim to have contributed causally to the settlement only in the metaphysical sense that the flap of a butterfly's wings in Beijing may lead to a thunderstorm in Delaware."" The case was a derivative lawsuit, meaning the investor who brought it, Anthony Pacchia, was suing on behalf of Activision. The settlement was paid to Activision's treasury by Vivendi, insurers and an investor group that included Activision Chief Executive Bobby Kotick and co-Chairman Brian Kelly.The settlement is the largest ever for a shareholder derivative lawsuit.

May 20 A Delaware judge on Wednesday approved a $275 million shareholder settlement involving videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc and awarded the small law firms that brought the case a $72.5 million fee.The owner of the ""Call of Duty"" game agreed to the settlement last year, which ended a shareholder lawsuit challenging Activision's $8 billion deal to acquire its stock held by French conglomerate Vivendi SA. The lawsuit alleged that Activision's chief executive and co-chairman benefited unfairly from the deal, and the settlement barred them from gaining control of Activision.On Wednesday, Travis Laster, a judge on Delaware's Court of Chancery, overruled an objection to the settlement and to the fee award. The lawsuit was led by the four-attorney firm of Friedlander & Gorris in Wilmington, Delaware, and the six-lawyer firm of Bragar Eagel & Squire of New York. ""This case involved true contingency risk,"" wrote Laster, in a 90-page opinion approving the fee and settlement. He noted the partners of the firms involved took out personal loans to fund the case and turned away other work.The fee award works out to $9,500 an hour, according to court records. ""While the size of the award implies a generous hourly rate, in this case it is justified by the effort,"" wrote Laster. The fee award was opposed by two shareholders who said their attorneys had contributed to ultimate settlement by opposing an attempt to strike an early deal in the case. They sought $7.25 million for lawyers at Levi & Korsinksy of New York and Smith Katzenstein & Furlow of Wilmington.Laster rejected that argument and noted ""they can claim to have contributed causally to the settlement only in the metaphysical sense that the flap of a butterfly's wings in Beijing may lead to a thunderstorm in Delaware."" The case was a derivative lawsuit, meaning the investor who brought it, Anthony Pacchia, was suing on behalf of Activision. The settlement was paid to Activision's treasury by Vivendi, insurers and an investor group that included Activision Chief Executive Bobby Kotick and co-Chairman Brian Kelly.The settlement is the largest ever for a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Other large settlements include $139 million involving News Corp in 2013 and $122 million paid by Oracle Corp's chief executive, Larry Ellison, in 2005.The Friedlander firm was known as Bouchard, Margules & Friedlander when it brought the lawsuit.

51,"   By Eric Auchard and Leila Abboud | DUBLIN  DUBLIN Video game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) will buy ""Candy Crush Saga"" creator King Digital Entertainment KING.N for $5.9 billion, as the heavyweight of console and PC-gaming makes a major push into the faster-growing mobile market.The deal is one of the biggest in the industry in recent years, more than twice the size of Microsoft Inc's (MSFT.O) $2.5 billion purchase of ""Minecraft"" maker Mojang last year, and the biggest-ever acquisition of a mobile gaming company.The failure of Dublin-based King to replicate the success of Candy Crush with follow-up titles such as ""Farm Heroes"" and ""Pet Rescue"" has led some investors to think it may be a one-hit wonder.But Activision, whose shares were down 0.5 percent at $34.43 in early trading, is betting that its experience in sustaining long-running blockbuster franchises like ""Call of Duty"" and ""World of Warcraft"" can help it develop new hit series.Cowen & Co analysts described the deal as ""an absolute steal"", but others expressed skepticism.""The combination increases Activision's scope and scale, but more importantly gives the company another top-quality IP (intellectual property) creator,"" the Cowan analysts wrote.The deal also gives the U.S. company a major presence in the mobile market, where games sales are expected to grow 21 percent this year to $20.6 billion, according to research firm Newzoo.That compares with expected growth of 7 percent for computer games and 2 percent for TV and console games, although they will still represent the lion's share of the $91.5 billion overall industry, according to the industry researchers. Activision is paying $18 per share in cash, showing how the company's fortunes have flagged since its 2012 initial public offering at $22.50 per share. The offer is a premium of 16 percent to King's close on Monday.King's net revenue - still heavily reliant on Candy Crush - fell 16 percent in the second quarter.King's shares were trading at $17.73 on Tuesday morning, indicating that investors don't expect a higher bid.Analysts at Jefferies & Co were among those expressing some doubts about the deal, saying that King faced a ""daunting task"" in replicating the success of Candy Crush.""We expect a heavy dose of scepticism from investors especially given the large deal size,"" said the brokerage, which nonetheless recommended that investors buy Activision shares. 500 MILLION USERS With the gaming business driven by blockbusters as much as the movie business, some companies such as Finland's Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds, and online games company Zygna (ZNGA.O) have faded after failing to follow up with new hits.Activision said buying King would help broaden the reach of its games, adding that 60 percent of King's players were female, and that the combined company would have more than 500 million monthly active users across the world. Activision, whose action games appeal mainly to males, focuses mainly on console and PC-based games whereas King's offerings are designed for mobile devices and playing online.Santa Monica, California-based Activision said the deal would add to its estimated 2016 adjusted revenue and earnings by about 30 percent. It will use $3.6 billion of cash held offshore to fund the acquisition, and borrow the rest.King will continue to operate as an independent unit led by Chief Executive Riccardo Zacconi, who told Reuters that Activision appealed to him because of the company's expertise in building long-lasting franchises.European private equity fund Apax [APAX.UL] listed King in 2014 and holds a 44.68 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.The deal, expected to be completed by spring 2016, is subject to approval by King's shareholders and the Irish High Court, and clearances by antitrust authorities.Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Activision on the deal, while King was advised by J.P. Morgan.

56,"  * Activision makes big push into mobile gaming market* Combined company to have over 500 mln monthly active users* To pay $18 per share, in all cash-deal* Deal is 20 percent below the 2012 IPO price* Activision shares down 0.5 pct, King trades near offer price   (Adds share move, analyst comment)By Eric Auchard and Leila AbboudDUBLIN, Nov 3 Video game maker Activision Blizzard will buy ""Candy Crush Saga"" creator King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion, as the heavyweight of console and PC-gaming makes a major push into the faster-growing mobile market.The deal is one of the biggest in the industry in recent years, more than twice the size of Microsoft Inc's $2.5 billion purchase of ""Minecraft"" maker Mojang last year, and the biggest-ever acquisition of a mobile gaming company.The failure of Dublin-based King to replicate the success of Candy Crush with follow-up titles such as ""Farm Heroes"" and ""Pet Rescue"" has led some investors to think it may be a one-hit wonder.But Activision, whose shares were down 0.5 percent at $34.43 in early trading, is betting that its experience in sustaining long-running blockbuster franchises like ""Call of Duty"" and ""World of Warcraft"" can help it develop new hit series.Cowen & Co analysts described the deal as ""an absolute steal"", but others expressed skepticism. ""The combination increases Activision's scope and scale, but more importantly gives the company another top-quality IP (intellectual property) creator,"" the Cowan analysts wrote.The deal also gives the U.S. company a major presence in the mobile market, where games sales are expected to grow 21 percent this year to $20.6 billion, according to research firm Newzoo.That compares with expected growth of 7 percent for computer games and 2 percent for TV and console games, although they will still represent the lion's share of the $91.5 billion overall industry, according to the industry researchers.Activision is paying $18 per share in cash, showing how the company's fortunes have flagged since its 2012 initial public offering at $22.50 per share. The offer is a premium of 16 percent to King's close on Monday.King's net revenue - still heavily reliant on Candy Crush - fell 16 percent in the second quarter. King's shares were trading at $17.73 on Tuesday morning, indicating that investors don't expect a higher bid.Analysts at Jefferies & Co were among those expressing some doubts about the deal, saying that King faced a ""daunting task"" in replicating the success of Candy Crush.""We expect a heavy dose of scepticism from investors especially given the large deal size,"" said the brokerage, which nonetheless recommended that investors buy Activision shares.500 MILLION USERS  With the gaming business driven by blockbusters as much as the movie business, some companies such as Finland's Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds, and online games company Zygna  have faded after failing to follow up with new hits.Activision said buying King would help broaden the reach of its games, adding that 60 percent of King's players were female, and that the combined company would have more than 500 million monthly active users across the world.Activision, whose action games appeal mainly to males, focuses mainly on console and PC-based games whereas King's offerings are designed for mobile devices and playing online.Santa Monica, California-based Activision said the deal would add to its estimated 2016 adjusted revenue and earnings by about 30 percent. It will use $3.6 billion of cash held offshore to fund the acquisition, and borrow the rest.King will continue to operate as an independent unit led by Chief Executive Riccardo Zacconi, who told Reuters that Activision appealed to him because of the company's expertise in building long-lasting franchises.European private equity fund Apax listed King in 2014 and holds a 44.68 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.The deal, expected to be completed by spring 2016, is subject to approval by King's shareholders and the Irish High Court, and clearances by antitrust authorities.Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Activision on the deal, while King was advised by J.P. Morgan.(Additional reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bengaluru, Liana Baker in New York and Freya Berry in London; Editing by Pravin Char and Ted Kerr)",2015-11-03,ATVI,"Tue Nov 3, 2015 | 10:12am EST",UPDATE 5-Activision Blizzard buys 'Candy Crush' maker in mobile push,http://www.reuters.com//article/king-digital-ma-activision-idUSL3N12Y1HB20151103?type=companyNews

73,"  Activision Blizzard Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit due to strong demand for its popular ""Call of Duty: Black Ops III"" videogame.  Shares of the company, which also forecast current-quarter revenue and profit above analysts' expectations, rose 4 percent in extended trading on Thursday.""Call of Duty: Black Ops III"", released in November, stayed in the list of 10 most sold physical videogames in the United States in January-March, according to research firm NPD Group.Activision, known for its game series such as ""Skylanders"" and ""World of Warcraft"", said adjusted revenue from its high-margin digital business rose 48 percent to $797 million.The company gets nearly 90 percent of its revenue from the digital business, which offers games and other content as downloads.  Videogame makers such as Activision are increasingly offering games on the digital platform instead of selling them in physical formats as gamers shift to playing on smartphones and tablets from consoles. Activision, which bought ""Candy Crush"" maker King Digital in February, said it expected to release a new game ""Overwatch"" on May 24. The futuristic multi-player game allows players to choose an avatar from 21 heroes.Activision forecast adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share and revenue of $1.38 billion for the second quarter.  Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 33 cents per share and sales of $1.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Activision's total adjusted revenue rose 29.2 percent to $908 million in the quarter ended March 31, beating the average estimate of $812.9 million. Excluding items, the company earned 23 cents per share, nearly double the 12 cents analysts had expected.Activision shares were trading at $36.35 after the bell.

74,"   By Anya George Tharakan  Activision Blizzard Inc is sweet on mobile advertising.The new owner of King Digital could soon start displaying mobile ads in King's games as it looks to target the 463 million players who access games such as ""Candy Crush"" and ""Farm Heroes"" on their smartphones.Activision closed its nearly $6 billion acquisition of King in February, becoming the world's biggest game network, but sparked concerns that it was overpaying for a company with just one blockbuster game series - ""Candy Crush"".Now, with in-game advertising, Activision is set to tap a big revenue opportunity that should put to rest all doubts.""Given our massive network, we do believe that advertising could be a meaningful revenue stream for King in the long term,"" King's Chief Executive Riccardo Zacconi said on Activision's earnings call on Thursday.Zacconi said King's gamers were one of the ""largest untapped audiences for advertisers in the world"" and the company had  started experimenting with advertising in two games.He, however, said it was early days and didn't expect any impact to this year's results. As an independent company, King used to run ads in its games until 2013. It stopped them to offer an ad-free gaming experience to better compete with ""Farmville"" creator Zynga Inc.""I think one of the first things (King) will do is they'll have some type of incentive ad, where if you run out of lives it'll go hey, if you watch this 30-second video, we'll give you two more lives,"" Cowen and Co analyst Doug Creutz told Reuters.If King carries video ads, that would be a huge opportunity for them, said Harish Thimmappa, senior director of social sales at marketing-technology company Kenshoo.King, whose players are primarily female, generated just 1 percent of its 2013 revenue of $1.88 billion from advertising. For Activision, though, the opportunity could be much bigger, at least $500 million annually, analysts said.CALL OF OPPORTUNITY   Activision on Thursday reported first-quarter profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street expectations, helped by strong demand for its popular ""Call of Duty: Black Ops III"" videogame and the inclusion of King's financials.Activision shares closed up 8.5 percent at $37.87 on Friday. The stock had risen more than 50 percent in the past 12 months.Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said he expected King to begin advertising by the end of this year, but generate significantly higher earnings from it in 2017.""We believe Activision Blizzard could earn well in excess of $3.00 by 2018 if it optimizes King's untapped advertising opportunity and unlocks deal synergies, suggesting its stock is significantly undervalued,"" said Pachter who has an ""outperform"" rating on Activision's stock.He raised his price target to $43 from $40 on Friday.

The multi-player futuristic game now has more than 15 million players and has generated about $500 million in revenue to date, excluding deferrals, the company said. The success of ""Overwatch"" gave the Blizzard unit its biggest-ever quarterly online player community, with monthly active users increasing 13 percent to 33 million.The company's net income dropped 40 percent to $127 million, or 17 cents per share, mainly due to costs associated with the near $6 billion acquisition of King Digital in February.Activision said King Digital's monthly active users declined to 409 million due to ""seasonal trends and launch timing"". King is expected to release one more non-Candy Crush game towards the end of the year, Activision said.

93,"  GameStop Corp (GME.N) forecast a bigger-than-expected drop in same-store sales for the crucial holiday quarter, and the company said it expected revenue from its business of selling videogames to largely decline during the period.The company, the world's largest retailer of video games, has been struggling as more players switch to downloading games on their consoles from buying physical copies.Revenue from the videogame category, which includes new hardware, software and accessories, is expected to decline in double digits in November and by single digits in December, Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said in an interview on Tuesday. Bartel said the company expected revenue from the business to be flat to positive in January.He also said sales of Activision Blizzard's (ATVI.O) latest ""Call of Duty"" game would be lower than a year earlier.GameStop also forecast total sales to decline between 5-10 percent in the current quarter, translating into revenue of $3.17 billion-$3.35 billion.Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $3.45 billion,  according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, GameStop's shares gained 2.1 percent to $24.61 in after-market trading as the company maintained its full-year profit forecast. Bartel said the company expects to expand its operating earnings by diversifying its portfolio. Under Chief Executive Paul Raines, GameStop has been expanding its digital and mobile offerings and snapping up technology brand stores that sell mobile phones and other electronic devices. Revenue in its technology brand business rose 54.4 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.       The company said it expected sales at established stores to decline between 7 percent and 12 percent in the fourth quarter, much bigger than the 7.1 percent fall analysts were expecting, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.GameStop's net income fell to $50.8 million, or 49 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Oct. 29 from $55.9 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. The company's net sales fell to $1.96 billion from $2.02 billion, the third straight quarterly decline.Excluding items, GameStop earned 49 cents per share, beating analysts' estimate of 47 cents.The numbers were in line with the company's preliminary estimates released earlier this month.
