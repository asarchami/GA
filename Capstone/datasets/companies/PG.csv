9,"  By Phil WahbaJan 24 Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, reported a dip in quarterly profit on Friday as its push in emerging markets led to a lower gross profit margin.Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told reporters on a conference call that sales in emerging markets had risen 8 percent during the second quarter, easily outpacing developed markets, where sales barely edged up.But P&G's gross margin is lower in those markets as the company establishes itself. Still, the costs are worth paying, said one investor.""The emerging markets are definitely the future for P&G,"" said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which manages about $11 billion and has long owned P&G and Kimberly-Clark Corp shares. P&G's Moeller said its market shares in both emerging and developed sectors had held steady.Earlier this weak, rival Unilever  said it would stick to its emerging markets growth strategy as a fourth-quarter recovery in sales there boosted 2013 results.P&G's gross profit margin slipped 0.9 percentage points, in part because of stagnant sales of its beauty products, which have higher margins. The margins were helped by lower manufacturing costs. P&G, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, left its 2014 forecasts unchanged. It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes as well as acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent, and core earnings to rise 5 percent to 7 percent.""It is reassuring to see it has confidence it can hit the numbers, despite the weak categories,"" J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher wrote in a note. The company's beauty division continued to struggle during the quarter, with organic sales unchanged as skin care results slipped. P&G's health care segment reported the fastest growth, rising 5 percent.The company earned $3.43 billion, or $1.18 per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from $4.06 billion, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges, fell 1 percent to $1.21. Analysts expected $1.20 a share.Sales rose 0.5 percent to $22.28 billion, in line with the average Wall Street estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

12,"   By Soyoung Kim and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 31 Merck & Co Inc has received approaches from large consumer companies interested in buying its consumer healthcare business, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, according to people familiar with the matter.Merck's consumer healthcare business, which also includes Dr. Scholl's foot care and other consumer products, could be worth as much as $8 billion to $10 billion in a sale, or roughly four to five times the unit's annual revenue, some of the people said.Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer Inc, is considering alternatives for both its consumer and animal health businesses and has said it expects to complete the review in 2014.Among a range of options it has considered for the consumer unit, Merck discussed a potential asset swap with Novartis AG , under which Merck would give up its consumer assets in return for the Swiss drugmaker's animal health and other units, Reuters and others previously reported.The probability of carrying out such a deal, however, is currently seen as low due to the complexity of valuing different businesses, prompting Merck to explore an outright sale of its consumer unit as well, people familiar with the matter said.Merck has been in conversations with several interested parties and is being advised by Morgan Stanley on the process, the people said, asking not to be named because the conversations are private. For its much larger animal health unit, the second-largest in the industry after Zoetis Inc, Merck is evaluating the potential of spinning it off as a separate publicly traded company, people familiar with the matter said.Analysts and people familiar with the industry say big consumer companies such as Reckitt Benckiser Group and Procter & Gamble Co could be logical buyers for Merck's consumer healthcare business.Reckitt already owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in a September interview that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and has the firepower to do sizeable deals. Procter & Gamble Co also has a portfolio that includes a range of medicines and beauty products.Reckitt and P&G declined to comment.Johnson & Johnson is the biggest player in the $200 billion global consumer health industry, with about 4 percent of the market, followed by Bayer AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Merck, however, is relatively small with around 1 percent of the market. Merck has said in the past that it views its consumer business as sub-scale.In considering options for the consumer and animal health businesses, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc, which created shareholder value by seperating non-core assets.Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA  for $11.9 billion in 2012, and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis.Many other drugmakers have been looking to shed businesses, prompted by pricing pressure and increasing competition that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets.A Merck spokeswoman declined to comment on details of the strategic review.

13,"   By Dhanya Skariachan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the world's largest household products maker, cut its sales and earnings outlook for the year on Tuesday to reflect unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Venezuela and the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets.The changed outlook reflects the recent devaluation against the dollar of the Argentine peso, Turkish lira, South African rand, Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Brazilian real and several other currencies, said P&G, whose products include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.For U.S. companies that do substantial business in developing countries, the devaluations cause their earnings in those currencies to be worth less when converted back to dollars. Procter & Gamble said it now sees growth in core earnings per share of 3 percent to 5 percent, down from its prior outlook for growth of 5 to 7 percent. It also revised its forecast for sales growth to a range of flat to a rise of 2 percent versus its prior forecast for growth in a range of 1 to 2 percent.Procter & Gamble shares dipped 0.5 percent to $78.45 in after-market trading on Tuesday, after closing up 1.4 percent at $78.84 in regular trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. dollar is expected to make steady gains against major currencies this year as a recovery in the world's largest economy gains steam and gives the Federal Reserve room to wind down its stimulus program. Plunging emerging market currencies have forced many global companies to hedge foreign currency exposure more aggressively and raise prices frequently.Automaker Ford Motor Co. (F.N), appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) and liquor giant Diageo (DGE.L) all cited weakness and a more sober outlook in once-roaring emerging markets in earnings reports last month.(Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Leslie Adler and Tom Brown)",2014-02-11,PG,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 5:34pm EST",Procter & Gamble cuts outlook on emerging market currency impact,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-procterandgamble-outlook-idUSBREA1A26V20140211?type=companyNews

Procter & Gamble shares lost 1.7 percent to $77.49 and weighed on both the Dow and S&P 500 after the company cut its sales and earnings growth outlooks for the year to reflect unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Venezuela and the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets.The lackluster move in U.S. stocks followed a rally on Tuesday after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to suspend the debt limit until March 2015 and the Federal Reserve's new chief, Janet Yellen, held off from making any changes to the central bank's schedule for trimming stimulus.The debt ceiling deal pressured U.S. bond prices for a second day, though.

24,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON As a slowdown in emerging markets takes the shine off shares in consumer goods makers like Nestle NESN.VX, Unilever (ULVR.L), Danone (DANO.PA) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N), hungry investors have been sampling more of the companies that supply them.Scent and flavor makers such as Symrise (SY1G.DE), Givaudan GIVN.VX and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF.N), and food ingredient names like Glanbia (GL9.I) and Kerry Group (KYGa.I) are attractive, analysts say, because they're more resistant to weak consumer spending and benefit from health and wellness trends forcing so many brands to modify their products.""The companies in those segments have exposure to faster growing specialty areas, serve a wide range of customers (from top brands to white label) and constantly invest in new technology,"" Berenberg analysts said this month. They upgraded Germany's Symrise to ""buy"" and Switzerland's Givaudan to ""hold"".JPMorgan Cazenove estimates the European food ingredients sector on average will see 6 percent earnings growth in 2014, while European food producers will see no growth.Indeed, consumer staples stocks have been battered by currency devaluations and cooling demand in emerging markets and lingering economic malaise in Europe and the United States. Over the past 12 months, the top 25 global consumer staples stocks are still up 7.5 percent on average, but down 3.5 percent in the year to date, according to Reuters data.By contrast, 2014 has favored ingredients. At Thursday's close Kerry was up 3 percent, IFF 5 percent, Symrise 6 percent and Givaudan 9 percent.Still, there are outliers. Lower European sugar prices are squeezing profits at German sugar company Suedzucker (SZUG.DE), while Britain's Tate & Lyle (TATE.L) on Thursday forecast sharply lower prices for its Splenda sweetener due to competition from cheaper Chinese sucralose makers. Both companies' shares are down by double digits.""There are some very, very good businesses in that space, but I don't think you can just bundle them all together, as you can see with Tate & Lyle,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent. ""If you take a stock like Kerry, we've been buyers of that stock for as long as we've been analysts at Exane."" EQUAL OPPORTUNITY SUPPLIER In developed markets, makers of everything from beer to bread to bodywash have lost some ground to generic, white-label products. But for the ingredients makers, those brands are customers. And in less mature markets, the growing customer base is local manufacturers.Kerry Group's deal to supply dairy ingredients to Chinese infant nutrition company Beingmate shows how the sector can benefit from the development of local players who are stepping up their game against multinationals. Companies like Natura Cosmeticos (NATU3.SA) from Brazil and Grupo Bimbo (BIMBOA.MX) from Mexico are just two developing market consumer companies actively expanding into new markets.Analysts at Davy Research who follow the sector say that as local manufacturers get bigger and more savvy, they are turning to internationals for more reliable and high-quality supply. That is especially true in China, where a 2008 scandal involving tainted milk made consumers wary of local brands.China's top milk producer, China Mengniu Dairy (2319.HK), this week agreed to sell more of itself to Danone as it tries to win customers. Denmark's Arla Foods ARLAF.UL, another dairy supplier, also has a stake in Mengniu. <ID:L3N0LH37V>HEALTHY INNOVATION The average consumer goods maker spends about 8 to 10 percent or more of its sales on advertising and marketing and just 2 percent on research and development. Over time, R&D spending has come down as categories mature and companies cut costs, leaving them to outsource technical development to their suppliers. ""I think they have always been marketing companies,"" said JPMorgan analyst John Faucher. ""As the technologies and categories become more complicated, they simply need to cast a broader net.""By contrast, flavor and fragrance companies often spend more than 7 percent of sales on R&D, and have been buying smaller makers of specialized ingredients for which they can charge higher prices and boost margins.""They want your M&M to be the right blue and for the melt characteristics to be exactly right,"" said a banker who has advised on deals in the sector. ""They're not trying to sell flour to bakers.""Last year, Tate & Lyle bought a maker of oat beta glucan, and in January IFF bought a maker of complex specialty ingredients, while Symrise is trying to take over Sweden's Probi (PROB.ST), which makes probiotic ingredients for yoghurt. Israel's Frutarom Industries (FRUT.TA) has bought 12 companies since 2011.A technical arsenal is handy as brands yield to more pressure to make their goods healthier or more natural. This month alone, Kraft Foods KRFT.O removed an artificial preservative from its Singles cheese, and U.S. Subway restaurants removed a chemical from its bread found in rubber yoga mats. A U.S. Senator has since called on regulators to ban the chemical.In that light, Tom Pirko of Bevmark Consulting said ingredients companies that are entrepreneurial and creative write their own tickets.""Those who foresee the future, are generally big winners.""(Editing by Will Waterman)",2014-02-14,PG,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 7:42am EST",No appetite for big consumer goods?

25,"   By Nadia Damouni, Olivia Oran and Phil Wahba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is considering current and former executives of the world's largest household products maker as it begins the search for candidates to succeed Chairman and Chief Executive A.G. Lafley, according to sources familiar with the situation.P&G veterans being considered as part of the succession planning process include Fabrizio Freda, who spent two decades at the company before becoming CEO of Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N); and Susan Arnold, former president of global business units who is now an operating partner at private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O).Lafley is also closely watching the performance of some of his other direct reports for their potential to succeed him, the sources said.These executives include Melanie Healey, group president of North America; David Taylor, group president of global home care; and Deborah Henretta, group president of global beauty care; Martin Riant, the group president of global baby care; and Giovanni Ciserani, the group president of global fabric care.P&G declined on Thursday to comment or to make executives available for interviews.No formal search process is currently under way, and the sources said Lafley could stay on for some time to come.Lafley, 66, was previously P&G's CEO from 2000 to 2009, but came out of retirement after his successor, Bob McDonald, was abruptly replaced last year amid pressure from investors who worried about its growth prospects and lagging share price.Since taking the helm, Lafley has conducted a ""deep dive"" to figure out what needs fixing. He re-organized P&G into four businesses to boost efficiency. Last year, he said the fiscal 2014 year would be a transition year, with fiscal 2013 a ""stepping stone.""In a telephone interview with Reuters last week, Freda declined to say whether he had been approached by the P&G board. But he said, ""I'm very happy at Estee Lauder Cos, and that's what I'm doing and that's what I am focused on and that's what I plan to continue doing."" A representative for Arnold declined to comment.These new details about P&G's succession planning process suggest that the company, whose products including Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Pampers diapers are household names, is leaning toward choosing one of its own to be the nextCEO. The sources said the appeal of hiring a former or current executive is that they would not only understand the complexities of a large multinational company with dozens of products but also understand its culture.Gary Stibel, founder and CEO of New England Consulting Group and a former P&G executive, said the company is unlikely to select a candidate with no ties to it. ""It is totally unnecessary, because they have so much internal talent competing for that job that it will be a challenge to select one,"" Stibel said.P&G has traditionally chosen CEOs and other top executives from within its management ranks. In 2009, Lafley picked McDonald, who was the chief operating officer at the time, to take over the company.McDonald struggled with a pullback in consumer spending in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the recession. In early 2012, he unveiled a $10 billion restructuring program, cutting thousands of jobs and taking other steps to improve operations, launch new products and expand into fast-growing emerging markets.Investors wanted faster improvements. Activist investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management took a $2 billion stake in P&G and began pushing for changes, saying shares were undervalued. (Ackman has since sold at least part of its stake.) P&G shares underperformed those of rivals between the time McDonald was appointed in June 2009 and the announcement of his departure. During that time, P&G rose about 50 percent, while Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), for example, was up 74 percent and Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX index advanced 75 percent.""Bob retired, the board called me and I felt like duty called,"" Lafley said in an interview when he returned in May 2013.Consultants and recruiters said they expect Lafley to remain in the top seat at P&G for at least another 12 to 18 months.""It is still early. These changes don't happen overnight. I think investors have a lot of confidence in him,"" said Jason Tauber, an analyst for Neuberger Berman's large cap disciplined growth team. Neuberger owns about 7 million P&G shares.But as Lafley and the board consider a potential successor, they have to contend with investors increasingly eager to see what moves P&G will make to speed up growth.Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, said shedding some business and making further progress on cost-cutting would help P&G.""Procter is doing just fine - but when you look at their other competitors who have been able to surpass P&G, the reason is they're more nimble and they're more adroit in adapting to shifts in consumer patterns,"" said McCormick.Bahl & Gaynor owned 4.2 million P&G shares as of September, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Ken Wills)",2014-02-14,PG,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 7:37pm EST","Exclusive: P&G eyes alumni, unit heads as candidates for CEO job",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-proctergamble-ceo-idUSBREA1D00S20140214?type=companyNews
26,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO With U.S. stocks doing a stutter-step after a five-year bull run, a shift into low-volatility funds might give you a little more traction if the market retrenches.Low or ""minimum"" volatility funds have become more popular since the 2008 meltdown. Buying mostly defensive stocks with high dividends and modest price variations, they represent an $11 billion market for moderately risk-averse investors.The most popular fund in this category, the PowerShares S&P 500 Low-Volatility ETF, holds more than $3 billion in assets. It owns brand-name stocks like McDonald's Corp and Johnson & Johnson, along with lesser-known companies like Sigma-Aldrich Corp.The fund, which charges 0.25 percent for annual management expenses, was up 14 percent for the year ended February 12.A similar fund is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF, which with slightly more than $2 billion in assets is a runner-up in terms of size in this group. It holds nearly half of its portfolio in consumer defensive, healthcare and financial services stocks like AT&T Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and United Parcel Service Inc.The fund charges slightly less in annual expenses - 0.15 percent - and gained about 16 percent in the year through February 12. But both it and the PowerShares ETF are lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which is up 22 percent for that period.Although it is too early to tell, low-volatility funds might have a distinct advantage if the bull cycle has reached or surpassed its peak.If corporate earnings falter or global economies slow, the market may tilt toward value and dividend-rich stocks. To date, though, the low-volatility advantage has yet to appear. Both the S&P 500 and low-volatility shares are closely tracking each other, down slightly more than 1 percent year to date as of February 12.DIVIDENDS WORTH GRABBING Despite the desire to time the top of a bull market, it is tough to make an exit from growth stocks into high-dividend shares. Market peaks are notoriously difficult to discern.The most pressing question for a long-term investor is whether to tilt more toward value than growth. Until this year, growth stocks have had their run of the roost, but value may dominate if fear stalks the market. It is typical for low-volatility funds to bulk up on boring, dividend-rich sectors like consumer durable, healthcare and utilities.The PowerShares fund, for example, has nearly half of its portfolio in those three groups. Both it and the iShares fund have yields north of 2 percent, which reflect the higher payouts of those kinds of companies.Yet what appears to be a virtue can be a disadvantage, particularly if the bull has room to run and the market will still favor growth stocks.By their very staid nature, low-volatility funds may not outpace the S&P 500, which rose 32 percent last year with dividends reinvested, compared with 25 percent for the iShares fund. Instead of trying to guess where the market is going and reacting week to week, a dividend-growth strategy might prove potent in the long run. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index ETF, which I hold in my 401(k), lagged the S&P 500 by only about 1 percentage point over the past three years.The Vanguard fund, which focuses on companies that consistently raise their dividends, is slightly more diversified than the other low-volatility funds I have mentioned. Its portfolio is more spread out among mega-, large- and medium-size companies with holdings like Abbott Laboratories, Procter & Gamble Co and PepsiCo Inc. It costs only 0.10 percent annually to own and was up 16 percent for the year ended February 12.Companies paying lower but growing dividends may also be bargains, Matt Freund, chief investment officer of USAA Funds in San Antonio, stated in a recent market commentary.""Companies increasing their dividend payments are making a commitment to the market,"" Freund said. ""They are telling investors that their business is strong enough to generate the free cash needed to pay higher dividends in the future.""Whatever path you take, do not confuse low-volatility funds with no volatility. All low-volatility stock funds will still react to market swoons. The Vanguard fund, for example, was down more than 3 percent year to date through February 12, compared with a 1.3 percent decline for the S&P 500.Concentrating too much on defensive stocks will certainly create a drag on performance if growth still dominates, but that may not be a bad thing if you want to focus on total return over the long haul.(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)(Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-02-18,PG,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 7:26am EST",Boring might be better for fund investors in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-column-wasik-volatility-idUSBREA1H0T220140218?type=companyNews

29,"   By Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON Procter & Gamble Co is bringing the dentist into the bathroom with the world's first smartphone-connected toothbrush, a device that gives personalized advice to help people improve their brushing.The toothbrush, to be sold under P&G's Oral-B brand and which will be widely available from June, has a Bluetooth 4.0 link to a smartphone app that can be programmed with the help of a dentist, for example to pay more attention to any areas of the mouth being neglected, P&G said.""The app provides real-time guidance,"" Michael Cohen-Dumani, global associate director for Oral-B, told Reuters.""Dentists always tell us: 'People do a great job in the week before they come to visit us and in the week after they visit us. But nothing can hide the fact that when we look inside the mouth we can see all the areas they miss'."" The toothbrush will be unveiled at the phone industry's annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, joining an expanding range of devices connected to smartphones that measure everything from sleep patterns and calorie intake to distance walked and exercise taken.Professionals had helped develop the app as a tool to manage their patients' behavior between visits, Cohen-Dumani said. The app displays brushing progress in real time, telling the user when to move to a different part of the mouth and warning if they are brushing too hard, he said. ""It will guide you in terms of how to brush, and you will be able to fully personalize the brushing routine for you,"" Cohen-Dumani said.In tests, the app had extended average brushing times from less than a minute for a manual toothbrush to 2 minutes and 16 seconds, he said. The device will be at top end the Oral-B electric toothbrush range, with a recommended retail price of 199 pounds ($330) in Britain and 219 euros in Europe.French startup Kolibree has also developed a connected electric toothbrush that it plans to launch in the third quarter, according to its website.(Editing by David Holmes)",2014-02-20,PG,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 5:42am EST",P&G's smart toothbrush keeps tabs on tooth care,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mobile-world-toothbrush-idUSBREA1J0ON20140220?type=companyNews

31,"  * Ukraine conflict continues; Russia seizes marine base* Nasdaq hit as Internet, biotech names tumble* Procter & Gamble rallies and helps limit the Dow's loss* Dow off 0.2 pct; S&P 500 down 0.5 pct; Nasdaq off 1.2 pct   (Updates to close)By Angela MoonNEW YORK, March 24 U.S. stocks fell on Monday, with some of the market's recent best performers like technology and biotech shares leading the way down.Concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate gave investors a reason to drop some of the market's biggest trading favorites. The Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average earlier, in a sign of weakening near-term momentum.Netflix Inc tumbled 6.7 percent to close at $378.90, with fellow Internet names Facebook Inc down 4.7 percent at $64.10 and TripAdvisor Inc down 3.9 percent at $97.58.

Over those four sessions, the biotech index slid 9 percent.

And just earlier on Wednesday, privately held Mars announced a $2.9 billion deal to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's pet food business, which includes brands like Iams and Eukanuba. Founded in 2006, Freshpet makes fresh, refrigerated food for dogs and cats as an alternative to dry or canned food. Freshpet's products, available at stores including Target Corp  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, do not have preservatives, fillers, corn or wheat.Private equity firm MidOcean Partners made what it referred to as a ""significant investment"" in Freshpet in 2011, joining Tyson Foods Inc, which had been a strategic partner of Freshpet since 2009.

Freshpet and Tyson Foods did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Freshpet's sales are expected to top $100 million this year from just $500,000 in 2006, CEO Richard Thompson was cited as saying in an interview with a local newspaper last month.

39,"  April 18 Procter & Gamble Co is planning to offer a new kind of razor, with a swiveling ball hinge and a pricey tag, to move forward with its strategy to push premium products, according to the Wall Street Journal on Friday .The world's largest household products maker has seen sales of its Gillette razors suffer a hit in the fourth quarter of 2013 from the growing trend of sporting moustaches and stubble.The company's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller had in January blamed a movement by the Movember Foundation for weak razor sales. The non-profit organisation calls for men to grow moustaches during the month of November to raise awareness of men's health issues, such as prostate cancer. P&G's Gillette planned to start shipping the new razor, called ProGlide FlexBall, on June 9, the WSJ said, quoting marketing documents. The razor's ball hinge allows the blade to pivot and can lead to missing about 20 percent less hair with each glide. P&G will offer manual and battery-powered versions of the FlexBall for suggested prices of $11.49 and $12.59 with one ProGlide cartridge, the report said.The company has a $188 million sales target for FlexBall for the first year.

46,"   By Sophie Sassard and Soyoung Kim | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK German drugmaker Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) is nearing an agreement to buy Merck & Co Inc's (MRK.N) consumer healthcare unit, people familiar with the matter said, in a deal that could value the business at around $14 billion.Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L), one of the final contenders in the auction, said on Wednesday it was no longer in active talks to buy the Merck business, leaving Bayer in the pole position to win the asset, which is best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine. Bayer and Merck are hammering out final terms of an agreement and could announce the transaction in the next several days, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Bayer and Merck declined to comment.Reuters first reported last week that Bayer and Reckitt had emerged as forerunners in the auction with each offering roughly $13.5 billion, a price that could come close to $14 billion when the deal is finalized.. Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Bayer entered exclusive talks with Merck. Bayer has also edged out other rival bidders in the auction, including Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis AG NOVN.VX and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), people familiar with the matter said.(Reporting by Sophie Sassard in London and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2014-05-01,PG,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 3:26pm EDT",Bayer nears deal to buy Merck consumer unit: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-consumer-idUSBREA400SO20140501?type=companyNews
47,"  * Second acquisition for Henkel this week* Henkel says more deals possible* Both deals expand position in existing categories, markets   (Adds details on BC Partners, background, context, byline)By Victoria Bryan and Martinne GellerFRANKFURT/LONDON, June 5 Henkel & Co  plans to buy French household cleaner maker Spotless, for 940 million euros ($1.28 billion) cash, its second purchase in a week as the German consumer goods company builds its presence in large, profitable, mature markets.Henkel is buying Spotless from London-based private equity firm BC Partners, adding Eau Ecarlate and Dylon laundry products to a portfolio that already includes Persil detergent, Loctite adhesives and Schwarzkopf hair products.Spotless will give it leading positions in established markets like France, Italy and Britain where home and personal care products enjoy relatively fat profit margins, Henkel said. The global consumer goods sector is seeing a spate of deals as tough economic conditions are leading small and mid-sized firms to seek entry into new markets or greater scale in existing, mature markets.Henkel's latest acquisition follows a 270 million euros ($367.78 million) deal on Monday, to buy three U.S. hair care brands. Both purchases are being funded by a 4 billion euro ($5.45 billion) war chest the company has been building over several quarters for acquisitions.Henkel had been shopping for takeover targets for well over a year as a way to stay competitive in a consolidating consumer goods market increasingly fuelled by emerging markets. By 2016 it aims to have 20 billion euros in sales, up from 16.4 billion in 2013, with half of that coming from emerging markets.The price paid for Spotless, which includes debt, represents a multiple of 3.4 times sales and 12.1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That is higher than the 10 times sales and 1.7 times EBITDA Unilever  paid in 2010 for laundry and personal care brands from Sara Lee. Henkel itself trades for about 13.5 times EBITDA and has a market value of about $47 billion. ""The acquisition seems to be rather expensive, but high valuation is justified, due to low volatility business profile and the emerging opportunity to increase market share in the highly competitive Western European laundry market,"" wrote Equinet Bank analysts in a research note.According to Euromonitor International, the deal would slightly lift Henkel's share of the $82 billion global laundry care market to 8.7 percent, still well behind Procter & Gamble's  26.6 percent and Unilever's 14.8 percent. Unilever sells Persil detergent in some markets.Consumer giants like Unilever, Nestle and Procter & Gamble are also taking advantage of high valuations to prune their portfolios and sharpen their focus on their most profitable businesses. Recent weeks have seen a bidding war for U.S. sausage maker Hillshire Brands, Japan's Mizkan Group buying Unilever's Ragu pasta sauce, Mars Inc buying P&G's pet food unit, L'Oreal  buying Chinese beauty mask maker Magic Holdings, and Emperador from the Philippines buying the Whyte & Mackay Scotch whisky business from United Spirits, controlled by Diageo.Despite Henkel's deals this week, there could still be more, said a spokesman for the company, which pre-empted an auction for Spotless with an offer, according to a source close to the deal.BC Partners made a return of 2 times its original investment, according to the source. BC bought Spotless from Ardian, formerly Axa Private Equity, in 2010 for 640 million euros including debt. It has not taken any dividends from its investment, said the source.The deal is subject to approval by antitrust authorities and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015. Henkel said it would add to earnings immediately.Henkel's shares were up 0.5 percent at 85.69 euros at 0937 GMT, valuing the company at about $47 billion.BC Partners was advised by JP Morgan and Rothschild on the transaction.

48,"   By Steve Holland | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON President Barack Obama has chosen former Procter & Gamble Chief Executive Bob McDonald, an Army veteran, as his nominee to be the next secretary of veterans affairs, a senior Obama administration official said on Sunday.Obama's announcement of McDonald, 61, will be made this week, possibly on Monday. If confirmed by the Senate, McDonald would be tasked with repairing the Veterans Administration after widespread evidence of delays in military veterans getting healthcare at VA facilities.The announcement is to come days after a White House review found significant and chronic failures across the board at the Veterans Administration and evidence that a ""corrosive culture"" prevails.A senior administration official said Obama was attracted to McDonald by his corporate background and military service. He would succeed Eric Shinseki, who resigned late in May after the depth of the VA's problems became clear.McDonald is the former chairman, president and CEO of Procter & Gamble, having retired a year ago after 33 years with the Fortune 500 company, where he started as a brand assistant in 1980 and rose through the ranks.He served on the McKinsey Advisory Council, the Singapore International Advisory Council of the Economic Development Board, and on the boards of U.S. Steel and Xerox Corp.Officials believe his lengthy tenure at P&G prepares him well for a huge agency with management challenges in providing services to more 8 million veterans a year. At P&G, he oversaw more than 120,000 employees, with operations around the world, selling products in more than 180 countries. MILITARY BACKGROUND U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called McDonald ""a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector. With those traits, he's the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA.""But Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, added: ""The next VA secretary can only succeed in implementing that type of change if his boss, the president, first commits to doing whatever it takes to give our veterans the world class health care system they deserve by articulating a vision for sweeping reform. Our nation's veterans deserve nothing less.""After graduating in the top 2 percent of his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, McDonald served in the U.S. Army as a captain, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division, and received the Meritorious Service Medal.    ""Bob is an immensely gifted and caring individual.  That was evident to me when we first met as cadets at West Point, over 40 years ago,"" retired Major General James ""Spider"" Marks said in a statement. ""He came from a military family, and knows the challenges from living them.""Corporate colleagues of McDonald repeatedly cited his management abilities in grappling with large and complex organizations.    American Express Chief Executive Ken Chenault, who served on the P&G board during McDonald's time there, called McDonald a strong manager who knows how to make large organizations work effectively.""He's an excellent choice to set the right course for the Veterans Administration at a difficult time,"" Chenault said in a statement. The White House review, which was conducted by senior Obama aide Rob Nabors, said the agency's 14-day scheduling standard for new patients to receive care was arbitrary, ill-defined and misunderstood.Obama accepted the findings on Friday by Nabors and acting Veterans Secretary Sloan Gibson, who said: ""We can and must solve these problems as we work to earn back the trust of veterans.""

50,"  (Corrects fourth paragraph to read ""portfolio acquired from Merck"", not ""portfolio acquired by Merck"")* Coppertone, Dr. Scholl's draw interest after $14 bln deal* Bayer says to hold on to non-drug consumer brandsBy Ludwig Burger and Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT, July 1 German drugmaker Bayer said it would keep the Dr. Scholl's and Coppertone brands it bagged as part of a $14 billion buy from U.S. Merck, despite overtures from companies keen to grab them, widening its healthcare line to include consumer goods.Just weeks after clinching the deal to buy Merck 's non-prescription drugs business, Bayer - best known as a life sciences company which makes cancer drugs - is being courted by rivals keen to acquire the foot care and sunscreen brands, several people with knowledge of the approaches told Reuters.But when asked about the expressions of interest for Dr. Scholl's and Coppertone - each worth more than $1 billion - Bayer said it was not planning to untie the Merck bundle it secured in May in a competitive bidding tussle with Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble Co and Novartis .""We intend to keep the portfolio acquired from Merck & Co. as a core business,"" Bayer said in a written statement.The German company, which makes contraceptives as well as prescription drugs against cancer, heart disease and multiple sclerosis, said when it bought the Merck business that its aim was to become global leader in over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. The deal was the largest in the German healthcare sector since Bayer bought rival Schering for 17 billion euros ($24 billion) in 2006.But with Bayer's existing OTC medicines business listing products like aspirin and Canesten antifungal creams, some are questioning the logic of it wanting to keep everyday products like sunscreen.""They aren't really part of the core business and don't have much to do with medicines in the strict sense,"" said Warburg Research analyst Ulrich Huwald.Offloading Dr. Scholl's foot care and Coppertone, which account for 27 percent of the Merck bundle's combined annual sales, would allow Bayer to focus on Merck's core healthcare products such as allergy remedy Claritin and MiraLAX laxative, analysts say, and give it the resources to make the most of those brands. Repeated comments by chief executive Marijn Dekkers in the past that Bayer - the inventor of aspirin - is mainly about life sciences and molecular research, seem to have given hope to consumer goods companies that he might yet have wanted to part with brands that have little to do with healthcare.Reckitt Benckiser, which owns the Scholl foot care brand outside the United States, as well as Beiersdorf and L'Oreal were seen as potential acquirers. Officials at the three companies declined to comment.GOING FOR SHELF SPACE?  There are however sound reasons for Bayer to retain Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's despite the products being so different to much of its other business: Big U.S. drug store chains such as Walgreen Co and CVS Caremark  prefer dealing with suppliers that can fill large amounts of shelf space and the two big consumer brands would add to Bayer's bargaining power.Bayer has also said that the Merck deal, which is expected to close in the second half of the year, should allow it to make better use of its distribution network and sales force and give it more clout when dealing with retailers.There may however be another reason Bayer is reluctant to sell. Having bought Merck's unit for more than twice the core earnings multiple at which Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest consumer care company, is trading, any spin-off sales might reveal it to have overpaid.One source said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's, with $275 million and $309 million in 2013 sales, respectively, could be worth as much as $4 billion between them, reflecting the sales multiple of about 6.5 that Bayer paid for the entire Merck consumer bundle.But another person said that Dr. Scholl's was more likely to fetch $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and Coppertone about $1 billion, because personal care products change hands for lower multiples than the medicines included in last month's deal.Selling on some consumer brands for a lower earnings multiple than what was agreed for the entire Merck portfolio would exposed the high price paid for the remaining OTC drugs - and might not go down well with Bayer investors.""Shareholders would start to do the maths,"" the source said.

McDonald, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served as an Army captain in the late 1970s before working his way through the Procter & Gamble ranks.

52,"  (Adds comment from veterans committee chairman, details on reform bill)WASHINGTON, July 29 The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously confirmed Bob McDonald as the next Veterans Affairs secretary, pinning Washington's hopes on the former Procter & Gamble Co chief executive to launch a massive turnaround effort at the troubled agency.McDonald, 61, replaces retired Army general Eric Shinseki, who resigned in late May amid a scandal over cover-ups of long waiting times for health-care appointments at VA hospitals and clinics across the country.The 97-0 vote to confirm McDonald comes a week after he pledged to bring corporate-style discipline and accountability to the agency, refocusing its 341,000 employees on serving veterans. ""In the wake of the biggest scandal in the history of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald certainly has his work cut out for him,"" House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said after the Senate vote.""In order to be successful, McDonald will need to take swift and decisive action to discipline employees responsible for mismanagement, negligence and corruption that harms veterans while taking bold steps to replace the department's culture of complacency with a climate of accountability,"" Miller added. McDonald, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point who served as P&G CEO from 2009 to 2013, is widely expected to start his new job with an extra $17 billion at his disposal to reduce months-long health care wait times in new legislation slated for passage by Congress this week. The compromise measure reached by the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives Veterans Affairs committees on Monday would allow veterans forced to wait more than 30 days for an appointment to seek care from private doctors at VA expense. It would provide $5 billion for the VA to hire more doctors and nurses and open 27 new clinics across the country.The measure also would give McDonald sweeping new authorities to fire or demote VA employees for poor performance, subject to a 21-day appeal process. To date, no one has been dismissed at VA over the misrepresentation of wait-time data.McDonald retired last year at P&G, best known as the maker of Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste, amid a major corporate restructuring as some institutional investors had pushed for faster improvements in profits and better stock performance.

The S&P 500 was on track to post its biggest weekly loss since April.Government data showed U.S. job growth slowed in July and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose.That relieved some investors who were worried about how soon the Fed could bump up interest rates after data on Thursday showed U.S. labor costs recorded their biggest gain in more than 5 1/2 years in the second quarter. Concern remained over Argentina's debt problems. A U.S. judge on Friday criticized Argentina's decision to default earlier this week, and ordered negotiations between the country and holdout investors to continue.""Anytime a country defaults on its debt, it's usually an unnerving event in the market,"" said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland.

Twenty-three of the brands have sales of between $1 billion and $10 billion.""Less will be much more,"" Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said. P&G did not name the brands it planned to sell, keep or discontinue, but Lafley told Reuters the company's family, feminine and baby care business would lose fewer brands than its other four businesses.The business, which houses brands such as Pampers diapers and Always sanitary napkins, is P&G's fastest-growing and was the company's second-biggest revenue contributor in the year ended June 30.P&G's top 80 brands had sales of about $84.1 billion in 2013 while the other roughly 100 brands had sales of just $2.4 billion, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj.Dibadj expects the company to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products among others. P&G is unlikely to sell its Gillette, Tide, Pantene, Oral B, Olay and Old Spice brands, he said. P&G said it would have fewer but larger distribution centers in North America and would focus on strengthening its presence in emerging markets, or what Lafley called the company's ""engines of growth"".Lafley told Reuters he expects the moves to result in fewer job cuts than the near 10,000 the company cut in 2002.SLUGGISH SALES  P&G's revenue growth has been sluggish, with sales missing Wall Street's estimates in nine of the last 13 quarters.The company says it has been hurt by ""choppy"" growth in developed markets, tough competition and a strengthening U.S. dollar.P&G has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management, reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five-year, $10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012.P&G's organic sales, which excludes divestitures and acquisitions, rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, but currency losses wiped out the gains. Net sales fell 1 percent to $20.16 billion, missing the average analyst estimate.P&G said it expected fiscal 2015 organic sales to rise by a low- to mid-single digit percentage and core earnings to rise by a mid-single digit.A 7 percent fall in operating expenses in the quarter helped P&G post a core profit of 95 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 91 cents.""PG's earnings quality is below its potential,"" BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note.P&G's shares were up 3.5 percent at $80.03 in early afternoon trading on Friday.

Fears of a rate hike sparked Thursday's decline, which wiped out the Dow's entire gains so far this year.""We have conflicting reports about when the Fed might or might not move, and on top of that we still have a lot of geopolitical issues that the market has to deal with,"" said Nick Sargen, chief economist at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati.

Data showed 209,000 jobs were created in July, below the 233,000 that was expected. Analysts had speculated that a stronger-than-expected report would give the Fed flexibility to hike rates. Such a move would raise borrowing costs for individuals and companies and crimp spending, which could impact economic growth.The jobs report ""won't force the Fed to raise rates any time soon, and given all the fear that was out there yesterday, it makes sense to me that futures would come back so strongly,"" said Mark Grant, managing director at Southwest Securities in Fort Lauderdale.Other data pointed to improving economic conditions, including the Institute for Supply Management's read on manufacturing, which expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years in July.

Energy shares, a cyclical group that is tied to the pace of economic growth, were the weakest, off 0.6 percent. Thursday's decline was the biggest one-day drop for the S&P since April, and it turned the Dow negative for the year. Despite Friday's rebound, the S&P remained under its 50-day moving average, a sign of weak near-term trends.For the week, the Dow is down 2.6 percent, the S&P is down 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq is down 2 percent.

These brands up for review are estimated to have roughly $900 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) combined, the people said.Duracell, the world's No.1 battery business, alone accounts for the majority of the value with estimated EBITDA of around $500 million, according to one person. Braun is the next largest brand likely to be shed, with less than $100 million in EBITDA, that person added. Several private equity firms have already started exploring potential deals involving various P&G brands, according to the people familiar with the matter.Representatives for P&G could not be immediately reached for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. P&G did not name any of the brands it planned to sell but Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said the company would narrow its focus to 70 to 80 of its biggest brands, which include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent. These top brands generate 90 percent of its $83 billion in annual sales and over 95 percent of its profit.The sweeping move is a major strategy shift for the consumer products giant, whose revenue growth has been sluggish, with sales missing Wall Street's estimates in nine of the last 13 quarters.It also reflects a wider trend among conglomerates across various industry sectors to streamline their business lines, by shedding non-core operations and allocating resources to high growth areas. Large consumer companies like Nestle SA NESN.VX and Unilever Plc (UNc.AS) have shed underperforming businesses in the last year to focus on their top brands. Healthcare giants including Merck & Co (MRK.N), Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) have also moved to shed their declining mature drug businesses in recent months. P&G says it has been hurt by ""choppy"" growth in developed markets, tough competition and a strengthening U.S. dollar. The company has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management, reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five-year, $10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012.

67,"   By Eric Kelsey and Jennifer Saba | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK When NFL players strap on their pink shoes and gloves in October for the league's annual Breast Cancer Awareness Month campaign, it will be doing so with one less sponsor, a notable retreat blamed on the league's handling of domestic violence.Crest, Procter & Gamble Co's dental brand, will no longer be offering pink mouth guards to NFL players, the company said on Friday, the first sponsor to publicly withdraw from the NFL's signature overture to women.""The brand has decided to cancel on-field activation with NFL teams,"" Procter & Gamble said in a statement.The company added it will honor its planned $100,000 donation to the American Cancer Society, the NFL's long-time partner in the October campaign.Procter & Gamble's retreat from the NFL's game plan to woo women illustrates the risk America's most popular sports league faces with its female fans while it seeks to correct its acknowledged poor handling of domestic violence cases.""From a family perspective it makes it really hard to support it (the NFL) even though lots of people love it,"" said Kelley Skoloda, a women's marketing expert at Ketchum Inc. The NFL draws 6 million women to games every week and women account for about 45 percent of the league's audience. Women represent a key growth area for the league which has nearly maxed out its audience among U.S. men.On Friday, a chastened NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sought to take control of the public outcry, vowing that the league would change its personal conduct policy and he would cede some power in the process. Domestic violence mushroomed into an issue for the league when Goodell suspended former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice two games for knocking out his then-fiancee Janay Palmer, a punishment considered by many as too lenient. Goodell later bowed to public pressure and reversed course, suspending Rice indefinitely when website TMZ published a video of the punch on Sept. 8.Sponsors sought to distance themselves from the NFL this week with consumer brands McDonald's Corp, Campbell's Soup Co and Anheuser-Busch InBev saying they had expressed their concerns to the league. ""I believe that women became open to becoming serious NFL fans because they were not aware to Roger Goodell's and owners' response to domestic violence,"" said Terry O'Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, which has called for Goodell to resign.     For its part, the NFL has donated some $6 million to the American Cancer Society for education and screening grants.Skoloda, a marketing expert, says for the NFL's female fans and the sponsors who want to court them, it is a defining moment for the league.Women, who tend to judge their personal success on the well-being of their children according to Skoloda, are also grappling with the long-term health effects of football, including brain trauma.""They're playing with things that are at the very top of the list of how moms and women define their personal success,"" said Skoloda.

73,"   By Alexandra Alper | MEXICO CITY  MEXICO CITY The world's largest household product maker Procter & Gamble and No. 2 toymaker Hasbro are at the heart of a Mexican probe into tax avoidance that could cost the firms hundreds of millions of dollars in back-taxes between them, sources told Reuters. In January, Mexico said it had launched a probe of 270 companies for allegedly exploiting tax loopholes that have leaked income out of Mexico for years. At first, seven multinationals were the focus of the government's ""informal audit,"" led by Oscar Molina, who audits big companies at Mexico's tax collection agency SAT.But Molina says he is in advanced discussions with two companies to pay more income tax for prior years. He didn't name them but said one of the two has been involved in litigation since 2005 over the extent of its taxable presence in Mexico. The other, he said, has been less aggressive and had made gradual changes to its tax scheme. Five sources have told Reuters the firms are Hasbro and P&G.In its 2014 second quarter report released in July, Hasbro said it is defending itself against outstanding tax assessments by Mexican authorities totaling about $250 million for the 2000 to 2007 period related to how it accounts for cross-border transactions, known as transfer pricing issues.""The company is party to discussions with the Mexican tax authorities to determine if the two parties can reach an agreed settlement of these issues,"" Hasbro said in the filing. It said it has made a settlement offer to authorities without specifying the amount.SAT says the probe, which still includes a handful of firms, involves examining corporate structures that ensure profits based on Mexican manufacturing activities or sales to Mexican customers are reported in offshore units, beyond the reach of the Mexican tax authority. Molina is arguing that these offshore units which derive profits from economic activity in Mexico, had a de facto taxable residence or permanent establishment in Mexico and so, he can tax their Mexico-related profit. Tax authorities in Spain, France and Norway have previously gone to court to argue a multinational using such profit shifting structures, had a deemed permanent establishment in their countries. However, those efforts largely failed, which is partly why countries are now pressing for changes in international tax rules which would bring profits shifted offshore by convoluted arrangements back within reach of tax authorities.Mexico levies 30 percent income tax on firms, above OECD countries' average of 25 percent. ""We are working under the understanding that there is permanent establishment,"" Molina said in a June interview about the probe. ""They send away part of the income. And we say: No, no, no. Your income is bigger than that. And it is because of your permanent establishment.""P&G and Hasbro declined to comment on whether they are being probed. Neither company revealed their tax obligations in Mexico.Hasbro spokeswoman Julie Duffy said that the global toymaker is often involved in tax audits around the world. P&G spokeswoman Jennifer Corso said in an email that the company pays all taxes owed in more than 150 tax jurisdictions and does not pursue aggressive tax planning.     Ohio-based P&G, the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent, employs about 7,000 people at eight plants, two distribution centers and an office in Mexico, the company said.RULES REVIEW An undated confidential document that a source said P&G submitted to the Mexican government last year described the company's operations in Mexico. It was reviewed by Reuters and shows about $1 billion in revenue and some $3 billion in exports from P&G Mexico in 2012. Neither Hasbro nor P&G have said how much income tax they pay annually in Mexico. SAT would not say how much it believed the two companies it is in advanced talks with should pay.  Hasbro, known for its My Little Pony toys and Transformers action figures, generates nearly $200 million in Mexican sales annually, according to a confidential document, also undated and about its operations in Mexico, that the source said the firm presented to the government in 2013.The toymaker has offices in Mexico City, a distribution center and sales personnel in five cities, the document said. The Rhode Island based-firm, which trails only Mattel in the world toy market according to Euromonitor, says it has 245 employees in Mexico. Mexico's actions reflect growing frustration among some large developing countries, including China and India, with legal loopholes in international tax rules that companies can exploit to shift profits to tax havens. Mexico's SAT argues that by doing so, some companies are avoiding their tax dues. In 2012, the group of 20 leading economies stepped up efforts to crack down on corporate tax dodging, after reports of firms like Apple and Google using complex structures to slash their tax bills sparked outrage. The G20 asked the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) to review the rules on how multinationals are taxed, emboldening Mexico to pursue its own tax avoidance probe. Mexico, a haven for auto manufacturers and light assembly plants, has the lowest tax take in the OECD, crimping its ability to spend on programs vital to boosting economic growth and living standards. The main factor in determining whether a company has a taxable presence or a ""permanent establishment"" in a country is the extent of its sales operations there.    But loopholes allow companies to avoid hefty levies in high-tax countries where they generate big sales revenue, for example, by signing sales contracts abroad.Molina said he could complete formal audits of the firms he is in advanced talks with quickly and go to court if they don't reach a deal.

75,"   By Anna Ringstrom | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Sweden's SCA, the world's biggest maker of incontinence pads, is accelerating product upgrades and boosting promotions to counter the re-entry of U.S. personal care giant Procter & Gambler into the market, its CEO told Reuters.However, Jan Johansson brushed off some analysts' advice that he should respond with a change in strategy, such as extending one of SCA's feminine care brands into incontinence. ""We’ve known about this for quite some time, longer than the market. Our concern was that they’d come out with an entirely new product range that we don’t have,"" he said in an interview.  ""But there was no innovation that we didn't know about.""SCA accounts for about a quarter of the global market for adult diapers, with its top-selling Tena brand making more than 10 billion crowns ($1.4 billion) of sales a year, out of a group total of 89 billion crowns last year.  The firm's shares have fallen around 16 percent since P&G hinted in June -- and then confirmed in August -- that it would return to the incontinence care market after a 15 year absence. P&G has begun rolling out in Europe, where SCA has the bulk of business, and the United States.            Handelsbanken analyst Karri Rinta, who has an accumulate rating on SCA's shares, has warned SCA could lose 30 percent of its operating profit from incontinence products in 2016 due to P&G's extension of its well-established feminine care brand Always into the market.  However, Johansson said analysts were underestimating the strength of the Tena brand and that SCA would be able to defend its position with product upgrades and innovations. He said it had brought forward upgrades, such as a higher-and-faster absorption pad for people who suffer incontinence during a sudden sneeze. It has also reallocated resources from advertising toward promotions in order to match P&G's offers. Aging populations and the fact incontinence is also widespread among younger adults, most of which don't use incontinence pads, means it is a market with huge potential, Johansson added. SCA estimates that less than 40 percent of sufferers in Europe use incontinence pads or pants, with fewer than 5 percent of incontinent men using the products.  SCA, which started out as a forestry company in 1929 and makes the largest share of its revenues from tissues, sells most of its incontinence products directly to the healthcare industry, with less than 30 percent of revenues from retailers. P&G, which made net sales of $83 billion in its latest financial year, is focusing on the retail market for now. Johansson dismissed the idea of investing heavily in one of SCA's feminine care brands and, once it was bigger, extending it into incontinence products for the retail market.   ""Tena is much stronger (than SCA's feminine care brands) so it would be daft to change brand,"" he said.    Johansson also said he had no plans to shift focus more to emerging markets at the expense of Europe.""Europe, too, is a fantastic growth market as long as we find a good way to increase penetration. (P&G's entry) means more competition, but also helps drive penetration,"" he said.Independently of P&G's return, SCA is investing online, where it sees a big potential market due to the embarrassment felt by some incontinence sufferers when buying products in store. The firm has its own online stores in several markets.

78,"  (Repeats with no change to text)By Valentina ZaMILAN Oct 22 Luxottica, the world's largest eyewear group, named a senior Procter & Gamble  manager as its new co-chief executive on Wednesday, seeking to solve a governance crisis after losing two chief executives in the span of six weeks.The maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses said its chairman would propose at a board meeting on Oct. 29 that Adil Mehboob-Khan be appointed as co-CEO in charge of markets from January and in the interim joins the board as a non-executive director.The move follows last week's abrupt departure of the last CEO, Enrico Cavatorta, who only six weeks earlier had taken over from long-time boss Andrea Guerra.Both executives have clashed with Luxottica's chairman and majority owner Leonardo Del Vecchio, 79, who has temporarily taken on management of the group. Del Vecchio now plans to hand all executive responsibilities to Chief Operating Officer Massimo Vian, who will become co-CEO in charge of operations and products once Mehboob-Khan joins, the company said.The chairman had already intended to put Vian in charge until the second co-CEO was found but had to shelve that plan only a day after unveiling it following a board clash.Del Vecchio said on Wednesday the naming of Vian as co-CEO guaranteed ""continuity with the existing strategy."" ""At the same time, Adil's appointment as  Co-CEO for Markets will bring fresh energy,"" he added in a statement.Mehboob-Khan is set to leave Procter & Gamble on Jan. 1 after 27 years, the U.S. company said in a separate statement.

Guerra, widely considered one of Italy's best top managers, presided over a doubling of group sales to 7.3 billion euros.The subsequent departure of Cavatorta, Luxottica's trusted chief financial officer since 1999, has further stoked investors' concerns and hastened Luxottica's search for a new co-CEO after the group had previously said it would take time.Luxottica, 61 percent owned by Del Vecchio, is due to publish third-quarter results on Oct. 29 and it has forecast a net profit rise of around 10 percent as a stronger dollar boosts U.S. sales.""We believe though that all eyes will be on corporate governance as the investor community will be seeking answers on the recent management changes and on the reasons behind Cavatorta's unexpected decision to leave,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note earlier this week.(1 US dollar = 0.7901 euros)   (Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London; Editing by Silvia Aloisi and Greg Mahlich)",2014-10-22,PG,"Wed Oct 22, 2014 | 2:31pm EDT",RPT-UPDATE 1-Luxottica names P&G executive as proposed new co-CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/luxottica-group-ceo-idUSL6N0SH5RE20141022?type=companyNews

83,"  * Microsoft, Procter & Gamble results lift U.S. shares     * Ebola scare diminishes, boosting U.S. shares     * U.S. Treasuries prices stable on reduced Ebola concerns     * Euro rises ahead of European bank stress test results   (Adds close of U.S. markets)     By Sam Forgione     NEW YORK, Oct 24 Global equity markets rose on Friday after strong corporate results from Microsoft and Procter & Gamble and reduced concerns over the possible spread of Ebola boosted U.S. shares and kept safe-haven U.S. Treasuries prices stable.      MSCI's all-country world equity index rose 3.1 percent for the week, marking its biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 was up 5.5 percent from its low on Oct. 15 and notched its best weekly gain in almost two years. Solid U.S. corporate results bolstered shares over the week.      News late on Thursday of the first person to test positive for Ebola in New York City weighed on European shares, and while the scare initially held back buying in the United States, U.S. investors later shook off those concerns.      ""Ebola is something you want to keep an eye on, but the probability of widespread infection is pretty small, and I think that's what the market believes,"" said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.     ""Stocks were oversold. Investors were over-worried about global growth, they were over-worried about Ebola,"" he added on reasons for the stock market rally over the week.      Corporate earnings were mixed. Microsoft and Procter & Gamble rose following their quarterly results, offsetting a plunge in Amazon after the online retailer reported an earnings miss. Microsoft shares closed up 2.5 percent at $46.13, while Amazon shares closed down 8.3 percent at $287.06.     The euro rose against the dollar on the view that a weekend update on the euro zone banking sector's financial health would not reveal too many problems at the region's top banks. As of the end of 2013, 25 banks failed the European stress tests, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.        MSCI's all-country world equity index was last up 0.45 percent, to 409.23. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of top European shares closed down 0.34 percent at 1,312.74.     The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.76 percent at 16,805.41, while the S&P 500 closed up 0.71 percent at 1,964.58. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.69 percent at 4,483.72.     The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.14 percent to 85.721. U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were last up 3/32 in price to yield 2.2658 percent.      Brent oil prices fell but were little changed on the week, while U.S. crude oil futures continued to slide. Brent crude  settled at $86.13 per barrel, down 70 cents for the day, while U.S. crude settled down $1.08 at $81.01 per barrel.

News of the first case of Ebola diagnosed in New York City hit futures late on Thursday, but the markets shook off those concerns on Friday. A doctor being treated for Ebola in a New York City hospital is in stable condition, the city's health commissioner said, while the World Health Organization set out plans for speeding up development and deployment of experimental Ebola vaccines.""I am encouraged by the fact that the market seems to be having a cooler head about the most recent Ebola news,"" said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers. ""It feels like a market that's trying to consolidate some very sharp moves.""Shares of Microsoft rose 2.5 percent to $46.13, after the company reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue while keeping profit margins largely intact. Fellow Dow component Procter & Gamble gained 2.3 percent to $85.16.

86,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Nandita Bose  Procter & Gamble Co on Friday said it would sell its Duracell battery business, probably through a split-off into a separate company, as it looks to focus on faster-growing brands.P&G shares rose about 3 percent as investors shrugged off a marginal fall in quarterly sales and warning that a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings this quarter. A surging U.S. currency, reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars. P&G and Colgate-Palmolive Co, which on Friday reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings forecast, are the latest companies to be hurt by a stronger dollar. Emerging markets generate about 50 percent of Colgate's sales and about 39 percent of P&G's revenue comes from developing markets.    The world's No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands in the next two years. Duracell, the world's No. 1 battery business, was widely considered to be one of the largest assets that P&G was likely to divest. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer John Moeller said the company had sold or discontinued 11 brands in the latest quarter and 25 in the last five quarters. Analysts expect it to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products, among others.  Demand for Duracell's mainstay non-rechargeable, disposable alkaline batteries has waned while a worldwide explosion in electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries.P&G, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it would first sell its interest in a China-based battery joint venture for an undisclosed amount and then exit Duracell completely.The company said it was looking to split Duracell off into a stand-alone company but would consider alternatives that offer better value to shareholders.Under the split-off, expected in the second half of 2015, P&G shareholders would be able to exchange some, none or all of their stock for shares of Duracell. SALES STRUGGLE P&G said it expected the percentage growth in its net sales in fiscal 2015 to be little changed or rise in the low single digits, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from a strong dollar.  Net income attributable to P&G fell to $1.99 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30 from $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings, excluding the currency impact, were $1.07 per share, in line with the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales dipped to $20.79 billion from $20.83 billion due to currency fluctuations and divestitures. Organic sales, excluding those effects, increased 2 percent.Shares of P&G were up 2.6 percent at $85.41 at midday.

MSCI's all-country world equity index was set for its biggest weekly gain since July 2013, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 was on pace for its first weekly gain in five and best week since the start of 2013, bolstered by solid U.S. corporate results.      News of the first person to test positive for Ebola in America's largest city weighed on European shares and held back buying in the United States, but overall the market's reaction to new Ebola cases was nowhere near as dramatic as the volatility witnessed earlier in October when fears of a rapid spread of the disease frightened investors.      ""I think the fears are a bit overdone. In previous cases, such as avian flu, the virus ended up being contained quite quickly,"" said Caroline Vincent, European equities fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management.     Corporate earnings were mixed. Microsoft and Procter & Gamble rose following their quarterly results, offsetting a plunge in Amazon after the online retailer reported an earnings miss. Microsoft shares were last up 1.6 percent at $45.76, while Amazon shares were last down 8.2 percent at $287.44.     U.S. Treasuries prices were up slightly as worries about Ebola stoked safe-haven demand for low-risk U.S. government debt, even as prices pared some gains on news that a nurse in Dallas who contracted Ebola is now free of the virus.       The euro rose against the dollar on the view that a weekend update on the euro zone banking sector's financial health would not reveal too many problems at the region's top banks. As of the end of 2013, 25 banks failed the European stress tests, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.        MSCI's all-country world equity index was last up 0.35 percent at 408.8. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of top European shares closed down 0.34 percent at 1,312.74.     The Dow Jones industrial average was last up 0.4 percent at 16,743.97, while the S&P 500 was up 0.31 percent at 1,956.96. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.25 percent at 4,463.72.     The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, was down 0.15 percent at 85.714. U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were last up 4/32 in price to yield 2.2623 percent.

Such investigations are usually resolved with a hefty fine, with the companies resuming business as usual before any real toll is taken on operations or profits.""It is commercial operations that have been stopped. The company cannot import, export or sell its products. But that does not affect day-to-day work at P&G,"" the source said. ""Employees continue to work and there are no thoughts of firing anyone.""Many other companies including foreign giants such as Anglo-Dutch Unilever supply Argentine supermarkets with some of the same household goods as P&G, meaning that even if the tax probe drags on, there is little risk of shortages.

101,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna Kumar  Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company's tax bill.Rather than pay cash, Berkshire (BRKa.N) will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. P&G (PG.N) will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.Buying Duracell is a ""brilliant move,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.""Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,"" Kass added. ""And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.""Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year.Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. NOT A GOOD SIGN Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.""I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,"" Buffett said in a statement. [ID:nBw5J6R8za]Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not.While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.""It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. ""I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G."" Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87.""WILLING AND EAGER""  Berkshire has owned P&G stock since P&G bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989. Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette's board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That's more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion.Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock.Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66 (PSX.N) for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets.Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30.P&G will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation.Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N), Duracell's main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent.UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved ""willing and eager"" to buy Duracell.Goldman Sachs, Jones Day, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft advised P&G.

102,"   By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Procter & Gamble Co., one of Warren Buffett's top portfolio holdings, is about to lose the billionaire's influential backing at a time when it appears the company's own fortunes have peaked.Thursday's agreement by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to turn over the $4.7 billion in shares it owns in the world's largest consumer products company in exchange for P&G's Duracell battery business comes one day after P&G shares hit a life-time high.""He is basically cashing in at a 52-week high,"" said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida. ""He is stating in transaction that Duracell is inexpensive and P&G stock is expensive. And accomplishing this all in tax-efficient transaction."" Buffett's transaction provides an exit from an investment he began making a quarter century ago, and on which he had already been dialing back. Under the deal, P&G will infuse about $1.8 billion of cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.Berkshire became one of P&G's biggest shareholders as a result of Buffett's investment in Gillette Co. P&G bought Gillette in 2005 in a $57 billion deal that Buffett supported. Berkshire held more than 101 million P&G shares in 2007 and cut the stake several times since then as the consumer-goods company faltered under previous Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald. Berkshire had fewer than 53 million shares as of June 30.Although P&G shares hit a life-time high of $89.88 on Wednesday, they have underperformed the market. Since its market bottom in March 2009, P&G has doubled in price. That pales next to the 147 percent gain in P&G's peer sector, the S&P consumer staples index, and the tripling in value of the wider S&P 500.  And P&G shares are expensive. They are trading at roughly 20 times forward earnings compared with a peer median of 18.7 times, and 16.5 times cash flow versus a peer median of 14.2. That means P&G is more expensive than half its peers in arguably one of the market's priciest sectors. The forward price-to-earnings multiple for the entire S&P 500 is about 16, according to Thomson Reuters data.To be sure, P&G's 3.7 price-to-book ratio is cheap relative to the 5.3 median for its peers. Buffett favors measuring Berkshire's own worth using growth in book value per share, instead of the stock price. In recent years, Berkshire has shed most of its multi-billion-dollar stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips and Kraft Foods Inc, the latter of which has since split into two companies.  Buffett was unhappy with Kraft's decision in 2010 to buy the British confectionery company Cadbury.

105,"  * Buffett to return $4.7 billion worth of shares to P&G* Purchase is ""brilliant move"" for Buffett - money manager   (Adds link to Breakingviews column)By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna KumarNov 13 Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company's tax bill.Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. P&G will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.Buying Duracell is a ""brilliant move,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.""Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,"" Kass added. ""And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.""Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings.NOT A GOOD SIGN Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.""I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,"" Buffett said in a statement.Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.""It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. ""I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.""Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87. ""WILLING AND EAGER"" Berkshire has owned P&G stock since P&G bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989.Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette's board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That's more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion.Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock.Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66  for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co, which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets.Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30.P&G will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation.Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc, Duracell's main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent.UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved ""willing and eager"" to buy Duracell.Goldman Sachs, Jones Day, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft advised P&G.

111,"  BUENOS AIRES Nov 17 Argentina tightened its international trade controls on Monday by creating a new government agency to keep track of imports and exports two weeks after accusing U.S. household products giant Procter & Gamble Co  of tax fraud.Early this month Argentina said the company hid income and over-billed $138 million in imports to get money out of the country, which three years ago introduced stringent capital controls to protect its dwindling foreign reserves.The government published a decree on Monday creating the Trade Operations Tracking Unit. The new agency will ""verify the price and quantity of goods and services exported and imported, along with the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange,"" the decree said. International reserves held by Argentina's central bank have fallen 7.6 percent so far this year to $28.3 billion.Cut off from the global bond market due to repeated debt defaults and interventionist policies that have slowed the economy to a standstill while inflation rages at an estimated 40 percent, Argentina relies on its reserves for financing. Cincinnati-based P&G, the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent, denied wrongdoing and has entered talks with the Argentine government over the allegations of tax evasion. The company, which runs three manufacturing plants and two distribution centers in Argentina, says its Argentine operations contribute about 1 percent to its overall sales.Argentina has also accused a handful of local banks and international grains exporting companies of tax evasion charges similar to those lodged against P&G.

113,"   By Anjuli Davies and Freya Berry | LONDON  LONDON Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is working with Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to explore the sale of its Wella hair care business that could be worth around $7 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as the world's largest consumer products company streamlines its business. P&G is exploring all options for the unit, which includes a professional and a trade business. That may result in selling the whole or parts, the sources said on Friday, cautioning that no final decision had been taken. A P&G spokesman said the company did not comment on rumor or speculation. Goldman Sachs was not immediately available to comment. Cincinnati-based P&G said in August it would shed 80 to 100 slow-growing product lines in order to focus on about 80 brands such as Tide laundry detergents and Pampers diapers which generate most of its profit and revenue.     In November, it announced the sale of its Duracell battery unit to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and it has already sold the bulk of its pet food business to Mars Inc and Spectrum Brand Holdings Inc.  In the hair care segment, P&G also owns Clairol, which it bought from Bristol-Myers Squibb for $4.95 billion in 2001, and Vidal Sassoon.     Prospective buyers could include Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group Unilever (ULVR.L) and Germany's Henkel, which made an informal approach for Wella in 2002 before it was subsequently sold to P&G in 2003 for 6.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion).     P&G has undertaken a multi-year restructuring program, cutting thousands of jobs and taking steps to streamline operations, launch new products and expand into fast-growing emerging markets, under pressure from shareholders including activist investor William A. Ackman, who took a stake in P&G in 2012.      It is also thought to be exploring options for Braun, which makes electric razors and toothbrushes and which it acquired as part of its $57 billion purchase of Gillette in 2005, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. It could also look to sell some of its fragrance business.

123,"   By Michael Georgy | CAIRO  CAIRO Procter & Gamble (PG.N) expects Egypt's economic growth could return to levels seen before the country's 2011 popular uprising within three years, but the government needs to make life easier for investors, the company's general manager for the region said.Mohamed Sultan, general manager and vice president, Near East, expressed confidence that stability had returned to the Arab country with its huge market of about 90 million people.""Within three years Egypt can be posting these numbers,"" he said, referring to economic growth of 5-7 percent Egypt achieved before the ouster of president Hosni Mubarak, compared to 2-3 percent now.Egypt is trying to secure its fragile recovery by conveying an investor-friendly image in the run-up to an investment conference in March.Sultan declined to give any profit forecasts or details on Procter & Gamble's investment plans in the country but he was cautiously optimistic. ""I think we have been through the worst. We are able to do business. That gives you confidence. I think we are heading in the right direction,"" he told Reuters in an interview.Egypt’s currency is a critical factor for foreign investors, particularly the persistence of a black market and constraints on dollar outflows.Sultan said exports allowed his company to secure funds but stressed that dealing with the foreign exchange issue would make Egypt more attractive to foreign investors. ""The biggest challenges for big companies is the dollar,"" said Sultan. ""A number of ideas are being studied with the banks that will make access to forex easier."" Procter & Gamble, one of the biggest non-oil sector investors in Egypt, sees growth potential in household  detergents and cleaning products as well as the diaper market.""Consumption per capita is still quite low compared to neighboring markets,"" Sultan said. Procter & Gamble exports 35 percent of its products to 37 countries, he said. It believes Africa offers the most growth potential, especially Kenya.Cheaper imports from Turkey, Malaysia and China, meanwhile, are posing a challenge in Egypt, Sultan said.(This story has been refiled to correct spelling of Procter in headline) (Editing by Jane Merriman)",2015-01-20,PG,"Tue Jan 20, 2015 | 2:10pm EST",Procter & Gamble optimistic over Egypt's economic recovery,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-egypt-procter-gamble-idUSKBN0KT27X20150120?type=companyNews

126,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar  Jan 23 Kimberly-Clark Corp is set to increase advertising and promotional spending for its diapers and launch new products in an escalating war with bigger rival Procter and Gamble Co in North America.Industry analysts say moms are either going upscale and choosing Pampers or going down-market with Luvs, both P&G brands, leaving Kimberly-Clark's mid-tier Huggies Snug & Dry line without a real identity.To compete better, Kimberly-Clark said on Friday it would cut prices and ""improve"" its Snug & Dry line starting this quarter, without giving details.Huggies is the core of Kimberly-Clark's baby care products business, which generates about $7 billion in annual sales. Pampers, P&G's largest brand, alone has sales of over $10 billion.""The consumer is shifting downward in price and they (Kimberly-Clark) don't have a lower-priced product,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj told Reuters. Dibadj said the company could play either end of the price spectrum: introduce a lower-priced brand or ""a product that is of such high quality that people are willing to pay more for it.""P&G and Kimberly-Clark control about 80 percent of the U.S diaper market, but the Kleenex maker is losing share, according to Euromonitor International data. Huggies' U.S. market share dropped to 8.50 percent in 2013 from 10.2 percent in 2008.Indeed, weakening sales of Huggies and other core products in North America is expected to lead to fall in sales in 2015, Kimberly-Clark said on Friday. Its shares fell 6 percent.

It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said.After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar  has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand.The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining.""You have companies who don't normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. ""It's really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening."" HEDGING HELP LIMITED WITH SHARP MOVES The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors.While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts' ability to estimate losses.One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates. Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share.The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps.American icon Apple Inc is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations.Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple's 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report.Apple's Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a ""clear headwind"" included in the company's guidance for the year ahead.Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics.Medical device maker Stryker Corp said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent.Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson and IBM .Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps. But actual losses may be much higher as many firms citing currency impacts did not disclose the amount, it noted.

137,"  (Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets)* Trade deficit widens to $46.6 billion in December* Imports rise 2.2 percent, exports fall 0.8 percent* Weekly jobless claims rise 11,000, less than expectedBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Feb 5 The U.S. trade deficit in December widened sharply to its highest level since 2012 as a stronger dollar appeared to suck in imports and weigh on exports, which could see the fourth-quarter economic growth estimate revised lower.The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit jumped 17.1 percent to $46.6 billion, the largest since November 2012. It was the biggest percentage increase since July 2009 and also reflected a sputtering global economy.""It is not hard to come up with reasons for the weakness in today's report - sluggish foreign growth and a strong dollar are the obvious ones,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Wall Street had expected the trade gap to narrow to $38 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit widened to $54.7 billion from $48.7 billion in November.December's shortfall was wider than the government had assumed when it reported last week that gross domestic product had expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Trade was estimated to have subtracted 1.02 percentage point from GDP growth.Economists said it now appeared the drag on growth was bigger and they expect the government to lower the fourth-quarter growth estimate by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point when it publishes revisions later this month. On an inflation-adjusted trade-weighted basis, the dollar appreciated 5.3 percent last year.While trade is on the back foot, the labor market is weathering the strong dollar and the global slowdown.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Jan. 31, the Labor Department said in a separate report.The increase, which was less than economists' expectations for a rise to 290,000, left intact the bulk of the prior week's huge decline, which had taken claims to their lowest level since April 2000.U.S. stocks were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. FIRMING LABOR MARKET January's employment report to be released on Friday will likely show that nonfarm payrolls increased 234,000, according to a Reuters survey of economists, which would be the longest stretch of job gains above 200,000 since 1994.A firming labor market, together with lower gasoline prices, is seen bolstering consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth in early 2015.""We still believe the U.S. can remain an oasis of prosperity in the world even if international developments are starting to intrude a little on our buoyant forecasts for 2015,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. In a sign of the consumer-driven strengthening in domestic demand, imports rose 2.2 percent to $241.4 billion in December. The increase was in part due to a jump in petroleum imports, which hit their highest level since May 2013.The higher petroleum imports probably found their way into wholesale inventories and could prove temporary.""We suspect ... storage plays by domestic oil market participants, with a large number of oil investors racing to buy crude at lower prices and storing it amid contango plays,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Imports of non-petroleum products surged to a record high, also reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar.But with the dollar's rise, exports slipped 0.8 percent to $194.9 billion in December, an eight-month low.A range of companies, including Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and Microsoft Corp  have warned that the dollar was hurting profits.Exports have been hurt by a labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which has been cited by some manufacturers as causing delays in the movement of goods.Exports to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - fell in December. In contrast, exports to Japan, China and the European Union rose in December.The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 5.5 percent to $28.3 billion.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-02-05,PG,"Thu Feb 5, 2015 | 11:11am EST",WRAPUP 2-U.S. trade deficit widens; weekly jobless claims up modestly,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0VF17B20150205?type=companyNews
138,"  (Adds reaction, details)By Corina Pons and Brian EllsworthCARACAS Feb 10 Venezuela on Tuesday launched a new foreign exchange platform that will likely devalue the bolivar heavily in efforts to bolster state coffers amid tumbling oil revenue, but risk a spike in already soaring inflation.The change amounts to an easing of 12-year-old currency controls and marks a small step toward market economics as the state-led model created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez struggles with shortages, swelling grocery lines and recession.However, the changes by Nicolas Maduro's government do not eliminate the unwieldy three-tiered exchange structure seen by investors as the country's principal stumbling block to economic growth.The change will likely lead to billions of dollars in write-downs by foreign corporations with exposure to Venezuela including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co and drugmaker Merck & Co Inc.The new platform, called Marginal Currency System or Simadi, is the third system in a three-tier exchange control mechanism and will allow for legal trading of foreign currency based on supply and demand, said Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco.""This third mechanism is open, free, in which bidders and buyers exchange offers,"" Marco said during a press conference with Central Bank President Nelson Merentes.The currency controls have been providing U.S. dollars at three different rates: 6.3 bolivars for food and medicine, and two complementary rates of around 12 bolivars and 52 bolivars for other goods through systems known as Sicad I and Sicad II.But dollars fetch nearly 190 bolivars on the black market, according to widely referenced website dolartoday.com.Marco and Merentes did not offer details on what the open rate would be when the market kicks off in coming days. Merentes said the new platform would help lower the parallel rate. Brokerage sources consulted by Reuters say the rate could begin at around 120 bolivars, substantially lower then the black market but still more than double the lowest existing rate.A representative of the country's primary business organization, Fedecamaras, said via telephone that the group was still studying the measure and did not have immediate comment on how the country's businesses would be affected.SHORTAGES OF BASICS Opposition critics slammed the announcement as an insufficient measure that will do little to address the decaying economy, which one former government minister recently described as becoming the ""laughing-stock"" of the region.""If devaluation were the solution, we would be Switzerland!"" wrote opposition-leaning economist Miguel Angel Santos via Twitter, noting repeated devaluations during the 16 years of rule by the late Chavez and Maduro. The tumbling price of oil, which provides nearly all of Venezuela's hard currency, has left the 12-year-old exchange controls struggling to provide dollars to ensure steady supplies of such as detergent and milk that are increasingly going missing.Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation.Dismay over the state of the economy, and particularly of product shortages, has pushed Maduro's approval rating down to 22 percent, according to local pollster Datanalisis.A further spike in inflation due to the higher cost of imports could spur voter indignation and leave the ruling Socialist Party unable to maintain its majority in legislative elections to be held later this year.Both Marco and Merentes, however, denied there would be an inflationary impact. The Sicad I auction system will continue to hold periodic auctions for specific sectors of the economy and will for the moment continue providing dollars at the rate of 12, Marco said, adding that rate would change over time.The new Simadi market will replace the Sicad II system.Investors generally interpret devaluations positively because they leave the government with more hard currency available to service debt.Venezuelan bonds, which have been trading at distressed levels on fears of a possible default, were up across the board on Tuesday, with yields on several dropping to one-month lows.The Global 2026 bond was up 2.750 points in price to yield 26.841 percent while the Global 2022  rose 3.180 points to yield 31.717 percent.Equities investors face billions of dollars in write-downs by U.S. corporations with exposure to Venezuela, as many have been unable to repatriate bolivars back into dollars due to delays in the currency controls.At least 40 major U.S. companies together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books, concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country's currency system.Others foreign companies with notable exposure to Venezuela include Spain's Telefonica and Germany drugmaker Bayer .Some companies have already taken charges on their Venezuela exposure, including Kimberly Clark, Ford and Schlumberger. General Motors last week said in its annual report that instability in Venezuela could lead to a $900 million hit to earnings.The Coca-Cola Co said during a conference call on Tuesday that it expects Venezuela pricing provisions will continue to negatively impact net revenue.

139,"   By Corina Pons | CARACAS  CARACAS Feb 10 Venezuela on Tuesday will unveil a new foreign exchange system that is likely to ease the country's three-tiered currency controls but would also mean a hefty devaluation of the bolivar currency.Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco and Central Bank President Nelson Merentes were to hold a news conference at 11 a.m. local time (1030 EST/1530 GMT) on a ""new exchange scheme,"" the government said.The currency controls have been providing dollars at three different rates: 6.3 bolivars for food and medicine, and two complementary rates of around 12 bolivars and 52 bolivars for other goods through systems known as Sicad I and Sicad II.On the black market, the dollar is selling for nearly 190 bolivars, according to widely referenced website dolartoday.com. President Nicolas Maduro in January said the government would keep the preferential rate of 6.3 bolivars, maintain Sicad I at a yet-to-be-announced rate, and replace Sicad II with a new supply-and-demand driven platform.Brokerage operators who have been discussing the new system with officials told Reuters that the idea was to allow the bolivar to trade on that platform at a rate nearer the black market, at least double the current weakest level of 52.The operators said authorities were projecting the black market price could come down to between 120 and 140 bolivars once the third system opens. The Central Bank and state oil company PDVSA would be allowed to sell foreign currency via this mechanism, the sources said, with a projected daily offer of between $30 million and $45 million. The Central Bank would retain a power of veto over all operations, they added.The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation.The 12-year-old exchange controls have steadily reduced dollar disbursals amid declining oil prices, spurring shortages of products such as detergent and milk as companies have been unable to import machinery and raw materials.The new exchange rate is likely to affect U.S. corporate giants with exposure to Venezuela because the government has not allowed them to repatriate revenue from operations.At least 40 major U.S. companies, including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co and drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books.

140,"  (Updates with analyst comment, bond and CDS prices)By Brian Ellsworth and Daniel BasesCARACAS/NEW YORK Feb 11 Venezuela's dollar-denominated bonds tumbled on Wednesday after the government announced a new foreign exchange platform that was seen as insufficient to resolve an economic crisis and ease fears of a possible bond default.The OPEC nation on Tuesday unveiled a new free-floating currency platform called Simadi, the third system in a three-tier exchange control mechanism meant to bolster state coffers.Venezuela faces a potential gap in funding in 2015 given what it owes to foreigners holding U.S. dollar denominated debt.Siobhan Morden, a veteran emerging market debt strategist and head of Latin America strategy at Jeffries in New York believes the government needs to fill a $14 billion hole in its balance sheet in order to meet its obligations.""Maybe they can do something that is extremely creative that enables them to get through this year. But as it stands right now, with all the resources I am looking at, they are underfunded,"" said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies in New York.If President Nicolas Maduro can make it through this year, that funding gap increases to roughly $26 billion in 2016, Morden said.""Then they are absolutely, completely underfunded for 2016. But that is assuming they make it through this year. I would say there is still a high probability of default this year,"" she said.Critics pointed out that the changes to the 12-year-old currency control system did not remove two heavily over valued exchange rates, which will limit the government's ability to save hard currency amid a drastic fall in oil revenues. ""The persistence of large distortions in the FX market will make it more difficult for the government to make necessary savings in the new scenario of lower oil prices,"" wrote Alejandro Grisanti of Barclays. ""In such conditions, scarcity and inflation problems could continue to deepen.""Benchmark Venezuelan government debt fell sharply because the new plan underwhelmed the the market. Simadi was seen as marginal tinkering at best, even if it was a step in the right direction toward reform.Venezuela's Global 2027 bond fell 3.49 points in price to bid 40.005, driving the yield up to 25.12 percent. .An investor wanting to insure a $10 million portfolio of Venezuelan sovereign bonds for five years would need to spend $6.52 million upfront versus $6.32 million on Tuesday, according to data provider Markit.State-owned oil company PDVSA's bonds declined as well. It's benchmark 2024 bond dropped 1.36 points in price to bid 32.64, with yield up to nearly 25 percent. A plunge in oil prices has left Venezuela's state-led model created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez struggling with shortages, swelling grocery lines and recession.The country's dollar-denominated bonds are now trading at distressed levels and on average their yields pay 27 percentage points more than similar U.S. Treasury bills due to concerns of a possible default.Maduro insists the country will meet all foreign debt commitments without cutting social spending plans or scrapping the currency control system.CORPORATE WRITE-DOWNS  Bonds had jumped on Tuesday in expectation that the new system would imply a large devaluation, which is generally viewed positively by bondholders because it frees up more hard currency for debt service.Officials did not say what the exchange rate would be on the new system, insisting it would be determined by supply and demand once the market kicks off in the coming days.Business leaders in Venezuela have given little detailed reaction to the change, though some said the free-floating mechanism was a welcome, albeit limited, move.""The government is recognizing that supply and demand must set prices,"" said Jorge Roig, head of the main business group Fedecamaras, in reference to the new system.""A bit of liberalism isn't a bad thing.""The three-tiered system will now comprise the preferential rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar for food and medicine, a complementary rate of 12 bolivars for other goods through a system called Sicad, and the floating rate via Simadi.Local consultancy Ecoanalitica estimated the new rate would start between 130 and 140 bolivars.The group added that the weighted average exchange rate for 2015 would be 46.6 bolivars per dollar compared with 20.3 bolivars in 2014, which would imply a devaluation of 56 percent.That could force another round of hefty write-downs by foreign companies with exposure to Venezuela including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co  and Spanish telecom giant Telefonica.

PLUNGING REVENUES The tumbling price of oil, which provides nearly all of Venezuela's hard currency, has left the 12-year-old exchange controls struggling to provide dollars to ensure steady supplies of products such as detergent and milk that are increasingly scarce around Venezuela.Maduro, speaking late on Tuesday, said Venezuela's revenues had fallen 60 percent due to the oil price decline, and the country was ready for another two years of ""low or very low"" prices.However, all social welfare projects and foreign debt commitments, starting with the 1 billion euro Global 2015 issue  coming due on March 16, would be honored, his economic officials said.Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year, with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation.Dismay over the state of the economy, and particularly of product shortages, has pushed Maduro's approval rating down to 22 percent, according to local pollster Datanalisis. ""Despite the fanfare that is likely to accompany the apparent shift towards a market-based foreign exchange system, we doubt that it will solve Venezuela's deep economic problems,"" Capital Economics said in a note on Tuesday's changes.A further spike in inflation, due to the higher cost of imports for businesses, could spur voter indignation and leave the ruling Socialist Party unable to maintain its majority in legislative elections to be held later this year.Both Marco and Merentes, however, denied there would be an inflationary impact. They said 70 percent of the economy's needs would be covered by dollars sold at the 6.3 rate.The Sicad I auction system will continue to hold periodic auctions for specific sectors of the economy and will for the moment continue providing dollars at the rate of 12, Marco said, adding that rate would change over time.The new Simadi market will replace the Sicad II system.Investors generally interpret devaluations positively because they leave the government with more hard currency available to service debt.Venezuelan bonds, which have been trading at distressed levels on fears of a possible default, were up across the board on Tuesday, with yields on several dropping to one-month lows.The Global 2026 bond was up 2.750 points in price to yield 26.841 percent while the Global 2022  rose 3.180 points to yield 31.717 percent.Equities investors face billions of dollars in write-downs by U.S. corporations with exposure to Venezuela, as many have been unable to repatriate bolivars back into dollars due to delays in the currency controls.At least 40 major U.S. companies together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books, concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country's currency system.Other foreign companies with notable exposure to Venezuela include Spain's Telefonica and German drugmaker Bayer .Some companies have already taken charges on their Venezuela exposure, including Kimberly Clark, Ford and Schlumberger.

146,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: P&G Beauty Division Divestment â€“ Block Sale to  Investment-Grade Peer Unlikely here MILAN/LONDON, April 09 (Fitch) Procter & Gamble's reported plan to divest a  large chunk of its USD20bn beauty division is unlikely to attract interest from  major competitors such as L'Oreal, Henkel, Unilever, Colgate and Kimberly Clark  if P&G wants to offload the business in a single sale, Fitch Ratings says in a  new report. But rivals would probably be interested in buying individual brands. According to media reports, P&G intends to retain several brands, such as  Pantene, that have leading shares and positive marketing momentum, and may  divest the remaining assets in one lot via an IPO or sale. We estimate that the  remaining assets lined up for divestment generate about USD8bn in revenues, and  at a conservative 15x EBITDA multiple could cost a buyer USD13bn-15bn.  This would be a hefty price for major competitors and the USD8bn in revenues  would be transformative for all but Unilever, which has roughly USD52bn total  revenues (including food). The assets probably would not be earnings accretive  as margins are lower than those of potential buyers, and therefore would be more  likely to negatively affect the would-be buyer's existing ratings. We therefore  do not think any major consumer industry companies have the capacity or  willingness to engage in an acquisition of this magnitude, particularly if it is  non-accretive. We therefore believe that if the assets were divested as a single block, an IPO  or a sale to a non-strategic buyer would be more likely. Unrated Coty Inc. could  also be a potential buyer as it is focussed on growth and has previously been  able to offer USD10.7bn for Avon Products.  We believe major rated consumer companies would be more interested in selective  acquisition of P&G brands, and several could remain near current ratings if they  made acquisitions with a price tag of around USD5bn. But even if buyers were  able to pick and choose a group of brands the price is likely to be high, and  require a meaningful level of debt financing and future cash draws for brand  support and integration. For a detailed analysis of the potential M&A appetite of personal care companies  and the likely impact of a multi-billion acquisition on their ratings, see our  report ""P&G Beauty Division Divestments - Block Sale Unlikely to Investment-Grade Peers"" available at www.fitchratings.com.

147,"   By Olivia Oran, Arno Schuetze and Martinne Geller  Personal care and cosmetics companies Henkel & Co KGaA AG, Revlon Inc and Coty Inc are preparing bids for parts of Procter & Gamble Co's beauty business, according to sources.The three companies are working with investment banks ahead of a first-round bid deadline set for next week, the sources said on Wednesday. A successful sale would allow P&G to focus on more profitable consumer brands such as its Gillette razors, Tide detergent and Pampers disposable diapers.Henkel is interested in buying P&G's haircare business, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands, the sources said, declining to be named because the matter is private. The haircare business is worth about $7 billion based on annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $500 million, the sources said. Revlon, the owner of makeup brands such as Almay, is eyeing P&G's cosmetics business, which includes drugstore brands CoverGirl and Max Factor. That business has annual EBITDA of around $350 million, the people said. Coty, which makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, is likely interested in P&G's fragrance unit, though it could also look at buying P&G's cosmetics business as well, the sources said.  P&G's fragrance unit includes brands such as Hugo Boss and Gucci and has EBITDA of around $250 million, they said. It remains unclear whether P&G will try to sell its brands as part of a package, whose value could range from $10 billion to $12 billion, or piecemeal. P&G could also decide to scrap the sale entirely and instead look to spin off the unit, the sources added.  Representatives for P&G and Revlon declined to comment. Coty and Henkel did not respond to requests for comment. P&G is looking to sell some of its beauty brands as part of a cost-cutting strategy by Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley. Lafley said in August he would reverse the Cincinnati-based company's strategy of aggressive expansion and shed more than half its brands. P&G said it would concentrate on 70 to 80 brands that have accounted for 90 percent of its sales over the past three years. P&G has already divested some of its non-core brands. Last year, the company sold its Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion in stock and also sold some of its soap brands to Unilever PLC.

Snowy winter weighed on activity early in 2015. Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, as well as the dollar and softer global demand have been a constraint.""This provides some confirmation on the disappointing growth performance in the first quarter. The absence of a lift in the other forward-looking indicators suggests that the U.S. economic recovery is struggling to regain any traction,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Fed said. March's decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop.A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent in March, marking the third straight month of declines in mining output. Crude oil has lost more than half of its value since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity. Companies in the oil field are also either postponing or cutting back on capital expenditure projects.Separately, the Fed in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide said investment in oil and gas drilling had declined and related layoffs were reported by ""multiple"" regions. Caterpillar Inc early this year cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.Last month, utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, also weighing on industrial production. ""We do not see the emerging picture as supporting the hand of those who have been arguing for an earlier Fed rate hike,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.Most economists have pushed back their expectations for the first rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe monetary policy will only be tightened in 2016. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008. Data including for retail sales, housing starts, inventories, trade and manufacturing suggest the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December quarter.U.S. Treasury prices rose as the data supported bets the Fed was likely to wait longer to raise rates. Stocks rose while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.WEAK MANUFACTURING  For the first quarter, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009.Oil and gas well drilling and servicing, which tumbled at a 69.8 percent rate, accounted for the bulk of the drop in industrial output in the first quarter. While manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent in March, the first gain since last November, it fell at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, the first decline since the second quarter of 2009. The soft trend could persist for a while. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index fell to -1.19 in April from March's 6.90. This was the first negative read for the index since December.The weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been attributed to the buoyant dollar, bad weather and supply chain disruptions from the ports dispute.  Softer growth in Europe and Asia, especially China where the economy expanded at its slowest pace in six years in the first quarter, has also been a drag.The dollar has gained 13 percent against the United States' main trading partners since last June, which economists say is equivalent to a 0.5 percentage point interest rate hike.""The dollar's strength may be taking some of the oomph out of factory production, which had been on a tear until December last year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.""Time will tell whether this is real weakness or simply a bump on the road to prosperity.

151,"  (Adds events for Verizon, AT&T, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications)Week AheadA slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald's Corp, AT&T Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines.

Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business.Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods.Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry's top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working.On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn't losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown.Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer's drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider's growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy.AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company's dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira's continuing growth and sales of the company's recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc's potent treatments for the liver disease.Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands.Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories' infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company's branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar.Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company's plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015.On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company's cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company's buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls' business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group.Pentagon's No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year.Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald's and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company's previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States.On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company's connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June.On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC.Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware's revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth.Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton's second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup's results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market.Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor's pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be ""challenging,"" having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year.Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations.

However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday.Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook.Dunkin' Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston's record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin' Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful.Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear.Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company's recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel.Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets.

Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company's newly acquired centrifugal compression business.Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts' estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada's largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal.Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear's comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses.Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia's state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company's quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees.AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward.On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software.

The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services.On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing.On Thursday Mexico's national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank's 3 percent target.

Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly.Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company's institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs's strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month.Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world's second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia.Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell.

159,"  (Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets)* Core capital goods orders fall 0.5 percent in March* Core capital goods shipments slip 0.4 percent* Durable goods orders jump 4.0 percent on transportationBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, April 24 U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March, weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices, suggesting the economy was struggling to rebound from a recent soft patch.The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came on the heels of lukewarm data on retail sales, employment and housing starts that have hinted at insufficient growth momentum that could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year.""This is consistent with a sluggish rebound in growth. It's shedding more doubt on the Fed's willingness to raise rates mid-year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest decline since July 2013.The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February. Economists had forecast these orders gaining 0.3 percent last month. The weakness mirrors other manufacturing indicators such as industrial production and various regional factory surveys.The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors were cheered by strong results from Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp.The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said an increase will likely be considered at its June policy-setting meeting.MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING  Manufacturing has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, whose 12.1 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co.The world's largest household products maker on Thursday reported a 8.3 percent decline in quarterly sales.In addition, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger and Halliburton .Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, has cut its capital expenditure plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion. Halliburton slashed its capex by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion.""Cheap oil and a strong dollar, while beneficial to consumers, are putting serious pressure on manufacturers,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. The dollar and reduced capex spending by oil-field firms combined with a harsh winter and softer global demand to slow U.S. growth at the start of the year.In March, shipments of core capital goods - which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement - fell 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February.Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. As a result, JPMorgan lowered its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.6 percent annual pace.Barclays trimmed its forecast to a 1.1 percent rate from a 1.2 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday.Pointing to prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, unfilled orders for core capital goods fell for a second straight month in March after barely rising in January.""We have not seen the full ramifications of the strong dollar and the drop in oil-related investment, so that could continue to play out,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ""The focus is now on services and consumers in the hope that they are going to pick up the tab. So far we are not seeing signs of that.""A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rebounded 4.0 percent last month. That was the largest increase since July last year and followed a 1.4 percent decline in February.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-04-24,PG,"Fri Apr 24, 2015 | 12:25pm EDT",WRAPUP 2-Weak U.S. business spending data hints at sluggish growth rebound,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XL0OC20150424?type=companyNews
160,"  (Recasts with final auto sales data)* Manufacturing activity muted, strong dollar cited* Auto sales slow in April after March's robust pace* Consumer sentiment rises in April from March* Construction spending hits six-month low in MarchBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 1 U.S. factory activity failed to gain steam in April after slowing for five straight months and demand for automobiles softened, suggesting the economy was struggling to find momentum after growth almost stalled in the first quarter.Other data on Friday showed construction spending hit a six-month low in March, also indicating that the anticipated acceleration in growth in the second quarter could disappoint.   That could see the Federal Reserve delaying raising interest rates until later this year.The economy expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have undercut domestic energy production.""The reacceleration in growth will not come fast enough for many, especially those looking for a liftoff by the Fed to happen sooner,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in New York. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was at 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013.The index had declined since November and economists had expected it to rise to 52 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.While new orders rose last month, a gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since May 2013 and recorded its lowest reading since September 2009.Manufacturing has been hit by the dollar's 12 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June.The buoyant currency has hurt export growth and profits of multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, and prompted Colgate-Palmolive and healthcare conglomerate  Johnson & Johnson to cut their profit forecasts for the full year. Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is also being pressured by the lower oil prices, which have caused oil-field companies to slash spending on exploration and well drilling.Caterpillar Inc has warned the dollar and weak oil prices will hurt profits this year.U.S. stocks closed higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. REGAINING FOOTING Separately, auto sales fell to an annualized pace of 16.45 million vehicles last month from a 17.15 million-unit rate in March. However, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co  reported stronger-than-expected U.S. auto sales in April on robust demand for trucks, and crossover and sports utility vehicles.Demand for autos is likely to pick up in the months ahead. In another report, the University of Michigan said its overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 95.9 this month, the second highest level since 2007, from 93.0 in March.Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and expectations for the future. More consumers said it was a good time to buy a major household item and a vehicle. There was also an increase in consumers saying it was a good time to buy and sell a house, which should support home sales.""This suggests that there may be some upside risk for durable goods spending in the second quarter ... and that perhaps housing market activity will pick up in the months ahead,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion in March, the lowest level since September.Construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest such decline since June. Public construction outlays were also weak.""We think the outlook for residential construction is positive in 2015 as household formation appears to have picked up and as house price gains have remained firm,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-01,PG,"Fri May 1, 2015 | 4:50pm EDT",WRAPUP 3-Anemic U.S. factory data points to moderate growth bounce,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XS0V820150501?type=companyNews
161,"  (Adds details, background, analyst comments, updates markets)* Factory orders rise 2.1 percent on transportation* Orders excluding transportation unchanged* March core capital goods orders revised upBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 4 New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar.The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter's abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather.""It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment.Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February's 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June.The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms. That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter.The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year.The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year.Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices. Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar.The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month.""Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.""We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices.""Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories  rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines.Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-04,PG,"Mon May 4, 2015 | 1:23pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory orders rebound solidly, but trend still soft",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XV0WQ20150504?type=companyNews
162,"  * Private equity mentality spreads in consumer sector* Highlights importance of financial prowess* JAB, Nomad Foods have links to 3G-controlled AB InBevBy Martinne GellerLONDON, May 21 The consumer goods world has long been dominated by marketing whiz kids raised through the ranks of Procter & Gamble or PepsiCo, but the executives now in demand come from a new school that values cost-cutting and mergers over marketing.The new playbook, embodied by U.S. private equity firm 3G Capital, applies cutthroat Wall Street sensibilities to Main Street shopping aisles, demanding the highest performance from  fewer people willing to work extra hard and progress quickly.The spread of a private equity mentality to more of the largest names in the sector exacerbates the pressure on finance chiefs, already wading through increased volatility of commodities and currencies, and highlights the need for financial prowess outside the finance department.The 3G management philosophy was developed by three Brazilian investment bankers and pioneered at Budweiser brewer Anheuser Busch InBev, the world's biggest brewer, which they helped create through a series of big mergers. It is now also in effect at Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International where they are major shareholders, and ketchup maker Heinz which they have bought. Soon it will arrive at Kraft Foods, which is being bought by Heinz.The Brazilians have demonstrated that the private equity model can be implemented on a large scale, potentially creating big winners and losers in a low-growth sector.Private equity firms in general are known for a more aggressive culture than marketing-focused consumer goods companies, with more competition and a higher turnover rate among executives, said Gary Stibel, CEO of New England Consulting Group. He said more consumer firms are adopting some of those philosophies, but it is not always a good fit.""They have a maniacal focus on cash and results,"" Stibel said. ""You've got to be very careful about putting a bull in a china shop unless you're prepared to have a lot of broken glass.""After 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, they closed six factories and cut 7,000 jobs in 18 months. Operating margins jumped from 18 percent to 26 percent. Part of the 3G playbook is zero-based budgeting (ZBB), which forces managers to justify each year's costs from scratch rather than assume the previous year's budget as a starting point.While 3G is often seen as extreme - at Heinz they limited employee use of company printers to 200 pages per month, required double-sided printing - ZBB is being adopted elsewhere, such as at Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International .Executives familiar with the strategy are in demand as other companies seek to repeat the trick.""Anyone who worked at ABI (AB InBev) or Heinz under the 3G regime would be very appealing to the market, because of their familiarity with ZBB,"" said Fabio Vacirca, head of the consumer goods and services group at consultancy Accenture.As industry-wide sales have slowed for packaged food makers such as Kellogg, Campbell Soup and General Mills , all eyes have turned to profits.3G's founders Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira developed their management style at Banco Garantia, the investment bank they founded in Brazil in the 1970s. After selling it to Credit Suisse in 1998, they formed private equity firm 3G to invest in U.S. consumer names. Lemann, Brazil's richest man and a former tennis pro, once served on the board of Gillette, where he met Buffett, who has partnered with Lemann on Heinz and Kraft and has said he would like to do more deals.CFO TURNOVER A shakeup in finance departments throughout the packaged goods sector suggests the emphasis on dealmaking and cost-cutting is putting new pressure on a side of the business that used to take a back seat to marketing.Unilever announced the departure of its chief financial officer Jean-Marc Huet on Tuesday, becoming the fifth major consumer products firm to change the post in recent months, following Heineken, Danone, Nestle  and SABMiller.""Maybe it is just becoming a more pressurized and intense job as the CFOs are being required to actually become more operationally involved in all that cost-cutting rather than just adding up the numbers,"" said one investment bank analyst covering the sector, who declined to be identified by name. Since the credit crunch, companies have been increasingly naming finance experts as CEOs and board members, ""because it's been more about management of those risks as opposed to the more expansive agenda that perhaps marketeers had traditionally been better suited to,"" said Will Hayllar, co-leader of the global consumer goods team at OC&C Strategy Consultants.Dealmaking activity is requiring a lot of attention from top executives, SABMiller's interim CFO, Domenic De Lorenzo, told reporters last week: ""Conversations, evaluations, looking at transactions, that's still a big part of everyone's day-to-day job in this industry.""Many of the dealmakers and financiers taking up top jobs in the industry have outright connections to 3G and AB InBev.Stefan Descheemaeker, the executive who led Belgium's Interbrew into the merger that formed the precursor to AB InBev, will soon take charge of Birdseye frozen foods owner Iglo Foods as the new CEO of acquisition firm Nomad Holdings.Olivier Goudet, a veteran of the 2008 takeover of Wrigley by Mars, has been named as both the new chairman of AB InBev and as CEO at JAB Holdings, the family office of the German billionaire Reimann family which is putting together the world's largest pure-play coffee company. JAB's former CEO Peter Harf also served as AB InBev chairman.The tumult helps the sector to be seen as a hot field for aspiring managers. Work in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector became the most popular destination for business students last year, eclipsing banking for the first time, according to a global survey by Deloitte.Deloitte's Margaret Doyle, who worked on the report, pointed to an increased number of female students, who she said often lean toward marketing jobs, and a weakening of the banking industry, whose reputation was bruised by the financial crisis.""FMCG companies have always been perceived as having well-regarded graduate programmes,"" said Doyle, head of financial services insight at Deloitte. ""People are initiated through different parts of the business - they get to market shampoo, market washing powder, they experience a real rotation which is a great foundation.""Procter & Gamble for decades was seen as one of the best breeding grounds for business executives, due to its world-class talent programme and reputation for promoting from within. Aside from consumer leaders like Unilever CEO Paul Polman and Estee Lauder CEO Fabrizio Freda, P&G alums include General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt and former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer.Yet industry bankers said they could they could see why new graduates might like to work for 3G, despite its culture being so thrifty that even top executives abide by restrictions on travel and entertainment.""Come to them, and they'll teach you as much about consumer products marketing as anyone else, but they'll also show you how to develop that playbook,"" said one banker.

165,"  (Adds consumer sentiment, factory data, updates markets)* First-quarter GDP revised down to show contraction* GDP shrinks at a 0.7 percent annual rate* Trade, inventories account for bulk of revision* Strong dollar weighs on Q1 corporate profitsBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 29 The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter as it buckled under the weight of unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, but activity already has rebounded modestly.The government on Friday slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month.A larger trade deficit and a smaller accumulation of inventories by businesses than previously thought accounted for much of the downward revision. There was also a modest downward revision to consumer spending.With growth estimates for the second quarter currently around 2 percent, the economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. The economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been erratic.Weak data on consumer sentiment and factory activity in the Midwest on Friday suggested that while the economy has pulled out of its first-quarter soft patch, the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production.But reports on housing and business spending plans have indicated momentum could be building, which would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Economists caution against reading too much into the slump in output. They argue the GDP figure for the first quarter was held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have cast doubts on the accuracy of GDP estimates for the first quarter, which have tended to show weakness over the last several years.They argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving ""residual"" seasonality. The government said last week it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it.""Obviously the economy is weaker than we would like it to be, but the first quarter overstates that,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. ""We're going see enough growth to keep job creation in place and allow the Fed to maintain their lift-off schedule for September.""When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up slightly and business spending on equipment was much stronger than previously estimated, taking some edge off the slump in output.U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street fell. DOLLAR, ENERGY DRAG Apart from the statistical quirk, the economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, was hammered by a sharp decline in investment spending in the energy sector as companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton  responded to the plunge in crude oil prices.Spending on mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a 48.6 percent pace in the first quarter, the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009.Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February chopped at least one percentage point from growth.Trade was hit both by the strong dollar and the ports labor dispute, which weighed on exports through the quarter and then unleashed a flood of imports in March after it was resolved. That resulted in a trade deficit that subtracted 1.90 percentage points from GDP, the largest drag in 31 years, instead of the 1.25 percentage points reported last month.The GDP report also showed after-tax corporate profits declined 8.7 percent. That was the largest drop in a year and the second quarterly fall, as the strong dollar burdened multinational corporations and oil prices hurt domestic firms.Multinationals like Microsoft Corp, household products maker Procter & Gamble Co and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.Unlike 2014, when growth snapped back quickly after a dismal first quarter, the dollar and investment cuts by energy companies continue to hamstring activity.But growth could accelerate as the year progresses.The value of inventory accumulated in the first quarter was revised down to an increase of $95 billion from the lofty $110.3 billion rise reported last month.That meant inventories contributed 0.33 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.74 percentage point, suggesting warehouses are not bulging with unwanted merchandise and businesses have latitude to order more goods from factories.While consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent rate, it could finally get a lift from the considerable savings households amassed because of cheaper gasoline.Personal savings increased at a robust $726.4 billion pace.""The outlook for the economy is very encouraging,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-05-29,PG,"Fri May 29, 2015 | 11:56am EDT",WRAPUP 4-U.S. economy contracts in Q1; dollar hurts corporate profits,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSLNNTGEBB220150529?type=companyNews

172,"  (Adds details, housing data, updates markets)* Industrial production falls 0.2 percent in May* Manufacturing output slips 0.2 percent* Mining production drops 0.3 percent* New York state factory activity gauge falls in JuneBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, June 15 U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May as manufacturing and mining activity remained weak, a sign that a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector continued to constrain economic growth.The softness in the production side of the economy contrasts starkly with recent upbeat data on retail sales, employment, consumer and small business confidence, which have pointed to a growth pickup after a sluggish start to the second quarter.""Signs of spring remain largely absent in the industrial sector. The challenges of the stronger dollar and drop in energy  prices linger,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.Industrial output slipped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Industrial production has been weak since December, and  economists had expected output to rise 0.2 percent last month.The data was likely to get the attention of Fed policymakers who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists said.The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at this week's policy meeting, but rather to wait until later this year. Industrial production last month was held down by a 0.2 percent drop in manufacturing output. Manufacturing has been whacked by a strong dollar, which has eroded the profits of multinational corporations.Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.The dollar has gained about 13.2 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June largely on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy.U.S. financial markets were little moved by Monday's data as investors kept a wary eye on Greece, which inched closer to defaulting on its debt. U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt rose. WEAK ORDERS Although motor vehicle production, machinery, and computer and electronic products increased last month, it was not enough to offset the drag on manufacturing output from declines in the production of electrical equipment, appliances and components, fabricated metal products and wood products.Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and more than 72 percent of industrial production, was also weighed down by falling output of nondurable goods such as food and petroleum products.It is likely to remain weak in the months ahead.In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index dropped to a reading of minus 1.98 in June from 3.09 in May.That was the weakest reading since January 2013 and the second negative reading in the past three months. A gauge of new orders contracted, while shipments edged down. Though a measure of unfilled orders increased last month, it remained in contraction territory, indicating order books remained weak. ""Manufacturers will continue to struggle with the impact of the dollar's rise for some time yet,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.But given manufacturing's small share of the economy and recent signs of a sharp pickup in growth in the non-factory sectors, Ashworth said ""there is every reason to believe that GDP growth will average between 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent annualized over the rest of this year.""That upbeat assessment was bolstered by a third report showing confidence among homebuilders vaulted to an eight-month high in June, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining traction. Housing is expected to take up some of the slack from weak manufacturing.GDP contracted in the first quarter, slammed by bad weather, port disruptions, dollar strength and energy sector spending cuts.Last month, mining production fell 0.3 percent, the fifth straight monthly decline, as oil and gas well drilling and servicing fell 7.9 percent after plunging 14.5 percent in April.That took the cumulative drop since the end of 2014 to 51.8 percent. But the pace of decline in oil and gas well drilling and servicing is moderating, suggesting the worst of the spending cuts is over.Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year.Oil and gas production, however, increased 0.5 percent in May. Unseasonably warm weather last month lifted demand for air conditioning, leading to a 0.2 percent increase in utilities production.The amount of industrial capacity in use last month fell to its lowest level since January 2014.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao)",2015-06-15,PG,"Mon Jun 15, 2015 | 1:35pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. industrial output hurt by weakness in manufacturing, mining",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0Z10NV20150615?type=companyNews

Lew said failure to reach an agreement would create broad uncertainties for the global economy. ""The market seems to be pricing in a possibility, overpricing, a Greece exit,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.He said he does not expect a surprise to the market from the Fed in terms of a rate hike, or from a Greek default.""Financials have been leading and dividend payers have sold off.

Stocks had opened lower but quickly turned higher and drifted up throughout the day to close near the session's high.Consumer staples lead the way up, with Coty shares at a record, closing up 19.3 percent at $31.08. Coty is on track to buy Procter & Gamble's beauty business in a $12 billion deal. P&G shares closed up 1.3 percent at $79.10.In other merger news, shares of NCR Corp hit a 14-month high of $36.50. Reuters reported Blackstone and Carlyle are making a joint bid for NCR in what would be the year's biggest leveraged buyout at more than $10 billion, including debt. NCR closed up 10.7 percent at $34.73 while Blackstone fell 0.6 percent to $41.98 and Carlyle rose 0.8 percent to $28.41. The chance that the Fed Wednesday will give more clarity on the timing of its expected rate hike was seen as a catalyst for more takeover deals.""Rising rates could be a trigger for even more M&A activity,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.""They are a signal that now's the time to get the deals done if you are going to do them with cheap financing.""Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,946 to 1,104, for a 1.76-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,635 issues rose and 1,158 fell for a 1.41-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 8 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows while on the Nasdaq Composite there were 138 new highs and 37 new lows.About 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 5.98 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

178,"  June 15 U.S. cosmetics group Coty has won auctions to acquire three businesses from Procter & Gamble Co for as much as $12 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Reuters reported last week that Henkel & Co KGaA AG  and Coty, both of which have personal care and cosmetics businesses, made binding offers to buy separate parts of P&G's beauty businesses.P&G, the world's largest household products maker, has been looking to sell several assets it considers non-core as part of its cost-cutting strategy. Coty, which has a market value of $9.39 billion and makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, has been looking to expand its products portfolio.Coty outbid other potential buyers vying for P&G's hair-care, fragrant and cosmetics businesses, the source said, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. The source cautioned that the deal, had not yet been finalized. The deal was first reported by the New York Post.Coty refused to comment when contacted by Reuters. P&G was not immediately available for comment.

179,"  (Refiles to fix typo in Procter in first paragraph)* Coty, P&G deal to take weeks to finalise - sources* JAB to own third of equity, 47-48 pct of voting rights* Deal would make Coty No. 1 perfume and hair care companyBy Astrid WendlandtPARIS, June 16 Coty is on track to acquire Procter & Gamble's  beauty business in a $12 billion deal that would make the U.S. cosmetic company the world leader in perfume and hair care, sources close to the matter said.If the deal goes though, Coty would get its hands on brands such as Gucci and Hugo Boss perfume, Wella and Clairol hair care products and Max Factor and Cover Girl make-up, part of its strategy to reverse its own declining sales trends.For P&G, the sale is part of a large plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world's No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands over the next two years.Last year, it sold its Duracell batteries to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion and sold some of its soap brands to Unilever Plc. Coty was vying with Henkel for P&G's hair care businesses and won an auction over the weekend, the sources said, adding that details of the complex transaction are likely to take at least two weeks to be finalised.For tax purposes, the deal would be completed through a ""Reverse Morris Trust"", which means that P&G would spin off its beauty assets into a separate company that would then absorb Coty in an all-share deal, the sources said.Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings, the billionaire Reimann family's investment firm which controls 75 percent of Coty, would own about a third of the equity in the combined business and about 47-48 percent of voting rights, the sources said.P&G, Coty and JAB Holdings declined to comment. SHARES SURGE In New York trade, Coty shares closed 19.3 percent higher and have gained about 50 percent this year. P&G shares rose 1.3 percent.Wells Fargo analyst Chris Ferrara said a deal would be ""transformational"" for Coty and estimated it would increase its revenue to nearly $11 billion from $4.4 billion. ""A large deal would likely give Coty the opportunity to quickly exit 'tail' (poorly performing) brands and sustainably raise the company's growth profile,"" Ferrara said.In response to lower sales, Coty has been cutting costs and shedding staff. It has also been through much organisational change, merging divisions and replacing chief executives three times in the past three years.Elio Sceti, who ran Europe's largest frozen foods company Iglo Foods Holdings and has no experience in the cosmetics industry, will become Coty's chief executive next month.Coty, which makes Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Chloe as well as celebrity perfumes, would become the world's No.1 perfume maker ahead of L'Oreal if the deal goes through, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.This would also mark its entry into the hair care market with the Wella and Clairol brands. In make-up, Coty, which has a significant presence in Britain and France, would gain a much bigger stronghold in the United States.JAB controls fashion brands Bally and Belstaff, shoe maker Jimmy Choo and coffee company D.E Master Blenders 1753, which is set to merge with the coffee business of Mondelez International.

180,"  (Corrects figures on Publicis contract wins, paragraph 13)* WPP's Sorrell says trading tough this year* Publicis' Levy say account reviews offer risk, opportunity* Ad market forecast to grow around 4.2 pct this yearBy Leila AbboudCANNES, June 26 The reluctance of big companies to spend at a time of lacklustre global growth and fewer major sporting events this year are dampening demand for advertising, said the chief executives of two leading ad agencies.In separate interviews on Friday, Martin Sorrell of WPP  and Maurice Levy of Publicis sounded cautious about the prospects for the advertising market, citing a lack of vibrancy in the U.S economy, weakness in Brazil, Russia and China, and Europe's continued fragility.""There is a lot of uncertainty,"" Levy told Reuters. ""Companies have cash to spend but are not in the mood to do so, and consumers are not feeling confident either.""Research firm Zenith Optimedia, owned by Publicis, recently cut its growth forecast for the global advertising market to 4.2 percent down from 4.9 percent earlier this year. For his part, Sorrell said that the major companies served by WPP agencies such as Ogilvy and Mather and Group M were very focused on cost controls, sometimes to the detriment of long-term investment in their brands and products.""Business is tough. Clients are very demanding in an environment where top-line growth is lower than it was before the financial crisis began,"" he said.UP FOR GRABS  Against that backdrop, the world's top six ad agencies face upheaval because an unprecedented $27 billion in media buying and planning contracts are up for review in the coming months at companies including Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble  and L'Oreal.That is requiring them to defend some major contracts, while trying to steal others from rivals.Morgan Stanley estimated that Publicis was the most exposed, with 1.7 percent of sales at risk and 2.5 percent of earnings per share. It is defending seven contracts including P&G, General Mills, Twenty-First Century Fox and Coca-Cola.For WPP, about 1.1 percent of revenue and 1.6 percent of earnings per share are risk as it seeks to keep nine contracts including Volkswagen and Unilever. Both Sorrell and Levy claimed the reviews were an opportunity to win business, while acknowledging that the fees would be lower on the new deals than the old ones.""The reviews are worrying for the agencies but their effects will also be felt on media owners because the price of ads will fall further,"" Levy predicted, referring to TV broadcasters, print outlets, and radio.Levy said Publicis had already won one contract with beauty products maker Coty with billings of $100 million and another with coffee specialist Keurig worth $150 million.""If we lose all our current contracts and win none of the new ones we're going for then our sales could drop 2 percent,"" said Levy.""But if we defend everything and win all the new ones, then they could go up as much as 3 percent.""Sorrell said that WPP's plan was to stress its technology and data expertise in pitches to clients. WPP has made a big bet on data with its Kantar unit, which Sorrell argues offers a competitive advantage although a lower margin business.""We are differentiated from our competitors and that will help in the reviews,"" he said.

182,"   By Astrid Wendlandt and Siddharth Cavale  Coty Inc (COTY.N), the U.S. maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfume, will buy Procter & Gamble's (PG.N) perfume, hair care and make-up businesses for $12.5 billion in the biggest cosmetics merger in recent history.Coty would become the No. 1 perfume maker ahead of L'Oreal (OREP.PA) and No. 3 make-up provider behind its French rival and Estee Lauder (EL.N). It would run the perfume licenses of Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana as well as make-up brands Cover Girl and Max Factor, more than doubling its size with combined sales of more than $10 billion.The deal comes as Coty's sales across categories have either been stagnating or declining for more than two years while P&G has been struggling to expand its beauty business.Coty shares fell 4.6 percent, while P&G slipped 0.4 percent as investors questioned the benefits of the mega-merger. ""We are getting critical mass around the globe with access to key markets such as Brazil, Japan and Mexico,"" Coty Chairman and Chief Executive Bart Becht said in an interview on Thursday.Analysts said the mass beauty brands Coty is set to acquire is expected to do well in emerging markets due to low pricing but the company has to invest in new initiatives to revive growth in developed markets.""The deal is extremely transformative for Coty, but investors are uncertain of what this means for the company,"" retail research firm Conlumino's Chief Executive Neil Saunders said. The debt Coty will assume, fairly small savings and questions on how it will cope with the transition make investors nervous, he said.Coty said the deal would save $550 million, including $400 million in non-transferred overhead costs, but take on $2.9 billion of P&G Beauty' debt.But Coty's stock is still up about 17 percent from before Reuters' June 8 report that it was fighting rivals such as Henkel for P&G's beauty business and had submitted a bid for the P&G assets. The sale is part of P&G's plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world's No. 1 household products maker said last year it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands.The 43 brands being sold generated sales of $5.9 billion, or 7 percent of P&G's total revenue in fiscal 2013/14, and adjusted income of $1.15 billion.By taking on P&G's hair brands Wella and Clairol, Coty is entering a whole new business, which ranked No. 2 in terms of market share.On a call with analysts, P&G said it prefers to execute the deal through a ""Reverse Morris Trust"" split off transaction in which its shareholders could exchange P&G shares for those of Coty and the new beauty businesses.However, if it is executed as a split-merge, P&G would establish a separate entity to hold these beauty brands which would be transferred to electing P&G shareholders in a tax efficient transaction. There will also be a simultaneous merger of the new entity with Coty. P&G said it expects to close the deal in the second half of calendar 2016 pending regulatory approvals.P&G shareholders would own 52 percent of the combined business while Coty's existing shareholders will own 48 percent.Coty shareholder JAB Holdings, the Luxemburg investment company of the billionaire German Reimann family, will own a third of the combined entity.  BECHT'S BETCoty has gone through a painful three-year reorganization with departures by many top executives and marketing veterans. Becht, who will be running the combined business, said Coty would take on all of P&G's Wella and Clairol management teams as Coty had no experience in that sector.The company expects hair color products to account for 24 percent of total sales after the deal was completed.P&G's 10,000 employees will join Coty's 9,000, Becht said.      P&G's beauty chief Patrice Louvet will not be part of the new entity, Becht noted.

190,"  (Adds details, updates shares)By Siddharth CavaleJuly 9 Coty Inc has sealed a deal to buy Procter & Gamble Co's beauty business, which includes brands such as Clairol and Wella, in a $12.5 billion transaction that will make Coty the world leader in perfume and hair care.Coty's shares fell 6 percent in early trading after the widely expected deal, while P&G was up 0.6 percent.In a tax-efficient deal designed as a ""Reverse Morris Trust"" transaction, P&G will separate 43 of its cosmetics, fragrance and haircare brands and fold them into Coty.The deal is a game-changer for Coty as it adds popular brands such as Wella and Clairol hair color products and Cover Girl and Max Factor make-up to its portfolio of perfume brands that include Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein. Coty will also gain access to Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana perfumes as part of the deal.For P&G, the sale is part of a plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world's No. 1 household products maker said last year it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands.The combined company is expected to have annual revenue of more than $10 billion - double Coty's turnover - and will be led by Coty CEO Bart Becht. Coty, which is trying to staunch a decline in sales, said it expects hair color products to account for 24 percent of total sales after the deal is completed.Coty said it expects to generate about $4.5 billion in annual sales from its fragrance business, making it the world's largest fragrance company by sales.It also expects to become the third largest brand in the color and cosmetics sector, behind L'Oreal and Estee Lauder. JAB Cosmetics B.V. owns 97 percent of Coty's Class B shares is in favor of the deal, Coty said. JAB is controlled by Germany's billionaire Reimann family.Coty said the deal valued the P&G Beauty Business at $12.5 billion at the time of the proposal. Based on Coty's current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion, P&G said.P&G estimated a one-time gain of $5 billion-$7 billion,  depending on the final deal value at the time of closing.Reuters first reported in June that Coty was on track to acquire P&G's brands in a $12 billion deal.Goldman Sachs advised P&G, while Morgan Stanley was the lead adviser for Coty.

192,"   By Astrid Wendlandt | PARIS  PARIS Coty Inc's boss Bart Becht believes he is the right man to run what will become the world's biggest perfume maker, despite industry doubts over its planned mega-merger and faltering sales at the beauty products group.With Coty due to gobble up Procter & Gamble's beauty business for $12.5 billion, Becht has no intention of seeking anyone else to lead the expanded group where he is both chairman and chief executive following a series of high-level departures.""As you know, there has been a lot of changes at Coty over the past 12 to 18 months ... so the board asked me to stay to oversee the transaction,"" Becht told Reuters after the P&G deal was announced last week. The 58-year-old Dutchman said it was possible the group, founded in Paris and New York-based, could hire a new leader in the future but there was no time frame for that now.Becht, who jointly runs a Luxembourg holding company that is Coty's biggest shareholder, knows how to merge big businesses. He tied up Dutch-based Benckiser with Britain's Reckitt & Colman in 1999 and ran the combined chemicals and consumer goods group for more than a decade.Under him, Reckitt Benckiser grew in value from 3 billion to 23.5 billion pounds, helped by two major acquisitions. Its shares rose more than four-fold over a decade.Coty, the maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfumes, has at times proved a tougher proposition since Becht became chairman in 2011 to prepare for a stock market flotation. After its New York debut in 2013, the share price stagnated and at times was significantly lower until late autumn last year.Still, Becht's cuts to marketing departments and expenses in general lifted profits, and the stock eventually responded. It rose more than 60 percent in the eight months to June, when news broke that the P&G deal was afoot.But since peaking at $32 in early July just before the merger was officially announced, it has lost 15 percent as the forecast earnings boost was smaller than expected and investors were concerned the deal would take more than a year to complete.NUMBERS MAN While Becht is known in the industry for his cost-cutting abilities, he has a stronger record in managing fast-moving consumer goods such as Woolite soap than high-end perfumes.""Becht is a numbers man, an efficient operator and a great deal-maker but he is not a person with a particularly strong luxury sensitivity,"" said one former senior Coty manager who worked with him for several years.Under Becht, who is personally Coty's seventh biggest shareholder, the group has become one of the industry's worst performers in terms of sales. These fell 2.1 percent in the year to June 30, 2014 while Estee Lauder's revenue grew 8 percent in the same period and L'Oreal's like-for-like sales rose 3.7 percent in calendar 2014.Becht has also made pay-offs to three chief executives - two who departed and one who never arrived. A week before frozen foods manager Elio Leoni Sceti was due to start on July 1, Becht told him not to come, allowing the Dutchman to handle the merger in both top jobs. Sceti got $1.75 million in compensation. Coty, which was once associated with the early 20th century inventor of modern perfumery Francois Coty, highlights the dangers of putting profits before creativity and innovation - a recipe for disaster in terms of sales growth.Some analysts say the future looks difficult. ""Valuation could decline if Coty does not improve organic sales growth in the base business ... and CEO Bart Becht did not offer solid arguments why, and in what timeframe, this deal would enhance organic sales growth,"" said Linda Bolton Weiser at broker B. Riley & Co. Weiser, who kept a ""sell"" rating on Coty stock, cited uncertainty over how long Becht would stay and whether the company could eventually find a super-star to manage this ""beauty beast"" - the P&G deal will double Coty's size, creating a group with more than $10 billion in annual sales. Coty, which makes Rimmel mascara, will run P&G's make-up brands Cover Girl and Max Factor as well as its perfume licenses with fashion brands Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana. It will also enter a new category with P&G's Wella and Clairol hair treatment brands.NO GROWTH Many of Coty's big perfume brands such as Calvin Klein have lost market share and quarterly revenue has either fallen or stagnated for more than two years.P&G's beauty businesses have performed little better. This year, sales of its fragrance brands are down and make-up brands flat, while its hair business is modestly growing, sources close to the deal said. Coty and P&G declined to confirm the trends. Becht said the merger would not create growth overnight but would generate $550 million in savings and boost future profits and earnings per share - on which his long-term incentive plan is based.After waves of job losses, Coty employees fear further cuts once the deal goes through, according to people at the company. Restructuring has created a climate of fear ""which is not very good for creativity"", said one person still at Coty.This worries analysts. ""One of my concerns is how Coty will retain and attract talent,"" said Mark Astrachan, analyst at broker Stifel.Bernd Beetz, who led Coty for 11 years, departed as CEO less than a year after Becht arrived. Beetz was known for empowering staff, making them take risks and come up with innovative marketing campaigns and products, former and current Coty managers said, declining to be named.""When Beetz left, the whole company was in mourning,"" said a former top Coty executive who left for a rival firm.Beetz's successor Michele Scannavini also left in September last year, putting Becht firmly in the executive seat. Recent casualties have included the chief marketing officer and fragrance marketing director.Renato Semerari, president of categories and innovation, quit Coty and now heads Italian fashion brand Roberto Cavalli. Becht acknowledges he focused too hard on short-term profits after the IPO. ""Yes, I agree,"" he told Reuters last month. ""But we restored profitability by cutting non-strategic cost and now we have the flexibility to reinvest back into the business.""MASS VERSUS LUXURY Last year Becht merged Coty's mass and prestige divisions although they have different objectives: one to give consumers value for money, the other to sell a dream in a bottle. Becht believes in the fast-moving consumer goods model which worked at Reckitt, involving high volumes, low cost and reasonable margins. This may not work for high-end cosmetics, analysts say, where shops are more carefully selected to protect image, limiting volumes. Also, marketing costs are higher but so are prices and margins.Coty does not fully exploit its heritage, unlike many other luxury brands. For example, Henri Coty, grandson of the company's founder, failed to persuade Coty to re-launch historic perfumes such as L'Origan.Francois Coty, a descendant of Napoleon, was one of France's richest men who owned Figaro newspaper and made his fortune in building fragrance factories, flower fields and collaborating with crystal bottle makers such as Baccarat and glass designer Rene Lalique. STRUGGLING LUXURY  Becht is one of three people who run JAB Holdings, the firm that manages the fortune of the German billionaire Reimann family, inherited from Benckiser. JAB owns 75 percent of Coty and will hold a third of the enlarged business, with P&G shareholders taking 52 percent.""For me, part of the problem is that JAB has been meddling too much with Coty's business,"" said one of the merger's many advisers.  JAB has a checkered history with creative types. Shortly after it bought Jimmy Choo in 2011, it parted ways with Tamara Mellon, who was the soul of its fashion success. Several of JAB's luxury brands are struggling. British jacket brand Belstaff has not stopped haemorrhaging cash since JAB bought the firm in 2011. When it will become profitable remains unclear, industry sources close to JAB said. Swiss leather goods brand Bally is just starting to turn itself around about eight years after being acquired by JAB.

""When Beetz left, the whole company was in mourning,"" said a former top Coty executive who left for a rival firm.Beetz's successor Michele Scannavini also left in September last year, putting Becht firmly in the executive seat. Recent casualties have included the chief marketing officer and fragrance marketing director.Renato Semerari, president of categories and innovation, quit Coty and now heads Italian fashion brand Roberto Cavalli.Becht acknowledges he focused too hard on short-term profits after the IPO. ""Yes, I agree,"" he told Reuters last month. ""But we restored profitability by cutting non-strategic cost and now we have the flexibility to reinvest back into the business.""MASS VERSUS LUXURY Last year Becht merged Coty's mass and prestige divisions although they have different objectives: one to give consumers value for money, the other to sell a dream in a bottle.Becht believes in the fast-moving consumer goods model which worked at Reckitt, involving high volumes, low cost and reasonable margins. This may not work for high-end cosmetics, analysts say, where shops are more carefully selected to protect image, limiting volumes. Also, marketing costs are higher but so are prices and margins.Coty does not fully exploit its heritage, unlike many other luxury brands. For example, Henri Coty, grandson of the company's founder, failed to persuade Coty to re-launch historic perfumes such as L'Origan.Francois Coty, a descendant of Napoleon, was one of France's richest men who owned Figaro newspaper and made his fortune in building fragrance factories, flower fields and collaborating with crystal bottle makers such as Baccarat and glass designer Rene Lalique.STRUGGLING LUXURY Becht is one of three people who run JAB Holdings, the firm that manages the fortune of the German billionaire Reimann family, inherited from Benckiser. JAB owns 75 percent of Coty and will hold a third of the enlarged business, with P&G shareholders taking 52 percent.""For me, part of the problem is that JAB has been meddling too much with Coty's business,"" said one of the merger's many advisers.JAB has a chequered history with creative types. Shortly after it bought Jimmy Choo in 2011, it parted ways with Tamara Mellon, who was the soul of its fashion success.Several of JAB's luxury brands are struggling. British jacket brand Belstaff has not stopped haemorrhaging cash since JAB bought the firm in 2011. When it will become profitable remains unclear, industry sources close to JAB said. Swiss leather goods brand Bally is just starting to turn itself around about eight years after being acquired by JAB.

200,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Dena Aubin | BOSTON  BOSTON Venezuela's currency woes cut nearly $3 billion in profit at U.S. blue-chip companies during the second quarter and prompted Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) to remove its operations in the South American country from its consolidated financial reports.More so-called deconsolidation moves and exits from Venezuela are likely to happen during the second half of the year as U.S. corporations grow increasingly frustrated with Venezuela's sinking Bolivar currency, according to analysts and U.S. regulatory filings.Deconsolidating Venezuelan operations means that business can largely no longer hurt or benefit a U.S. parent company's financial results. Often companies are taking a big one-time charge so that they can ring-fence what is left in Venezuela.Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O), for example, said they also may deconsolidate their Venezuela operations if economic conditions in that country worsen, according to U.S. regulatory filings made this week.And Mattel Inc (MAT.O) said it may cease operations in Venezuela altogether if volatility in Venezuela worsens. With slumping crude oil prices and debt payments coming due this year, the Venezuelan government has fewer U.S. dollar reserves available to meet the private sector’s demands. As a result, entities may have a harder time obtaining U.S. dollars than any time since currency controls were first implemented in 2003, Ernst & Young said in an April report.  Jack Ciesielski, president of investment research firm R.G. Associates, said if conditions do not improve in Venezuela, he expects to see more companies follow P&G’s lead. “I’d say the die has been cast,” he said. Drug maker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) took a $715 million second-quarter hit against profit after it revalued its Venezuela assets using a less preferential exchange rate. But the biggest impact from Venezuela's currency woes came from Procter & Gamble. The world's largest consumer products maker on Thursday announced a $2.1 billion charge against earnings, reflecting the company's inability to convert Venezuela's currency or pay dividends.   Beginning in the third quarter, P&G will exclude the operating results of its Venezuelan subsidiaries from its consolidated financial statements.Hits to U.S. corporate profits in Venezuela accelerated in February when the President Nicolas Maduro devalued the bolivar by 70 percent via a new currency system known as Simadi. Previously, many U.S. companies valued their monetary and non-monetary assets at the most preferred rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar. But under Simadi, the exchange rate has been around 200 bolivars.

""The bad news this year comes from Brazil and it is there to stay because the crisis is structural,"" Agon told the French daily.Agon predicted sales growth of the global cosmetics market would be 3.5-4 percent in 2015, of the same order as last year and with which L'Oreal's underlying sales growth was in line.""But it (the group's sales growth) will be higher in the second half thanks to the expected pick-up at our mass market division and which will continue in 2016,"" Agon told Le Figaro. Agon told the paper that online sales, up 40 percent in the first half, now represented around 4-5 percent of L'Oreal's total revenue.""E-commerce is a an activity with good profitability, with low costs,"" Agon said.Agon declined to say if L'Oreal would try to lure Gucci's perfume licence from Coty, which just acquired it from Procter & Gamble as part of a $12.5 billion deal.""This is great news,"" Agon told the paper about the transaction.

210,"  (Updates with economists raising Q2 growth estimates)* Factory orders increase 1.8 percent in June* Gain in core capital goods orders lowered to 0.7 percent* Shipments of core capital goods revised to show increaseBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Aug 4 New orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded strongly in June on robust demand for transportation equipment and other goods, a hopeful sign for the struggling manufacturing sector.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.8 percent after declining 1.1 percent in May.""We are moving past the very weak period for the manufacturing sector from early on this year, but that activity has yet to meaningfully increase,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Factory activity has been stymied by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year's sharp plunge in crude oil prices. Tepid global demand also has weighed on manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy. Those factors have eroded the profits of multinational companies like Caterpillar Inc, Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, and Whirlpool Corp, the global home appliances giant.Though there are signs that the energy spending drag is easing, the dollar's strength will likely remain a constraint. The dollar has gained 15 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.Stocks on Wall Street were little changed, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. The dollar was largely flat against a basket of currencies.Orders for transportation equipment surged 9.3 percent in June, reflecting a 65.4 percent jump in aircraft bookings. There were increases in orders for machinery, furniture, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, appliances and components.SOLID INVENTORIES The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - increased 0.7 percent instead of the 0.9 percent rise reported last month. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.3 percent in June. Shipments were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent.Manufacturing inventories increased a solid 0.6 percent, which was more than the government assumed in its second-quarter GDP snapshot published last week.Coming on the heels of a report on Monday showing stronger construction spending in May and April than previously reported, economists said the sturdy increase in factory inventories suggested that second-quarter GDP could be revised to as high as a 3 percent annual pace.The Commerce Department reported last Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.3 percent pace in the second quarter. It will publish its second GDP estimate for that quarter later this month.In the wake of the construction data, economists had said they expected second-quarter growth would be raised by at least four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace. They forecast factory inventories adding another 0.3 percentage point.But with the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, compared to 1.30 last September, manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters.""It also highlights the probability that an unwinding of this stockpiling will almost assuredly result in a drag on GDP growth in the second half of the year,"" Tim Quinlin, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

211,"  (Adds comments, details on valuation, updates share prices)By Jonathan Stempel, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Sweta SinghAug 10 Warren Buffett is paying a hefty price for the biggest bet of his career as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has agreed to buy Precision Castparts Corp, valuing the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion.The purchase is Berkshire's largest, and accelerates its transformation from a company largely dependent on insurance businesses into one resembling the broader U.S. economy, including a railroad, several industrial companies, utilities, a car dealership and consumer goods businesses.It also joins several recent Buffett forays into unglamorous sectors, including a big stake Kraft Heinz Co and the pending takeover of the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble Co.Berkshire has said it owned 3 percent of Precision Castparts prior to Monday's takeover. Precision Castparts earned $1.53 billion in its latest fiscal year.""I'm not crazy about paying $30 billion for a $1.5 billion earnings stream of a cyclical company supplying airplane makers,"" said Jeff Matthews, a principal at hedge fund Ram Partners and author of a book about Buffett. ""I'd keep the $30 billion and wait for the next crisis.""Known for buying undervalued and often unloved companies, Buffett acknowledged paying a steep price for Precision Castparts, which has been hurt by falling oil and gas prices.""This is a very high multiple for us to pay,"" he told CNBC television.Berkshire is paying $235 per share for Precision Castparts, which represents a 21.2 percent premium over Friday's closing price, and 17.5 times projected 12-month profit. It valued Precision Castparts at $37.2 billion including debt.The merger eclipses Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's $26.5 billion purchase in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad that it did not already own.In afternoon trading, Precision Castparts shares rose $37.13, or 19.2 percent, to $231.01. Berkshire's Class A shares fell $522.76, or 0.2 percent, to $214,940. 'CREDIT TO TODD COMBS' The latest purchase shows how hard it is to move the needle at Berkshire, whose own stock has lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last five years and which on Friday posted quarterly operating profit well below analyst forecasts.Adding Precision Castparts would boost Berkshire's overall operating profit by less than 10 percent.It would also give Berkshire ownership of 10 companies that standing alone could be part of the Fortune 500, plus 26.9 percent of Kraft Heinz.Todd Combs, one of Buffett's investment managers, had begun buying Precision Castparts shares in 2012. ""You've got to give credit to Todd Combs for this deal,"" said Buffett, who turns 85 on August 30. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965.Precision Castparts generates 70 percent of sales by making nuts, bolts and other fittings for the aerospace industry, where booming commercial aircraft demand has led Airbus Group SE  and Boeing Co to boost production.But the Portland, Oregon-based company also makes parts for the energy industry, which has struggled as oil prices   have fallen by more than half over the last year.Prior to Monday, Precision Castparts' shares had fallen 20 percent in 2015, and the purchase price is below the shares' 52-week high of $249.05 set last September.Even so, analysts said Berkshire is paying more than 12 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That's above the 9 multiple for BNSF, which now generates more than one-fifth of Berkshire's operating profit.""At the time of his Burlington Northern deal, everyone criticized he paid too high a price,"" said Ken Shubin Stein, founder of Spencer Capital Management in New York. MORE DEALMAKING? Precision Castparts would become a unit of Berkshire, keeping its name and management as well as its headquarters.""We see a unique alignment between Warren's management and investment philosophy and how we manage PCC for the long term,"" Chief Executive Mark Donegan said in a statement.Andrew Carolus, managing director at Mesirow Financial Investment Banking in Chicago, said Buffett is ""obviously a believer"" in Precision Castparts' prospects ""over the next five to six decades.""Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York, added that having access to Berkshire's balance sheet could help Precision Castparts do more dealmaking, ""which the management has proven they're good at.""Other industrial companies that Buffett has bought in the last decade include toolmaker Iscar, parts maker Marmon, and specialty chemicals company Lubrizol.Buffett said Berkshire would spend $23 billion of cash to finance the Precision Castparts purchase, and borrow the rest.While that would leave Berkshire with more than $40 billion of cash, twice the cushion Buffett wants, Buffett said it would be at least a year before he could pursue another ""elephant"" sized transaction.Kraft Heinz has proven among his most successful. Buffett has in two years transformed what he has called a $9.5 billion investment in the former H.J. Heinz Co into a Kraft Heinz stake worth roughly $25.5 billion.The Castparts merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Credit Suisse and the law firms Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Stoel Rives advised Precision Castparts. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

212,"  (Adds details, Rospotrebnadzor and P&G responses)By Maria KiselyovaAug 25 Russia's consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said it had asked retailers to withdraw some batches of detergents made by foreign companies including Henkel & Co and Procter & Gamble as they did not meet toxicological safety criteria.German retailer Metro AG said on Tuesday that its cash-and-carry stores in Russia had removed some cleaning and cosmetic products from their shelves on Rospotrebnadzor's orders.Russia banned many food imports from the European Union and the United States last year in retaliation to their sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine conflict. Russia expanded the list of countries this year and restricted flower imports from the Netherlands, citing health risks.The extent of the withdrawal of foreign detergents, including those made by Colgate-Palmolive and Clorox Co , was not immediately clear. Russian media said only some products were affected rather than entire product lines.Rospotrebnadzor said on Tuesday that it was conducting tests on household chemicals and detergents made by other companies, but it did not elaborate. The watchdog is carrying out an unscheduled inspection of Henkel's plant in Russia after reaching an agreement with the prosecutor general's office, an official at Rospotrebnadzor's Perm branch told Reuters. The results are expected in four days at the earliest, the official said.Henkel's spokeswoman Natalia Ovakimian said the company was aware of the inspections, which were linked to the regulator's earlier order to withdraw some of its detergent products from retail chains. Clorox spokeswoman Aileen Zerrudo said the company did not ""actively market cleaning products in Russia,"" but might have sold a ""small amount of products"" to a distributor.""In countries where we don't operate but have permitted distribution of our products, we work with distributors to ensure regulations are met,"" she said, adding that Clorox would conduct a ""thorough assessment of this matter.""P&G said it was seeking to work with the Rospotrebnadzor to resolve the matter as soon as possible.Russia's home care market is valued at 188.54 billion rubles ($2.74 billion), according to Euromonitor. P&G has a 27.4 percent share of the market, with Henkel holding 16.3 percent.

P&G expects organic sales growth ""to further strengthen in the back half,"" Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said pricing was expected to be a ""bigger driver"" of sales this year.

""They've missed huge trends,"" Levy said, notably a move to online shopping and the launch of new diaper products in China.  P&G, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from markets outside North America, reported its seventh straight quarter of sales decline as demand fell further across product categories and a strong dollar eroded international sales.Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency, divestitures and acquisitions, fell 1 percent in the first quarter.RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi also expressed concerns over P&G's margin expansion and a fall in volumes, which he said suggested that the company was not spending enough to attract customers at a time when rivals were gaining market share.

The company also said last week it would acquire the cosmetics unit of Brazil's Hypermarcas SA to beef up distribution of the brands it will buy from Procter & Gamble in Brazil.Coty's perfumes, sold mostly at retailers such as Wal-Mart , are losing their appeal as they are available widely. Consumers are also seeking out more niche perfumes rather than the company's celebrity-branded perfumes. Coty said on Thursday it was on track to close its P&G deal in the second half of 2016 and that the financing structure for the deal was in place.Sales from perfumes fell 8 percent, while those from skin & body care fell 1 percent in the first quarter, on a comparable basis, which excludes special items such as foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions.Net income attributable to Coty rose to $125.7 million, or 34 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $10.6 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier.

223,"  (Adds manufacturing data, analyst comments, updates markets)* Weekly jobless claims decline 11,000* Mid-Atlantic factory activity contracts in December* Current account deficit increases 11.7 percent in Q3By Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Dec 17 The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell from a five-month high, suggesting sustained labor market healing that could lead to further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes next year.The sign of underlying economic strength came a day after the U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, the first increase in nearly a decade.""The labor market continues to stay tight with demand for workers strong and pockets of actual shortages in many industries. The Fed has achieved the employment part of its dual mandate and this is what triggered the rates liftoff yesterday,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended Dec. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday.It was the 41st straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with strong labor market conditions. That is the longest such run since the early 1970s. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 250 to 270,500 last week.The Fed said in its policy statement on Wednesday that there had been ""further improvement"" in the labor market and that ""underutilization of labor resources"" had diminished appreciably since the beginning of the year.Despite the labor market momentum, there remains no respite for the manufacturing sector, which has been slammed by a robust dollar, deep spending cuts by energy firms, weak global demand and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut.A separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its gauge of manufacturing activity in the region fell to -5.9 this month from 1.9 in November. It was the third negative reading in the past four months.Factories in the mid-Atlantic region reported that new orders continued to decline this month, though there was an increase in shipments. Order books shrunk, while inventories  increased for the first time in four months. ""The intense headwinds facing the U.S. manufacturing sector  continue to linger,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.A survey early this month showed manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, contracted in November for the first time in three years. The weak Philadelphia Fed survey brought it in line with other regional surveys that have been mired in contractionary territory.U.S. stocks fell, while the dollar jumped to a fresh two-week high against a basket of currencies. U.S. government debt prices rose. JOBS MARKET STRENGTH The claims data covered the survey period for December nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims dipped 500 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting another strong month of job gains. Payrolls increased by 211,000 in November.""We expect a 200,000 December nonfarm payroll increase, with limited upside risk from a tight claims path,"" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado.Dollar strength, which has eroded exports and the profits of multinational corporations, helped to push the current account deficit in the third quarter to its highest level in nearly seven years, another report from the Commerce Department showed.The current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased 11.7 percent to $124.1 billion, the largest shortfall since the fourth quarter of 2008.The current account was also pressured by an increase in remittances, government grants and pensions, and dividend payments to foreign individuals and entities.The deficit represented 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, the biggest share since the second quarter of 2012, up from 2.5 percent in the second quarter. The current account shortfall, however, is not a problem as the United States continues to attract ample income from overseas.""With rates of return in foreign economies likely to remain depressed for the foreseeable future, we look for the dollar to strengthen further in the coming quarters,"" said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-12-17,PG,"Thu Dec 17, 2015 | 11:40am EST","WRAPUP 2-U.S. labor market strengthening, factories struggling",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1460ZV20151217?type=companyNews

226,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON A slew of major  U.S. corporations are likely to announce in the next few weeks whether they will take big writedowns for their troubled Venezuela operations, and some may say they are leaving the country altogether. The companies may decide to slash the valuations of their businesses and take charges based on declines in some of the  oil producing nation’s four exchange rates for the bolivar currency, of which three are official and one black market, and then deconsolidate the operations on their balance sheets, Wall Street securities analysts said.They may have more reason to accelerate the process after the socialist government on Friday declared a 60-day economic emergency, which would give President Nicolas Maduro wider powers to intervene in companies or limit access to already scarce dollars in Venezuela.It also disclosed that the nation’s economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year while the official annual inflation rate was the world’s highest at 141.5 percent in that period, as plunging oil prices, and what critics of Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.    Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.    The Reuters analysis shows that U.S. companies with exposure could face total writedowns of more than $3 billion if they revalue their assets in Venezuela using the less preferential Simadi exchange rate of nearly 200 bolivars to the dollar. In the past, many companies valued their assets using the main official rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar.     But even that change may not reveal the full extent of the problem given that the black market exchange rate has worsened to about 878 bolivars to the dollar from about 190 bolivars a year ago, according to dolartoday.com, a website that tracks the rate.        MONITORING DAY-BY-DAY     Increased government regulations and lack of access to U.S. dollars at lower rates could force companies such as Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co to deconsolidate if they lose further control over their operations. Goodyear said in recent financial disclosures that a deconsolidation move would trigger a one-time, pre-tax charge of more than $500 million and what it termed “derecognition” of $293 million of cash on its balance sheet. Goodyear was not immediately available for comment. At a Jan. 12 investor conference, Goodyear Chief Financial Officer Laura Thompson described Venezuela as “a very volatile environment.”“The outlook is pretty uncertain. Our visibility is unclear, but we continue to monitor the situation day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter, as we go,” Thompson said.Deconsolidation under U.S. accounting rules allow companies to treat a subsidiary in a volatile foreign market as an investment rather than an operating unit, while writing down the market value of that subsidiary largely insulates the parent company from future hits to its financial results.So far, blue-chip companies that have deconsolidated in Venezuela and written off nearly all of their investment there include Procter & Gamble Co, Pepsico Inc and Ford Motor Co. Among those who have departed altogether is cleaning products maker Clorox Co.One major pressure point could be drug companies. Abbott Laboratories, Abbvie Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Pfizer Inc and Zoetis Inc have about $1.8 billion in combined net monetary assets exposed to the bolivar, recent U.S. regulatory filings show.Zoetis, which declined to comment for this story, began scaling back operations in Venezuela several months ago, executives have said previously. Pfizer, Merck and Abbvie did not return messages seeking comment. Abbott declined to comment.These companies’ preferential access to dollars at the official exchange rate has become more difficult, even as the government has made availability of drugs a priority. But the economic crisis has worsened so much that now less business is being done at the official rate, even for essential food and medicine.The government also has another lower official rate known as the Sicad rate – that has been at around 13 bolivars to the dollar – but there are also very few dollars available at that rate. The last Sicad auction was in September.    Meanwhile, it is not uncommon for U.S. companies to have currency exchange settlements pending with the Venezuelan government for years, U.S. regulatory filings show.SUSPENDED SHIPMENTS Other companies selling sensitive products, such as baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, have had to adjust their practices because of constraints placed by the Venezuelan government on the release of U.S. dollars to repatriate cash back to the United States. Mead suspended shipments to Venezuela temporarily, the company said during an October investor day presentation. The company was not available for comment.Consumer products maker Newell Rubbermaid Inc has been identified by some Wall Street analysts as the next major U.S. company that will likely take action to protect itself from Venezuela's crumbling economy.""We continue to view a deconsolidation (in Venezuela) as a likely event"" when Newell reports fourth-quarter results on Jan 29, analysts at Jefferies Companies said last week in a research note.If Newell were to deconsolidate it would take a one-time charge of $111 million, according to company commentary in recent U.S. regulatory filings. Newell declined to comment for this story.Such a move would largely protect the company from taking further Venezuela-related hits to its financial results in the future.Among U.S. companies, Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International Inc has one of the largest remaining exposures to Venezuela, with $617 million in net assets, according to the Reuters analysis of corporate disclosures.""We would expect to provide an update on Venezuela and other markets when we announce our (fourth quarter) earnings on Feb. 3, but I’m not able to provide comment before that time due to quiet period,” said Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens.Besides Newell and Goodyear, 3M Co, Colgate Palmolive Co and Herbalife Ltd have at least raised the specter of insulating their financial results from Venezuela.

The price hikes helped it boost organic sales in the latest quarter, but led to a drop in volumes across all businesses.P&G also posted a better-than-expected profit by cutting costs, sending its shares up 2.5 percent to $78.79 on Tuesday, outperforming the broader consumer staples index .SPLRCS.""Today's results, along with increased visibility of the new CEO David Taylor, could move the stock into the $80s in the coming months,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Chappell wrote in a note titled, 'Two percent organic growth a ""nice start"" for new CEO'. Taylor took the helm in November, in the middle of P&G's turnaround plan.P&G is selling unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Gillette, Pampers and Tide to revive sluggish growth, which analysts have blamed on the company's slow reaction to trends in top markets such as China.Taylor has the ability to correct the company's missteps, RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. P&G now expects to reduce non-manufacturing costs by 25-30 percent by 2016, a year ahead of schedule, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a conference call.Moeller said P&G would continue investing despite the strong dollar and expects media spend to increase in double-digits in the second half of 2016.The company, which gets nearly two-thirds of sales from outside North America, also said it would reduce its focus on unprofitable brands in India in favor of higher-margin products. P&G said the strong dollar reduced second-quarter sales by 9 percent and in 2016 expects it to reduce sales by 7 percentage points, more than the 5-6 percentage points it estimated earlier.Overall, full-year sales are still expected to decline in the high-single digits.P&G's second-quarter sales fell 8.5 percent to $16.92 billion, slightly below analysts average estimate.

Crude prices settled up 3.7 percent on hopes that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would tackle an unrelenting supply glut.With oil at 12-year lows and threatening to put higher-cost producers out of business, investors have been reeling from a turbulent start to the year that has left the S&P down 7 percent from the end of 2015.

249,"   By Jessica Dye  The U.S. Supreme Court will not review a federal appeals court decision that affirmed certification of five state-specific classes of customers who say they were duped by claims that Procter & Gamble's Align probiotic supplement boosted digestive health. The high court on Monday in a one-sentence order rejected the petition filed by P&G, which had argued that the classes should never have been certified because they lacked a common unifying question, and because there was no easy way to ascertain who qualified as a class member.

251,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A former cosmetics saleswoman for Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is suing the company, claiming that she was fired after becoming  pregnant and being told earlier by a supervisor that ""pregnancy is not part of the uniform.""The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday by Tiffany Kantrowitz, who for two years worked at P&G’s Dolce and Gabbana makeup shop inside Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. P&G has a licensing agreement to make and sell Dolce and Gabbana products, according to a company representative who declined to comment on the lawsuit. Neither Dolce and Gabbana nor Saks was named in the lawsuit. Kantrowitz says she was fired by P&G in February 2015 after asking to be allowed to sit down while dealing with customers because she was pregnant, in violation of the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act and a similar New York City law. Instead of accommodating Kantrowitz's request, the lawsuit said, P&G forced her to take breaks that were deducted from the leave time she was entitled to under the Family and Medical Leave Act. She says she planned to take leave only after her baby was born. ""For (P&G), ever vigilant about the image of its makeup shop sales associates, pregnancy did not comport with the 'perfect look,'"" the lawsuit said.Before she became pregnant, the suit said, Kantrowitz told a supervisor she wanted children and he responded that ""pregnancy is not part of the uniform."" When Kantrowitz was fired, the company told her it was because she had taken ""tester"" items for personal use, according to the lawsuit. But P&G encouraged its cosmetics staff to do so, the suit says, and never warned Kantrowitz against it during her time with the company. Pregnancy discrimination has been a top issue for groups that focus on employment protections for women, along with pay parity and wage increases in industries that employ disproportionate numbers of women. The issue received national attention last year, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N)  improperly denied a pregnant driver's request not to lift heavy packages. The court, in a 6-3 decision, said employers must offer legitimate business reasons to deny accommodations to pregnant employees, and cannot simply claim it would be expensive or inconvenient.The case is Kantrowitz v.

253,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette shaving products, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by cost-cutting and higher selling prices.However, P&G's sales declined for the seventh quarter in a row as higher prices weighed on volumes and as the company shrinks its vast product portfolio to focus on faster-growing brands such as Pampers diapers and Pantene shampoo.P&G's organic sales – sales excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency impact – increased 1 percent in the third quarter ended March 31.But, analysts have warned that the Cincinnati-based company's reliance on price hikes, rather than volume growth, to boost organic sales would be unsustainable.P&G continues to expect organic sales to rise in the low-single digits percentage range in the fiscal year ending June, but sales would be driven by volume rather than pricing in the next two to four quarters, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. The company, whose shares were down 0.5 percent at $80.94 in early trading, said it expects core earnings for the current quarter to be ""significantly lower"" than a year earlier due to increased advertising costs, a higher tax rate and negative currency impacts.P&G had lost market share as it has been slow to react to changing trends in key markets including China. But under Chief Executive David Taylor, who took over from A.G. Lafley in November, P&G has ramped up advertising spending to regain its footing.The company now expects full-year core earnings to fall 3-6 percent, compared with the decline of 3-8 percent it had estimated in January. Net income attributable to P&G jumped nearly 28 percent to $2.75 billion, or 97 cents per share in the latest quarter.Excluding items, it earned 86 cents per share, beating analysts average estimate of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.P&G's cost of goods sold fell by 11 percent. It raised prices, by an average of 1 percent, in four of its five businesses. The company said volumes fell in all businesses, except in the baby, feminine and family care business.

Markets see no chance of an interest rate increase at the meeting that is set to begin on Tuesday but have priced in a one-in-five chance of a hike at the meeting in June. Fed officials have repeatedly said a hike in June is on the cards.While job growth has continues to gain strength, inflation stubbornly remains below the Fed's 2 percent target.""Investors are focused on the Fed's language and especially their statements of the global and economic developments and to what degree those items pose risks,"" said Bill Merz, investment strategist at U.S. Bank.Investors will also assess earnings reports from major players such as Apple, AT&T and Ebay, which are due to report after the market close. First-quarter earnings from S&P 500 components are expected to have fallen 7.3 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 135 companies that have reported, 59 percent reported revenue above analyst expectations, just short of the average 60 percent since 2002.""Expectations are low and while companies are modestly beating them, the returns over the past couple of months have been due to multiple expansions and not fundamental growth and current prices are slightly high,"" said Merz.With the S&P 500 up in eight of the past 10 weeks and nearing the record high set almost a year ago, traders are struggling to find reasons to push it even higher as underwhelming earnings and the specter of higher interest rates hover over markets.At 10:54 a.m. ET (1454 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 24.93 points, or 0.14 percent, at 17,952.31, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,087.79 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.35 points, or 0.33 percent, at 4,879.44. Six of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy  and materials index's 0.7 percent rise leading the advancers.Oil prices were up about 2 percent due to a weaker dollar and hopes for an easing of the global oil glut.Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rebounded less than expected in March. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that orders for durable goods increased 0.8 percent last month, below the 1.8 percent rise expected by economists polled by Reuters.Adding to the day's pressure, the consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in April and came in below expectations.Shares of Apple were down 0.6 percent at $104.43. The world's largest public company is expected to report a fall in quarterly revenue on weakened demand for its smartphones.Whirlpool was down 5.6 percent at $175.60 after its profit missed expectations.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,941 to 872. On the Nasdaq, 1,323 issues rose and 1,247 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and 1 new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 new highs and 18 new lows.

Terms of Unilever's deal, announced late on Tuesday, were not disclosed. However, Fortune cited sources saying it is paying $1 billion in cash for the company, which sells razors and blades directly to consumers via online subscriptions . Unilever declined to comment on the report. Dollar Shave Club's turnover is expected to grow to over $200 million in 2016 from $152 million last year, Unilever said. Based on those figures, Unilever would be paying five times annual sales for Dollar Shave Club, higher than most U.S. consumer deals, which get done at below four times.Jefferies analysts said the deal gives Unilever 60 percent of the U.S. subscription ""shave club"" market, versus only 5 percent for P&G's Gillette, and 11 percent of the U.S. blades market overall.""Unilever are parking their tanks on P&G's lawn in one of their most profitable categories,"" Jefferies said, adding that the move risks potentially value-destroying retaliation. Unilever and Procter have a history of battle. In 2013, they fought a price war for haircare products that ate into margins. Dollar Shave Club founder Michael Dublin will continue to run the company after the deal closes, expected in the third quarter of 2016.THE BEST UNILEVER CAN GET?  The U.S. market for men's grooming products rose 4 percent last year to $8.5 billion, according to Euromonitor, fueled by online sales of men's shaving products which it said reached $342 million.    Analysts were divided on whether Unilever's purchase of Dollar Shave Club makes it more likely to go on to buy Edgewell which has brands including Schick and Edge. Canaccord Genuity analysts said they still see Edgewell as a further possible target, as Unilever would look to build scale, but Bernstein said it could just keep attacking Edgewell and Gillette without owning the manufacturing.This deal does, however, make Edgewell less attractive to other potential suitors such as Henkel (HNKG_p.DE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), Bernstein said, since they would have to compete with both P&G and Unilever.""This was a smart tactical move by Unilever in that it puts up barriers to others who might want to acquire Edgewell, while leaving it as an option to come back to and build scale,"" Bernstein said.

268,"  Duracell said it plans to close a battery-making plant in South Carolina that employs 430 people, making the announcement fewer than five months after being acquired by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.The shutdown of the Lancaster, South Carolina, plant, which made AA batteries, will begin in March and should be completed by the middle of 2019, Duracell said in a statement dated Wednesday.Duracell is consolidating its North American production of AA and AAA batteries into a plant in LaGrange, Georgia.""This was a very difficult decision,"" Robert Lorch, Duracell's president of global operations, said in a statement. ""We're taking this important step to position the Duracell business for growth."" Duracell said the move will lead to ""some"" job growth in LaGrange, which is about 330 miles (531 km) southwest of Lancaster, and that Lancaster workers will be encouraged to apply for work there.The company, which said it has about 3,000 employees, also makes C and D batteries in a plant in Cleveland, Tennessee. Berkshire acquired Bethel, Connecticut-based Duracell plus $1.8 billion of cash on Feb. 29 in exchange for about $4.2 billion of stock it held in Procter & Gamble Co, Duracell's former owner.Since 1965, Buffett has built Berkshire into a conglomerate with roughly 90 operating businesses employing more than 360,000 people. He prefers to leave day-to-day decision making, including job cuts, to executives who run those businesses. Kraft Heinz Co, which Berkshire and private equity firm 3G Capital created through acquisitions, has shed thousands of jobs under the 3G management team that runs the food company. Buffett has praised 3G's efforts.

291,"   By Jessica Kuruthukulangara and Siddharth Cavale  Beauty products maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, due to a slump in demand for its fragrances and color cosmetics, and said the slowdown in revenue would continue in the current quarter.The company's stock fell as much as 15.6 percent to $18.48 on Wednesday, a day after the U.S election, its lowest level since January last year.On a call with analysts, executives attributed the continuing sales weakness to distractions caused by the integration of Procter & Gamble Co's (PG.N) specialty beauty business, which Coty acquired for $12.5 billion.""People are not necessarily fully focused on the business ... they are in transition ... helping out on the integration of the business so those have caused distractions and caused us to lose momentum in the business,"" Coty Chairman Bart Becht said on the call.The company also said that challenges in the consumer beauty business and the previously-announced sale of 6-8 percent of its product portfolio would hurt second-quarter sales.Becht said the results of the recently concluded U.S. presidential election do not affect the company's plans. SALES LOSE SHINE     Fragrance sales fell 9 percent on a like-for-like basis, while color cosmetics fell 6 percent in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. These two segments are its biggest contributors to revenue. ""This period of integration for Coty has been met with less than stellar underlying performance and lack of clarity has created anxiety in the stock,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a note.Coty has inked multiple deals to transform itself into a global beauty products giant, as it reduces its dependence on its struggling fragrance business.After buying P&G's specialty beauty business, the company acquired ghd, a high-end hairstyling appliance brand, from private equity firm Lion Capital LLP for about $522 million. Coty posted no profit during the first quarter ended Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a net income of $125.7 million, or 34 cents per share.Net revenue fell to $1.08 billion from $1.11 billion.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Coty, which owns cosmetics brands like COVERGIRL and Rimmel, were down 13.2 percent in early trading. The stock has fallen as much as 23 percent in the last 12 months.
