5,"   By Charlie Zhu | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Aug 4 State oil giant PetroChina  plans to pay the more than $1 billion it needs to complete a takeover of the Dover oil sands project from Canadian firm Athabasca Oil Corp by the end of September, a person with knowledge of the deal told Reuters.PetroChina was supposed to complete the acquisition of Athabasca Oil's 40 percent stake in the project in June, but delayed the payment while it reassessed the deal amid a government-led corruption probe into the Chinese national oil company, the person said.The internal review showed the geological structure of the project is more complicated than previous estimates, which would increase development costs, but the acquisition will go ahead, the person added.""The next step is to complete the transaction,"" said the source, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""PetroChina will pay in August or September."" Asked about the deal, PetroChina spokesman Mao Zefeng said: ""At the moment, there is not any sign that PetroChina will not proceed with the project."" He declined to comment further.Officials at Calgary-based Athabasca Oil declined to comment on the payment.Shares in Athabasca Oil tumbled last week after it said it was still trying to collect the C$1.23 billion payment owed to it by a unit of PetroChina, Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd, for the stake in the Dover project. The delay triggered speculation that the deal may have been scrapped as the Chinese government investigates about a dozen former senior executives at PetroChina and its parent China National Petroleum Corp for alleged graft, including Beijing-based Song Yiwu, deputy head of CNPC's overseas operations.Song was deeply involved in PetroChina's Canada businesses. PetroChina, the world's fourth most valuable oil company, in 2009 signed an agreement to acquire 60 percent stake in the Dover and MacKay River projects owned by Athabasca Oil for C$1.9 billion in a major push into Canada's reserve-rich but capital intensive oil sands industry.Under the agreement, Athabasca Oil holds the option to sell its remaining 40 percent stake in the two projects to PetroChina after receiving relevant Canadian regulatory approvals. PetroChina bought the remaining 40 percent stake in MacKay River in 2012 for C$680 million.PetroChina and Athabasca are now negotiating the final sum for the remaining 40 percent stake in Dover, the person said, adding that the amount should be little changed from the C$1.23 billion previously agreed upon.The Dover oil sands project, 95 kilometers (59 miles) northwest of Fort McMurray, Alberta, is expected to eventually produce as much as 250,000 barrels of bitumen per day, according to filings by Athabasca.

PetroChina was expected to have completed the acquisition in June, but it delayed payment amid a government-led corruption investigation into the Chinese company, launched more than half a year ago.

8,"  EditorsNote: updates with quotesKahne survives, but Kurt Busch, Biffle, Allmendinger, Almirola outD DOVER, Del. -- Jeff Gordon drove by Brad Keselowski in lapped traffic on lap 305 of the 400-lap AAA 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Dover International Speedway on Sunday and sailed on to his fourth win of the 2014 season and his first win of the Chase for the Sprint Cup.With the win, Gordon clinched a spot in the Contender Round of the Chase. The same can't be said for former champ Kurt Busch, Greg Biffle, AJ Allmendinger and Aric Almirola who were eliminated and saw their hopes of winning the championship vanish at Dover.Busch finished 18th after being in position to move on, but he faded in the last part of the race.""It was just tight the last 100 miles,"" he said. ""I thought we were in position to advance, but you can't expect to advance by running 15th. You have to be more competitive. We gave it a good run. ... I just chalk it up to me not getting the job done.""Allmendinger was more succinct.""We sucked all day. We didn't deserve to make it,"" said Allmendinger, who finished 23rd. ""I'm not disappointed we didn't make it, I'm disappointed to run like this. ... We just weren't good enough."" Almirola lamented a lack of execution and consistency throughout the entire Sprint Cup season.""Just sad, just disappointed,"" said Almirola, who finished 28th. ""I picked a really bad day to run like that. That's what we found this year. We're just really inconsistent. We have really good weeks, and really bad weeks. This week we just missed it.""Throughout the second half of the race, Kurt Busch and Kasey Kahne battled for the 12th and final spot into the next round of the Chase. Kahne wound up with the spot as Busch reported a vibration and lost positions as he was passed by drivers that included Stewart-Haas Racing teammates Kevin Harvick and Tony Stewart.Allmendinger wound up the first driver out, missing advancement by two points. Keselowski, who finished second to Gordon on Sunday, and Penske teammate Joey Logano had already clinched advancing before starting their engines on Sunday.The other drivers advancing to the Contender round are: Harvick, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Matt Kenseth, Ryan Newman, Carl Edwards, Denny Hamlin and Kasey Kahne.The Contender Round consists of three races at Kansas Speedway, Charlotte Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. A driver who wins one of those three races will automatically advance to the Eliminator Round. The rest of the eight-driver field to make the Eliminator Round will be determined by the points scored in the three Contender Round races.Johnson finished third on Sunday, followed by Logano and Kenseth was fifth. ""I feel good about that (a fourth-place finish),"" Logano said. ""It was a little bit of a tougher week for us. We didn't have a very fast car off the truck, but (crew chief) Todd Gordon and all these Shell/Pennzoil guys did a great job giving me a car that was pretty racy.""Gordon pulled away from Keselowski, but after a cycle of green-flag pit stops with about 70 laps remaining, Keselowski looked to reel in Gordon. Gordon, though, was able to maintain a cushion of just over a second and began pulling away again in the final 10 laps.The No. 2 (Keselowski) was really good on short runs, but we could run him down,"" Gordon said. ""Of course, he made us work for it there at the end, because he was so good on short runs and he got to me. I was really, really tight in traffic there at the end.""Harvick dominated the race before suffering from an issue with the valve stem on the left-front inner liner of his tire on lap 253. Up to that point, he had led 223 of the laps ran after starting on the pole. A caution for Harvick's trouble enabled him to remain on the lap, but he restarted the race 21st after running most of the event, to that point, up front. Keselowski inherited the lead.""I don't know what happened to Kevin Harvick,"" Gordon said. ""It was unfortunate for him. He was the class of the field. We were tuning on it to try to keep even with him. When I saw him go out, I knew we could compete with the No. 2 car (Keselowski).""The yellow flag waved five times throughout the race, with most cautions being a result of debris. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. brought out a caution on lap 75, the second yellow flag of the race, and Harvick's tire problem resulted in the fifth and final caution of the event.NOTES: Kevin Harvick's pole for the AAA 400 was his seventh pole start of the season, surpassing his pre-2014 career total of six. ... Jeff Gordon's win on Sunday was his fifth-career victory at Dover. ... Jimmie Johnson entered Dover as the winningest active driver at the track with nine victories. ... Johnson won the two most recent races at Dover prior to Sunday's race. ... The bottom nine of the 16 Chase for the Sprint Cup drivers heading into the AAA 400 were separated by only 12 points. ... Chase drivers Kyle Busch and Joey Logano finished first and second in Saturday's NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Dover. ... The AAA 400 was Kurt Busch's 500th-career Cup race. His first also came at Dover in 2000.",2014-09-28,DOV,"Sun Sep 28, 2014 | 7:39pm EDT","Kahne survives, but Kurt Busch, Biffle, Allmendinger, Almirola out",http://www.reuters.com//article/car-nascar-sprint-writethru-idUSMTZEA9SMS6TLG20140928?type=companyNews
9,"   By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service  Specter of Talladega motivates Johnson to win soonBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeDOVER, Del. -- Jimmie Johnson wasn't shy about revealing his game plan for the next round of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup.He wants to win either at Kansas Speedway or Charlotte Motor Speedway so he doesn't have to worry about potential chaos at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway.Johnson advanced comfortably from the Challenger to the Contender Round of the Chase with a third-place finish in Sunday's AAA 400 at Dover International Speedway. Johnson has been a quiet presence in the Chase thus far, and on Sunday, he never had enough speed to challenge either race winner Jeff Gordon or runner-up Brad Keselowski.The six-time Sprint Cup champion hopes to change that, however, when the series moves to Kansas and Charlotte for the first two races of the Contender Round. Johnson craves a victory at one or both of the two tracks.""I'd love to win at Kansas or Charlotte to take Talladega out of the mix and not have to stress about that, but we'll see how things go,"" Johnson said. ""Talladega is definitely the wild card. If I'm one of the guys that wins at Charlotte or Kansas, it's sure going to make the race at Talladega fun.""Otherwise, you're just going to be on pins and needles and stressing like crazy. That's the strategy; really try to win one of those first two so you can go to Talladega, pull them tight and let it rip.""Rookie Kyle Larson, who finished sixth on Sunday, had a different suggestion. ""Hopefully, I can be the guy that wins Kansas and Charlotte so all the Chase guys can be nervous going into Talladega,"" Larson quipped.CLEAN SLATE FOR HAMLIN For Denny Hamlin, Kansas is just like starting over. Hamlin overcame last week's disaster at New Hampshire--a fueling problem and a wreck--and raced his way into the next round of the Chase by a four-point margin over AJ Allmendinger.But now that the Chase field is pared to 12 drivers and reset to equal points, Hamlin can afford to be more aggressive.""I feel great,"" said Hamlin, who finished 12th in the AAA 400. ""You never know what can happen. I knew we had a car that was capable of racing our way in, but I didn't think it was going to be that close. We just started fading there at the end. A little bit on the defensive on my part, but still we lost the handle. Just happy this all resets and all starts from scratch again and we've got another life.""From Hamlin's perspective, that life is about to become more enjoyable, at race tracks that are in his wheelhouse.""The tracks just keep getting better for us as this Chase goes on, so we're sitting in good shape,"" Hamlin said. ""We're as level as anyone right now. This is going to be a great comeback story if we can keep going."" MOMENTUM FOR LOGANO Joey Logano posted an inconspicuous fourth-place finish at Dover without leading a lap, but the superb consistency of his entire team has engendered optimism on the part of Logano and the No. 22 Team Penske Ford.With a victory and two fourth-place finishes in the first three Chase, Logano has ample reason to be excited entering the start of the Contender Round at Kansas Speedway.""We had three top-fives in the first three races here in the Chase, so that's important,"" said Logano, whose average finish of 3.0 is best among the Chase drivers. ""We've got to do that again and again to be able to win this championship.""We've got momentum. The part I'm most proud of is that we're executing. Even if we don't have the best race car, we execute to make sure we have a nice solid finish out of it one way or the other, so we have to keep doing that throughout the rest of the Chase.""The only thing Logano regrets is that the results of the first three races don't carry over into the next round.""As consistent as we've been and as good as we've been running I hate to see it reset,"" he said. ""You're like, 'All right, this is three good finishes, a win in there, this feels good!'""But now we're all tied again, so it's like that's all out the window. It's nice we're able to go to the next round, but after that, it's over and you've got to start over and go again.""",2014-09-29,DOV,"Sun Sep 28, 2014 | 8:29pm EDT",Specter of Talladega motivates Johnson to win soon,http://www.reuters.com//article/car-nascar-sprint-writethru-idUSMTZEA9SMS6TLG20140929?type=companyNews

He won the NASCAR championship in 2004 and has won 25 NASCAR races including one this year.Police in Dover, the state capital, declined to give any details about the alleged incident or the accuser.Busch's lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said in a statement that Busch ""expects to be vindicated when the entire truth of the situation comes to light.""""This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship and Mr. Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect,"" Hardin said. The Dover Police Department said in a statement that it ""can confirm that an investigation is being conducted based on an allegation of domestic assault that is alleged to have occurred in the City of Dover involving Mr. Busch.""Police first learned of the allegations on Wednesday and ""will not have any further comment on this matter in order to preserve the integrity of the case,"" the statement said.NASCAR, which holds two major races a year in Dover, issued a statement saying it was aware of the investigation. ""We recognize the seriousness of this matter and are actively gathering information from all parties, including law enforcement authorities and (Busch's race team) Stewart-Haas Racing,"" NASCAR Senior Vice President Brett Jewkes said.""It would be inappropriate for NASCAR to comment further on this matter until we have more information,"" Jewkes added.Busch practiced on Friday in Phoenix for the second-to-last race in the NASCAR premier series. Busch's team is co-owned by Tony Stewart, who was investigated by police after his car fatally struck another driver in an open-wheel sprint car race in upstate New York in August. A grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against Stewart in that case.Busch's younger brother Kyle also races on the NASCAR circuit.Prior to this, the most recent NASCAR premier series driver to be accused of domestic violence was Travis Kvapil, who pleaded guilty in January in North Carolina's Iredell County  and was given probation, fined and sentenced to 72 hours of community service.Kvapil, 38, has raced in 21 races in NASCAR's top series this year.The National Football League has been rocked by a recent series of domestic violence allegations against star players including Ray Rice, Greg Hardy and Adrian Peterson, who was also represented by Hardin.
