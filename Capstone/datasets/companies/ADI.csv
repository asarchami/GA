11,"   By Liana B. Baker and Bill Rigby | NEW YORK/SEATTLE, June 8  NEW YORK/SEATTLE, June 8  With the biggest year in chip deals since 2000 not even halfway through, mid-sized semiconductor makers appear to be prime takeover targets as the largest players look to round out their capabilities and turn their focus to chips for cars, watches and other devices, making the ""Internet of Things"" a reality.Bigger is better is the new mantra, as more technologies are being squeezed onto chips and customers want to deal with integrated suppliers that can offer the broadest range of products.""You want to be the supplier that has the most capability,"" said Ernie Ruehl, managing director at Credit Suisse.Credit Suisse advised NXP Semiconductors on its deal with Freescale Semiconductor, which kicked off the current wave of chip mergers in March, and was one of the advisers to Avago Technologies in its $37 billion deal for Broadcom Corp last week.Bigger companies can better afford the ever-rising cost of design and manufacturing. ""A leading-edge design can cost $150 million to $200 million, which means that you have to be able to generate four times the revenue to get a return on investment,"" said Mario Morales, an analyst at tech research firm IDC.Companies that make analog and mixed-signal chips - a mixture of analog and digital - are in demand, analysts said. Analog chips process real-world signals such as sound and light, so they are central to smartphones and devices connected to the Internet.As a result, companies like Maxim Integrated Products Inc, Linear Technology Corp, Intersil Corp, Silicon Laboratories Inc , Analog Devices Inc and M/A-COM Technology are under the spotlight. Another closely related subsector is microcontrollers, essentially small computers used in automatically controlled products like car engines or implanted medical devices. Smaller microcontroller makers include Atmel Corp  and Renesas Electronics Corp.The big chip makers, such as Intel Corp, Texas Instruments Inc  and Qualcomm Inc, want to beef up in just those areas. This thirst for growth has helped spur semiconductor stocks to new heights, with the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index last month hitting its highest since 2001.As a result, valuations are growing, but not out of line with technology in general. Potential target NVIDIA Corp is trading at 24 times estimated profit for the next 12 months, and Xilinx Inc, Analog Devices and Marvell Technology Group are at around 21 times, according to Reuters data. Semiconductors as a group have historically traded about 15 times.But high valuations have not stopped the pace of deals or the premiums companies are willing to pay as low interest rates provide a source of cheap capital. Intel is offering about 35 times expected earnings for Altera Corp .After barely five months, $80 billion in semiconductor M&A has been racked up this year, according to Reuters data. In the last two weeks alone, Avago and Broadcom announced their deal and Intel moved to buy Altera.More deal activity is brewing. Analog chip maker Exar Corp said last month it would look at strategic options. Cypress Semiconductor Corp  has made an offer for Integrated Silicon Solution Inc but has so far been rebuffed. The chief executive officer of Lattice Semiconductor Corp  told Reuters this week he was open to a sale, but only for a big premium.

12,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK, June 19  NEW YORK, June 19 Texas Instruments Inc (TI)  could be gearing up to make the next big deal in what has already been a record-breaking year for semiconductor M&A, industry bankers and analysts said.The Dallas, Texas-based chipmaker, which has a market capitalization of $56 billion, has so far stayed on the sidelines as peers Intel Corp, Avago Technologies Ltd  and NXP Semiconductors NV made acquisitions worth tens of billions of dollars earlier this year.TI is looking for large acquisitions as well, according to people familiar with the matter. It held talks to acquire Maxim Integrated Products Inc late last year but discussions broke off when Maxim, which has a market capitalization of about $10 billion, decided not to sell itself, the people said.TI also considered buying Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  before Freescale agreed to be acquired by NXP in March for $11.8 billion, the people said.A TI spokeswoman said the company has a long-standing policy to not comment on market rumors and speculation or competitor activity. Maxim declined to comment and Freescale did not respond to a request for comment.If Texas Instruments chief executive Rich Templeton doesn't make a move soon, the company could run out of high value targets, FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland said. TI should act by the end of the year while NXP, one of its fastest growing rivals, is tied up awaiting approval for its merger with Freescale, he said. ""If I was TI, I would think of what NXP's next target would be and should I get there first,"" Rolland said.Driving TI's appetite for M&A, according to the sources, is a desire to improve on its profitability and increase its share in the fragmented market for analog chips, which process signals such as sound, light and temperature and convert them into digital signals, and are central to smart phones and devices connected to the Internet.To be sure, TI is not the only big semiconductor company on the hunt for a large deal. Larger peer Qualcomm Inc, which has a market capitalization of $110 billion, may look to make a substantial acquisition to bulk up its data center and cloud businesses, as its mobile phone customers see their markets mature, some of the people said. Qualcomm declined to comment.The right deal could boost TI's operating margins and profits by increasing the utilization rates in TI's 21 fabrication plants in nine countries. This could be done by tapping the production volumes from the acquisition target over a number of years, according to analysts. In addition to Maxim, TI could look at Analog Devices Inc , Linear Technology Corp, Microchip Technology Inc, Intersil Corp and Atmel Corp, a $4 billion microcontroller company which Reuters reported last week was exploring options, analysts said.Microcontrollers are small computer processors designed to do tasks that are used in a variety of electronics. TI has a microcontroller business. ANALOG CHIPS Semiconductor dealmaking has reached $79.7 billion so far this year, an amount that already surpasses every full-year period on record, with the exception of 2000, when M&A in the sector hit $115.5 billion.TI focuses on analog and embedded chips, which are used in products ranging from cars to televisions and account for the bulk of the company's revenue.TI's chief financial officer Kevin March said on a conference call with analysts last fall that TI would prefer to buy an analog company that sells into the industrial and automotive markets, or one that provides catalog parts which are non-custom silicon parts.Some analysts said however that TI is very price conscious. Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees said TI has done well by not pursuing big M&A for four years, focusing instead on its core competencies in analog and microcontrollers.Since it bought National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion in 2011, its last large scale acquisition which some analysts have argued it overpaid for, TI developed a reputation as an M&A skeptic, preferring to use its cash flow to buy back shares and pay dividends.""There's no question that TI gets a first look at everything but they have a real rigid strategy in terms of what they expect for their return on invested capital. If it doesn't fit that box, they don't acquire it,"" Van Hees said.    (Reporting by Liana B.

21,"   By Liana B. Baker | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Analog Devices Inc (ADI.O) said on Tuesday it would buy fellow chipmaker Linear Technology Corp (LLTC.O) for about $14.8 billion, the latest deal in a wave of consolidation that has swept the semiconductor industry in the past two years. By buying Linear, Analog is aiming to boost its profitability and increase its share in the fragmented market for analog chips, which process signals such as sound, light and temperature and convert them into digital signals. The chips are central to smart phones and devices connected to the internet.The deal comes on the heels of SoftBank Group Corp's (9984.T) $32 billion acquisition of British chip designer ARM Holdings ARM.L announced on July 18.Analog's Chief Executive Vincent Roche said in an interview that consolidation in the semiconductor industry will continue as companies aggressively buy up assets to gain scale. ""Growth has been hard to come by in the industry over the past several years. Those who have the balance sheets are using them,"" Roche said. Roche added that buying Linear ""is about much more than that"" and creates an ""industry-leading innovation engine"" that generates strong revenue growth.Linear was viewed as one of the most attractive sales targets in semiconductors because of its high margins and engineering talent. Analysts have long identified Linear as being coveted by Analog or one of its rivals, Texas Instruments (TXN.O). Analog said it would offer $46.00 per share in cash and 0.2321 a share for Linear. This roughly values the company at $60 a share, a 24 percent premium to Linear's closing share price on Monday. The companies said the deal values the combined business at about $30 billion. Founded in 1965 by two MIT graduates, Analog last made a significant acquisition in 2014 when it bought Hittite Microwave Corp for about $2 billion.Linear's stock closed up nearly 29 percent at $62.49, its highest since 2001. The deal, which was first reported by Bloomberg, creates a company with combined revenue of $5 billion. Analog's shares rose to a 52-week high. The deal is expected to immediately add to Analog's adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) advised Analog Devices while JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) provided financing.

23,"   By Tessa Walsh | LONDON  LONDON The slower than expected syndication of a US$7.5bn senior acquisition loan, which is part of a US$11.6bn financing backing Analog Devices’(ADI.O) US$14.8bn acquisition of chipmaker Linear Technology (LLTC.O), shows that banks are finding it harder to make returns work on drawn acquisition term loans.The unusually weak demand for an acquisition financing from an investment-grade company comes as the cost of lending rises for banks that have to hold more regulatory capital against loans.“Analog is the first bridge loan for a high grade company to get a poor reception from the market for a long time,” a senior banker said.The US$7.5bn syndicated financing consisted of a US$2.5bn three-year term loan, a US$2.5bn five-year term loan, a US$2.5bn 364-day bridge loan to capital markets issues and a US$1bn revolving credit. A US$4.1bn, 90-day senior unsecured bridge loan was not syndicated.The deal, which was underwritten by JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse, was launched in early August. The deadline was extended to September 19 after relationship banks came in at lower levels and a couple declined, bankers said. The loan has now closed and has been allocated, and Analog has its money.BAML and JP Morgan declined to comment and Credit Suisse was not immediately available for comment. Banks are usually keen to give acquisition bridge loans to top companies as they are often quickly repaid by bond or equity issues. Participation also ensures positions on more lucrative bond and equity issues that subsidize cheaper loans.But banks are targeting higher returns on equity and are becoming more sophisticated at measuring profitability. This is making it harder for lenders to commit to funded term loans that do not hit return models and tie up capital that could be used more profitably elsewhere.“The returns on three and five-year term loans on investment-grade bridge loans are horrible. Some banks are realizing that five-year term loans are dragging their returns back so badly that they can’t make unprofitable lending decisions. Maybe they’re waking up and smelling the coffee,” a second senior banker said. RELATIONSHIP LENDING?  This is putting pressure on the concept of relationship lending that has underpinned the investment-grade syndicated loan market for decades. Loans have been viewed as “loss leaders” for more lucrative ancillary business, but more banks are now turning down deals that do not pay on a standalone basis.Analog’s three-year term loan was priced at 112.5bp and its five-year term loan at 125bp, which proved challenging even for relationship banks, a syndicate head said. “It’s very hard to make those numbers work,” the second senior banker said.The term loans are new money for Analog and the company also increased the size of its revolving credit facility to US$1bn from US$750m, which required existing lenders to increase their exposure or make new commitments.The company’s position in the technology sector and Triple B credit rating were also considerations, bankers said. S&P lowered Analog’s rating to BBB from A– following the acquisition announcement, with a negative outlook, on July 26.Analog announced the cash and stock acquisition in late July and said that it planned to fund the acquisition with US$7.3bn of new long-term debt, including term loans and bonds, and 58 million new shares of Analog common stock and the combined company’s balance sheet cash.The acquisition is expected to close by mid 2017, subject to approvals. The combined business is valued at about US$30bn.
