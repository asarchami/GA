0,"  Jan 28 Nucor Corp, the largest U.S. steel producer, said on Tuesday that earnings rose in the fourth quarter, helped by stronger sales and shipments as well as a noncash gain related to deferred tax balances.The earnings beat Nucor's own forecast made in December, even excluding the impact of the tax gain and a smaller than expected inventory charge.North Carolina-based Nucor, which is the largest producer of steel in the United States by volume, said it sees earnings in the current quarter similar to the fourth quarter, excluding the tax adjustment. Seasonal weakness and bad weather may weigh on Nucor's construction products business, but the company expects to benefit from having fewer planned outages during the quarter.Massive excess capacity has steelmakers under pressure around the world. In the United States, output contracted 2 percent in 2013, but there was also a noticeable increase in prices in the second half of the year as demand improved. Nucor said total shipments to customers rose 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012.Net earnings increased to $170.5 million, or 53 cents a share, from $136.9 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier. Net sales rose 10 percent to $4.89 billion. In December, Nucor had forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 35 to 40 cents a share, and analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 40 cents on revenue of $4.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Fourth quarter earnings included a 7 cent a share gain to correct deferred tax balances and 4 cent charge on the value of inventory, smaller than the 6 cent charge Nucor had forecast.Shares edged higher, rising 0.7 percent at $48.77 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",2014-01-28,NUE,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 10:52am EST","UPDATE 1-Nucor Q4 earnings rise on stronger sales, shipments",http://www.reuters.com//article/nucor-results-idUSL2N0L20QP20140128?type=companyNews

2,"  March 18 Steelmaker Nucor Corp said on Tuesday it expects first-quarter earnings to be below its previous forecast in part because of severe winter weather.Nucor forecast first-quarter earnings between 30 cents and 35 cents a share, up from 26 cents in the first quarter of 2013, but below fourth-quarter profit. Bad weather has cut demand, reduced rail capacity and exacerbated the usual seasonal weakness in Nucor's construction products business, the company said. It added that steel imports are still weighing on prices and reducing margins at its bar and sheet mills. Nucor said in January that first-quarter earnings would likely be similar to fourth-quarter results, excluding the impact of a tax adjustment in the earlier quarter.

7,"  (Adds details on direct reduced iron facility, construction industry)June 20 Steelmaker Nucor Corp forecast a rise in second-quarter earnings on Friday, but said results would likely come in at the low end of its previous outlook after a shutdown at a new facility in Louisiana.Nucor forecast earnings between 35 cents and 40 cents a share, up from 27 cents a share a year earlier. The company had previously forecast ""some improvement"" from the first quarter, when it earned 35 cents a share. It said the new forecast is at the low end of its previous expectations. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company sees a loss of $30 million, or 6 cents a share, at its new direct reduced iron plant in Louisiana in the quarter. The plant started production in December, and volume has been better than expected but yield needs work, Nucor said. It has shut the plant down for three weeks of adjustments.Made from iron ore, direct reduced iron is a raw material used to make steel, and a substitute for scrap, Nucor's traditional feedstock. Nucor said the plant's performance should improve significantly in the third quarter, and it expects the facility to be profitable by the end of the year. Demand for steel plate and sheet products has been strong, Nucor said, and conditions have improved in the non-residential construction market.""Although nonresidential construction markets are at historically low levels, they are improving. Accordingly, we expect further increased operating profits in our fabricated construction products businesses going forward,"" the company said in a statement.

10,"   By Nicole Mordant  Emboldened by a recent favorable ruling for U.S. steelmakers in a steel pipe trade case, Nucor Corp said on Thursday it was confident the industry was poised for more success in future cases as it works to stem ""a tsunami of imported steel."" Nucor Chairman and Chief Executive John Ferriola said that after spending time in Washington he is more optimistic that U.S. lawmakers are finally starting to understand how damaging low-priced steel imports are for the U.S. economy and jobs. In particular, he said he felt ""good"" about an upcoming final ruling in a case concerning imports of steel rebar from Mexico and Turkey. ""We feel confident that we've got a good shot at a final ruling that's more favorable than the preliminary,"" Ferriola said on a conference call after Nucor reported better than expected quarterly earnings on higher shipments and prices.In April, the U.S. Commerce Department set preliminary duties on millions of dollars worth of rebar imports from the two countries after U.S. producers complained about price undercutting. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department set duties on South Korean steel pipe used in the oil and natural gas industry, reversing itself in one of the most contentious trade disputes in years after hefty lobbying from U.S. producers and lawmakers. Ferriola also hinted that more trade cases were in the offing but declined to be specific.  COLUMBUS  Ferriola declined to say whether Nucor had made a bid for the Columbus unit of Russia's Severstal but said that although it was a good asset Nucor could not justify the price. Severstal said on Monday it will sell its Columbus unit in Mississippi to Steel Dynamics Inc for $1.63 billion. ""Given that it really didn't expand our geographical footprint, it didn't help us on our customer base, it didn't expand our product portfolio, we could not justify the $1.6 billion price tag,"" Ferriola said.He added that he was pleased that Columbus was bought by an existing domestic competitor as that would result in further consolidation in the sheet industry.Earlier on Thursday, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Nucor said performance improved at its steel mills compared with the first quarter, especially at sheet and bar mills. It also expects an improvement in earnings in the current quarter.  Strong demand and rivals' supply problems boosted demand for sheet steel, and volume and margins rose at bar mills.Second-quarter earnings increased to $147.0 million, or 46 cents a share, from $85.1 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier.

19,"  (Adds Severstal comment, paragraphs 5, 6)WASHINGTON Oct 21 The U.S. Department of Commerce will terminate a 15-year-old deal sheltering Russian flat-rolled steel producers from high import duties, it said in a letter to Russian authorities.In the letter published on Monday, the United States gave Russia 60 days notice of the termination and said anti-dumping duties would then apply.The so-called suspension agreement has sheltered Russian steelmakers from anti-dumping duties as high as 184.56 percent on hot-rolled, flat-rolled, carbon quality steel, instead setting a cap on imports and a minimum price.Duties will apply beginning Dec. 16, according to the letter from Ronald K. Lorentzen, the Commerce Department's deputy assistant secretary for enforcement and compliance, to Russia's economic development ministry.Severstal, one of Russia's top steel producers, blasted the proposed move. It claimed there was ""no objective reason"" for it because the price of hot-rolled coil in the U.S. market has actually risen this year and it indicated it might appeal the decision to ""defend our interests."" A spokesman for the Russian ministry told Reuters his office had received the formal notice and was studying the issue.The United States has intensified sanctions against Russia over its intervention in Ukraine in recent months, moving from travel bans and asset freezes for officials to targeting Russia's largest bank and oil companies.U.S. steel producers complained to Commerce in July that the 1999 agreement had not stopped Russian producers from undercutting local prices or flooding the U.S. market.
