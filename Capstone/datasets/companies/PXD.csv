0,"  (Adds shares of more companies)June 25 Shares of U.S. refiners such as Valero Energy Corp dropped on fears of a rise in crude costs after U.S. officials allowed energy companies to export very light crude oil, or condensate, after it has been minimally processed.Shares of oil and gas producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co  and pipeline company Enterprise Products Partners LP  rose after the companies received a private ruling from the U.S. Department of Commerce to export the condensate.The ruling also lifted shares of many U.S. oil and gas producers, particularly those more weighted to condensate. Shares of Eagle Ford shale producers Rosetta Resources Inc  and SM Energy Co were up more than 4 percent in afternoon trading.""This (the commerce department's ruling) may be a precursor or trial balloon to less restrictive condensate exports or even light crude oil over the longer term,"" Tudor Pickering Holt Energy analysts wrote in a note. Analysts said the ruling was a step towards alleviating the light oil glut on the U.S. Gulf Coast and it would potentially weigh on refining margins.U.S. refiners may see crude costs go up as they would have to compete with international buyers for supplies, analysts said. Most refiners, except Phillips 66, have campaigned against a lifting of the U.S. ban on exports.The ruling sent down shares of refiners most levered to light crude oil. Shares of Alon USA Energy Inc, Delek US Holdings Inc  and HollyFrontier Corp were all down about 7 percent, while those of Western Refining Inc were 6 percent lower. Valero shares were down about 9 percent.The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security told Pioneer Natural that lightly processed condensate would be eligible for export without a license.The department had given approval via a private ruling to Pioneer Natural and Enterprise Products to export the condensate, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.Pioneer Natural's shares rose as much as 4 percent, while Enterprise Products' stock gained 1.6 percent.

1,"  (Adds background on crude oil ban)NEW YORK Aug 4 Pioneer Natural Resources Co  said on Monday that its first cargo of condensate from the Eagle Ford shale oil play was exported in late July following confirmation from the U.S. Commerce Department that the ultra-light oil could be exported without a license if processed minimally.The company said its monthly condensate shipments are expected through year-end at prices higher than domestic levels. It added that Asian petrochemical demand for the Eagle Ford shale condensate is growing. Last month, South Korea and Japan purchased the first condensate from the United States since what appeared to be the easing of a 40-year ban on U.S. crude oil exports. Sources said that South Korean oil refiner GS Caltex bought a condensate cargo to be loaded in late July. That cargo was marketed by Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co. Ltd., which had bought it from Enterprise Product Partners LP. . Pioneer and Enterprise had been told in March that putting condensate through a stabilizer was sufficient processing to export it without a license. In 2013, the company's significant purchasers of oil, natural gas liquids and gas were Plains Marketing LP at 26 percent, Enterprise at 12 percent and Occidental Energy Marketing Inc at 12 percent, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp, according to a Pioneer filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.More recently, sources said the Commerce Department has put on hold at least two companies' request for permission to sell the lightly processed crude abroad as companies seek clarification on what can be legally exported.

5,"  (Adds details, background on license approval, shale boom)By Catherine NgaiNEW YORK, Sept 3 Pioneer Natural Resources Co  said on Wednesday it has benefited from improved pricing as a result of its ability to sell an ultra-light oil called condensate outside of the United States.The oil was previously sold at around $15 a barrel below U.S. crude oil prices. Prices for the historically discounted grade have improved significantly due to Pioneer's license to export the oil, the company's CEO said.""Pricing continues to improve,"" Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said during a webcast of his presentation at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference on Wednesday.

Pioneer also said it is in negotiations with foreign buyers to sell condensate, which the company produces and has the authority to export.Pioneer, along with Enterprise Product Partners LP, received the green light from the U.S. Commerce Department in March to export condensate, a ruling that became public in June. In July, South Korea and Japan purchased the first condensate from the United States since what appeared to be an easing of a 40-year ban on U.S. crude oil exports.But while the two companies received the approval, applications from at least three other companies have been since put on hold. Pioneer has exported two cargos already, Sheffield said.

15,"  Jan 6 Pioneer Natural Resources said on Tuesday that icy winter weather has significantly disrupted its production and drilling operations in the Permian Basin in West Texas, one of the top U.S. oil basins.""At the beginning of January, the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area experienced heavy icing and freezing temperatures that has resulted in extensive power outages, facility freeze-ups, trucking curtailments and limited access to production and drilling facilities,"" the Dallas company said in a statement. It will take several weeks before the weather's full impact will be known, Pioneer said.

17,"   By Lucas Iberico Lozada | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 6 Pioneer Natural Resources , a major producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas, said on Tuesday it has restructured most of its 2015 hedge position to protect against further falls in oil prices.The move reflects a growing belief in the industry that prices will not return to pre-crash levels this year, and is one of the more effective tools in U.S. producers' arsenal in their stare-down with OPEC over market share.Pioneer's decision follows a Monday announcement by smaller rival Concho Resources that it would be dramatically scaling back its 2015 spending plan. Pioneer said in a statement that it had replaced most of its options-based ""three-way collars"" with fixed-price swaps. This exchanges a system with more potential upside for one that offers greater protection on the way down, after it was left exposed in November.Collars guarantee producers sales within a given range, provided the market price for a barrel of oil does not fall beneath a put option, set lower than the ""floor"" of the range. Swaps guarantee future sales at a fixed price but limit potential gains on the upside. For its third quarter, Pioneer reported a robust hedge book, with collars in place for some 96,000 barrels per day (bpd), about 85 percent of what the company says it expects to produce in 2015. But those collars were set with the lower put option - which analysts call a ""subfloor"" - at $73.54 a barrel, leaving the company unprotected when prices dropped below $70 in late November. By replacing the inert collars with swaps set at just above $71 per barrel for 82,000 barrels per day and leaving its 2016 collars in place, the company is effectively betting that prices will stay low throughout the year and rise again in early 2016.The company did not respond to a request for comment on which lender was used for the transaction, and how much it had been charged.(Reporting by Lucas Iberico Lozada; Editing by Richard Chang)",2015-01-07,PXD,"Tue Jan 6, 2015 | 7:10pm EST",U.S. shale producer Pioneer restructures 2015 hedges,http://www.reuters.com//article/oil-hedging-pioneer-natl-rsc-idUSL1N0UL28D20150107?type=companyNews
18,"  (Adds quotes, details)By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Anna DriverHOUSTON, April 21 Pioneer Natural Resources Co , a top oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas, will start adding drilling rigs in June so long as market conditions are favorable, the company's CEO said on Tuesday in a bold show of industry optimism.The comments from Scott Sheffield mark the first time during the current crude price downturn that a prominent shale oil company has said rigs will be added soon. Many companies have slashed their rig fleets in half after crude prices fell 50 percent after June. But prices have ticked upward some 13 percent this month to around $55 per barrel.Sheffield said the market bottomed out some weeks ago at $42 a barrel. What remains now is to see if inventories fall. ""We're going to see what happens when Cushing gets full,"" he said, referring to the U.S. crude oil storage hub. The massive oil storage facility is currently 8 million barrels from its maximum capacity, he said.Sheffield said if market conditions are right, Pioneer will add about two rigs a month. Pioneer expects to add rigs as additional takeaway capacity in the Permian basin comes online, Sheffield said. He expects the Permian Express pipeline to come into service by July 1.Pioneer has hedged 90 percent of its 2015 production and 60 percent of its 2016 production. The company has not yet begun to hedge its 2017 production. While ""prices aren't bad"" for 2017, according to Sheffield, he is reluctant to enter into a contract that wouldn't allow for upside in the case of geopolitical disruptions that tighten supply.Pioneer aims to send about 70 percent of its crude to the Gulf Coast, and the remainder to Cushing by July 1, Sheffield said.   (Reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault and Anna Driver; Editing by Terry Wade and David Gregorio)",2015-04-21,PXD,"Tue Apr 21, 2015 | 5:26pm EDT","CERAWEEK-Bucking downturn, Pioneer sees adding rigs soon",http://www.reuters.com//article/ceraweek-pioneer-natl-rsc-idUSL1N0XI2GV20150421?type=companyNews
19,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Pioneer Natural Resources Co may be the first major U.S. shale oil producer to ramp up drilling after a deep slump halved prices, adding rigs as soon as June so long as market conditions are favorable.In an unusually bold show of industry optimism, Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield told Reuters on Tuesday that Pioneer, a top producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas, may increase drilling at a rate of two rigs a month, starting to reverse a trend that has seen the U.S. oil rig rate halve in seven months.The comments mark the first time during the current crude price downturn that a prominent shale oil company has spoken publicly about new drilling, even as other executives work to curb spending and cut costs to ride out the downturn.""We hope to be adding rigs,"" Sheffield said in an interview.It may signal the start of a shift in industry thinking after months of tumbling prices, as big traders like Vitol and consultants including PIRA Energy call an end to the slump. Sheffield too believes that prices bottomed out some weeks ago at $42 a barrel, but wants to see if record stockpiles ebb.Oil prices dived by more than 60 percent since last summer, but have rebounded by as much as $15 a barrel this month.""We're going to see what happens when Cushing gets full,"" he said, referring to the U.S. crude oil storage hub. The massive oil storage facility is currently 8 million barrels from its maximum capacity, he said. If other drillers follow suit, the decline in U.S. oil production that is expected to begin as early as next month may be short-lived. However Pioneer’s extensive oil price hedges may also give it greater confidence to drill more than some of its peers who are less protected from another price slump. Sheffield said if market conditions are right, Pioneer will add about two rigs a month. Pioneer expects to add rigs as additional takeaway capacity in the Permian basin comes online, Sheffield said. He expects the Permian Express pipeline to come into service by July 1.     HEAVILY HEDGED Other CEOs, like Continental Resources Inc's Harold Hamm, counter that ramping up drilling may come more slowly, noting that the process requires permitting and other measures that may cause it to be much slower than shutting in production. While Continental shed its hedges, Pioneer is well protected. Pioneer has hedged 90 percent of its 2015 production and 60 percent of its 2016 production. The company has not yet begun to hedge its 2017 production.While ""prices aren't bad"" for 2017, according to Sheffield, he is reluctant to enter into a contract that would not allow for upside in the case of geopolitical disruptions that tighten supply.  Pioneer aims to send about 70 percent of its crude to the Gulf Coast, and the remainder to Cushing by July 1, Sheffield said.Pioneer is continuing to export superlight crude oil known as condensate to Asia at a rate of about 20,000 barrels a day, gross, Sheffield said. ""It helps when there's a spread of $7 to $9 with Brent,"" he said.U.S. policy bans nearly all crude exports, but allows shipments of minimally processed super light oil known as condensate.The U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast American oil output may dip as early as this month and certainly later this year, before rising to around 9.18 million barrels per day at year's end.

Some on Wall Street remained optimistic about the company and sector despite Einhorn's criticisms. For these investors and advisers, the fate of the companies depends primarily upon oil prices. ""He is right if oil prices remain under $60; he is dead wrong if prices go beyond $75,” said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.

Shares closed on Monday at $168.33, down 1.9 percent.Pioneer declined comment, referring Reuters to its earnings statement expected Tuesday. Because oil markets may be approaching an inflection point as shale production is curtailed and oil refinery runs increase demand, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Leggate upgraded his price target on the stock to $200 a share, in a recent note to clients obtained by Reuters.  In the note, Leggate held that U.S. oil companies are undervalued and advocated a gradual shift toward higher exposure to companies including Pioneer and Concho Resources Inc., remaining cautious of their portfolio quality and balance sheet strength. Investors have piled in to Pioneer and other shale drillers, driving up their shares up as much as 30 percent since January, outstripping gains in oil. Private equity funds have sought a toehold in oil production, with a $4.5 billion Blackstone Group oversubscribed earlier this year. Einhorn's comments are not seen deterring eager investors from the space.

31,"  (Adds details on WPX plan, background)July 8 U.S. shale exploration and production company Pioneer Natural Resources Co said on Wednesday it is increasing drilling activity in Texas following the sale of its stake in an Eagle Ford shale pipeline and processing business.The Dallas company's optimism stands out in a market unnerved by a 15 percent drop in crude prices since late June. Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield told Reuters in April that his company would start adding rigs this month if market conditions warranted more drilling.""Our strong balance sheet, combined with a strong derivatives position for 2015 and 2016, provides us with the financial firepower to ramp up drilling activity,"" Sheffield said in a statement.North Dakota oil producer WPX Energy Inc said last month it would add two drilling rigs later this year, a decision that is unchanged despite the recent crude oil price drop. Half a dozen or so other companies in the crowded U.S. shale industry have indicated they may add rigs but have so far not made definite moves as they wait to see where crude prices settle.Pioneer said it has already added two drilling rigs in the Permian Basin this month and plans to add an average of two per month during the balance of the year as long as the crude oil price ""remains constructive,"" the company said. The increased drilling is not expected to have a big impact on 2015 production, which had been forecast to grow more than 10 percent, but it will push capital spending up $350 million to $2.2 billion, the company said.More rigs are planned for early next year. Pioneer said it plans to add eight horizontal rigs in Texas shale basins, bringing the total rig count to 36, or the same number it had before the price of oil collapsed by more than half. Pioneer, which owned 50.1 percent of the Eagle Ford pipeline and processing business before the sale, said its share of the proceeds from Enterprise Product Partners LP is $530 million at closing and about $500 million a year after closing.(Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston and Ernest Scheyder in Williston, North Dakota; Editing by Richard Chang)",2015-07-08,PXD,"Wed Jul 8, 2015 | 1:43pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Pioneer says increasing drilling activity as planned,http://www.reuters.com//article/pioneer-natl-rsc-rigs-idUSL1N0ZO1ID20150708?type=companyNews

Deliveries of the so-called effluent, are expected to start at the end of the year.As crude oil has slid to its lowest level in six years -currently about $40 a barrel - oil and gas companies pumping from shale rock have tried to cut every unnecessary penny from their operations. Water acquisition and transportation can be up to 10 percent of the cost of drilling and fracking a well, according to consulting firm IHS.Producers are also trying to mitigate long-term risks of water scarcity in the arid Permian Basin of West Texas, where the top U.S. oilfield is situated.Oil and gas companies operating in area, including Pioneer and Apache Corp, have long sought cheaper, more environmentally sound sources of water to use for fracking. For example, both companies have drawn some of the water they use in their operations from the Permian's brackish aquifers, which contain water unfit for drinking. Both companies also have worked to recycle water that is used for frack jobs or found in the ground while drilling.During hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, million of gallons of water are blasted, along with sand and chemicals, into a well drilled through shale or other rocks. The high-pressure slurry cracks the rock, allowing oil and gas to escape and exit the well.Pioneer is the first oil and gas company to sign a long-term wastewater supply contract with Odessa, a city of about 110,000 people. The Dallas-based company recently began construction on a pipeline network that will transport the treated water from the city's sewage plant to one of its oilfields about 20 miles away. ""The money has been approved,"" said Stephen McNair, president of Pioneer's water management group.Pioneer's goal is to eliminate the use of fresh water in fracking in 5 to 10 years, said McNair.The municipal reclaimed water the company intends to use  comes from sewage plants that treat human waste and water from activities that include bathing and food preparation, according to Texas regulators. City officials say the deal will provide a steady stream of revenue and reduces truck traffic.""We didn't think we were making our highest and best use of our effluent water, we were using a lot for irrigation,"" said Larry Long, the Odessa city attorney who helped to negotiate the deal with Pioneer.

46,"  (Adds details on executives, stock movement)HOUSTON May 19 U.S. shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co said on Thursday that Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield will retire at the end of the year and be replaced by Tim Dove, the company's chief operating officer.The retirement draws to a close one of the longest-tenured positions in the oil industry. Sheffield joined Pioneer's predecessor company, Parker & Palsey, in 1979 and became its chief executive in 1989.He took the top spot at Pioneer when it was created in 1997 after its all-stock buyout of T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Petroleum. In the ensuing years Sheffield helped create what is considered one of the most-capable U.S. independent oil producers, with assets throughout Texas and Colorado.Indeed, despite the oil price downturn of the past 18 months - a drop that has ravaged many of the company's peers - Pioneer's shares have gained 22 percent. Sheffield, who said he is retiring to spend time with his family, called Dove ""the best person to serve as Pioneer's next CEO.""Dove joined Parker & Palsey in 1994 and has held varied roles at Pioneer, including chief financial officer and head of business development. He joined Pioneer's board in 2013. ""Tim's strategic thinking and depth of experience was critical to our efforts to transform the company into a leading developer of U.S. onshore unconventional resources,"" Sheffield said in a press release.Dove was not immediately available for comment.Shares of Pioneer closed Thursday at $162.84, unchanged in after-hours trading.

54,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Arathy S Nair | NEW YORK/BENGALURU  NEW YORK/BENGALURU Oil and gas producer Marathon Oil Corp's plans to buy a small Oklahoma producer is the latest signal U.S. shale companies are pouncing on properties in the state's high margin STACK basin as the price of oil rebounds. Marathon Oil said Monday it would purchase PayRock Energy Holdings LLC for $888 million from venture capital firm EnCap Investments. PayRock currently produces about 9,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Anadarko Basin STACK play in Oklahoma. The deal comes after Devon Energy Corp's recent buy of about 80,000 net surface acres in the STACK play from privately held Felix Energy - also part of EnCap's portfolio - for $1.9 billion.The STACK, or Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties play, lies in the Anadarko Basin, which covers about 60,000 square miles in western Oklahoma, southwestern Kansas, and parts of the Texas Panhandle and southeastern Colorado. The play has emerged as a top investment priority for several companies, including Continental, Devon and Marathon Oil in the past year largely because the cost to operate wells in this area is lower than other parts of the United States. That, in part, has made it a prime opportunity for investment as oil prices recover after plumbing 12-year lows earlier this year.  Rig counts have now increased for three weeks in a row, as crude prices recover to near $50 a barrel, suggesting a shift in producers' strategies.More recently in May, Newfield Exploration Co agreed to buy 42,000 net acres in the STACK play for $470 million from a unit of Chesapeake Energy Corp. Marathon Oil had agreed to sell non-core assets for $950 million in April, bringing its total sales through divestitures to about $1.3 billion since last August.    ""It is a little bit of a change, compared to what we've been hearing lately in M&A,"" Imre Kugler, senior consultant in North America Upstream at IHS, said. He said until recently, companies had been focused on selling assets not crucial to their businesses, but the latest Marathon Oil transaction is ""more of an aggressive move.""The most recent production numbers suggest the STACK play is seeing more activity. Continental Resources Inc said production from STACK more than tripled to 11,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter from the year-ago period. Devon's production from the area soared about 39 percent to 91,000 boepd.  To be sure, the play is still in its early stages, but analysts have expressed optimism in its growing potential. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Sunday that STACK should ""power capital efficient production growth"" for Devon, Marathon Oil and Continental Resources.Shares of Marathon Oil rose 11.5 percent to $14.67 a share in afternoon trading.

58,"   By Mike Stone and Devika  Krishna Kumar | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Acquisition-hungry energy companies are back on the prowl.Dealmakers have recovered from the shock of Britain's ""Brexit"" vote last month to leave the European Union and have resumed buying oil and gas fields in choice locations in Canada and the United States, restocking their inventories on a bet that a two-year slump in the price of oil has abated.""Buyers are increasingly confident in a stable to slowly increasing oil price - as are their funding sources, whether private equity funds or public market investors,"" said Bobby Tudor, chief executive of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an oil and gas investment bank.Oil prices CLc1 have held steady at or above $45 a barrel for a majority of the last two months and touched a 2016 high above $51, ahead of the British referendum.Tudor said buyers were banking on it eventually settling at around $60 a barrel, giving them confidence about buying drilling acreage in some of the nation's shale heartlands.U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O) last week said it would spend $560 million buying leases on oil-rich land in the Southern Delaware Basin, within the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, where initial production results have been strong and costs are coming down.A day later, U.S. energy company Laredo Petroleum Inc (LPI.N) said it would spend $125 million buying acreage in the Midland Basin, also part of the Permian.These deals mark a resumption in buying after Brexit caused a temporary lull in acquisitions.Before the British referendum on June 23, buyers and sellers had grown comfortable with the idea that oil had rebounded from 12-year lows. That conviction helped to unclog the acquisition pipeline after a long-dormant period in which deals were offered but failed to materialize.About $5.1 billion of U.S. and Canadian properties traded hands in June, the largest dollar amount in more than a year according to PLS Inc, global M&A database for such deals.Acreage deals create confidence and open the door to acquisitions of entire companies, so long as oil remains relatively steady, according to nearly a dozen dealmakers interviewed by Reuters.More acreage deals are in the works, including ones that involve large exploration and production (E&P) companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Southwestern Energy Co  (SWN.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, like Magnum Hunter Resources, or are going through the process, like Ultra Petroleum Corp [UPLMQ.PK], will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy, having eliminated much of their debt.Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now, a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions. Traditional E&P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter, representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value, respectively, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price.  Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate, where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart.Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine-week period of relatively low oil volatility, when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about $40 and $50 a barrel.  Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out CLc36, according to bankers. That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about $60 per barrel, the bankers said.That forward price has now returned to its pre-Brexit levels of about $54 a barrel, enabling deals once again.Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location. Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about $50 per barrel is profitable. The acreage most sought-after is in Texas' Permian Basin and in Oklahoma's STACK area (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties), popular because of their easy-to-extract rock formations and relatively low break-even prices.     In June, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) said it would spend about $888 million to acquire STACK acreage and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) said it would sell Texas acreage to Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) and an undisclosed buyer for $858 million.HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES     While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months, many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long-term.""Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U.S. rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market. We think those concerns are unwarranted,"" ANZ said in a note.""We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017.""On Friday, U.S. oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher.

60,"  HOUSTON U.S. oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co posted a second-quarter net loss on Wednesday that widened from a year earlier on $229 million in losses on derivatives it uses to insulate its revenues from volatile oil prices.Pioneer, known for its aggressive hedging program and for being one of the most efficient oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas, said its second quarter net loss was $268 million, wider than $218 million a year ago.It was the first time in a year that the company posted derivatives losses and the biggest such loss in five years, according to filings. Oil prices rose to hover between $40 and $50 barrel for much of the second quarter, surprising some analysts after bottoming at $27 a barrel in the first quarter.Excluding derivatives losses, the adjusted loss was $37 million. Revenue in the latest quarter was $786 million, up 22 percent from the same period last year.Pioneer reiterated on Wednesday it would start drilling more as oil prices improve and now that its capital spending program has been raised to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion. Pioneer bought Texas shale acreage from Devon Energy Corp last month for $435 million, issuing 5.3 million shares to help fund the deal. Pioneer also said that it planned to add five drilling rigs to Texas starting in September, bringing its total count in the state to 17. Pioneer expects to spend about $2.1 billion this year on its capital budget. Pioneer has been one of the leaders in the U.S. shale oil industry in technological development, with improved fracking techniques helping to stabilize the company's production this year and offset slipping crude prices.

62,"  (Repeats to additional subscribers, no changes to headline or text)By Terry WadeHOUSTON, July 28 Improved fracking techniques have helped cut Pioneer Natural Resources Co's  production costs in the Permian Basin to about $2 a barrel, low enough to compete with oil rival Saudi Arabia, CEO Scott Sheffield said on Thursday.The comments from Sheffield, who is retiring soon, were perhaps the most concrete sign yet that the fittest U.S. shale oil producers will survive the price crash that started in mid-2014 when Saudi Arabia and OPEC moved to pump heavily to win back market share from higher-cost producers.Dozens of shale companies, many with marginal assets, have filed for credit protection in the biggest wave of corporate bankruptcies since the telecoms crash of the early 2000s. Sheffield said high costs would continue to make U.S. shale plays outside the Permian basin relatively less competitive.On Pioneer's second-quarter results call, Sheffield said that, excluding taxes, production costs have fallen to $2.25 a barrel on horizontal wells in the Permian Basin of West Texas, so it is nearly on even footing with low-cost producers of conventional oil. ""Definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has,"" he said.""My firm belief is the Permian is going to be the only driver of long-term oil growth in this country. And it's going to grow on up to about 5 million barrels a day from 2 million barrels,"" even in a $55 per barrel price environment, he added.Oil traded near $50 a barrel for much of the second quarter but is currently around $42. Pioneer's shares were up more than 3 percent on Thursday at $155.91 each. Sheffield said other U.S. shale plays, notably the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in South Texas, may not be able to weather the downturn as well given their higher costs.""The Bakken and the Eagle Ford I think there's no way they can recover to the levels that they've already had,"" he said.Pioneer expects output to grow 15 percent a year through 2020 after posting production of 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day this past quarter. It sees most of its growth in the Permian, though it also has acreage in the Eagle Ford. Pioneer helps limit costs by doing much of its oilfield services work in-house. It also has its own sand mine, and uses effluent water from the city of Odessa for frack jobs using pressurized sand, water and chemicals to unlock oil from rock.Pioneer said it is now introducing its third generation of well completion techniques, called version 3.0, that is using even more sand and water than the super-sized volumes introduced at the start of the price crash to pull more oil out of rock.Its newest wells are using up to 1,700 pounds per foot of sand, up to 50 barrels per foot of fluid, and frack points as often as every 15 feet with wells that are now nearly 10,000 feet long.Wells fracked using completion techniques known as version 2.0 have produced about 2,000 barrels per day in their early days, double what they were producing with earlier wells.While the newest wells appear more productive, the company declined to say what output from wells fracked with the third generation completion techniques would ultimately be, partly because it chokes, or restricts, initial output from new wells to ensure their longevity.

65,"  HOUSTON U.S. oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co posted a second-quarter net loss on Wednesday that widened from a year earlier on $229 million in losses on derivatives it uses to insulate its revenues from volatile oil prices.Pioneer, known for its aggressive hedging program and for being one of the most efficient oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas, said its second quarter net loss was $268 million, wider than $218 million a year ago.It was the first time in a year that the company posted derivatives losses and the biggest such loss in five years, according to filings. Oil prices rose to hover between $40 and $50 barrel for much of the second quarter, surprising some analysts after bottoming at $27 a barrel in the first quarter.Excluding derivatives losses, the adjusted loss was $37 million. Revenue in the latest quarter was $786 million, up 22 percent from the same period last year.Pioneer reiterated on Wednesday it would start drilling more as oil prices improve and now that its capital spending program has been raised to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion. Pioneer bought Texas shale acreage from Devon Energy Corp last month for $435 million, issuing 5.3 million shares to help fund the deal. Pioneer also said that it planned to add five drilling rigs to Texas starting in September, bringing its total count in the state to 17. Pioneer expects to spend about $2.1 billion this year on its capital budget. Pioneer has been one of the leaders in the U.S. shale oil industry in technological development, with improved fracking techniques helping to stabilize the company's production this year and offset slipping crude prices.
