4,"   By Bill Berkrot  Generic drugmaker Mylan NV has offered to buy Perrigo Co Plc for about $29 billion in cash and stock, a deal that would make Mylan a major player in over-the-counter consumer products and extend its geographic reach.Mylan's disclosure on Wednesday set off fresh speculation in an already hot market for healthcare deals. Some industry watchers questioned whether Mylan sought to fend off unwanted takeover advances from larger rival Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Others said the offer could spur competing bids for Perrigo.   Mylan offered to buy the Ireland-based company for $205 per share. That represents more than a 25 percent premium over Perrigo's April 3 closing price, the last trading day before Mylan made its offer in an April 6 letter to Perrigo Chief Executive Joseph Papa.Perrigo shares initially jumped well above the offer price to $215.72, but closed up 18.4 percent at $195, indicating some investor skepticism that the deal will happen. Mylan shares rose 15 percent to $68.36, while Teva's U.S.-listed shares gained 3.5 percent.""People think that this is going to flush out a Teva bid for Mylan,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Annabel Samimy. ""If that's the case, then this bid for Perrigo is not going to go through."" She noted that Mylan provided very few details of the offer, including how much would be cash and how much in stock.Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said the two companies have held several discussions about a proposed merger. Perrigo confirmed that it had received an unsolicited offer from Mylan and said its board would meet to discuss the proposal.Perrigo, with a large and attractive portfolio of OTC consumer products, infant formulas and a line of generic topical pharmaceutical medicines, has long been seen as a takeover target. Combined, Perrigo and Mylan had sales of about $15.3 billion in 2014. ""What will be interesting to see is if we end up in a bidding war,"" said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse. He suggested Teva, the world's largest maker of generic drugs, and serial acquirer Valeant Pharmaceuticals International as potential rival bidders for Perrigo.Samimy mentioned Novartis's Sandoz generic unit as a possible Perrigo bidder. ""They've said in the past that they need to get bigger or get out.""Teva, Novartis and Valeant all declined to comment on the speculation. BIGGEST DEAL OF THE YEAR? The proposed $29 billion deal would the largest in the healthcare sector announced this year, ahead of AbbVie Inc's nearly $21 billion deal for Pharmacyclics Inc and Pfizer Inc's planned $16.7 billion purchase of Hospira Inc, according to Thomson Reuters data. (For a graphic, see: link.reuters.com/waf54w)It is further evidence that the appetite for healthcare acquisitions continues unabated. Generic drugmakers are looking to get bigger and gain access to product lines with higher profit margins and pharmaceutical companies seek to bolster their development pipelines by acquiring potentially lucrative specialty medicines, such as for cancer and rare diseases. Medical device makers have also sought to expand product portfolios through acquisitions.  Several potential deals in which U.S. healthcare companies sought to buy overseas assets to benefit from lower tax rates were shelved in 2014 after the U.S. Treasury issued tougher rules on such purchases.         AbbVie, for example, scuttled a $55 billion purchase of Ireland's Shire Plc. But both companies have since pursued new deals. AbbVie won a three-way bidding war for Pharmacyclics and Shire bought NPS Pharmaceuticals for more than $5 billion.Mylan has been at the center of deal speculation as  Actavis, one of its main rivals, swallows up companies to expand beyond generic medicines, including a $67 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan last year. Just last month, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch raised the prospect of another ""material transaction"" by the end of 2015.""Assuming Mylan can get to the finish line with this, they'd be a heck of a lot bigger in Europe,"" said CRT Capital Group analyst Timothy Chiang. Perrigo recently bulked up with a $4.5 billion purchase of Belgium-based OTC drugmaker Omega Pharma.Both Mylan and Perrigo had previously undertaken so-called inversion deals to gain lower tax rates.Mylan's $5.3 billion acquisition of Abbott Laboratories' overseas generic drugs business allowed it to move its corporate headquarters to the Netherlands. In 2013, Perrigo bought Irish drugmaker Elan for $6.7 billion and rebased from Michigan to Ireland.

Some Fed participants went on record saying they expected upcoming economic data would warrant an initial rate increase in June, while others anticipated a hike later in 2015 due to recent strength in the U.S. dollar. Market participants had been expecting the first rate hike to come in September or later, with last week's much weaker-than-expected March payroll report pointing to slowing growth.

""If the Fed moves monetary policy in an arbitrarily fast manner, that would be a detriment for stocks.""Fed officials acknowledged risks from overseas and a weak start to the year at their March meeting but remained confident in the strength of the recovery, the minutes showed.

12,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, April 10 (IFR) - Drugmaker Mylan is at risk of dropping back into junk territory if it doesn't strike a perfect balance between bond and equity to finance its proposed US$30bn acquisition of healthcare supplier Perrigo, analysts warned.The Baa3/BBB- pharma has offered to buy Perrigo for US$205 a share in transaction valued at US$30bn, including assumed debt, and it may need to raise up to US$9bn to complete the acquisition.Analysts and rating agencies have been spooked by Mylan's decision not to divulge exactly how much debt and equity it plans to issue for the acquisition and warn that, at best, the deal will leave it teetering on the edge of junk.Late this week S&P put Mylan's BBB- rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, threatening its investment grade rating amid concerns that the merger ""could significantly increase debt leverage"".Moody's also rates Mylan at its lowest investment-grade rating of Baa3, which the pharma company achieved in late 2012 after years of struggling with high leverage due to acquisitions. KEEPING THE GRADE Mylan won its investment-grade status back then by publicly articulating a 3.0-times debt/EBITDA target.Even if the Perrigo acquisition financing has a 70-75% equity component, the combined company's total debt to EBITDA would soar to around 4.5-times, according to analysts. ""The company has repeatedly stated its commitment to investment grade, but...the cash/stock consideration will have a material impact on the degree of credit deterioration and potential agency actions,"" said CreditSight pharma credit analyst, Eric Axon.Axon believes Mylan could use a 25% debt, 75% equity financing split to pay for the acquisition and keep its investment grade rating, but only if it aggressively delevers over an 18-month period.That would imply taking on an additional US$7.2bn in debt, bringing total debt to US$19.897bn or 4.5-times EBITDA for the combined company and net leverage to US$16.05bn or 3.6-times. Shubhomoy Mukherjee, credit strategist at Barclays, also believes that Mylan could issue between US$7.5bn-US$9bn and still maintain its BBB- rating, as long as it achieves about US$500m of synergies from the acquisition and rapidly delevers over 18-24 months.Under Mukherjee's calculations, that would imply a 70% equity mix in the financings. Despite the significant dilution implications of such a high equity component, Mukherjee believes Mylan can pull it off.""We think it could reduce the resulting equity dilution by financing a portion of the consideration with mandatorily convertible preferreds, which could get 100% equity credit from the rating agencies,"" said Mukherjee.For the time being, bond investors are sitting tight. Mylan's bonds have already been trading at a 7-12% discount to other low BBB healthcare credits like Actavis and Perrigo, in expectation that it would seek a major acquisition this year.""Given the possibility of Mylan's issuing US$7.5bn-US$9bn to fund this transaction and meaningfully increasing leverage, we expect Mylan bonds to re-price another 10bp wider,"" said Mukherjee.

26,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ankur Banerjee  Perrigo Co Ltd (PRGO.N) on Wednesday rejected a sweetened takeover offer from Mylan NV (MYL.O), while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) said it remains committed to acquiring Mylan, in a high stakes battle of major generic drugmakers.Mylan's pursuit of Perrigo, which also sells over-the-counter consumer products, is widely seen as an attempt to fend off Teva, the world's biggest maker of generic drugs.Mylan's latest offer, worth $34.1 billion, comprised $75 in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share, up from a previous $60 in cash and 2.2 shares. With Mylan raising its bid for Perrigo, it appeared more likely that Teva would increase the size of the cash component of its rejected bid for Mylan, Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry said.Based on Mylan's Tuesday close, the raised offer valued  Perrigo at $242 per share. The previous offer was about $220 per share. Perrigo said it viewed Mylan's latest offer to be worth $202.20, based on Mylan's March 10 share price of $55.31, before speculation over Teva's interest in Mylan pushed up the stock.""Today's announcement from Mylan continues to propose a price lower than the previously rejected proposal,"" Perrigo said.Mylan summarily rejected Teva's $40 billion offer on Monday, saying it grossly undervalued the company, and made public a scathing letter to Teva management from Executive Chairman Robert Coury, who took several shots at the Israel-based company. Coury said Mylan did not want to be paid with Teva's ""high-risk"" stock and he raised antitrust issues.

27,"  * Mylan offers $75 and 2.3 Mylan shares per Perrigo share* Perrigo rejects Mylan's offer again* Teva responds to Mylan rejection   (Adds details from Teva letter to Mylan, updates shares)By Bill Berkrot and Ankur BanerjeeApril 29 Perrigo Co Ltd on Wednesday rejected a sweetened takeover offer from Mylan NV, while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said it remains committed to acquiring Mylan, in a high stakes battle of major generic drugmakers.Mylan's pursuit of Perrigo, which also sells over-the-counter consumer products, is widely seen as an attempt to fend off Teva, the world's biggest maker of generic drugs.Mylan's latest offer, worth $34.1 billion, comprised $75 in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share, up from a previous $60 in cash and 2.2 shares. With Mylan raising its bid for Perrigo, it appeared more likely that Teva would increase the size of the cash component of its rejected bid for Mylan, Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry said.Based on Mylan's Tuesday close, the raised offer valued  Perrigo at $242 per share. The previous offer was about $220 per share.Perrigo said it viewed Mylan's latest offer to be worth $202.20, based on Mylan's March 10 share price of $55.31, before speculation over Teva's interest in Mylan pushed up the stock. ""Today's announcement from Mylan continues to propose a price lower than the previously rejected proposal,"" Perrigo said.Mylan summarily rejected Teva's $40 billion offer on Monday, saying it grossly undervalued the company, and made public a scathing letter to Teva management from Executive Chairman Robert Coury, who took several shots at the Israel-based company. Coury said Mylan did not want to be paid with Teva's ""high-risk"" stock and he raised antitrust issues.Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman responded on Wednesday in a letter to Coury that took exception to the tone of Coury's response and attempted to rebut Mylan's lengthy list of objections to a deal.

Perrigo sees this offer to be worth only $202.21 based on Mylan's unaffected March 10 share price of $55.31, before speculation over Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd's (TEVA.TA) interest in Mylan intensified, according to the source.The source asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Perrigo and Mylan spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mylan last week raised its original offer to $60 in cash and 2.2 Mylan shares, valuing Perrigo at $222 a share. Perrigo said that offer valued it at $181.67 per share, based on the Mylan's March 10 share price.  Mylan, which makes the EpiPen product for severe allergies, is pursuing an offer for Perrigo as it fends off an unsolicited takeover from larger rival Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA). Mylan on Tuesday rejected Teva's $40 billion offer, saying it ""grossly undervalues"" the company. Teva said it is ""fully committed"" and will move forward with the offer.Teva has also said its offer for Mylan is contingent on the company's not completing an acquisition of Perrigo or any alternative transaction. Perrigo, which has a large portfolio of over-the-counter consumer products, infant formulas and a line of generic topical pharmaceutical medicines, has long been seen as a takeover target.A tie-up between Perrigo and Mylan would be the latest in a string of recent multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical deals, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Ltd's (VRX.TO) $11 billion deal for Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd and AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) $21 billion offer for Pharmacyclics Inc PCYC.O.

Perrigo rejected Mylan's sweetened offer in late April, around the same time Mylan rejected an offer of $40 billion from Teva, saying it grossly undervalued the company.

39,"  TEL AVIV, June 23 Mylan NV chief financial officer John Sheehan will arrive in Israel on Wednesday for a meeting with the head of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to discuss a possible listing of its shares if it succeeds in buying Perrigo Co, an industry source said.Mylan has offered to acquire Perrigo for $34 billion in an attempt to fend off a bid from Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the world's biggest generic drugmaker. Perrigo has rejected Mylan's offer.Perrigo's shares are listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange since it acquired Israeli drugmaker Agis Industries in 2005.The source, who asked not to be named, said on Tuesday Mylan's shares would replace Perrigo in Tel Aviv just as Perrigo's shares replaced Agis when it was acquired.In addition to a meeting with Yossi Beinart, the chief executive of the stock exchange, Sheehan may also meet with institutional investors in Israel who own shares in Perrigo. A spokeswoman for Mylan in Israel declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for the bourse also declined to comment.The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which is seeking to stem falling trading volumes in recent years, is eager to ensure it does not lose Perrigo, which is one of the most active shares on the Israeli bourse. Teva last week raised its stake in Mylan to the 4.61 percent needed for it to legally challenge Mylan's rejection of Teva's hostile takeover offer under Dutch law.Mylan rebuffed a $40 billion bid from Teva in April, saying it grossly undervalued the company. Mylan reincorporated in the Netherlands last year, where it set up a legal structure called a stichting -- Dutch for ""foundation"",  which can be used as a kind of poison-pill defence against hostile takeovers.Mylan's top shareholder, Abbott Laboratories, has already come out in support of the company's rejection of Teva by backing Mylan's proposed acquisition of Perrigo. Abbott holds a 14.5 percent stake in Mylan.Teva said on Friday it would limit its stake to less than 5 percent before Mylan's extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on the Perrigo transaction if Mylan held the EGM before September.

Paulson also disclosed on Friday that the firm had purchased about 2.1 million Perrigo shares in a range of $188.24 to $192.08 on Thursday.Two other proxy advisory firms earlier this week advised Mylan shareholders to vote for the deal, which is up for approval at Mylan's Aug. 28 shareholder meeting. Institutional shareholders typically follow proxy firm recommendations.Mylan's biggest shareholder, Abbott Laboratories, said in June it would vote with Mylan. Mylan made a cash and stock offer now worth about $200 per share in April, saying the Dublin-based generic and over-the-counter drugmaker would be a strategic fit. Perrigo has repeatedly rejected the offer, saying it can do better on its own.Mylan has stuck to its pursuit and on Thursday lowered the bar to move forward on a takeover to receiving just over 50 percent of Perrigo shares in the tender offer.That size stake would allow control of Perrigo's board, and after that Mylan would need to increase its stake to more than 80 percent in order to consolidate operations. ISS said in the note that the offer was ""not a compelling acquisition strategy."" In order to approve the proposal, shareholders must believe that the deal has synergies beyond what Mylan has revealed and that the acquisition will occur at the current price despite lack of support among Perrigo shareholders, it said.ISS said that since the acquisition would dilute shares, that the deal is not expected to add to earnings until 2019 and that Mylan does not have the leverage it needs to increase its stake above 80 percent, the proposal is not warranted.Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said the ISS report misunderstands or underestimates key aspects of the transaction such as the opportunity for value creation and synergies.Mylan shares were up slightly at $54.28 on Friday afternoon while Perrigo shares were up 1.1 percent at $194.70.(Additional reporting by Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",2015-08-14,PRGO,"Fri Aug 14, 2015 | 2:30pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Proxy firm urges Mylan investors vote 'no'; Paulson backs deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/perrigo-company-ma-mylan-nl-idUSL1N10P0XE20150814?type=companyNews

61,"   By Bill Berkrot and Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Perrigo Co Plc's (PRGO.N) chief executive expressed confidence on Tuesday that his company's shareholders will reject rival generic drugmaker Mylan NV's hostile takeover attempt, and said the offer is not close to what it would take to get a deal done.Mylan (MYL.O) shareholders are set to vote on Friday on whether the company should move forward with the Perrigo bid, whose value has declined with the recent market sell-off. If more than half vote ""yes,"" Mylan plans to take its cash and stock offer directly to Perrigo shareholders. Mylan has said that if just over 50 percent of Perrigo shareholders tender their shares, it will take control of the Dublin-based company. It had aimed for 80 percent of shareholders but lowered that to the bare minimum of just over 50 percent to gain control, an option under Irish takeover laws.""Based on what I've heard from shareholders they are not going to get 80 percent of Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares and they are not going to get 50 percent of Perrigo shareholders tendering their shares. I do not believe they are going to get to either threshold,"" Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa said in a telephone interview.He shrugged off the Aug. 28 vote by Mylan shareholders. ""If they get their vote, they get their vote.""  It is unclear if more than 50 percent of Mylan shareholders will back the deal. Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Mylan's largest shareholder with a stake of more than 14 percent, and hedge fund Paulson & Co, which owns just under 5 percent, have said they back the deal. Influential proxy advisory firm ISS weighed in against it.Mylan, whose shares closed at $49.11 on Tuesday, said in a press release on Tuesday that it believes its deal will gain   approval from both its shareholders and Perrigo shareholders.  With the recent plunge in world markets, shares of both Perrigo and Netherlands-based Mylan have suffered, lowering the overall value of the offer for Perrigo to about $192 per share from about $205. ""That's not even close,"" Papa said, referring to what it would take for the Perrigo board to recommend the deal it has unanimously rejected. ""I have no problem to use words substantially undervaluing us as a company,â said Papa, whose company's shares closed at $178 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. ""There's no logical reason to go forward here. It will reduce the price to earnings multiple of Perrigo. Our PE multiple is substantially higher than the PE multiple of the Mylan company.""Earlier this month, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch called its offer ""fair and compelling"" and said it was not looking to alter the terms.

77,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Some of Perrigo Company Plc's (PRGO.N) top shareholders have asked the Irish generic drugmaker to explore a sale, hoping for an alternative to Mylan NV's (MYL.O) roughly $25 billion hostile bid, according to people familiar with the matter.The requests, made by shareholders representing at least 6 percent of Perrigo's equity capital, represent a challenge to Perrigo's defense tactics, which have so far been limited to trying to convince investors of the merits of its standalone strategy.The calls for a broad sale process also show how many investors are keen to ride the tide of deal making sweeping the healthcare sector. The industry has seen a record $460 billion in mergers and acquisitions so far this year, an increase of 80 percent over the last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""The board is not opposed to completing a deal or further maximizing value for our shareholders, but it is opposed to supporting this bad deal,"" Perrigo Chief Executive Joseph Papa told Reuters in an interview. He would not comment on whether Perrigo would explore a sale. Mylan declined to comment.Some of Perrigo's shareholders view Novartis AG NOVN.VX, Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), Proctor & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL.N) as potential suitors for Perrigo, according to the sources. Mylan, Novartis, Proctor & Gamble, and Sanofi declined to comment. Colgate-Palmolive did not respond to a request for comment.For Mylan, the deal is an opportunity to become one of the largest purveyors of generic and over the counter medications, with annual revenues in excess of $15 billion, at a time when consolidation among insurers and pharmaceutical benefits managers is putting pressure on the prices of generic drugs. Mylan launched a tender offer earlier this month to purchase Perrigo stock directly from shareholders in exchange for $75 in cash and 2.3 Mylan shares for every share they tender.The offer has declined significantly in value since Mylanâs initial April 8 proposal. Mylan's share price has dropped by more than 30 percent since late July, partly due to its rejection of a $40 billion bid from Israeli generics drug maker Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA.TA), which went on to buy Allergan Plc's (AGN.N) generic drug business for $40.5 billion.Perrigo's board has recommended shareholders do not tender their shares to Mylan, but is restricted by Irish law from blocking the offer.Â Â Â    ROAD SHOWS In response to the offer, Perrigo's management team has embarked on extensive road shows, meeting with numerous shareholders to convince them not to tender, the sources said.During these meetings, Perrigo has claimed that it has received interest from potential buyers other than Mylan, the sources added. The company has not disclosed any step so far that would indicate it is exploring such an interest. Perrigo has primarily stressed that Mylan's offer does not adequately compensate shareholders for its ""exceptional"" standalone growth prospects, including $1 billion in new product launches over the next three years, a growing European consumer healthcare platform, and potential upside from future acquisitions.Â  To be sure, some of Perrigo's shareholders, including a number who plan to tender if Perrigo does not offer an alternative, have reservations about becoming Mylan shareholders, the people said, citing corporate governance concerns raised by Mylanâs rejection of Teva. Â Â Â Â However, a number of shareholders feel the structure of Mylanâs proposal could compel even hesitant shareholders to tender in order to avoid becoming a marginalized minority in a Mylan-controlled company, the people said. Shortly before the bid, Mylan relaxed its conditions for closing the deal from the 80 percent majority threshold that is customary in Ireland to a simple majority, which could potentially lead to a situation in which Mylan is the controlling shareholder of an independent Perrigo. About 20 percent of Perrigo's shareholder base is comprised of hedge funds with shorter time horizons, which may be more likely to tender, according to one of the sources. This would give Mylan a head start as it tries to reach the 50 percent threshold.

Mylan's generic drug sales in North America jumped 28 percent to $1.08 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, contributing about 40 percent of total revenue. European generic drug sales surged 79 percent to $629 million.Net income attributable to shareholders fell to $428.6 million, or 83 cents per share, from $499.1 million, or $1.26 per share, due to higher operating costs and an income tax provision. The per-share figure was affected by a near-30 percent rise in outstanding shares in period.Excluding special items, Mylan earned $1.43 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.38 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 29 percent to $2.70 billion, but fell short of the average forecast of $2.79 billion.Mylan's shares were little changed at $45.74 in light premarket trading on Friday.

Healthcare deals worth a record $477 billion had been announced by the end of October, according to Thomson Reuters data, as companies consolidate to cut costs and gain scale.Perrigo, with a large portfolio of consumer products, infant formulas and over-the-counter generic topical drugs, has long been seen as a takeover target.To convince investors to rebuff Mylan's offer, Perrigo had announced job cuts and a $2 billion share buyback plan last month.Perrigo said on Friday it would immediately start buying back shares, helping pull its stock off a more than one-year low. MYLAN MOVING ON Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury, who snubbed an offer from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to pursue Perrigo, said the company was ready to move on.Mylan is well-positioned to ""quickly execute on the next strategic, value-enhancing opportunities,"" some of which it has already identified, Coury said in a statement. Raymond James analyst Elliot Wilbur, however, said he did not expect an immediate deal.""Mylan won't necessarily be immediately opening up its checkbook for the next company it can buy and instead will step back, take a breather, and focus on the companies or assets it should buy,"" he wrote in a note.Mylan shares were up 13.4 percent at $48.98 in afternoon trading, while Perrigo shares were down 7 percent at $145.50.Mylan first made its interest in Perrigo public in April and went hostile in September, offering $75 plus 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share held.Based on Mylan's Thursday close, the offer worked out to about $174.36 per share for Perrigo.(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr and Kirti Pandey)",2015-11-13,PRGO,"Fri Nov 13, 2015 | 1:23pm EST",UPDATE 3-Perrigo shareholders snub drugmaker Mylan's $26 bln hostile bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/perrigo-company-ma-mylan-nl-idUSL3N1384O520151113?type=companyNews

Cohen has resolved U.S. charges related to insider trading, in an accord that clears the way for one of Wall Street's top investors to soon manage outside money even after his former firm pleaded guilty to fraud.Cohen accepted a two-year ban on managing outside money in a settlement announced on Friday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, possibly ending the long probe by the government into Cohen and his former firm SAC Capital Advisors.The accord is a victory for Cohen, 59, whose Stamford, Connecticut, firm, now called Point72 Asset Management, manages his roughly $11 billion fortune.It allows Cohen to resume managing money for outside investors as soon as Jan. 1, 2018, without the overhang of a potential lifetime ban. No fine was imposed.SAC, which once invested more than $14 billion, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2013 and paid $1.8 billion in criminal and civil settlements with U.S. authorities.Cohen agreed at the time to stop managing outside money. He was not criminally charged.In resolving a 2-1/2-year-old SEC administrative proceeding, Cohen did not admit or deny the regulator's findings that he failed to properly supervise former portfolio manager Mathew Martoma, who was convicted in February 2014 of insider trading.Friday's settlement ""achieves significant and immediate investor protection and deterrence, while ensuring that the activities of his funds are closely monitored going forward,"" Andrew Ceresney, head of the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement.IGNORING RED FLAGS  Prosecutors said Martoma, who worked at SAC's CR Intrinsic Investors unit, generated $275 million of illegal gains in 2008 by trading in Elan Corp and Wyeth shares, based on tips from a Michigan doctor about a clinical trial of an Alzheimer's drug that the companies were developing.Wyeth was bought by Pfizer Inc in 2009 and Elan by Perrigo Co in 2013.The SEC said Cohen ""ignored red flags"" indicating that Martoma might have had access to material nonpublic information about the clinical trial.It also said Cohen learned information from Martoma that ""should have caused a reasonable hedge fund manager to investigate"" whether insider trading was taking place.Martoma, 41, is appealing his conviction and nine-year prison term. The SEC case against Cohen became weaker after federal prosecutors last year abandoned their insider trading case against Michael Steinberg, another former SAC portfolio manager.Steinberg was convicted in December 2013, but prosecutors dropped the case after a later change in the law on insider trading.The SEC originally accused Cohen of having failed to properly supervise both Steinberg and Martoma.COHEN: SETTLEMENT OFFERS CERTAINTY Friday's settlement requires Cohen to retain an independent consultant to monitor Point72 for up to four years. One person who might serve is Bart Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor appointed as SAC's compliance consultant in the firm's criminal case, according to settlement papers.At SAC, Cohen delivered some of Wall Street's best returns over two decades, averaging roughly 30 percent annually.Point72 generated a 15.5 percent net return in 2015, a person familiar with the matter said, even as many other investors ended the year in the red.In a memo to Point72 employees seen by Reuters, Cohen pledged to pursue ""the highest ethical standards,"" after having vowed when SAC pleaded guilty that ""what happened to SAC would never happen to Point72.""He also said having the opportunity to eventually manage outside money ""does not necessarily mean"" he will do so.""Inevitably, some will ask why I agreed to settle,"" Cohen wrote.""The longer the pending litigation lingered, the more it distracted from the world-class Firm that we are building,"" he wrote.

""It allows us to stay on the cutting edge of being a leader of complex products.""Perrigo began operating in Israel and listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange when it bought pharmaceutical firm Agis Industries for $850 million in 2005. Perrigo fought off a $25 billion hostile takeover bid from rival Mylan NV last year, and Hendrickson said the company was not looking for any other buyers.""We aren't seeking anything like that. We feel we've got great stand-alone prospects,"" he said.With the Mylan saga behind it, he said the company was looking to buy back stock - up to $1.5 billion worth over the two to three years - and planned to continue with its own acquisitions. In the past several years, half of Perrigo's growth has come from mergers and acquisitions and the other half from expanding its existing business. ""We don't see that kind of a mix changing going forward,"" Hendrickson said.Perrigo's adjusted profit missed market estimates for the first time in more than a year in the fourth quarter, due to weaker than expected sales in its branded consumer healthcare business.  Perrigo had revenue of $1.42 billion in the fourth quarter, just shy of the average estimate of $1.46 billion.The shortfall was somewhat of a surprise, according to Hendrickson, who said the company remained in a strong position, due in part to its heavy investment in research and development.""We've got a pretty fruitful pipeline. When you look out I think over the next 2-1/2 years, 3 years we have about $1.2 billion of new products in our pipeline,"" he said.

""It allows us to stay on the cutting edge of being a leader of complex products.""Perrigo began operating in Israel and listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange when it bought pharmaceutical firm Agis Industries for $850 million in 2005. Perrigo fought off a $25 billion hostile takeover bid from rival Mylan NV last year, and Hendrickson said the company was not looking for any other buyers.""We aren't seeking anything like that. We feel we've got great stand-alone prospects,"" he said.With the Mylan saga behind it, he said the company was looking to buy back stock - up to $1.5 billion worth over the two to three years - and planned to continue with its own acquisitions. In the past several years, half of Perrigo's growth has come from mergers and acquisitions and the other half from expanding its existing business. ""We don't see that kind of a mix changing going forward,"" Hendrickson said.Perrigo's adjusted profit missed market estimates for the first time in more than a year in the fourth quarter, due to weaker than expected sales in its branded consumer healthcare business.  Perrigo had revenue of $1.42 billion in the fourth quarter, just shy of the average estimate of $1.46 billion.The shortfall was somewhat of a surprise, according to Hendrickson, who said the company remained in a strong position, due in part to its heavy investment in research and development.""We've got a pretty fruitful pipeline. When you look out I think over the next 2-1/2 years, 3 years we have about $1.2 billion of new products in our pipeline,"" he said.

128,"  Former Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N) head Joseph Papa was named Chief Executive Officer at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.TO) on Monday, a role in which investors said he should focus on returning the company to growth. Papa will replace CEO Michael Pearson, whose years of frenzied dealmaking fueled double-digit profit increases at Valeant until scrutiny of its controversial relationship with a specialty pharmacy and history of sharp drug price increases hit its shares and sales last fall.Shares of Laval, Quebec-based Valeant rose on Monday after it announced the high-profile hire before losing about 2.2 percent in New York trading to close at $35.16. Shares are far from their August 2015 high of $263.70, falling to the current level earlier this year after Valeant said it would restate earnings and delay filing its 2015 financial report, opening the door to possible default on its $30 billion in debt. Papa, 60, takes the reigns after a decade at Perrigo and previous positions at drug distributor Cardinal Health (CAH.N), generic drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals which is now Allergan Inc (AGN.N), and pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG (NOVN.S).Last year, he led Dublin, Ireland-based Perrigo to rebuff a $26 billion takeover by Mylan NV (MYL.O) and spent six months meeting with investors, urging them not to sell to Mylan. His meetings and a public letter campaign convinced shareholders that Perrigo should be a standalone company. Papa's track record helped his case, but recent months have been challenging and Perrigo said on Monday that its earnings and sales will fall short this year, disappointing shareholders. The shortfall is in part due to weak sales in Europe and its Omega Pharma acquisition, both part of Papa's strategy, said Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who downgraded the stock to market perform.Papa does not have significant experience in branded prescription drugs, Valeant's area of focus, Maris said. Perrigo sells over-the-counter products, which are a small part of Valeant's business. ""Perrigo has limited international business; Valeant has a lot,"" said Maris, who rates the stock ""underperform."" ""Perrigo has acquired a lot of products and divested very few; Valeantâs future probably has a lot of divestitures.""  Reuters reported earlier this month that Valeant had brought in investment banks to review its options amid buyout firms and other companies' interest in a number of its businesses. Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, which owns more than 2.3 million Valeant shares, said Papa's experience selling over-the-counter healthcare products would be an asset for the company's skincare and Bausch and Lomb eyecare lines. Kaser said one early priority should be repairing Valeantâs relationship with health insurance companies, which are steering patients away from the company's products. âJob One is slowing and stemming the damage,â he said. The news of the appointment, first reported by Reuters, pushed shares of Perrigo down more than 15 percent. The company replaced Papa with President John Hendrickson, a 27-year Perrigo veteran, and named director Laurie Brlas as chairman. Perrigo reported preliminary first-quarter earnings of $1.71 to $1.77 per share and said it expected a full-year profit of $8.20 to $8.60 per share, excluding special items. Both are below analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Valeant was looking for a replacement for Pearson for more than a month. He suddenly left in December on a medical leave for pneumonia and returned to Valeant at the end of February.

145,"  Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N) slashed its full-year earnings forecast for the second time, citing pricing pressure in its generic drugs business, sending its shares down as much as 13 percent and wiping out about $1.77 billion of market value.Perrigo's shares have halved since the company's stockholders rejected a $26 billion hostile bid from Netherlands-based Mylan NV (MYL.O) in November, raising concerns about the drugmaker's future as a standalone company.Dublin-based Perrigo, which also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit for the second time in three quarters, also said on Wednesday it had lower performance expectations for its branded consumer drugs business as it reorganizes.Chief Executive John Hendrickson has been working to stabilize Perrigo since he took over in May from longtime CEO Joseph Papa, who left to lead troubled Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N). Perrigo's announcement in May that it was cutting its forecast unleashed skepticism about Papa's tenure at Perrigo.  The latest forecast revision showed that things are not yet on the mend, said Wells Fargo analyst David Maris.""We were surprised by the magnitude of the guidance revision, given management's prior conviction in the business,"" Maris wrote in a client note. Perrigo, with its large portfolio of consumer products, infant formulas and over-the-counter generic topical drugs, has long been seen as a potential takeover target.The company, which had a market capitalization of $13.62 billion as of Tuesday's close, said it now expected adjusted earnings of $6.85-$7.15 per share for the year, down from its earlier estimate of $8.20-$8.60.

146,"  Aug 10 Perrigo Co Plc slashed its full-year earnings forecast for the second time, citing pricing pressure in its generic drugs business, sending its shares down as much as 13 percent and wiping out about $1.77 billion of market value.Perrigo's shares have halved since the company's stockholders rejected a $26 billion hostile bid from Netherlands-based Mylan NV in November, raising concerns about the drugmaker's future as a standalone company.Dublin-based Perrigo, which also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit for the second time in three quarters, also said on Wednesday it had lower performance expectations for its branded consumer drugs business as it reorganizes.Chief Executive John Hendrickson has been working to stabilize Perrigo since he took over in May from longtime CEO Joseph Papa, who left to lead troubled Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc . Perrigo's announcement in May that it was cutting its forecast unleashed skepticism about Papa's tenure at Perrigo.The latest forecast revision showed that things are not yet on the mend, said Wells Fargo analyst David Maris. ""We were surprised by the magnitude of the guidance revision, given management's prior conviction in the business,"" Maris wrote in a client note. Perrigo, with its large portfolio of consumer products, infant formulas and over-the-counter generic topical drugs, has long been seen as a potential takeover target.The company, which had a market capitalization of $13.62 billion as of Tuesday's close, said it now expected adjusted earnings of $6.85-$7.15 per share for the year, down from its earlier estimate of $8.20-$8.60.Up to Tuesday's close, Perrigo's stock had fallen 34 percent this year, making it the second-worst performing share in the S&P 500 healthcare index in percentage terms.

151,"   By Michael Flaherty | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Activist shareholder Starboard Value LP on Monday disclosed a 4.6 percent stake in Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N) and said the Dublin-based drugmaker must make immediate improvements to turn around its sagging stock price.Shares of Perrigo, whose market capitalization is around $13 billion, surged 7.3 percent to $95.15 in midday trading.The hedge fund delivered a scathing letter to Perrigo's chief executive officer, John Hendrickson, and its board on Monday, criticizing their performance since the company spurned a seven-month takeover effort by generic drug maker Mylan NV (MYL.O) late last year.Perrigo acknowledged receiving the letter and said it was looking forward to a ""constructive and productive dialogue"" with Starboard. Hendrickson replaced longtime CEO Joseph Papa, who left to head Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.N) in early May. Since then, Hendrickson has cut earnings expectations twice and said the company suffered during Papa's battle with Mylan.Papa, in the summer of 2015, convinced investors that they would be better off refusing Mylan's $205-per-share cash-and-stock offer, saying they could earn more if Perrigo stood alone.""Unfortunately, since that time, results have gone decidedly in the wrong direction, and management's promises have been woefully unfulfilled,"" Starboard said. Starboard said the drugmaker should consider hiring an investment bank for advice on selling non-core assets or broader strategic alternatives. The letter identifies Perrigo's prescription pharma business, known as Rx Pharmaceuticals, as one that would be attractive to other companies. It also said Perrigo should consider selling its stream of royalties from the drug Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis. ""The most likely angle is to drive a sale of both Rx/Tysabri, which could then lead to strategic interest in standalone Consumer,"" said RBC Capital in a research note on Monday. RBC has a ""sector perform"" rating on the stock. At a healthcare conference on Monday hosted by Morgan Stanley, Hendrickson said he has been reviewing all of Perrigo's businesses for potential divests since starting his new role earlier this year. He said that Tysabri was among the non-core assets that he was open to divesting, but he had not yet made a final decision. He added that a decision would be made soon. Hendrickson said he considers Perrigo's generics business core and that there are reasons for it to coexist with the over-the-counter business. Starboard often pushes for board representation and has started more campaigns this year against companies than any other activist shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. Starboard is currently seeking to control the board of another pharmaceutical company, Depomed Inc (DEPO.O), which successfully resisted a hostile bid from Horizon Pharmaceutical Corp (HZNP.O) last year. Starboard's letter also criticized Perrigo's management for spending $100 million to thwart Mylan's bid and for receiving bonuses for its successful defense while the company's stock has dropped 50 percent since the offer.The fund acknowledged Hendrickson's brief role as CEO but pointed out his long tenure at the company and indicated it would not be patient in awaiting a more detailed plan for changes.
