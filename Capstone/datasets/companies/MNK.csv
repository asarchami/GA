Yellen also said that while the unemployment rate has fallen recently, labor market conditions needed to improve further.""Nothing unexpected was said, but the market is very encouraged to hear it confirmed that the policy of being accommodative will continue,"" said Weyman Gong, chief investment strategist at Signature in Norfolk, Virginia.The policies have been credited with fueling the market's steep gains in 2013, and they are expected to keep a floor under equity prices for as long as they continue.The Fed first announced a slowing in the bond-buying program in December, followed by another one in January. Had that pace been slowed, it may have raised concerns that the economy was still not strong enough to grow on its own.

9,"   By Esha Dey  Specialty pharmaceuticals company Mallinckrodt Plc will buy drugmaker Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $5.6 billion to gain access to its multiple sclerosis drug, Acthar Gel, which is set to hit sales of $1 billion this year.The acquisition is Dublin-based Mallinckrodt's second in less than two months as it pushes into the lucrative specialty drugs market, which focuses on complex and chronic diseases.Mallinckrodt's shareholders took a dim view of the deal, however, pushing the company's shares down as much as 10 percent.Questcor has been facing federal probes into its marketing practices related to Acthar and multiple accusations from short-seller Citron Research.The company's shareholders will receive $30 in cash and 0.897 Mallinckrodt shares for each share held, for a total value of about $86.10 per Questcor share, the companies said in a statement on Monday.Questcor's shares were trading at $77 on the Nasdaq on Monday afternoon. Mallinckrodt was down 6 percent at $58.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.The deal - the latest in a series of acquisitions structured to take advantage of Ireland's low corporate tax rate - represents a 27 percent premium to Questcor's Friday close.Acthar is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 19 conditions, many of which are associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis and infantile spasms.""We currently expect solid double-digit revenue growth for Acthar to continue in the future, driven by educational efforts and further expansion into indications currently on the Acthar label,"" Mallinckrodt Chief Executive Mark Trudeau said on a conference call. Almost all of Questcor's revenue comes from the drug, which had annual sales of about $760 million in 2013, an increase of about 50 percent from 2012. The company acquired the drug from Aventis for $100,000 in 2001.Questcor's stock fell to below $20 in September 2012 as U.S. government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, launched investigations into the company's marketing practices and health insurer Aetna Inc cut reimbursement for the drug. The investigations are still on.The company has also faced repeated accusations from short-seller Citron Research regarding the drug's high price and Acthar's composition.The injectable drug, a formulation of pituitary hormones extracted from pigs, is priced at about $30,000 per vial.Acthar is expected to touch $1.9 billion in sales in 2018, according to Thomson Reuters data. Originally developed as a treatment for infantile spasms, Acthar has an orphan drug exclusivity until October 15, 2017 for the indication.FAIR VALUE? The deal values Questcor at 12 times forward earnings, well below the median of 18.4 for the broader pharmaceutical industry, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.In the 12 months to Friday's close, Questcor's stock had risen more than 125 percent. Still, the stock trades at a strong discount to its median 10-year historical price-to-earnings ratio.Stocks of several high-growth biotechnology companies, which led a rally in the broader market in 2013, fell on Friday, making investors anxious about how much further they may fall. Barclays analyst Ying Huang said the recent selloff in biotech stocks puts more companies in the ""sweet spot,"" with a market capitalization of $1 billion to $10 billion, where potential acquirers might give them a look.Big pharmaceutical companies facing patent expirations still need to replenish pipelines, he said.Mallinckrodt, which traces its roots back to 1840 in St. Louis, Missouri, makes drugs for pain management, cerebral and spinal spasticity, inflammatory diseases and depression. It also makes generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients.The company, which bought Cadence Pharmaceuticals Inc for $1.3 billion in February, had revenue of $2.2 billion in 2013.Mallinckrodt, which was spun off from Covidien Plc in July last year, said it expected the deal to add to adjusted earnings in 2014 and significantly boost adjusted profit in 2015.Mallinckrodt will fund the deal through cash on hand and debt financing from Barclays, which also advised the company. The deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter.Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox were Mallinckrodt's legal advisers in Ireland.Centerview Partners was Questcor's financial adviser, and Latham & Watkins LLP and Matheson were its legal advisers in Ireland.(Additional reporting by Susan Kelly; Editing by Kirti Pandey and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",2014-04-07,MNK,"Mon Apr 7, 2014 | 2:48pm EDT",Mallinckrodt to buy Questcor for lucrative MS drug,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-questcor-offer-idUSBREA360O320140407?type=companyNews

Inc  off 3.5 percent at $33.07. The Global X Social Media ETF which includes Groupon Inc and LinkedIn  fell 2.5 percent.The Nasdaq index posted its worst three-day decline since November 2011. But the biotechnology sector, which saw sharp declines in the past several sessions, ended higher with the Nasdaq biotech sector index up 0.5 percent at 2,367.94.Selling pressure migrated to other sectors, with only defensives such as utilities and consumer staples  in positive territory among the 10 major S&P sectors.""This type of market behavior (buyers favoring defensive names) suggests investors are turning cautious again after the big gains in stocks during the past year,"" said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.""We remain long-term positive on the U.S. economy and the U.S. stock market but expect increased volatility risk this spring and summer."" The CBOE Volatility index VIX, often used to gauge investor sentiment on Wall Street, jumped 11.5 percent to 15.56.

Pfizer Inc, down 3 percent to $31.20, added pressure to the Dow and S&P 500. The company's experimental breast cancer drug in a clinical trial nearly doubled the amount of time patients lived without their disease getting worse, but overall survival was not yet shown to be statistically significant, researchers said.Earnings season gets under way this week, with results due from financials JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co , as well as retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond.S&P 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1.2 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.A lackluster first-quarter earnings season hurt by a harsh winter could spark a pullback, some analysts said, with investors more optimistic for the second quarter.Specialty pharmaceuticals company Mallinckrodt Plc  agreed to buy drugmaker Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc  for about $5.6 billion to gain access to its multiple sclerosis drug, Acthar Gel.

12,"  * To pay $86.10 per Questcor share, a premium of 27 pct* MS drug Acthar Gel sales expected to hit $1.9 bln in 2018* Mallinckrodt shares fall as much as 10 pct   (Adds analyst comment, updates shares)By Esha DeyApril 7 Specialty pharmaceuticals company Mallinckrodt Plc will buy drugmaker Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $5.6 billion to gain access to its multiple sclerosis drug, Acthar Gel, which is set to hit sales of $1 billion this year.The acquisition is Dublin-based Mallinckrodt's second in less than two months as it pushes into the lucrative specialty drugs market, which focuses on complex and chronic diseases.Mallinckrodt's shareholders took a dim view of the deal, however, pushing the company's shares down as much as 10 percent.Questcor has been facing federal probes into its marketing practices related to Acthar and multiple accusations from short-seller Citron Research.The company's shareholders will receive $30 in cash and 0.897 Mallinckrodt shares for each share held, for a total value of about $86.10 per Questcor share, the companies said in a statement on Monday.Questcor's shares were trading at $77 on the Nasdaq on Monday afternoon. Mallinckrodt was down 6 percent at $58.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.The deal - the latest in a series of acquisitions structured to take advantage of Ireland's low corporate tax rate - represents a 27 percent premium to Questcor's Friday close. Acthar is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 19 conditions, many of which are associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis and infantile spasms.""We currently expect solid double-digit revenue growth for Acthar to continue in the future, driven by educational efforts and further expansion into indications currently on the Acthar label,"" Mallinckrodt Chief Executive Mark Trudeau said on a conference call.Almost all of Questcor's revenue comes from the drug, which had annual sales of about $760 million in 2013, an increase of about 50 percent from 2012. The company acquired the drug from Aventis for $100,000 in 2001.Questcor's stock fell to below $20 in September 2012 as U.S. government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, launched investigations into the company's marketing practices and health insurer Aetna Inc cut  reimbursement for the drug. The investigations are still on.The company has also faced repeated accusations from short-seller Citron Research regarding the drug's high price and Acthar's composition.The injectable drug, a formulation of pituitary hormones extracted from pigs, is priced at about $30,000 per vial. Acthar is expected to touch $1.9 billion in sales in 2018, according to Thomson Reuters data.Originally developed as a treatment for infantile spasms, Acthar has an orphan drug exclusivity until Oct. 15, 2017 for the indication.FAIR VALUE? The deal values Questcor at 12 times forward earnings, well below the median of 18.4 for the broader pharmaceutical industry, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. In the 12 months to Friday's close, Questcor's stock had risen more than 125 percent. Still, the stock trades at a strong discount to its median 10-year historical price-to-earnings ratio.Stocks of several high-growth biotechnology companies, which led a rally in the broader market in 2013, fell on Friday, making investors anxious about how much further they may fall.Barclays analyst Ying Huang said the recent selloff in biotech stocks puts more companies in the ""sweet spot,"" with a market capitalization of $1 billion to $10 billion, where potential acquirers might give them a look.Big pharmaceutical companies facing patent expirations still need to replenish pipelines, he said.Mallinckrodt, which traces its roots back to 1840 in St. Louis, Missouri, makes drugs for pain management, cerebral and spinal spasticity, inflammatory diseases and depression. It also makes generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients.The company, which bought Cadence Pharmaceuticals Inc  for $1.3 billion in February, had revenue of $2.2 billion in 2013.Mallinckrodt, which was spun off from Covidien Plc  in July last year, said it expected the deal to add to adjusted earnings in 2014 and significantly boost adjusted profit in 2015.Mallinckrodt will fund the deal through cash on hand and debt financing from Barclays, which also advised the company. The deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter.Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox were Mallinckrodt's legal advisers in Ireland.Centerview Partners was Questcor's financial adviser, and Latham & Watkins LLP and Matheson were its legal advisers in Ireland.

22,"   By Vidya L Nathan and Greg Roumeliotis  Dublin-based drugmaker Mallinckrodt Plc strengthened its presence in U.S. hospitals as it agreed to buy privately held Ikaria Inc, a maker of a respiratory drug and its delivery system, for $2.3 billion.Shares of Mallinckrodt, a seller of generics, specialty drugs and medical imaging agents, jumped as much as 6.7 percent to a record $123.95.The deal gives Mallinckrodt access to INOmax, which Ikeria says is the only approved product to treat hypoxic respiratory failure in infants. The device that delivers nitric oxide has been available in the market for about a decade and a half.Hypoxic respiratory failure affects about 25,000-30,000 babies born each year in the United States. INOmax currently caters to about half of that population, Mallinckrodt CEO Mark Trudeau said in a call on Thursday.Ikaria, owned by a group of investors led by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, is testing INOmax for treating other breathing difficulties and a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and heart. Madison Dearborn will get 2.8 times the $224 million it invested in Hampton, New Jersey-based Ikaria a little over a year ago, a person familiar with the matter said. New Mountain Capital, which invested about $220 million in 2007, will receive as much as $880 million, other people familiar with the matter said.Analysts from at least three brokerages — BMO Capital, Leerink Swann and Oppenheimer & Co — said the deal made sense for Mallinckrodt. The deal comes a year after Mallinckrodt, spun off from Covidien Plc in 2013, bought Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion.Mallinckrodt, which claims to have its products in almost every U.S. hospital, diagnostic imaging center and pharmacy, said it expects Ikeria to add at least $150 million to its sales and 25 cents to earnings per share for the year ending September. Mallinckrodt, which recorded sales of $866.3 million in its first quarter ended Dec. 26, plans to fund the deal with a combination of cash on hand and debt.Goldman Sachs is Mallinckrodt's financial adviser, and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox in Ireland its legal advisers. Ikaria's legal adviser is Kirkland & Ellis LLP.Mallinckrodt shares were up 4.3 percent at $121.18 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.

26,"  Jordan's Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc (HIK.L) has emerged as a bidder for German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim's generics unit Roxane Labs, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Other bidders for the U.S.-based Boehringer unit include Mallinckrodt Plc (MNK.N) and Perrigo Co (PRGO.N), and a decision could be made within weeks for a sale that could fetch as much as 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), Bloomberg reported. (bloom.bg/1NqCMdX)However, there is a possibility that the company may choose to retain the asset, Bloomberg reported.A spokesman for Perrigo declined to comment. Representatives at Hikma, Boehringer and Mallinckrodt were immediately not available for comment.   In January, Reuters reported that Boehringer, Germany's second largest drug maker, was considering a sale of Roxane to put a stronger focus on the development and sale of new pharmaceuticals.A company spokeswoman at the time said that Boehringer was not a specialist in generics and was therefore considering whether it made more sense for a generics specialist to own Roxane Labs. Roxane's activities include the development and marketing of Boehringer's generic drugs. It also has a production site making both generic drugs and some of Boehringer's patent-protected drugs.Boehringer had sales of 13.3 billion euros in 2014, of which 76 percent was from prescription medicines.

28,"  Drugmaker Mallinckrodt Plc (MNK.N) agreed to buy immunotherapy company Therakos Inc in a $1.33 billion deal, its second major acquisition this year to bolster its presence in hospitals.Therakos's flagship system is used to treat symptoms associated with a common form of blood cancer in patients who have been unresponsive to prior treatments.The platform is used by academic medical centers, hospitals and treatment centers in more than 25 countries.Devices based on Therakos's technology are the world's only approved fully integrated systems for extracorporeal photopheresis, or ECP, in which blood is treated with a photosensitizing agent and irradiated with light.Shares of Mallinckrodt, which makes generic and specialty drugs as well as medical imaging agents, were little changed in afternoon trading on Monday.Dublin-based Mallinckrodt said it would focus on selling more of Therakos's devices in the United States, where it is approved only for a form of blood cancer.Outside the United States, the device is also used to treat Crohn's disease, among other applications.Mallinckrodt's purchase of Therakos from investment firm Gores Group adds to its line of products that cater to surgical pain management and respiratory therapies in neonatal intensive care units.Mallinckrodt, spun off from Covidien Plc in 2013, has relied on acquisitions to fuel growth. Last year, it bought Questcor Pharmaceuticals for about $5.9 billion and Cadence Pharmaceuticals for about $1.3 billion.Mallinckrodt said in March it would buy privately held Ikaria Inc, a maker of a respiratory drug and its delivery system, for $2.3 billion. The Ikaria deal gave Mallinckrodt access to INOMAX, the only approved product to treat hypoxic respiratory failure in infants.The Therakos acquisition fits with the INOMAX buy, Mallinckrodt executives said on a call with analysts. Mallinckrodt plans to sell Therakos's devices to hospitals already using INOMAX and expects to generate sales of $500 million or more annually.Mallinckrodt will finance the acquisition with cash and debt.It said it expected the deal to add at least 10 cents per share to adjusted profit in 2016, assuming a close in late fiscal 2015 ending September.Gores Group bought Therakos from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc, a former subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), in 2012. Barclays advised Mallinckrodt on the deal, while Jefferies was Therakos's adviser. Up to Friday's close, Mallinckrodt's shares had risen 47 percent in the past 12 months, outperforming an 8 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index .SPX.(This version of the story corrects to ""blood"" from ""skin"" cancer in second and sixth paragraphs)     (Reporting by Natalie Grover and Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Savio D'Souza and Don Sebastian)",2015-08-10,MNK,"Mon Aug 10, 2015 | 6:34pm EDT",Mallinckrodt buys immunotherapy maker Therakos in $1.33 billion deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-therakos-m-a-mallinckrodt-idUSKCN0QF0ZX20150810?type=companyNews

30,"  Shares of Mallinckrodt Plc closed down 17 percent after short-seller Citron Research called the drugmaker ""a far worse offender of the reimbursement system"" in a tweet.Earlier in October, Citron had accused Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc of using specialty pharmacies to inflate revenue.""The market has been so focused on Valeant that they forgot about other platform companies, which are levered and face the same headwinds in reimbursement,"" Citron's Andrew Left said in an email.Shares of Valeant are down more than 40 percent since the short seller published its report on the company on Oct. 21.Specialty pharmacies are designed to handle complex medications such as cancer drugs, which require careful handling, storage and distribution. However, Valeant has used such pharmacies to sell more conventional medicines directly to patients to get past limits on a drug's use imposed by insurers or retail pharmacies.Citron indicated that it would disclose more in a report on Mallinckrodt, but did not say when it would be published.

36,"  Shares of Mallinckrodt Plc (MNK.N) closed down 17 percent after short-seller Citron Research called the drugmaker ""a far worse offender of the reimbursement system"" in a tweet.Earlier in October, Citron had accused Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) of using specialty pharmacies to inflate revenue.""The market has been so focused on Valeant that they forgot about other platform companies, which are levered and face the same headwinds in reimbursement,"" Citron's Andrew Left said in an email.Shares of Valeant are down more than 40 percent since the short seller published its report on the company on Oct. 21.Specialty pharmacies are designed to handle complex medications such as cancer drugs, which require careful handling, storage and distribution. However, Valeant has used such pharmacies to sell more conventional medicines directly to patients to get past limits on a drug's use imposed by insurers or retail pharmacies.Citron indicated that it would disclose more in a report on Mallinckrodt, but did not say when it would be published.
