1,"  By Avik Das and Jessica ToonkelJan 16 RCS Capital Corp on Thursday announced it would buy independent broker-dealer Cetera Financial Group from private equity firm Lightyear Capital LLC for about $1.15 billion in cash to expand its retail brokerage business.New York-based Lightyear Capital, which is run by former Paine Webber Group Inc Chief Executive Officer Donald Marron, created Cetera in 2010 when it acquired three ING  broker-dealers.Over the years, Lightyear has continued to build Cetera through acquisitions. Just last year, it acquired two brokerage firms from MetLife Inc. Today the firm  provides broker-dealer and advisory services to about 6,500 independent financial professionals as well as financial institutions. RCS, which has been an aggressive acquirer over the past few months, approached Lightyear several times last year about buying Cetera, Marron said. But it was not until right before Christmas that Lightyear took the offer seriously, he said.""They said Cetera's management would remain as it is and they asked if they could make a preemptive bid,"" Marron told Reuters in an interview. ""Price is important to private equity, but also is the firm (so) its value is in Valerie Brown and her team."" Cetera Chief Executive Valerie Brown will continue to operate Cetera.This is the fourth brokerage acquisition by New York-based RCS Capital, which just went public in June, in the last four months. It bought Summit Financial Services for $49 million in November and Investor Capital Holdings for about $52.5 million in October. It also bought Hatteras Funds Group in the same month for an undisclosed amount.The company's investment banking arm and Barclays  were its financial advisers, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch  advised Cetera.The transaction is expected to close in the later part of 2014.RCS Capital's shares were trading at $19.10, up over 3 percent in late afternoon trading, the New York Stock Exchange.",2014-01-16,MET,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 3:30pm EST",UPDATE 2-RCS Capital to buy broker-dealer Cetera for $1.15 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/rcscapital-cetera-idUSL3N0KQ4HD20140116?type=companyNews

6,"  March 9 MetLife Inc is by some measures one of the cheapest Standard & Poor's 500 stocks, and its shares could rise because the largest publicly-traded U.S. life insurer has a attractive global franchise and astute management, and may hike its dividend significantly, Barron's said in its March 10 edition.With a stock price of $53.15, MetLife trades at just 9.3 times projected 2014 profit of $5.70 per share and 8.7 times projected 2015 profit of $6.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Barron's said the 2015 projection is the lowest in the life insurance industry, and that fewer than 10 companies in the S&P 500 have lower ratios. Two with similar ratios are insurers Prudential Financial Inc and Lincoln Financial Corp .In addition, MetLife is trading at just 1.1 times book value per share excluding unrealized investment gains, also among the lowest in the S&P 500, Barron's said. Fans say the stock price could rise above $60, and that the company known for its blimp and for advertising featuring Snoopy and other ""Peanuts"" characters could benefit from both a rising stock market and higher interest rates.According to the newspaper, part of the reason for the low price is MetLife's refusal to buy back stock, as it awaits U.S. regulatory decisions on capital requirements and whether it will be declared a ""systemically important financial institution,"" a label that several of the nation's biggest banks already carry. But the newspaper said Chief Executive Steven Kandarian has made reducing risk a priority, cutting back in variable annuities and halting sales of products such as new long-term care insurance policies and one type of universal life insurance. Meanwhile, rising stocks boost potential profit from equity-sensitive annuities, and rising rates could help MetLife more affordably fund fixed-rate products and cut risk on offerings that guarantee investors minimum returns, the newspaper said.Even if growth slows in the United States, MetLife has a cushion because 30 percent of its profit comes from other countries, and the overseas business is growing faster than the U.S. business, the newspaper said.MetLife's annual $1.10 per share dividend equates to a 2.1 percent dividend yield, and Barron's said it could approach $1.50 per share in 2015, or nearly 3 percent based on the current stock price.",2014-03-09,MET,"Sun Mar 9, 2014 | 1:03pm EDT",Investors who get MetLife may find it pays -Barron's,http://www.reuters.com//article/metlife-barrons-idUSL2N0M60CO20140309?type=companyNews
7,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  Two former brokers for MetLife Securities Inc, a unit of MetLife Inc, allegedly engaged in a seven-year scheme to inflate commissions by having customers switch $21 million in annuities, Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog has alleged in a civil complaint.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) filed the regulatory complaint against Christopher Birli and Patrick Chapin, who both worked for MetLife in Williamsville, New York, until 2012. The two focused on advising employees of the State University of New York who participated in its retirement plan, FINRA alleged in a March 27 complaint.Birli did not immediately return a phone call requesting comment. Chapin did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Efforts to reach Chapin by telephone were not successful.MetLife, which is not alleged to have engaged in any wrongdoing, terminated Birli and Chapin in 2012, according to filings. Neither presently work in the securities industry, according to filings.MetLife declined to comment on the complaints against the former brokers but said it maintains a comprehensive compliance procedure. The two former MetLife brokers, between 2004 and 2007, allegedly recommended that 45 of their customers switch MetLife variable annuities held in their retirement accounts with new variable annuities held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) outside the university plan, said FINRA.Birli and Chapin structured the deals in a way to circumvent a MetLife policy that generally prohibited exchanging the two types of variable annuities in the transactions, FINRA alleged. The brokers advised clients to first cash in their retirement plan annuities and buy another security within the plan to hold for 90 days. Clients would then sell that security to buy a variable annuity through an IRA, according to FINRA. The scheme generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions, FINRA said.FINRA's complaint is the first step in a disciplinary proceeding that could lead to civil penalties against the former brokers, including suspending or barring them from the securities business. The former brokers will have an opportunity to dispute the allegations before a FINRA hearing officer.A variable annuity is a type of insurance product that offers investors steady income payments, typically in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Payments can grow if financial markets do well because they are tied to an investment portfolio, usually consisting of mutual funds holding stocks and bonds. Brokers are well rewarded for selling variable annuities, in part because of their high commissions, as much as 8 percent.The alleged scheme subjected investors to unnecessary risks, FINRA said. For example, the new annuity contracts tied up the investors' funds for as much as seven years, FINRA said. Some customers also had to pay fees to cash in their initial annuities, FINRA said.Birli and Chapin allegedly concealed the nature of their scheme from MetLife by submitting ""false and misleading"" paperwork to MetLife and using their personal email addresses to communicate to customers, FINRA said.(Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Eric Walsh)",2014-03-31,MET,"Mon Mar 31, 2014 | 7:49pm EDT",Wall Street watchdog alleges annuity scheme by two ex-MetLife brokers,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-finra-annuities-idUSBREA2U1PU20140331?type=companyNews

18,"  SHANGHAI May 6 The China venture of U.S. life insurer Metlife Inc has become the first foreign-backed insurance firm to receive regulatory approval to set up a branch in Shanghai's free trade zone.The approval was announced by Sino-US United Metlife Insurance Co Ltd, jointly operated by state-owned Shanghai Lianhe Investment Co and Metlife, on its official microblog on Monday.The move comes nearly eight months after the free trade zone was launched, receiving considerable attention from overseas firms and hailed as potentially one of China's boldest reforms in decades. However, that hype has cooled amid a lack of specific policy details since the initial fanfare. Foreign banks, such as Citigroup Inc < and HSBC Holdings PLC, have set up branches in the free trade zone but many foreign companies have been reluctant to follow suit citing a lack of clarity over what they exactly will be allowed to do in the zone. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission has said insurance firms will be allowed to enjoy looser restrictions on offshore investment and yuan-dominated cross-border reinsurance businesses compared with operations on the mainland, although no details have been published so far. Foreign insurers are only allowed to operate in China, including the free trade zone, through joint ventures with local partners.(Reporting By Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Kazunori Takada and Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-05-06,MET,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 3:28am EDT",Metlife wins first approval for foreign insurer branch in Shanghai free trade zone,http://www.reuters.com//article/metlife-china-idUSL3N0NS0QM20140506?type=companyNews

40,"  (Adds MetLife comment)By Emily StephensonWASHINGTON, Sept 30 The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced plans to study the potential effects of forcing big insurance companies to meet tough funding restrictions required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.The Wall Street oversight law directed regulators to identify big non-bank financial firms that could pose risks to the U.S. financial system. Those companies are regulated by the Fed and must meet capital requirements comparable to those for big U.S. banks.Insurers American International Group and Prudential Financial have already received this designation, and regulators are considering also applying it to MetLife. Those companies and other big insurers argue that bank-style capital requirements, which are limits on debt funding, do not fit their businesses and should be adapted.The Fed on Tuesday said it would study the issue to ""better understand how to design a capital framework for insurance holding companies it supervises"" under the Dodd-Frank law. ""This is a welcome step in the right direction,"" MetLife spokesman Christopher Stern said. ""Done properly, this study could go a long way toward helping the Federal Reserve understand the negative consequences of imposing bank-centric rules on life insurance companies and consumers.""Lawmakers from both side of the aisle have pressed the Fed to tailor its capital requirements for insurers. Regulators have yet not proposed rules for Fed-regulated nonbank firms. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo told a Senate panel earlier this month that the regulator could tailor capital rules for insurance products that are not offered by banks, but lawmakers must revise Dodd-Frank if they want substantially different requirements for insurers.The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives both want to change the wording of Dodd-Frank regarding capital rules for insurers, but the two chambers have approved different bills. So far, they have not agreed on a single plan.The Fed said on Tuesday that it contacted insurance firms about its study and asked them to provide data by Dec. 31.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  MetLife, Inc.'s (MetLife) $1 billion senior unsecured debentures as follows: --$500 million of 1.903% Series E senior component debentures tranche 1 due  2017; --$500 million of 4.721% Series E senior component debentures tranche 2 due  2044. MetLife will remarket $999,848,000 of the debentures ($499,924,000 of each  tranche), with holders of $76,000 of each tranche electing not to participate in  the remarketing.   Fitch affirmed all of MetLife's existing ratings on Aug. 11, 2014 with a Stable  Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS The offering represents the scheduled remarketing of the Series E senior debt  associated with the outstanding common equity units issued by MetLife in  November 2010 as part of the financing of the acquisition of American Life  Insurance Company and Delaware American Life Insurance Company (collectively,  ALICO). Proceeds of the remarketing will be used by the holders of the common  equity units to settle stock purchase contracts associated with the units.  Fitch expects the $1 billion of net proceeds realized by MetLife upon the  settlement of the stock purchase contracts to be used for general corporate  purposes. Fitch's view of MetLife's financial leverage is not affected by this  transaction. The company's financial leverage ratio was 26% as of June 30, 2014.  Financial leverage has declined from a recent high of approximately 30% in the  third quarter of 2010 (3Q'10), shortly before its acquisition of ALICO. MetLife's ratings reflect Fitch's view that the company's strong balance sheet  fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very strong market positions  in several major insurance product lines, markets in the U.S. and select  international markets, are consistent with rating expectations. Fitch believes  that the company's large-scale, very strong brand name, and large and diverse  distribution capabilities provide significant competitive advantages.  Fitch's primary rating concerns include MetLife's above-average, albeit  moderating exposure to the variable annuity business, above-average investment  risk, and macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate  environment.  MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's strong  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch notes that  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  is considered strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's  domestic life insurance subsidiaries (excluding ALICO) reported combined  statutory total adjusted capital of approximately $24 billion and risk-based  capital (RBC) of 430% at year-end 2013. The company's domestic life insurance  subsidiaries reported a combined statutory net operating gain of approximately  $2.6 billion in 2013.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2013, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers.  MetLife's GAAP interest coverage has improved significantly over the past five  years due primarily to solid growth in operating earnings. Interest expense has  also been slowly declining since 2011. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio to be between 7x and 8x for full-year 2014 on a normalized basis  on fairly stable earnings performance.  Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has experienced  significant improvement in operating earnings. Earnings have been bolstered in  part by growing asset-based fees driven by attractive capital market  performance, relatively stable interest margins, which have benefited from  active management of crediting rates and interest rate hedges, as well as  international acquisition activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in  4Q'10. Fitch expects GAAP return on equity (ROE) to remain in the area of 12% in  2014 as continued growth in fee income and solid earnings from International  operations are at least partially offset by pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large, albeit declining, size of its variable  annuity business. Fitch notes that the company's variable annuity hedging  program is robust and did perform well during the financial crisis. However, the  hedging of variable annuity risk requires the company to make policyholder  behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Deviations from pricing and  hedging assumptions could have a material negative impact on MetLife's capital  and earnings in a severe but unexpected scenario. On Sept. 4, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Board (FSOC) announced that  it had voted to preliminarily designate MetLife a non-bank systematically  important financial institution (SIFI), which could result in more stringent  oversight by the Federal Reserve. Although the specifics of the enhanced  supervision to which non-bank SIFIs will be subject have not been finalized, it  is likely that it will include higher capital requirements. MetLife has 30 days  following the announcement to request a hearing to contest the decision before  it becomes final, and Fitch believes that the company will do so. Fitch expects  such a designation to be credit neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC RBC ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC RBC ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio below 5x. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: MetLife, Inc. --1.903% Series E senior component debentures due 2017 'A-'; --4.721% Series E senior component debentures due 2044 'A-'.

The designations are part of an effort to rein in the largest and most risky firms after the credit crisis showed how the collapse of one such firm could roil global markets.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act identifies all banks with over $50 billion in assets as ""systemic"", but left it to FSOC to determine whether some non-banks also deserve the tag. So far FSOC has tapped two insurers - Prudential  and AIG - for the designation which has subjected them to supervision by the Federal Reserve on top of existing oversight by state regulators. GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric, has also been put in the category.(Reporting by Douwe Miedema; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-10-28,MET,"Tue Oct 28, 2014 | 3:38pm EDT",US insurer MetLife to contest super-risky tag Monday,http://www.reuters.com//article/metlife-supervision-treasury-idUSL1N0SN24G20141028?type=companyNews

All times in ET/GMT)   The Federal Reserve wraps up a two-day meeting that appears certain to end with an announcement that the U.S. central bank's bond-buying stimulus is coming to a close. Less certain is what Fed officials might say about the outlook for the economy and inflation, given an uncertain global backdrop that has led investors to reappraise when the central bank will be able to finally raise interest rates.    Visa Inc, the world's largest credit and debit card company, is expected to report a fourth-quarter profit, helped by higher spending by customers using its cards. The company is looking to capitalize on the growing mobile payment business, as it has been gaining traction among businesses and consumers alike. Visa, which partnered with Apple for its Apple Pay service, also launched online offerings like Visa Checkout and Visa Token. Visa lowered its full-year revenue forecast in July, citing slow growth in cross-border transactions.  Global investment bank Deutsche Bank AG reports third-quarter results. Investment banking roared back to life in the quarter, but costs for fines and settlements are likely to have hit Germany's top lender hard.  Barrick Gold Corp, the world's biggest gold producer, is expected to report lower third-quarter results on a weaker gold price and a fall in gold production after the sale of some of its higher-cost gold mines. The market's focus is likely to be on the way forward for Barrick following a number of key executive changes, including the elimination of its chief executive position. There will also likely be questions about Barrick's assertion that a higher royalty rate in Zambia could threaten the economic viability of its Lumwana copper mine.  Canadian miners Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd and Yamana Gold Inc are expected to report third-quarter earnings. The market will likely be looking for updated commentary on Agnico's outlook for 2015, news on expansions at the Goldex and Kittila mines and any further scope for acquisitions following the purchase of Mexico-focused miner Cayden. Yamana's results are expected to be relatively low key, after the company announced preliminary production results earlier in the month that were in line with expectations. World's second-biggest uranium miner Cameco Corp reports third-quarter results, following a challenging period. Canada's biggest diversified metals company, Teck Resources Ltd, is expected to report lower third-quarter earnings on weaker coal and base metals prices, with the market's focus on the impact of China's recent decision to reimpose import tariffs on metallurgical and thermal coal.   French oil company Total SA reports third-quarter results. The impact of the sharp drop in oil prices since June should start hurting, although a drop in the euro could temper that somewhat.  Whiting Petroleum Corp, on the verge of buying Kodiak Oil & Gas to become North Dakota's largest oil producer, is expected to post a spike in third-quarter profit thanks to increased drilling.  U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit. The company, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, will also be expected to give a pulse check on Obamacare.   Life insurer MetLife Inc is expected to report a rise in third-quarter profit, helped by derivative gains linked to credit spreads. The company, heavily exposed to persistently low U.S. interest rates, has a large derivatives program designed to reduce that risk. Last month, the Financial Stability Oversight Council proposed to designate the insurer as ""systemically important,"" which could subject it to stricter oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve. MetLife, which has vehemently opposed the proposal, has decided to contest the decision.  Allstate Corp's estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss for the third quarter is expected to be about $517 million, down significantly from $936 million in the preceding quarter. The largest listed U.S. home and auto insurer has been raising insurance rates in its home insurance business to offset catastrophe losses and low interest rates on its investments. Chief Executive Thomas Wilson said Allstate's focus this year would be to attract customers to boost its market share rather than go for ""abnormally large"" price increases.  Department chain operator Kohl's Corp's leadership team will host an investor conference to present their ""multi-year growth"" plans. Kohl's had said it expects third-quarter comparable sales to decrease 1.4 percent, hurt by weak demand for women's apparel. The company also said its 2014 earnings would be at the low end of its prior forecast of $4.05-$4.45 per share and that sales remained softer through October.   Hershey Co, which makes Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, is likely to report a third-quarter profit above analysts' average expectations, according to StarMine. Investors will be looking for indications on how the price increase has impacted sales, particularly as rival Mondelez International had to cut 2014 sales targets in August after price hikes to cover commodity costs sparked a backlash by consumers and retailers in some European markets.  After a slide in its shares this year, Eaton Corp will try to win back investors when it reports third-quarter results. The manufacturer of power systems and products has faced concerns about its markets and disappointed some investors when it signaled earlier this year that it would not spin off its vehicle business, as some on Wall Street had hoped.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co's results have been pressured this year, first from a severe U.S. winter that hurt auto demand and then by lower sales of its high-margin tires to automakers. The company has also sold fewer tires in Latin America, which has been hurt by lower vehicle production in Brazil and economic turmoil in Venezuela. These trends have also pinched rivals Bridgestone Corp and Michelin. Goodyear is the first of the group to report third-quarter results and investors will be watching for commentary on global auto production going into next year.  SunPower Corp, the second-largest solar panel maker in the United States, is expected to report a lower third-quarter profit. Uneven revenue recognition from solar projects has been weighing on the company's results. The company is now diversifying into installation of solar panels on rooftops, a market dominated by SolarCity. Investors will look to see if SunPower will continue to lease out panels to customers, or adopt other financing methods. Also of interest to investors will be the formation of a yield co.   Akamai Technologies Inc, whose networks help improve the quality and speed of content delivery, is likely to report third-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine. Akamai is benefiting from higher consumption of online video and streaming music and the company had forecast current-quarter profit and revenue largely above estimates. However, higher spending on sales, marketing and research and development may impact profit as the company is investing more on developing higher margin services to compete with rivals.  Network equipment makers JDS Uniphase Corp and F5 Networks Inc are scheduled to report first-quarter and fourth-quarter results, respectively. JDS Uniphase's profit is expected to beat the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine data. F5 Networks is also expected to report results slightly above the average analyst estimate, according to StarMine.   Chipmakers RF Micro Devices Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc are expected to report second-quarter profit above estimates, according to StarMine data, helped by record sales of Apple's iPhone 6.   Navigation equipment maker Garmin Ltd is expected to report third-quarter results slightly above analysts' estimate, according to StarMine. The growth in Garmin's fitness, aviation and other businesses in the past few quarters has offset a fall in sales of personal navigation devices. Investors will focus on sales of action camera Virb, which failed to resonate with customers after tough competition from GoPro.  IAC/Interactive Corp, the owner of internet brands such as Investopedia and About.com, is expected to post a third-quarter profit below estimates, according to StarMine data. The company's search and applications business, which contributes to more than half of the company's revenue, has seen slowing growth in the past few quarters and it has also been spending more on advertising expenses.  Take-Two Interactive Software Inc, the publisher of the blockbuster ""Grand Theft Auto"" games, will report second-quarter earnings. Investors will keep an eye out for digital sales during a seasonally quiet quarter and earnings guidance ahead of the launch of Grand Theft Auto V for Sony's PlayStation4 and Xbox One consoles this holiday season.  Animation studio DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc is expected to report third-quarter revenue below estimates, according to StarMine. Investors will look for details on an SEC investigation along with expectations for ""Penguins of Madagascar"" - DreamWorks' last movie for the year slated for release in November.   Shares of Shell Midstream Partners LP, a master limited partnership formed by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, are expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shell Midstream Partners said it expected its initial public offering of common units to be priced at $19-$21 per unit, valuing it at up to $1.42 billion. The Houston-based company's offering of 37.5 million units will raise $787.5 million at the top end of the expected range.    Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins will testify at the Senate banking committee on the Monetary Policy Report they presented on Oct 22. The testimony was rescheduled from Oct. 23 because of the shooting attacks in Ottawa the day before. The governor's opening statement will not be identical to the published opening statement that had been intended for the post-MPR news conference, which was canceled.   Statistics Canada announces September data for producer prices. Separately, the country's national statistics agency also releases raw materials prices for September (0830/1230).   Brazil's central bank is likely to hold interest rates steady despite stubbornly high inflation, as it waits for President Dilma Rousseff's first economic measures after she was re-elected on Sunday, a Reuters poll showed. The economists surveyed expect the central bank to keep its benchmark Selic rate unchanged at 11.00 percent. That would be the fourth straight meeting without changes to Brazil's key base rate, the longest period without rate moves since early 2010. Separately, Chile's statistics agency gives manufacturing output data for September.

MetLife said earlier this month that it would fight a plan by the U.S. risk council to designate it as a firm whose demise could risk global finance, a tag that brings far greater regulatory scrutiny.  The U.S. risk council is considering designating MetLife as a non-bank systemically important financial institution (SIFI), the third insurer to be tapped for such a designation.AIG (AIG.N) and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) were designated as systemically important last year.On an operating basis, MetLife earned $1.60 per share in the third quarter, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MetLife has tried to scale back on capital-intensive businesses such as annuities to focus more on traditional life insurance and pension products.The company's net profit rose to $2.06 billion, or $1.81 per share, in the quarter, from $942 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier.  MetLife's profit in the latest quarter benefited from a $311 million derivative gain.MetLife, like other insurers, is heavily exposed to persistently low interest rates. But it has long had a substantial derivatives program designed to smooth out that risk.

52,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 29 A group of funds that threw a monkey wrench in Bank of America Corp's proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities will object to JPMorgan Chase & Co's $4.5 billion offer to settle claims over similar investments, according to the lawyer that represents them.The funds, collateralized debt obligations known as the Triaxx entities, received court permission on Wednesday to intervene in a proceeding seeking judicial approval of the JPMorgan settlement, people close to the case said.JPMorgan last year reached the $4.5 billion agreement with some 20 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the bank took over during the financial crisis.The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market.The Triaxx entities hold certificates with an original balance of some $1.5 billion in 13 of the covered trusts, according to court papers.Their claims are ""potentially worth far more than the small percentage of the $4.5 billion settlement than they would receive,"" John Moon, an attorney for Triaxx, argued in the papers, filed in New York state court in Manhattan, seeking permission to intervene. Moon later told Reuters he planned to object to the deal.Triaxx is the second investor to raise questions about the accord. On Oct. 21, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which has holdings in 37 of the trusts in the proposed settlement, asked for a three-month extension of the Nov. 3 deadline to object.On Wednesday, Justice Marcy Friedman of New York state Supreme Court also allowed the bank to intervene, but did not change the deadline, people close to the case said. Friedman's chambers declined to comment. In August, trustees overseeing the securities accepted the bank's offer for the vast majority of the trusts.Some 20 investors agreed to the deal last year, including BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc, Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Company, and Bayerische Landesbank.Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group, did not immediately return a call for comment. In June 2011, Bank of America reached a similar deal with an investor group in which the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims involving securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in 2008.A New York judge largely approved the Bank of America deal in January, although she refused to accept a portion objected to by Triaxx, involving loan modifications.Triaxx has since dropped its opposition, as did American International Group Inc, which led objectors to the settlement in a three-year legal battle.An appeals court is still weighing the settlement on behalf of other objectors. Oral arguments were held last week.The case is In re: the application of U.S. Bank National Association, et al, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan), No. 652382/2014.

The industry is fiercely contesting this perception, saying their business model is different, and funding more stable.But the Federal Insurance Office, a Treasury unit that monitors the industry, last year pointed out that AIG was not the only U.S. insurer in trouble. Insurers Hartford Financial Services Group and Lincoln National Corp both received taxpayer aid during the crisis.

59,"  (Adds background, details on who will attend meetings)By Sarah N. LynchWASHINGTON Nov 5 The U.S. council of regulators that polices for destabilizing market risks is holding a series of private meetings with the financial industry to improve the process for designating large non-bank firms ""systemic,"" the U.S. Treasury confirmed Wednesday.The Financial Stability Oversight Council is holding a series of closed-door meetings, including several on Nov. 12, when industry groups will get to vent frustrations with the process the council uses to determine which firms pose high risks and should face heightened oversight.Some lawmakers and trade groups have complained the process is opaque and that firms do not have adequate time to contest a designation.The FSOC is a council of regulators chaired by the Treasury secretary and comprised of the heads of the top financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission.It was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and has the power to designate large firms ""systemic"" - a tag that involves strict supervision by the Fed and higher capital requirements. The FSOC has already designated General Electric Co's  GE Capital, Prudential Financial Inc and American International Group Inc.It recently proposed designating Metlife Inc, which is fiercely opposing the move. The council has also explored the asset management sector for potential risks.The FSOC has taken steps to address some concerns, and earlier this year adopted new standards such as providing more details from its closed-door meetings. FSOC officials including Treasury Secretary Jack Lew have said they are looking for further ways to improve the systemic designation process.A Treasury spokeswoman said upcoming discussions with stakeholders are ""consistent"" with the council's prior commitment to explore further changes.The Treasury has divided the Nov. 12 meetings into three separate groups, according to several sources familiar with the matter. The first meeting will be with five major trade groups that earlier this year submitted a petition to the FSOC calling for changes in the process so companies under consideration can be notified sooner and have more options to contest a designation.The FSOC has a three-stage process to designate firms, but companies complain they do not get adequate data or notice to let them contest it or understand it.Those groups were the American Council of Life Insurers, the American Financial Services Association, the Association of Institutional Investors and the asset management group of the Securities and Financial Markets Association.The second meeting will be attended by other interested parties, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute, while the third will involve academics or experts from think tanks.All participants were asked to come to the meeting prepared to discuss ways to improve transparency, the designation process and how companies are notified, and what things FSOC should consider each year when it re-evaluates whether companies should remain designated.

62,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all existing ratings  assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and its subsidiaries, including the 'AA-'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings assigned to certain domestic life  insurance companies and the 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to MetLife.  The Rating Outlook for MetLife and its subsidiaries is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the company's  strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very  strong market positions in several major insurance products lines and markets in  the U.S. and select international markets, are consistent with rating  expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale, very strong brand  name, and large and diverse distribution capabilities provide significant  competitive advantages. Fitch's primary rating concerns include MetLife's above-average, albeit  moderating, exposure to the variable annuity business; above average investment  risk; and continued macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low  interest rate environment.  MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's strong  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch notes that  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  are considered strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's  domestic life insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company  and Delaware American Life Insurance Company) reported combined statutory total adjusted capital of  approximately $24 billion and risk-based capital of 430% at year-end 2013.  Although the company does not provide intra-year RBC estimates, Fitch notes that  the company's domestic life insurance subsidiaries reported combined statutory  net operating gain of approximately $2.7 billion in the first three quarters of  2014 and an estimated growth in total adjusted capital of $1.3 billion, or 5.6%.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2013, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers.  The company's financial leverage was approximately 25% at Sept. 30, 2014, which  is at the high end of Fitch's rating expectations. Financial leverage has  declined from a recent high of approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2010,  shortly before its acquisition of ALICO. MetLife's GAAP interest coverage has improved significantly over the past five  years due primarily to solid growth in operating earnings. Interest expense has  also been slowly declining since 2011. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge  coverage ratio to be between 7x and 8x for full year 2014 on a normalized basis  on fairly stable earnings performance.  Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has experienced  significant improvement in operating earnings, bolstered in part by growing  asset-based fees driven by attractive capital market performance, relatively  stable interest margins, which have benefited from active management of  crediting rates and interest rate hedges, as well as international acquisition  activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in the fourth quarter 2010.  Fitch expects GAAP ROE to remain in the area of 12% in 2014 as continued growth  in fee income and solid earnings from International operations are at least  partially offset by pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large, albeit declining size of its variable  annuity business. Fitch notes that the company's variable annuity hedging  program is robust and performed well during the financial crisis. However, the  hedging of variable annuity risk requires the company to make policyholder  behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate. Deviations from pricing and  hedging assumptions could have a material negative impact on MetLife's capital  and earnings in a severe, albeit unexpected, scenario. On Sept. 4, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Board (FSOC) announced that  it had voted to preliminarily designate MetLife a non-bank systematically  important financial institution (SIFI), which could result in more stringent  oversight by the Federal Reserve. MetLife subsequently requested a hearing to  contest the decision before it becomes final. Although the specifics of the  enhanced supervision to which non-bank SIFIs will be subject have not been  finalized, it is likely that it will include higher capital requirements. Should  MetLife's efforts to avoid SIFI designation ultimately prove unsuccessful, Fitch  expects such a designation to be credit neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x. Fitch affirms the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: MetLife, Inc.  --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --5% senior notes due 2015 at 'A-';  --6.75% senior notes due 2016 at 'A-';  --1.756% senior notes due 2017 at 'A-'; --1.903% senior Notes due 2017 'A-'; --6.817% senior notes due 2018 at 'A-';  --7.717% senior notes due 2019 at 'A-';  --5.25% sterling senior notes due 2020 at 'A-'; --4.75% senior notes due 2021 at 'A-';  --3.048% senior notes due 2022 at 'A-'; --4.368% senior notes due 2023 'A-'; --5.375% senior notes due 2024 at 'A-'; --3.6% senior notes due 2024 at 'A-'; --6.5% senior notes due 2032 at 'A-';  --6.375% senior notes due 2034 at 'A-';  --5.7% senior notes due 2035 at 'A-';  --5.875% senior notes due 2041 at 'A-';  --4.125% senior notes due 2042 at 'A-'; --4.875% senior notes due 2043 at 'A-'; --6.4% junior subordinated debentures due December 2036 at 'BBB'; --10.75% junior subordinated debentures due August 2039 at 'BBB'; --4.721% senior notes due 2044 'A-'; --Floating-rate preferred stock, series A at 'BBB';  --Fixed-rate preferred stock series B at 'BBB'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

64,"  (Corrects name to Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) throughout)By Douwe MiedemaWASHINGTON Dec 19 U.S. regulators on Friday sketched several scenarios in which MetLife could exacerbate a financial crisis, motivating their decision to subject the largest U.S. insurer to tougher oversight.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, established to prevent a repeat of the 2007-09 credit collapse, said MetLife could disrupt markets if it was forced to sell off illiquid assets should it land in trouble.""The Council determined that material financial distress at this company - if it were to occur - could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability,"" said the FSOC, which includes the heads of the main U.S. regulatory agencies.MetLife on Thursday became the third U.S. insurer to be tagged ""systemically important,"" which brings it under the purview of the Federal Reserve, and subjects it to tougher capital and liquidity standards. In a statement, MetLife said it was disappointed by the FSOC's decision and that it was considering whether to take the regulators to court. FSOC itself only announced its 9-1 vote on Friday.In a 30-page document, it said that MetLife was so big that its failure could destabilize markets. MetLife's leverage, a measure of how much it borrows relative to its own capital, was among the highest of its peers, and it might not be able to renew its short-term borrowings quickly if it was in financial stress, the FSOC said.The company could be forced to sell assets to raise money, but that might not be easy, the regulators said.""A large-scale forced liquidation of MetLife's large portfolio of relatively illiquid assets ... could disrupt trading or funding markets,"" the report said. In one scenario, up to 65 money market funds could see their net asset value drop below one dollar - or ""break the buck"" - if MetLife were to default on certain types of debt, the FSOC said, a problem that could spread to banks.""Such an event could lead investors to withdraw from short-term funding markets more broadly, which could impair the ability of large financial firms to serve as financial intermediaries,"" the FSOC said.The dissenting vote came from Roy Woodall, an independent insurance expert.

67,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 22 (Fitch) Last week's decision by the U.S. Financial  Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to designate MetLife (Insurer Financial  Strength: AA-, Stable Outlook) a nonbank systematically important financial  institution (SIFI) is neutral to the credit ratings of the company, says Fitch  Ratings.  The FSOC had already announced a preliminarily decision to designate MetLife a  nonbank SIFI on Sept. 4; thus, the FSOC's reaffirmation of the decision was  expected.  The specifics of the enhanced supervision to which nonbank SIFIs will be subject  have not been finalized, so it is not possible to determine precisely what  effect, if any, such requirements would have on MetLife. Fitch believes greater  Fed oversight would, however, likely include higher capital requirements, which  could eventually have some modest influence over MetLife's already strong  balance sheet fundamentals. Regardless, the capital-based thresholds that we  count among MetLife's multiple rating drivers are expected to remain consistent  with our prior views.   MetLife continues to openly contest its SIFI designation. The company requested  a hearing with the FSOC following the Sept. 4 announcement, and with Friday's  affirmation, MetLife again responded in disagreement, stating that the company  has 30 days to seek judicial review under the Dodd-Frank Act.  MetLife becomes the fourth nonbank SIFI designated by the FSOC, joining  Prudential, AIG and General Electric Capital Corporation, which were designated  in 2013. The council's authority to subject large nonbank financial institutions  to consolidated supervision and enhanced prudential standards is granted under  Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act. As noted in Fitch's affirmation of MetLife's credit ratings on Dec. 15, the key  rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of the company's ratings include an  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and a  GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  an NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and a  GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio below 5x.

68,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON MetLife Inc (MET.N) on Tuesday sued U.S. regulators over a decision to subject the insurer to tougher oversight because it harbors enough risk to endanger the financial system if the next crisis hits.The largest U.S. life insurer unsuccessfully contested a ruling by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) last month, and a lawsuit is its last resort to escape being overseen by the U.S. Federal Reserve.""We just think that FSOC got this call wrong, and we believe that an appeal in this case is the right thing for our customers and for our other stakeholders,"" MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian told Reuters in an interview.MetLife shares closed down 1.2 percent on Tuesday.The lawsuit will renew scrutiny of the process laid out in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which gives FSOC, the top U.S. risk council, the power to designate large financial companies as ""systemically important,"" imposing tougher rules and oversight by the Fed on them.The lawsuit is also important for large asset managers such as BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Fidelity Investments that could be added to the list of risky firms, though they have aggressively campaigned to avoid the FSOC designation.Lawmakers and companies alike have complained that the designation process is opaque and that the risks are not sufficient to warrant the tighter rules.""This is the first real challenge to the FSOC's deeply flawed ... designation authority,"" said U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina. ""It is my hope this case will begin to shed some light on what metrics - if any - are used in the arbitrary and opaque FSOC review process.""Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who chairs FSOC, said last year the council may tweak its procedures. The council, comprised of the top U.S. regulators, plans to discuss potential reforms this month, a person familiar with the matter said. ""The question we keep asking FSOC is, 'how can you actually designate a company without knowing what the consequences are?'"" said Alice Joe, a managing director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which houses the FSOC, said on Tuesday, ""The council's decision to designate a ... company is reached only after a thorough analysis and extensive engagement with the company, both of which occurred in this case. We are confident in the council's work.""FED JOB UNFINISHED Regulators, in their decision to deem MetLife ""systemic,"" cited the firm's large size, its range of activities in risky financial markets outside its core insurance business, and its connections to a raft of other companies, among other factors. In its complaint, MetLife gave several reasons why FSOC's decision was ""arbitrary and capricious,"" the only way the law provides for it to win its case. Lawyers say this poses a high, though not insurmountable, hurdle.The decision was ""fatally premature"" because it will likely take the Fed months before it finalizes capital and other requirements for the industry, and a framework on how to cooperate with state regulators, the firm said.""It ... takes institutional courage to challenge the nine federal agencies that make up FSOC, even when you know that it is the right thing to do,"" said Thomas Vartanian, a former regulator and a partner at Dechert LLP.Including MetLife, the Fed oversees almost one-third of the industry in the United States, a study by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, showed last year. MetLife was the third insurer designated by the FSOC as systemic. American International Group Inc (AIG.N), which almost collapsed during the credit meltdown, and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) chose not to fight the decision.Insurers say they do not harbor the same type of risks as banks, which make large loans to clients that they cannot get back on short notice during a financial crisis.The company also said it was denied several meetings with the regulators, and that it did not have access to information FSOC had used when looking at the other two insurers.MetLife filed its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and has hired law firms Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.Eugene Scalia, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn, is on MetLife's team. The son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, he has a track record of successfully fighting federal regulators.Scalia said the court would likely take nine months to a year to render its decision.""Sometimes regulatory agencies that are taking on new responsibilities falter at first, and need to learn through what can be a bit of trial and error,"" Scalia said during a conference call with journalists.

71,"   By Rob Cox | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Challenging regulators can often come back to bite you in the rear. JPMorgan  proved this by publicly questioning the reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act and then privately failing to rein in some particularly naughty behavior by some of its traders. That's what makes MetLife's decision to take its watchdogs to court so surprising.The $900 billion insurer said on Tuesday that it will ask a federal judge to overturn its designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution. That status was recently conferred on it by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is effectively the Justice League of America's financial overseer. MetLife boss Steve Kandarian's point is simple enough: ""Size alone does not make a company systemic.""He's right about that. The Dodd-Frank Act makes that clear enough. The legislation also created the right for firms to seek judicial review of SIFI designations. It's easy to see why MetLife would want to avoid being called a SIFI.Granted, some banks may actually regard it as a weird badge of honor - it suggests they're so important that nobody will let them fail. But it bestows no obvious benefit on an insurance company, which must match its assets with appropriate liabilities for its business model to function. Being labeled a SIFI may, though, require it to hold more capital. AIG proved in 2008 that it's when an insurer acts like a bank that things go painfully awry - in AIG's case an effectively insolvent savings and loan subsidiary with a feckless regulator. AIG's business as an insurance company, big though it may have been, was not the source of systemic instability. As long as AIG, MetLife or Prudential, which was previously named a SIFI, behave like insurers the system should be relatively safe.It's actually not all that different for banks, though the business of lending is inherently harder to forecast with actuarial precision than MetLife's. JPMorgan's blooper didn't come from bad loans, though, but a series of derivative transactions by the bank's poorly supervised chief investment office. The ensuing $6 billion loss meant previous objections to regulation made by the bank's executives now rang hollow.As Kandarian acts like MetLife's mascot Snoopy taking on the regulatory Red Baron, he had best hope he has a better handle on what his 65,000 employees are doing than Jamie Dimon did.

72,"  WASHINGTON Jan 13 MetLife said it would file on Tuesday a lawsuit against regulators subjecting it to tougher oversight, challenging their verdict the firm harbors enough risk to bring down the financial system in a crisis.The company, the largest U.S. insurer, unsuccessfully contested the decision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in a hearing last month, and a lawsuit was its last resort to escape being overseen by the Federal Reserve.The designation of MetLife as a so-called ""systemically important"" company would make insurance products more expensive without actually enhancing financial stability, it said.""FSOC's designation of MetLife is premature,"" MetLife's head Steve Kandarian was quoted as saying in a statement. ""The Council should wait until the rules are in place and it knows the impact on designated firms."" The remark was a reference to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has yet to come up with capital rules for insurers. The industry is often skeptical that the central bank, which has long overseen banking, knows enough about insurance. The 2010 Dodd-Frank act to reform Wall Street after the 2008-2009 financial crisis put more onerous regulatory demands on the largest banks, and also authorized FSOC to subject other large and risky firms such as insurers to a similar regime.AIG, which almost collapsed during the credit meltdown, is now overseen by the Fed, as is Prudential Financial Inc. Including MetLife, the Fed oversees almost a third of the entire industry in America, a study showed last year. MetLife said it had filed its lawsuit in the District Court of the District of Columbia. It had hired Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP as its law firms.Eugene Scalia, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn, is on MetLife's team to help it with the lawsuit.

77,"   By Reynolds Holding | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - MetLife is giving harried financial watchdogs yet another risk to ponder. U.S. courts have squelched a slew of securities and commodities rules. Designations of systemically important financial institutions, known as SIFIs, may be next, as the insurer with $900 billion of assets challenges its big-and-risky status.MetLife on Tuesday sued the Financial Stability Oversight Council for naming it a non-bank SIFI. The company argues the move was ""fatally premature"" because capital and other requirements for the insurance industry don't even exist yet. That, says MetLife, makes FSOC's behavior ""arbitrary and capricious,"" the legal standard for overturning agency rulemaking.It's a high - but not insurmountable - hurdle. In 2011, for example, a federal appeals court struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission's proxy access rule, which would have made it easier to challenge corporate boards. The court said the SEC hadn't paid enough attention to the regulation's potential economic effects.Another U.S. court ruled in 2013 that a Commodity Futures Trading Commission cap on certain transactions was ambiguous and insufficiently justified. And an appeals court decided last year that an SEC regulation violated companies' free speech by requiring them to disclose whether their products contained specified African minerals. That ruling is under review. Financial watchdogs have in the past decade lost at least six challenges in the Washington, D.C. federal appeals court alone. Many investor advocates attribute the losses to Republican judges who until recently held a majority of the court's seats. Yet some of the jurists ruling against the rules were Democratic appointees.It's no coincidence that most of the questionable regulations were created pursuant to the Dodd-Frank financial reform. Sprawling post-crisis legislation passed under pressure can't help but contain flaws, and rulemakers working in haste risk further sloppiness. The watchdogs have sometimes given the required cost-benefit analysis short shrift and too quickly dismissed the concerns of expert critics. The CFTC, for example, drew a harsh rebuke from judges for not bringing ""its expertise and experience to bear.""Scrutiny will only grow more intense as banks and other companies, like MetLife, try to beat back regulation that might limit their business or increase their costs. That's reason enough to make sure that rulemaking is as watertight as possible. CONTEXT NEWS - MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, on Jan. 13 asked the federal District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn its status as a non-bank systemically important financial institution. The Financial Stability Oversight Council conferred the designation last month.- In its legal complaint, MetLife listed several reasons why FSOC's move was ""arbitrary and capricious,"" the standard for overturning regulatory decisions. Most notably, the insurer argued that the designation was ""fatally premature,"" because the Federal Reserve will probably take months to finalize capital and other requirements for the insurance industry.

83,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to MetLife,  Inc.'s (MetLife) issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes due 2025 and  $1 billion of senior unsecured notes due 2045. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects that the proceeds from the issuance will be used to repay $1  billion of 5.00% senior notes that mature on June 15, 2015 and for general  corporate purposes. MetLife's ratings reflect Fitch's view that the company's strong balance sheet  fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very strong market positions  in several major insurance product lines and markets in the U.S. and select  international markets are consistent with rating expectations. Fitch believes  that the company's large scale, very strong brand name, and large and diverse  distribution capabilities provide significant competitive advantages. Fitch's primary rating concerns include MetLife's above-average, albeit  moderating exposure to the variable annuity business, above-average investment  risk, and continued macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low  interest rate environment.  MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's strong  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch notes that  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  is considered strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's financial leverage was 25.5% at Dec. 31, 2014, which is in line  with Fitch's rating expectations. Financial leverage has declined from a recent  high of approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2010 (3Q'10), shortly before  its acquisition of ALICO. As the issuance being rated is earmarked to repay  maturing debt, Fitch considers it to be neutral to financial leverage. MetLife's GAAP interest coverage has improved significantly over the past five  years due primarily to solid growth in operating earnings. Interest expense has  also been gradually trending downward since 2011, but increased modestly in  2014. The company's GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio was 7.8x in 2014,  essentially unchanged from 2013.  Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has experienced  significant improvement in operating earnings, bolstered in part by growing  asset-based fees driven by attractive capital market performance, relatively  stable interest margins, which have benefited from active management of  crediting rates and interest rate hedges, as well as international acquisition  activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in 4Q'10. On Dec. 18, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Board (FSOC) announced that  it had reached a final determination to designate MetLife a non-bank  systematically important financial institution (SIFI), which could result in  more stringent oversight by the Federal Reserve. On Jan. 13, 2015, MetLife filed  an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn  the designation. Although the specifics of the enhanced supervision to which  non-bank SIFIs will be subject have not been finalized, it is likely that they  will include higher capital requirements. Should MetLife's efforts to avoid SIFI  designation ultimately prove unsuccessful, Fitch currently expects such a  designation to be credit neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: MetLife, Inc.  --3.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 'A-'; --4.05% senior unsecured notes due 2045 'A-'. Contact: Primary Analyst Bradley S.

93,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to MetLife,  Inc.'s (MetLife) issuance of $1.5 billion in series C fixed-to-floating rate  non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects proceeds from the issuance to be used to redeem approximately $1.5  billion of 6.50% series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Accordingly,  Fitch does not expect today's issuance to have a significant effect on the  credit profile of MetLife. The rating assigned to the new preferred shares is equivalent to the ratings  assigned to the preferred shares that will be redeemed with the proceeds, and  reflects standard notching for a hybrid with its risk characteristics. Fitch recently published an exposure draft of proposed changes to insurance  notching criteria, which includes notching of hybrid securities. Per Fitch  policies, newly assigned ratings are to be based on the proposed criteria. Fitch  assesses the hybrid rated today as having 'Minimal' non-performance risk under  the proposed criteria. Fitch notes the rating assigned to this hybrid would be  the same under both proposed and existing criteria. MetLife's ratings reflect Fitch's view that the company's strong balance sheet  fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very strong market positions  in several major insurance products lines and markets in the U.S. and select  international markets are consistent with rating expectations RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x.

97,"   By Richa Naidu  MetLife Inc (MET.N), the biggest U.S. life insurer, reported a 21 percent fall in quarterly profit, dragged down by $593 million in derivatives losses.The company has long relied on its substantial derivatives program to hedge against risks that insurers are exposed to such as currency exchange rates, volatile equities markets and changes to interest rates.MetLife blamed rising interest rates and the weakening of the dollar against certain currencies for the after-tax derivatives losses in the quarter ended June 30.The company reported derivatives gain of $202 million in the year-ago quarter.Net income fell to 92 cents per share from $1.17.Operating profit rose 12 percent to $1.56 per share, bumped up 5 cents by a tax rate change in Japan.

101,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all existing ratings  assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and its subsidiaries, including the 'AA-'  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings assigned to certain domestic life  insurance companies and the 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) assigned to MetLife.  The Rating Outlook for MetLife and its subsidiaries is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the company's  strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very  strong market positions in several major insurance products lines and markets in  the U.S. and select international markets, remain consistent with rating  expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale, very strong brand  name, and large and diverse distribution capabilities provide significant  competitive advantages. The ratings also consider MetLife's above average investment risk; and continued  macroeconomic challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate  environment. Fitch views MetLife's designation by the Financial Stability  Oversight Council (FSOC) as a non-bank systematically important financial  institution (SIFI) to be credit neutral. MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's solid  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch considers  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's domestic life  insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company and Delaware  American Life Insurance Company) reported combined statutory total adjusted  capital of approximately $25 billion and risk-based capital of 397% at year-end  2014. Although the company does not provide intra-year RBC estimates, the  company's domestic life insurance subsidiaries reported combined statutory net  operating gain of approximately $2.1 billion in first half 2015 and a very  modest decline in total adjusted capital.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2014, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers. The company's financial leverage was approximately 26% at June 30, 2015, which  is within Fitch's expectations for the company's current ratings. Financial  leverage has declined from a recent high of approximately 30% in the third  quarter of 2010, shortly before its acquisition of ALICO, and is essentially  consistent with year-end 2014 levels. MetLife's GAAP interest coverage has improved significantly over the past five  years due primarily to solid growth in operating earnings and fairly stable  interest expense. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio to be  approximately 8x for full year 2015 on moderate earnings growth. Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has experienced  significant improvement in operating earnings, bolstered in part by growing  asset-based fees driven by attractive capital market performance; relatively  stable interest margins, which have benefited from active management of  crediting rates and interest rate hedges; as well as international acquisition  activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in the fourth quarter 2010.  Fitch expects GAAP ROE to remain in the area of 12% in 2015 as continued growth  in fee income and solid earnings from International operations are at least  partially offset by continued pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large size of its variable annuity business. The  company's variable annuity hedging program is robust and performed well during  the financial crisis. However, the hedging of variable annuity risk requires the  company to make policyholder behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate.  Deviations from pricing and hedging assumptions could have a material negative  impact on MetLife's capital and earnings in a severe, albeit unexpected,  scenario. On Dec. 18, 2014, FSOC announced that it had reached a final determination to  designate MetLife a non-bank SIFI, which could result in more stringent  oversight by the Federal Reserve. On Jan. 13, 2015, MetLife filed an action in  the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the  designation. Although the specifics of the enhanced supervision to which  non-bank SIFIs will be subject have not been finalized, it is likely that they  will include higher capital requirements. Should MetLife's efforts to overturn  the FSOC decision ultimately prove unsuccessful, Fitch would view such a  development to be credit neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

The company's domestic life  insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company and Delaware  American Life Insurance Company) reported combined statutory total adjusted  capital of approximately $25 billion at year-end 2014, which Fitch estimates  resulted in consolidated risk-based capital of 384%. Although the company does  not provide intra-year RBC estimates, the company's domestic life insurance  subsidiaries reported combined statutory net operating gain of approximately  $1.4 billion in first nine months of 2015 and an increase of approximately $1  billion in total adjusted capital.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio significantly above 800% at year-end 2014, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers. The company's financial leverage was approximately 26% at Sept. 30, 2015, which  is within Fitch's expectations for the company's current ratings. Financial  leverage has declined from approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2010  (3Q10), shortly before its acquisition of ALICO, and is essentially consistent  with year-end 2014 levels. MetLife issued $1.25 billion of senior notes in  November 2015, and Fitch expects proceeds from the issuance to be used for  general corporate purposes, including funding debt maturities in 2016. As a  result of 2016 maturities, Fitch considers the new issuance to be neutral to  financial leverage. Fitch considers MetLife's GAAP interest coverage to be strong, reflecting solid  operating performance and fairly stable interest expense. Fitch expects  MetLife's GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio to be between 7.5x and 8.0x for  full-year 2015. Despite the ongoing low interest rate environment, MetLife has continued to  generate solid operating earnings in recent years, bolstered in part by growing  asset-based fees driven by favorable equity market performance; relatively  stable interest margins, which have benefited from active management of  crediting rates and interest rate hedges; as well as international acquisition  activity, particularly its acquisition of ALICO in 4Q10. Excluding the company's  $792 million charge in 3Q15 related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned  U.K.-based investment subsidiary, Fitch expects GAAP ROE to remain in the area  of 12% for full year 2015 and decline modestly to between 11% and 12% in 2016 as  continued growth in fee income and solid earnings from International operations  are at least partially offset by continued pressure from low interest rates. MetLife's equity market exposure is primarily attributable to its investment in  alternative investments and the large size of its variable annuity business. The  company's variable annuity hedging program is robust and performed well during  the financial crisis. However, the hedging of variable annuity risk requires the  company to make policyholder behavior assumptions that may prove inaccurate.  Deviations from pricing and hedging assumptions could have a material negative  impact on MetLife's capital and earnings in a severe, albeit unexpected,  scenario. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

109,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 13 (Fitch) MetLife's proposed restructuring announced Tuesday  has important implications for the life insurance industry, which faces  significant competitive and regulatory pressures in the U.S. and globally, says  Fitch Ratings. The move demonstrates how the evolving regulatory environment  affects the industry's capital management and operating strategies. The prospect  of increasing regulatory capital requirements associated with MetLife's nonbank  systemically important financial institution (SIFI) designation weighed heavily  in its decision.  MetLife is pursuing a separation of a substantial portion of its U.S. retail  life and annuity business that would be subject to enhanced capital requirements  under yet-to-be-announced U.S. nonbank SIFI prudential standards. MetLife will  no longer write new U.S. retail life and annuity business -- a significant  strategic shift for the firm. The U.S. business to be divested represents  approximately 20% of the operating earnings of the firm globally and 50% of its  U.S. retail operating earnings.  While the SIFI designation applies to only two other U.S. life insurers to date  (Prudential and AIG), the threat of higher regulatory capital requirements could  lead to further restructuring initiatives by U.S. life insurers, as well as  non-U.S. insurers designated as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII).  Rating implications for moves such as MetLife's could be mixed based on the  structure and nature of the disposition of more risky, market-sensitive  businesses, among many potential considerations.   Fitch believes that inclusion on the list of G-SIIs will continue to play a  significant role in setting strategy for global insurers. Already, one European  insurer, Generali, was removed in November 2015, while Aegon was added. The  Financial Stability Board did not explain its rationale for the change, but we  believe it was driven by how these firms are exposed to nontraditional business,  which includes some market-sensitive products.  MetLife is the second of the four nonbank SIFIs in the U.S. to elect a  significant asset disposal to mitigate the implications of its systemically  important designation. GE, the first such firm, is disposing of its  middle-market lending business and other wholesale funding dependent businesses  within its GE Capital arm. None of the eight U.S. banks with SIFI designations  have made moves quite as significant as MetLife and GE, but certain  disincentives for becoming larger have been firmly established for banks, mostly  though the global systemically important bank capital buffers, the Comprehensive  Capital Analysis and Review program and the U.S. adoption of Basel III capital  standards.  It remains unclear if the proposed restructuring will result in MetLife shedding  its SIFI designation as the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council has not  yet to provide an ""exit ramp"" for designated firms. MetLife has challenged its  SIFI designation in court. Fitch expects regulatory uncertainty around this  issue to persist into 2017.

Yellen said on Tuesday the U.S. central bank should proceed cautiously as it looks to raise interest rates. On Wednesday, her comments were echoed by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who said there was a high hurdle to raising rates in April, given low inflation.Those comments soothed investors worried about a slow global economy, a strong dollar, volatile oil prices and lackluster top-line growth at U.S. companies.""The market's best friend continues to be the Fed and central banks around the world,"" said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Investor appetite for risk has increased."" Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they reduce lending and investment and make it harder for companies to expand.

Markets around the world cheered Yellen's remarks, which suggested that a rate hike was not immediately on the horizon. The dollar fell more than a percent, while bond prices rallied.The rally was driven by Yellen's comments but the upcoming corporate earnings season would be the real test for stocks, said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust in Devon, Pennsylvania.""In order to sustain the strength in the equity market, you're going to have to see some decent earnings growth at some point,"" Cecilia said.

Its shares rose nearly 8 percent on the news, to $45.84, and could close at its highest level in more than four years.Shares of other insurers designated systemically important rose, as well. Prudential Financial Inc rose 2.8 percent and American International Group Inc was up 2.3 percent. At the heart of the case is whether the government can designate non-banks as systemically important. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law authorized the U.S. to designate banks as 'systemically important' after AIG received a government bailout of $182 billion during the 2008 financial meltdown.MetLife sued the council last year. It said the council, which includes the Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Chair, had not followed its own guidance on designating a firm as systemically important, essentially changing the rules to ensure the determination was made. In court in February, the federal government argued its process was fair and that a collapse by the insurer, with its many financial ties, products and contracts, would indeed hurt the financial system. It said it was open with the company during a 17-month process that included exchange of thousands of pages of documents and several meetings, including one with the full council.Representatives of MetLife and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.(Additional reporting by Sarah N.

134,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal judge's ruling that MetLife Inc is not important enough to warrant special regulatory scrutiny has opened the door for other non-bank financial firms to try and unshackle themselves from the designation of ""too big to fail.""Those that stand to benefit from Wednesday's decision include insurers Prudential Financial Inc and American International Group Inc, as well as General Electric Co's GE Capital and asset managers like BlackRock Inc, Fidelity Investments and The Vanguard Group Inc.Metlife, Prudential, AIG and GE Capital are the only four non-banks that have been deemed systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard have not been assigned systemic importance, but analysts and regulatory experts say they are large enough to merit consideration.It is difficult to assess whether any of these firms can avoid a ""too big to fail"" classification forever because the criteria are fluid and SIFI assessments start fresh every year. As such, even MetLife's victory may be short-lived.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, known as FSOC, is comprised of members from 15 regulatory bodies, 10 of which have a vote on matters including SIFI designations. The council was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Its SIFI designations are meant to add an extra layer of oversight on firms that could cause a system-wide financial crisis if they get into trouble, because of how large and interconnected they are.FSOC has been plagued by criticism about opaqueness nearly since its birth, even as it has taken steps to address complaints.In 2014 the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, criticized FSOC's ""lack of full transparency,"" saying FSOC did not always disclose public documents or explain the rationale for SIFI designations. Republican lawmakers have also lashed out at FSOC for not sharing enough information.The council has taken corrective measures, both in its public disclosures and in the way it interacts with companies. At an event last year, GE Capital Chief Executive Keith Sherin called GE Capital's designation as a systemically important institution ""very clear"" and ""very understandable."" In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, which chairs FSOC, said the council also has a ""clear process"" for removing SIFI designations.

135,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK, March 31  NEW YORK, March 31 A federal judge's ruling that MetLife Inc is not important enough to warrant special regulatory scrutiny has opened the door for other non-bank financial firms to try and unshackle themselves from the designation of ""too big to fail.""Those that stand to benefit from Wednesday's decision include insurers Prudential Financial Inc and American International Group Inc, as well as General Electric Co's GE Capital and asset managers like BlackRock Inc , Fidelity Investments and The Vanguard Group Inc.Metlife, Prudential, AIG and GE Capital are the only four non-banks that have been deemed systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard have not been assigned systemic importance, but analysts and regulatory experts say they are large enough to merit consideration.It is difficult to assess whether any of these firms can avoid a ""too big to fail"" classification forever because the criteria are fluid and SIFI assessments start fresh every year. As such, even MetLife's victory may be short-lived.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, known as FSOC, is comprised of members from 15 regulatory bodies, 10 of which have a vote on matters including SIFI designations. The council was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Its SIFI designations are meant to add an extra layer of oversight on firms that could cause a system-wide financial crisis if they get into trouble, because of how large and interconnected they are.FSOC has been plagued by criticism about opaqueness nearly since its birth, even as it has taken steps to address complaints.In 2014 the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, criticized FSOC's ""lack of full transparency,"" saying FSOC did not always disclose public documents or explain the rationale for SIFI designations. Republican lawmakers have also lashed out at FSOC for not sharing enough information.The council has taken corrective measures, both in its public disclosures and in the way it interacts with companies. At an event last year, GE Capital Chief Executive Keith Sherin called GE Capital's designation as a systemically important institution ""very clear"" and ""very understandable."" In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, which chairs FSOC, said the council also has a ""clear process"" for removing SIFI designations. It includes discussions between FSOC staff and company officials, as well as independent analysis of changes within companies or across markets, he said.Overall, the council aims to determine whether ""a firm's distress could destabilize the financial system,"" he said.Size is certainly one factor in determining which firms are ""too big to fail,"" but it is not the only one, regulatory experts say.

136,"   By Lisa Lambert | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N) won a major regulatory and legal battle on Wednesday when a federal judge struck down the U.S. government's determination that it is ""too big to fail.""MetLife had argued in court that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the heads of the country's financial regulatory agencies, used a secretive and flawed process when in 2014 it designated the company as a systemically important financial institution. The designation meant regulators believed a collapse of the insurer could devastate the U.S. financial system just as much as failure of a major bank, and triggered possible requirements for it to hold more capital and for stricter oversight.""From the beginning, MetLife has said that its business model does not pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States,"" the company's chief executive, Steven Kandarian, said in a statement. A representative for the U.S. Treasury said the agency  disagreed with the decision and would vigorously defend the council’s designations process.""FSOC conducted a rigorous analysis of MetLife, including extensive engagement with the company, and determined that material financial distress at MetLife could pose ... a threat to the financial system,"" said spokesman Adam Hodge. The ruling by the judge, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, is currently sealed, but parts may be made public next month, according to Wednesday's order, which also said the federal government may appeal.During a hearing last month, Collyer expressed concerns about the process and the analyses that the council, which includes the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chair, uses to make designations. [nL2N15P0TZ] In the order, Collyer granted three of the reasons, or counts, that MetLife gave when it argued against the designation. The company had said there were flaws in how the FSOC assessed its vulnerabilities, that some of the FSOC's assumptions and speculations were arbitrary and capricious, and that the FSOC had not given enough consideration of the designation's economic effects on MetLife.WELCOMED BY WALL STREET     MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, said earlier this year it was considering breaking up its business to shed the designation.Its shares ended up more than 5 percent on the news, at $44.73. Those of other insurers designated systemically important, Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and American International Group Inc (AIG.N), also rose.  ""It's a major win for companies placed under this designation. It's a very large blow for the FSOC. But FSOC can appeal,"" said Raymond James analyst Steven Schwartz. ""It's not over until it's over.""Deutsche Bank Markets Research analyst Yaron Kinar wrote in a note that because of potential appeals the company's status may not ""be finalized for some time"" and ""we'd expect the company to continue down the path of separating its U.S. retail business despite the ruling."" Asset managers greeted the decision as good news with the potential to soften future regulation that their industry has been expecting. Earlier this month, the FSOC said it was discussing how to address the risks that their products could pose to financial stability. [nL2N16T22N]   The nonprofit, nonpartisan group Better Markets said, however, Collyer's decision threatens ""the entire structure that protects the country and its taxpayers from future financial crashes caused by nonbanks."" The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law authorized regulators to designate nonbank companies as ""systemically important,"" largely in response to the $182 billion government bailout AIG received during the 2008 financial crisis. White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to comment on the decision, but said crisis-era bailouts showed ""it's not just banks on Wall Street that could potentially shake the foundation of our financial system.""""And if we're serious - and the president certainly is -about following through on a commitment to make sure that taxpayers are never in that position again, we need to make sure that our regulators ... can exercise, at least, some authority over nonbank institutions,"" he said at a White House briefing.MetLife sued last year, saying the FSOC had not followed its own guidance and essentially changed the rules to ensure the designation was made.The government argued its process was fair and a collapse by the insurer, with its many financial ties, products and contracts, would indeed hurt the financial system. It said it was open with the company during a 17-month process that included a meeting with the full council. [nL2N15P0TZ]At the same time, criticism of the council has mounted in the financial sector and on Capitol Hill, where Republicans say regulators should operate more openly. Securities and Exchange  Commissioner Michael Piwowar, also a Republican, has blasted the council, saying it should be renamed the ""Firing Squad On Capitalism.""

157,"  MetLife Inc (MET.N), the largest U.S. life insurer, reported a quarterly operating profit that fell far short of expectations as income from investments in hedge funds and bonds declined.American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the No. 1 U.S. commercial insurer, earlier reported a lower-than-expected profit for the third straight quarter as poor returns from hedge funds hurt investment income.Both companies, like their rivals, have been hurt by near-zero interest rates since the financial crisis.New York-based MetLife, whose shares were down 1.6 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, said its net operating profit fell 19 percent to $1.33 billion, or $1.20 per share, in the three months ended March 31.Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of $1.38 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the third straight quarter of lower-than-expected earnings. Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N), the No. 2 U.S. life insurer, reported a 23.2 percent fall in operating profit on Wednesday as its revenue from premiums fell.MetLife's net investment income, which includes returns from investments in bonds, fell 5.5 percent to $4.71 billion in the quarter. Variable investment income more than halved to $109 million, hit by weak returns from hedge fund investments. MetLife won a major battle in March when a judge struck down the U.S. government's determination that it was ""too big to fail"", a designation that would likely require the insurer to boost its capital. The government is appealing.Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said in January that the ""regulatory environment"" had driven MetLife to consider splitting off its retail business as higher capital requirements could put the company at a ""significant competitive disadvantage."" MetLife shares were trading at $43.24 after the bell. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen nearly 9 percent this year.

164,"   By Lisa Lambert | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government laid out its arguments against a federal judge's decision to strike down the designation of life insurer MetLife Inc as ""too big to fail"" in a brief filed late on Thursday, showing how it intends to defend a key provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.MetLife sued the U.S. government last year, saying the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the chiefs of U.S. financial regulatory agencies, used a flawed process in determining it could hurt the U.S. financial system if it faced financial distress.On March 30, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer rescinded the designation and the federal government appealed in the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C.""The district court's ruling in this case overturned the collective judgment of the heads of every U.S. financial regulatory agency and left one of the largest financial companies in the world subject to even less oversight than before the financial crisis,"" a Treasury spokesman said in a statement on Thursday, adding the government plans to ""vigorously defend"" the FSOC's work. MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, has until August to respond and oral arguments are expected in the autumn. Both sides say the case could reach the U.S. Supreme Court.Collyer's decision centered on the analysis FSOC conducted to make its 2014 determination that MetLife is a ""systemically important financial institution."" Saying that it had failed to review the likelihood that MetLife would fail, and in view of potential losses to counterparties, and costs imposed on MetLife by the label, she called the determination ""arbitrary and capricious."" Passed after the financial crisis of 2008-2009 - which was aggravated by the way in which many large financial institutions were inter-connected - Dodd-Frank created the FSOC and gave it the power to label firms as systemically important, which triggers requirements to hold more capital and abide by other regulations.Collyer's decision exempts MetLife from the regulations governing systemically important insurers that the Federal Reserve has proposed. In its brief, the government said the council is not required to consider the likelihood of failure or ""estimate specific counterparty losses or produce quantitative projections of the harm that would result.""""The 2008-2009 financial crisis demonstrated that the sudden, unforeseen failures of large financial companies can have sweeping, unpredictable ramifications,"" it added.It also said Dodd-Frank does not call for a cost-benefit analysis, and instead focuses ""on risk to the nation's financial stability rather than on costs to large financial companies.""",2016-06-17,MET,"Fri Jun 17, 2016 | 7:49am EDT",U.S. strikes back at judge's decision that MetLife not 'too big to fail',http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-metlife-idUSL1N1990E2?type=companyNews

168,"   By Dena Aubin | June 23  June 23 A federal court's striking down of the government's designation of insurer MetLife Inc as ""too-big-to-fail"" could undermine efforts to head off another financial crisis, authors of the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law said.In a brief filed on Thursday with a federal appeals court, former Senator Chris Dodd, former Representative Barney Frank and other Democratic party leaders said the designation was necessary to bring a key nonbank financial institution under an effective regulatory regime.Signed by 20 current and former lawmakers, the brief opposes U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer's order in March, now under appeal, rescinding the government's 2014 designation of MetLife as a systematically important financial institution.Such a designation would reflect regulators' concern that its failure could hurt the U.S. financial system.Collyer said the designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a group of federal regulatory heads, had been ""arbitrary and capricious."" She said the council never adequately assessed the risk of Metlife's failure and neglected to perform a cost-benefit analysis of applying the designation. The court's decision ""is an invitation to nonbanks to engage in riskier behavior than they have been doing without sufficient regulation,"" former Representative Frank said in a press conference about the brief on Thursday.The designation would put MetLife under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which typically regulates banks. ""Essentially what the judge did was amend the statute by imposing some obstacles to us trying to protect society,"" Frank  said.The FSOC was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and charged with designating systemically important companies, which would be subject to increased regulation and possibly tighter capital requirements. Other companies so designated are insurers American International Group and Prudential Financial Inc. and General Electric Co's finance arm.In the brief on Thursday, lawmakers said FSOC does not have to find that a company is financially vulnerable before it makes a systemically important designation.

179,"  EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Quarterback Ryan Nassib connected with wide receiver Tavarres King on two touchdown passes, including the 11-yard game-winner to give the New York Giants a 21-20 victory over the New York Jets on Saturday in the annual MetLife Bowl at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.The Giants' winning score was set up by undrafted rookie safety Andrew Adams, who picked off Jets rookie quarterback Christian Hackenberg (6 of 15 for 105 yards) deep in his own territory to set up King's second score of the night.Until that throw, Hackenberg, playing his first live snaps this preseason, engineered two scoring drives for 10 points to put the Jets ahead 20-14 his lone touchdown pass being a 10-yarder to wide receiver Robby Anderson.Jets kicker Ross Martin added two field goals, including a 29-yarder to cap Hackenberg's second scoring drive, and a 55-yard field goal earlier in the game that gave the Jets a 10-0 lead at the time.Jets starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, 9 of 16 for 76 yards, connected with receiver Eric Decker on a 22-yard touchdown pass to put the Jets on the scoreboard first.Fitzpatrick was relieved by Geno Smith, who finished 3 of 5 for 14 yards, followed by Bryce Petty, who went 5 of 10 for 50 yards and whose interception thrown to Giants defensive end Kerry Wynn was returned 73 yards to give the Giants a 14-10 lead in the fourth quarter.The Giants, whose starting offense under quarterback Eli Manning (10 of 15 for 65 yards) not only failed to get on the scoreboard but also failed to get into Jets territory, finally managed to break their scoreless streak when Nassib, who has also had a rough summer, connected with King on the first of their two scores for the night, a 27-yard skinny post that made it 10-7 in the third quarter. The Giants and Jets battled to a scoreless first quarter, though there were some mid-quarter fireworks when Giants punter Brad Wing's first punt of the game was blocked by Bruce Carter, who blew past Orleans Darkwa of the Giants.The Jets recovered the ball at the Giants 15, but three plays later, former Jets nose tackle Damon Harrison sacked Fitzpatrick for a 9-yard loss, stripping the ball loose for teammate Johnathan Hankins to recover.The forced fumble and recovery by the Giants' starting defense was their second in as many weeks inside the red zone. However, it was all for naught as the Giants' starting offense failed to cross into Jets territory in seven offensive possessions.The Giants' rushing game managed just 5 rushing yards on 12 carries in the first half, their offensive line unable to move a stout Jets defensive front off the ball. The passing game wasn't much better. Manning's offensive line couldn't protect him, with the veteran quarterback being bounced around like a pinball for the majority of the night.The final straw for the first-team Giants offense came when a second-quarter pass intended for wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was picked off by Jets cornerback Darelle Revis to give Gang Green a first-and-10 on the Giants' 30.On the play, which would go on to set up the Jets' first score of the game, it looked like Beckham cut short the route in order to avoid a big hit from Jets safety Calvin Pryor. Giants receiver Victor Cruz, making his first appearance in live action since suffering a torn patellar tendon in a regular-season game on October 12, 2014, was targeted twice in about 30 snaps, most of which were spent in his familiar slot position.Cruz had one reception for 4 yards in what was otherwise a very quiet night for his long awaited return.Running back Matt Forte made his Jets debut this week, rushing 10 times for 28 yards and adding two receptions for 9 yards on what was a successful first outing. Forte had been sidelined this summer with a hamstring injury.Also of note for the Jets was the absence of receiver Brandon Marshall, a surprise healthy scratch by coach Todd Bowles, who gave Marshall the night off ahead of the start of the regular season.As they usually seem to do in the preseason against the Jets, the Giants came out with a few injuries. Slot cornerback Leon Hall and rookie linebacker B.J. Goodson both suffered concussions.Starting weak-side linebacker Jonathan Casillas suffered a rib injury on the first defensive series, and fullback Nikita Whitlock was carted off the field in the third quarter with a foot injury.For the Jets, linebacker David Harris suffered a shoulder injury late in the second quarter and did not return to the game.",2016-08-28,MET,"Sun Aug 28, 2016 | 12:16am EDT",Nassib throw winning TD pass for Giants against Jets,http://www.reuters.com//article/fbn-giants-jets-recap-idUSMTZEC8SLNNUHN?type=companyNews
180,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the existing ratings  and Stable Outlook assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife). At the same time, Fitch  has placed the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating of New England Life  Insurance Company (NELIC) on Rating Watch Negative, and affirmed and removed  from Rating Watch Negative the IFS rating of General American Life Insurance  Company (GALIC). The Outlook is now Stable. MetLife Insurance Company USA's IFS   (MetLife USA) remains on Rating Watch Negative. A full list of rating actions is  shown at the end of this release. Today's rating actions follow Fitch's review of MetLife's operating performance  through first- half 2016 (1H16) and reflect ongoing developments around the  company's pending separation of a large portion of its U.S. Retail segment. In  connection with the separation, it is expected that NELIC and MetLife USA will  be the rated entities separated from MetLife and included in the new stand-alone  organization, which has been named Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse  Financial). When the separation was originally announced, GALIC was expected to  join MetLife USA within Brighthouse Financial. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that the company's  strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial flexibility, and very  strong market positions in several major insurance product lines and markets in  the U.S. and select international markets remain consistent with rating  expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale and very strong  brand name will continue to provide the company with significant competitive  advantages. Fitch views the pending separation of the Brighthouse  Financial-related businesses as neutral to MetLife's ratings based on our view  that any decline in diversification of MetLife as a result of the separation  will largely be mitigated by the lower risk profile of the businesses remaining  within MetLife.  The ratings also consider MetLife's above-average investment risk, lower  operating profitability in recent quarters and continued macroeconomic  challenges associated with the ongoing low interest rate environment. Fitch  views the uncertainty around MetLife's ultimate status relative to a potential  non-bank systemically important financial institution (SIFI) designation to be  credit neutral.  The Rating Watch Negative status of the entities that are expected to be  separated reflects Fitch's view that the operating risk profile of Brighthouse  Financial is more exposed to capital market volatility and interest rate risk  due to its business concentration in variable annuity and universal life with  secondary guarantee businesses.  Existing ratings assigned to MetLife USA and NELIC benefit from the broad  diversification and scale of the MetLife enterprise, which includes very strong  competitive positions in group, voluntary and worksite; corporate benefit  funding; and international insurance. Accordingly, it is likely that the  ultimate ratings of the separated entities will be lower than the current  ratings by one or two notches depending on whether or not the higher operating  risk profile is sufficiently mitigated via extremely strong capitalization or  other methods for which details are not yet available. Fitch expects to resolve  the Rating Watch status of these entities upon finalization of the form of  separation and further solidification of the capitalization and structure of  Brighthouse Financial. MetLife's strong balance sheet fundamentals reflect the company's solid  risk-adjusted capitalization and favorable liquidity profile. Fitch considers  the statutory capitalization of MetLife's U.S. and Japanese insurance operations  to be strong and in line with rating expectations. The company's domestic life  insurance subsidiaries (excluding American Life Insurance Company) reported  combined statutory total adjusted capital of approximately $26.8 billion at  year-end 2015, which resulted in consolidated risk-based capital (RBC) of 505%.  Although the company does not provide intra-year RBC estimates, the company's  domestic life insurance subsidiaries reported combined statutory net operating  gain of approximately $1.3 billion in 1H16 and an increase of approximately $1.9  billion in total adjusted capital.  MetLife's Japanese insurance subsidiary represents the company's largest  insurance business outside the U.S. The Japanese subsidiary reported a statutory  solvency margin ratio of 870% at the end of first quarter 2016, which is above  both rating expectations and levels achieved by most Japanese peers. The company's financial leverage was slightly below 25% at June 30, 2016, down  from approximately 27% at yearend 2015, and within Fitch's expectations for the  company's current ratings. Financial leverage benefited from the maturity of  $1.25 billion of senior notes in June 2016. Fitch views MetLife's operating profitability to be fundamentally sound, but  notes ongoing pressure from low interest rates coupled with recent less  favorable underwriting results. Reported operating income for first half 2016  was significantly affected by the outcome of the company's variable annuity  actuarial assumption review, which was accelerated into the second quarter in  2016 from the typical third quarter timing in preparation for the pending  separation of the Brighthouse Financial businesses. Second quarter operating  earnings were also adversely affected by reserve increases driven by modeling  improvements. DAC unlocking associated with the VA actuarial assumption review  reduced reported operating earnings by $161 million, and the modeling  improvements reduced reported operating earnings by $257 million. Fitch considers MetLife's GAAP interest coverage to be somewhat below  expectations for its current rating category, reflecting lower earnings pressure  noted above. Fitch expects MetLife's GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio to recover  somewhat from the 5.5x level achieved in 1H16 to a level between 7.0x and 7.5x for full-year 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES For two subsidiaries on Rating Watch Negative: Fitch may downgrade ratings upon application of criteria for non-core entities  as mentioned above or upon further announcements by the company of strategic  plans. For MetLife and remaining subsidiaries:  Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, run-rate  ROE below 10%, and GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

182,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Insurer Financial  Strength (IFS) ratings of MetLife Insurance Company USA (MetLife USA) and New  England Life Insurance Company (NELIC) to 'A+' from 'AA-' and removed the  ratings from Rating Watch Negative. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed the  existing ratings assigned to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and its other subsidiaries.  The Outlook on all ratings is Stable. A full list of rating actions is shown at  the end of this release. Today's rating actions follow Brighthouse Financial, Inc.'s (Brighthouse  Financial) filing yesterday of a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission associated with the planned separation of  Brighthouse Financial-related businesses from MetLife. The ratings of these two  entities were previously placed on Rating Watch Negative to reflect the  likelihood that the ratings would be lower on a stand-alone basis. In addition  to reflecting new financial information and strategic plans contained in the  company's Form 10 filing, today's rating actions reflect Fitch's application of  criteria for non-core entities to MetLife USA and NELIC, which are expected to  be separated from MetLife and included in Brighthouse Financial. Fitch now views  both entities to be of limited importance to their current parent.  The affirmation of the remainder of MetLife's ratings reflects Fitch's view that  the company's strong balance sheet fundamentals, excellent financial  flexibility, and very strong market positions in several major insurance product  lines and markets in the U.S. and select international markets remain consistent  with rating expectations. Fitch believes that the company's large scale and very  strong brand name will continue to provide the company with significant  competitive advantages. Fitch views the pending separation of the Brighthouse  Financial-related businesses as neutral to MetLife's ratings based on our view  that any decline in diversification of MetLife as a result of the separation  will largely be mitigated by the lower risk profile of the businesses remaining  within MetLife. KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade of the entities that are expected to be separated reflects Fitch's  view that the risk profile of Brighthouse Financial will be more exposed to  capital market volatility and interest rate risk due to its business  concentration in variable annuity and universal life with secondary guarantee  businesses.  As core subsidiaries of MetLife, MetLife USA and NELIC's ratings have  historically benefited from MetLife's broad diversification and scale. The one  notch downgrade of the ratings reflects Fitch's view that, although Brighthouse  Financial will be smaller relative to MetLife, its scale remains considerable  and, as such, will continue to yield favourable levels of efficiency benefits.  Fitch also views management's target financial leverage and risk-adjusted  capitalization, as well as its risk management capabilities, as sufficient to  offset a significant amount of the higher risk profile of Brighthouse  Financial's product portfolio. RATING SENSITIVITIES For MetLife Insurance Company USA and New England Life Insurance Company: Fitch's ratings on MetLife USA and NELIC assume a generally uneventful execution  of Brighthouse Financial's spin-off from MetLife. Fitch will apply its Prism capital model separately to Brighthouse Financial  when information becomes available, which is likely to be in 2017. A Prism  capital score below strong could cause Fitch to reassess its view of Brighthouse  Financial's capital strength, which is heavily supportive of the rating.  For MetLife and other subsidiaries:  Key rating drivers that could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 450%, financial leverage below 25%, and GAAP  fixed charge coverage ratio above 9x. Key rating drivers that could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings include  NAIC risk-based capital ratio below 350%, financial leverage above 30%, run-rate  ROE below 10%, and GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio below 5x.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction.

186,"   By Lisa Lambert | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 24 The U.S. government and the country's largest life insurer are set for a rematch in a U.S. appeals court on Monday over how federal regulators decide a company is ""too big to fail,"" one of the most significant reforms to come out of the financial crisis.The heart of the fight is whether the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators, should have designated MetLife Inc. a ""systemically important financial institution.""The label indicates MetLife's collapse could devastate the financial system, and it triggers tighter oversight. MetLife would also have to set aside capital to ensure it would not need a government bailout during a crisis.In March, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down the designation, saying the council used an ""arbitrary and capricious"" process in assessing MetLife's vulnerabilities. She also said the government should have analyzed costs and benefits to MetLife, the likelihood it would fail and possible counterparty losses.Most of the arguments before the three judges on Monday's appeals panel will revolve around the steps the FSOC took, with the U.S. government saying Collyer's requirements are not found in any laws and the government cannot assess the likelihood of a company's failure or counterparty losses. MetLife was designated ""too big to fail"" in 2014. It says the FSOC decided first that it was ""too big to fail"" and then created a justification for the label.MetLife will also argue the FSOC should have followed an alternative process known as the activities-based approach, that it says is less costly and better suited to insurance. In that approach, the FSOC would decide a certain activity poses a risk and then regulate it across all companies.The FSOC has said it does not have authority to designate an activity under statute. In April, however, it announced it would use the activities-based method to assess risk in asset managers and mutual funds, leaving MetLife to call its fairness into question. Collyer's decision was considered a blow to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, one of the most important pieces of legislation passed during President Barack Obama's tenure, and which has been under attack from Republicans in Congress.The law authorized the council to designate nonbank companies in response to the $182 billion government bailout that insurer American International Group received during the 2008 financial crisis.
