4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) of CenturyLink, Inc. (CenturyLink) and its subsidiaries at 'BB+'. The  issue ratings of CenturyLink's $8 billion of outstanding senior unsecured notes  (pro forma for first-quarter 2015 refinancing) and revolving credit facility  (RCF) have been affirmed at 'BB+'. The ratings on the outstanding $10.1 billion  aggregate amount of senior unsecured debt of Qwest Corporation (QC) and Embarq  Corporation (Embarq, including certain subsidiaries) have been affirmed at  'BBB-'. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The following factors support CenturyLink's ratings: --Fitch's ratings are based on the expectation that CenturyLink will demonstrate  steady improvement in its revenue profile over the next couple of years given  that rates of decline have moderated to nominal levels and could be flat in  2015; --Near-term consolidated free cash flows (FCFs) have strengthened and are  expected to be relatively healthy in 2015; --Liquidity is expected to remain relatively strong over the rating horizon.  The following factors are embedded in CenturyLink's ratings: --CenturyLink's financial policy, which incorporates a net leverage target of up  to 3x; --High-margin voice revenues continue to decline but are largely being replaced  by broadband and business services revenues. The latter sources have lower  margins.  CenturyLink's consolidated revenues continue to show signs of reaching  stability, declining by a modest 0.4% in 2014, after recording a 1.5% decline in  2013. Fitch continues to expect revenue growth from strategic areas, including  high-speed data, Prism, advanced business services, as well as in managed  hosting and cloud computing services, to contribute to longer-term revenue  stability.  In May 2014, a 24-month, $1 billion share repurchase program became effective  upon the completion of the previous $2 billion repurchase program and by the end  of 2014, $200 million of shares were repurchased. Share repurchases are being  funded primarily out of FCF. Fitch does not expect CenturyLink to issue debt for  future share repurchases. On a gross debt basis, CenturyLink's leverage at year-end 2014 was approximately  2.95x. Leverage has risen from the 2.84x posted in 2013 given slight pressure on  EBITDA as service revenues continue to shift to lower-margin, but strategic,  broadband and business service revenue from higher-margin legacy voice revenues.  Fitch believes leverage will remain around 3x over the next couple of years, in  part due to a stabilization of EBITDA in 2016 or 2017, as newer strategic  services achieve greater scale.  CenturyLink's total debt was $20.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2014. Financial  flexibility is provided through a $2 billion RCF, which matures in December  2019. As of Dec. 31, 2014, approximately $1.275 billion was available on the  facility. CenturyLink also has a $160 million uncommitted revolving letter of  credit facility.  In 2015, Fitch expects CenturyLink's FCF (defined as cash flow from operations  less capital spending and dividends) to be substantially similar to the $913  million generated in 2014. Expected FCF levels reflect capital spending within  the company's guidance of approximately $3 billion for 2015. Within the capital  budget, areas of focus for investment include continued spending on data  center/hosting, broadband expansion and enhancement, as well as spending on  IPTV, the company's facilities-based video program.  Fitch believes CenturyLink has the financial flexibility to manage upcoming  maturities due to its FCF and credit facilities. Maturing debt in 2015 totals  $550 million, of which $350 million was repaid in February 2015. In 2016,  maturities amount to approximately $1.5 billion.  The principal financial covenants in the $2 billion RCF limit CenturyLink's  debt-to-EBITDA for the past four quarters to no more than 4x and EBITDA-to-interest plus preferred dividends (with the terms as defined in the  agreement) to no less than 1.5x. QC has a maintenance covenant of 2.85x and an  incurrence covenant of 2.35x. The facility is guaranteed by certain material  subsidiaries of CenturyLink.  Going forward, Fitch expects CenturyLink and QC will be CenturyLink's only  issuing entities. CenturyLink has a universal shelf registration available for  the issuance of debt and equity securities.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes revenues will be flat in 2015, and will grow in the low single  digits beginning in 2016. EBITDA margins in 2015 and 2016 are expected to  decline slightly from the 38.8% recorded in 2014 as higher margin legacy  revenues continue to decline.  --In 2015, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to approximate $3  billion, similar to the amount spent in 2014. The company's $1 billion share  repurchase program, which became effective in May 2014, is expected to be  completed over an 18-to-24 month period.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not expect a positive rating action over the next several years based  on its assessment of the competitive risks faced by CenturyLink and expectations  for leverage. A negative rating action could occur if: --Consolidated leverage through, but not limited to, operational performance,  acquisitions, or debt-funded stock repurchases, is expected to be 3.5x or  higher; -A reduction in capital spending that, in Fitch's evaluation, affects future  revenue growth. The ratings have been affirmed as follows: CenturyLink --Long-term IDR at 'BB+';  --Senior unsecured $2 billion RCF at 'BB+';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BB+'. Embarq Corp. --IDR at 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'. Embarq Florida, Inc. (EFL) --IDR at 'BB+'; --First mortgage bonds at 'BBB-'. Qwest Communications International, Inc. (QCII) --IDR at 'BB+'. Qwest Corporation (QC) --IDR at 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'. Qwest Services Corporation (QSC) --IDR at 'BB+'.

5,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON AT&T Inc, CenturyLink Inc  and U.S. telecom and cable industry groups called for regulators to block parts of new rules for Internet service providers on Friday, citing ""crushing"" compliance costs and threats to investment.In filings with the Federal Communications Commission, the industry did not ask for a suspension of the principal ""net neutrality"" rules that ban Internet providers from blocking and slowing down web traffic or from striking deals with content companies for smoother downloads.Instead, the groups and companies sought to block the agency's move to reclassify broadband Internet as a more heavily regulated telecommunications service, and a new broad general conduct standard that prohibits Internet providers from ""unreasonably interfering"" with consumers' access to the web.While the requests are expected to be rejected by the FCC, they pave the way for the industry to ask courts to pause the implementation of the rules while they are being litigated. The new regulations go into effect on June 12. After a year of intense debate over how to best regulate Internet service providers, the FCC now faces several industry lawsuits over the proposed rules in different courts. It is not clear yet which court will ultimately get to hear the arguments.The FCC on Thursday asked to transfer the pending cases to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which has twice rejected its previous versions of net neutrality rules but last year confirmed its authority to set Internet regulations. Cable and wireless companies earlier argued they didn't oppose the principles of net neutrality, such as no blocking of any traffic, but rejected the tighter regulatory regime. Friday's filings offer the most specific details yet of the arguments they are expected to make in court.The documents cited testimonials of executives at regional and local Internet providers that the rules will create costly compliance burdens and limit resources for improvements to broadband networks or new products. The filings said that the complexity of the rules would be ""crushing"" for small broadband providers with limited human and financial resources, pointing to the risk of immediate lawsuits and additional burdens from new privacy protection demands.AT&T executives said that it would cost the company about $400 million in lost revenue to end current marketing practices in order to set up new procedures for compliance with the tighter, though yet unspecified, privacy protection requirements for broadband providers.The filings came from the USTelecom Association, CTIA-The Wireless Association, National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the American Cable Association, AT&T, CenturyLink and the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association.",2015-05-01,CTL,"Fri May 1, 2015 | 5:25pm EDT","AT&T, U.S. telecom groups seek to block new Internet rules",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-internet-neutrality-idUSL1N0XS1KM20150501?type=companyNews

""We are disappointed with the verdict and plan to appeal,"" Ayco spokesman Brian Cuneo said. A lawyer for Weinstein could not immediately be reached for comment. Bruce Nagel, a lawyer for the Nacchios, in a statement said the Morristown, New Jersey jury awarded everything his clients sought after a month-long trial. Nagel could not immediately be reached for additional comment. Nacchio, 66, spent roughly five years in prison after being convicted in 2007 of insider trading.

8,"  (Adds details of allegations, jury deliberations, byline)By Jonathan StempelJan 7 Joseph Nacchio, the former Qwest Communications International chief executive, on Thursday won a $14.2 million jury verdict against a Goldman Sachs Group Inc  unit and financial adviser over the sale of life insurance policies, his law firm said.Nacchio and his wife accused Goldman's Ayco financial planning unit and their former adviser David Weinstein of breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to tell them that the $95 million of variable life insurance they bought in 2000 would likely lapse before they died. After learning that the lapse would occur during their 70s, not when they turned 100 as they intended, the Nacchios canceled the policies and paid $26 million in premiums to replace them, their lawyer Bruce Nagel said.The jury award equaled roughly the difference between what the Nacchios spent overall, and what they would have spent in 2000 had they been sold the policies they wanted, Nagel added. ""We are disappointed with the verdict and plan to appeal,"" Ayco spokesman Brian Cuneo said.

14,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis  Buyout firm BC Partners Ltd is in pole position to acquire a data center business that CenturyLink Inc, a U.S. provider of phone and internet services, is hoping to divest for more than $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said.BC Partners emerged as the lead bidder after another private equity consortium comprising GTCR LLC, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Berkshire Partners LLC and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, which was also pursuing the assets, broke apart without any deal reached, the people said this week.The sale process has been complicated by leases that CenturyLink has with Digital Realty Trust Inc, a company which rents out data centers, making a deal with BC Partners uncertain, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. ""As we stated in our second-quarter earnings call in early August, our strategic review process continues to progress well and we expect to complete the process by the end of this year,"" CenturyLink said in a statement. BC Partners declined to comment and Digital Realty could not immediately be reached for comment.  Data center divestitures can be difficult to complete because they involve separating assets that are deeply integrated into a telecommunications network. AT&T Inc abandoned its plans last year to sell its data centers over similar issues.CenturyLink has about 59 colocation data centers that provide space for customers to install servers and equipment that the company then helps support.  Reuters reported in January that one of CenturyLink's peers, Verizon Communications Inc, was also seeking to divest its colocation portfolio of 49 data centers.Cowen Group research analyst Colby Synesael published a note on Oct. 5 stating that a sale of Verizon's data centers was imminent and that Equinix Inc was the most likely acquirer.A source familiar with the matter said Equinix was indeed in talks to acquire these assets from Verizon. Equinix and Verizon declined to comment.  Both companies are shedding assets that were acquired in deals in 2011 at a time when owning data centers was seen as attractive for telecommunications firms. CenturyLink bought data hosting company Savvis for $2.5 billion, while Verizon spent $1.4 billion on another data center company, Terremark Worldwide, that year. Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners is exploring a sale of Vantage Data Centers Management Co LLC in a deal it hopes will value the U.S. company at well in excess of $1 billion, including debt, sources said on Monday.

16,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer  Default Ratings (IDRs) of CenturyLink Inc. (CenturyLink) (NYSE: CTL) and its  subsidiaries on Rating Watch Negative. The rating action affects approximately  $19.9 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016. Fitch has affirmed the Long-Term IDRs of Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT) and  its wholly owned subsidiary Level 3 Financing, Inc. (Level 3 Financing) at 'BB'.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The rating action affects approximately $11  billion of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016. See the full list of rating actions at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Acquisition of LVLT: CenturyLink and LVLT have a definitive agreement whereby  CenturyLink will acquire LVLT in a cash and stock transaction; LVLT's existing  debt will remain outstanding. The cash portion of the transaction, which is  approximately 60%, will be financed by approximately $7 billion in incremental,  senior secured debt as well as cash on hand at both companies. The transaction  is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2017, following  customary shareholder and regulatory approvals.  Fitch views CenturyLink's acquisition of LVLT positively from a strategic  perspective. The two companies combined will create the second largest  enterprise service provider in the U.S. and should benefit from the enhanced  scale and operating synergies over time. Post-acquisition, CenturyLink will also  have an extensive international network.  The Negative Watch for CenturyLink's IDR reflects the increase in leverage pro  forma for the transaction. Fitch estimates that at the end of 2018, the first  full year following the expected close of the transaction, gross leverage will  approximate 3.9x. As currently proposed, the transaction would potentially lead  to a one-notch downgrade for CenturyLink to 'BB' and a Stable Outlook. Based on  a potential one-notch downgrade of the IDR to 'BB', Fitch would also downgrade  CenturyLink's senior unsecured debt one notch. The one-notch downgrade is  consistent with Fitch's notching treatment of issue ratings with 'RR4'  recoveries, reflecting a rating at the same level as the IDR. Resolution of the Rating Watch will be based on an evaluation of a number of  factors, including Fitch's further analysis of CenturyLink's final,  post-acquisition capital structure, an assessment of CenturyLink's financial  policies, the execution risks associated with the integration of LVLT, and the  effect of conditions placed on the transaction by the regulatory approval  process. LVLT's affirmation reflects the proposed structure of the transaction. A new  holding company (HoldCo) will be formed and become the parent of LVLT. The  Holdco is expected to guarantee the acquisition financing at CenturyLink and the  stock of LVLT is expected to also secure the new financing at CenturyLink. The  existing LVLT capital structure will remain in place and LVLT will not provide a  guarantee to the HoldCo or to the acquisition debt. To fund the transaction, CenturyLink has $10.2 billion in secured financing  commitments, including a $2 billion revolver. The remaining $8.2 billion of  other secured facilities includes financing for debt maturing at CenturyLink  prior to the expected close of the transaction. The secured financing is  expected to be guaranteed by existing CenturyLink subsidiaries (including Embarq  Corporation ), except for Qwest Corporation (QC), and by HoldCo. LVLT and QC  are expected to pledge stock to secure the facilities. Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Following the close of the transaction, Fitch  anticipates linking the IDRs of CenturyLink and LVLT based on the strong  operational and strategic ties.  Deleveraging Expected: Following the close of the transaction, Fitch expects  CenturyLink to delever at a moderate pace through EBITDA growth and debt  repayment; however, Fitch does not expect the company to approach its 3.0x net  leverage target in the three year period following the close of the transaction. KEY ASSUMPTIONS For CenturyLink, Fitch's key assumptions within the agency's rating case  include: -- Fitch's base case assumes the data centers are sold as of Jan. 1, 2017 and  thus reflects a full year loss of revenue and EBITDA. Although the LVLT  acquisition is expected to close around Sept. 30, 2017, the forecast assumes it  closes towards the end of fiscal 2017. LVLT's operations are fully incorporated  starting in fiscal 2018. --Fitch assumes CTL revenues will decline 2% or less in 2016 and 2017, before  stabilizing in 2018. --Fitch's forecast cost synergies slightly below synergies expected by  CenturyLink and integration expenses in line with CenturyLink's expectations. --The company benefits from $9.6 billion of unused NOLs from LVLT starting in  2018. --Fitch assumes additional one-time cash taxes related to the data center sale  are paid in 2017. --Share repurchases are suspended while the company deleverages back to its net  leverage target.  For LVLT, Fitch's key assumptions within the agency's rating case include: --The base case assumes a continuation of a rational pricing environment and  stable macro-economic conditions.  --LVLT is largely successful in capitalizing on operating leverage to expand  growth in gross margin and EBITDA margin during the forecast period. --CNS revenue growth ranging between 2% and 3% driven by continued strong growth  within the company's North American Enterprise segment. --LVLT's network access margin (gross margin) growing to over 67% by year-end  2017. --Capital expenditures will approximate 15% of consolidated revenues. --Free cash flow (FCF) generation exceeding 11.5% and 13.5% of revenues during  years ended 2016 and 2017, respectively. --Debt levels are expected to remain relatively consistent. RATING SENSITIVITIES What Could Lead to a Positive Rating Action: Should CenturyLink's IDR be downgraded one notch to 'BB', Fitch does not  anticipate a positive action within a 12- to 18-month rating horizon. To return  to the 'BB+' IDR, Fitch would expect CenturyLink to maintain leverage at 3.0x or  lower while consistently generating positive FCF in the mid-single digits.  Additionally, the company will need to demonstrate consistent revenue growth,  stable or improving margins, and no extensive delays in reaching expected cost  synergies.  What Could Lead to a Negative Rating Action:  Negative rating actions could result from a weakening of CenturyLink's operating  results, including deteriorating margins and revenue erosion brought on by  difficult economic conditions or competitive pressure. Additionally, should  CenturyLink's IDR be downgraded one-notch to 'BB', negative rating actions could  result from discretionary management decisions including, but not limited to,  execution of merger and acquisition activity that increases leverage beyond 4.5x  in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan. LIQUIDITY CenturyLink's total debt was $19.9 billion at June 30, 2016, and readily  available cash totalled $137 million (cash excludes $54 million in foreign bank  accounts). Financial flexibility is provided through a $2 billion revolving  credit facility that matures in December 2019. As of June 30, 2016, there were  no borrowings outstanding on the facility.  Fitch believes CenturyLink has the financial flexibility to manage upcoming  maturities due to its FCF and credit facilities. In 2016, maturities only  consist of $11 million of term loan amortization payments. Maturities amount to  approximately $1.5 billion and $196 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  The principal financial covenants in the $2 billion revolving credit facility  limit CenturyLink's debt to EBITDA for the past four quarters to no more than  4.0x and EBITDA to interest plus preferred dividends (with the terms as defined  in the agreement) to no less than 1.5x. QC has a maintenance covenant of 2.85x  and an incurrence covenant of 2.35x. The facility is guaranteed by certain  material subsidiaries of CenturyLink.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has placed the following CenturyLink ratings on Rating Watch Negative: CenturyLink --Long-Term IDR 'BB+';  --Senior unsecured $2 billion RCF 'BB+/RR4';  --Senior unsecured debt 'BB+/RR4'. Embarq Corp. --IDR 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-/RR2'. Embarq Florida, Inc. (EFL) --IDR 'BB+'; --First mortgage bonds 'BBB-/RR1'. Qwest Communications International, Inc. (QCII) --IDR 'BB+'. Qwest Corporation (QC) --IDR 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-/RR2'. Qwest Services Corporation (QSC) --IDR 'BB+'. Qwest Capital Funding (QCF) --Senior unsecured notes 'BB+/RR4'. Fitch affirms LVLT's ratings as follows: LVLT: --IDR at 'BB';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BB-/RR5'.  Level 3 Financing, Inc.: --IDR at 'BB'; --Senior secured term loan at 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BB/RR2'. The Rating Outlook for LVLT remains Stable.
