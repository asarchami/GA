1,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) reported a better-than-expected rise in revenue in the second quarter, helped by higher demand for its skin care and makeup products such as Clinique lotions and Pure Color Envy lipstick during the holiday shopping season.The company's shares were up 7.6 percent at $78.09 in early trading. Estee Lauder, however, said sales would fall more than it had forecast in the year ending June 30, hurt by a stronger dollar and slowing growth in Hong Kong and China.   Raymond James analyst Joseph Altobello said the forecast cut was anticipated because of the impact from a stronger dollar. ""We continue to view it as an interesting secular growth story with manageable near-term headwinds,"" he said.    The rise of the dollar over the past nine months has reduced the value of overseas sales for many companies including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N). The maker of M.A.C., Bobbi Brown and Estee Lauder cosmetics gets about 60 percent of its net sales from outside the Americas. Up to Wednesday, the dollar .DXY had risen 17.8 percent against major currencies since June 30, 2014.Estee Lauder said it now expected adjusted earnings of $2.93-$3.01 per share on net sales decline of up to 2 percent for the full year. It had earlier forecast adjusted earnings of $3.03-$3.11 per share and sales to be flat or down 1 percent.Smaller rival Coty Inc (COTY.N), known for its Calvin Klein and Davidoff perfume brands, also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit due to cost savings from its streamlined supply chain.Estee Lauder said net income attributable to the company rose almost 1 percent to $435.7 million, or $1.13 per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31. Net sales rose 1 percent to $3.04 billionAnalysts on average had expected revenue of $3.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Coty's shares rose as much as 11.5 percent to a record high of $21.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of rival Elizabeth Arden Inc RDEN.O, scheduled to report after markets close, were up 3.6 percent at $15.10 on the Nasdaq.

3,"   By Jessica Dye  A federal judge in Brooklyn has granted Estee Lauder's motion to dismiss a breach-of-contract claim from a proposed class action accusing the cosmetics giant of falsely promising that its Advanced Night Repair products could make skin more youthful. U.S. District Judge Edward Korman in the Eastern District of New York said Friday that a 30-month delay between when lead plaintiff Donna Tomasino first purchased the products and when she notified Estee Lauder of a problem was fatal to her breach of contract claim.

4,"  (Recasts, adds comments from Hypermarcas CEO in paragraphs 4-8, updates stock price)By Yashaswini SwamynathanNov 2 Coty Inc will pay about $1 billion for the beauty care unit of Brazil's Hypermarcas SA , beefing up distribution in one of the world's largest consumer markets ahead of the completion of a similar deal with Procter & Gamble Co.Coty said on Monday the Hypermarcas purchase would provide a platform to distribute P&G products in Brazil, where demand for U.S.-made cosmetics is growing rapidly. In July, Coty agreed to pay P&G $12.5 billion for 43 brands to expand beyond perfumes.Under Bart Becht, who was tapped as Coty's chief executive officer in June, Coty is trying to appeal to younger consumers, shifting to areas like make-up and celebrity perfumes. Becht, known for his hunger for big deals, engineered the merger that created Reckitt Benckiser Plc.""The deal makes sense. The region is a fast-growing market in terms of personal care... but the economy is one that has question marks over it,"" said Neil Saunders, who heads research firm Conlumino.Coty would become the world's No. 3 make-up maker behind L'Oreal SA and Estee Lauder Cos Inc  after the P&G deal closes. It shares rose as much as 4 percent before easing to be up 1.8 percent to $29.47.Becht must integrate Coty's Brazilian acquisitions amid the country's worst recession in a quarter century as well as record low consumer confidence and rising unemployment.Household consumption in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, fell 2.1 percent in the second quarter, the worst drop since 2001. Coty said the Hypermarcas business it is acquiring, including the Monange shampoo and Risqué nail polish brands, generated net revenue of about $253.5 million last year. Coty plans to pay for the purchase with cash and debt.The acquisition requires Brazilian regulatory approval. ""NET DEBT-FREE"" With the deal Hypermarcas, the largest Brazilian maker of over-the-counter medicines, can focus on its core business of pharmaceuticals, CEO Claudio Bergamo said in an interview.Proceeds will be used to repay debt, Bergamo noted. ""Once the deal is concluded, we will be net debt-free,"" Bergamo said. ""We are definitely focusing on pharmaceuticals in Brazil, where the potential to grow is immense.""Hypermarcas is also looking to spin off its diaper unit. A source told Reuters last month the company was in talks to sell the business to Kimberly-Clark Corp.Bergamo declined to comment on the negotiations because they are ongoing.

5,"   By Ramkumar Iyer  Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) reported a better-than-expected profit in the third quarter as it shifted some expenses into the current quarter, analysts said, a move that limited the company's ability to raise its forecast.Also, Estee Lauder's quarterly sales, excluding the effect of currency, did not rise as much as analysts expected, helping send the company's shares down as much as 3.7 percent on Tuesday.The company earned 73 cents per share on an adjusted basis in the third quarter, handily beating analysts' estimates of 61 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Estee Lauder raised its full-year profit forecast to $3.09-$3.14 per share from $3.07-$3.12, attributing the increase only to a smaller impact from the dollar. Analysts were expecting a profit of $3.15 per share.""They've had some advertising and marketing costs and store openings pushed from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. So you have lower SG&A, marketing, and fixed costs, which drove the beat in the quarter,"" Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said. The cosmetics maker also said it would cut 900 to 1,200 jobs, or 2.5 percent of its workforce, as part of a new restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs and improving R&D, supply chain and e-commerce.Estee Lauder said it expects to incur restructuring charges of $600-$700 million, but did not say when it would record the charges.The company's results in the third quarter was also hurt by the declining fortunes of its core skin care business, which houses the Estee Lauder and Clinique brands. Revenue from the business fell 3 percent to $1.07 billion, declining for the second straight quarter.Consumers' preference for ""instant benefit"" skin products such as face masks over anti-aging creams, which take longer to show effects, are hurting Estee Lauder, Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said.However, sales at Estee Lauder's makeup business surged 7 percent to $1.16 billion, primarily driven by the M.A.C. and Smashbox brands. That helped net sales increase 3 percent to $2.66 billion, meeting analysts' estimates.Estee Lauder's sales rose 6 percent on a constant currency basis, the low end of the company's guidance of 6-7 percent growth. Grundy said Wall Street analysts were expecting an increase of about 7 percent.The company's shares were down 3.7 percent at a session low of $93.54 in afternoon trading.

9,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Investors looking for stability and dividends have been pouring money into consumer staples stocks of late, ignoring warnings from Wall Street's analysts about pricey valuations for companies like Clorox (CLX.N) and Campbell Soup (CPB.N).Widely viewed as relatively safe bets in a world of macroeconomic worries, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like processed food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors in the past year, and fund flow data suggests investors expect more of the same.The number of new institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, of Campbell Soup in the last quarter has jumped 92 percent, according to research firm Morningstar. New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent.In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com.With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector. ""We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,"" said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies. ""The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,"" he said. The S&P consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data. Following the consumer staples index's 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P 500. ""On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar's impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods.But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for ""natural"" and organic food. The S&P 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago.

12,"   By Se Young Lee and Joyce Lee | SEOUL  SEOUL Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Bain Capital Private Equity will acquire a majority stake in unlisted cosmetics maker Carver Korea Co Ltd, seeking to tap into the growing popularity of South Korean beauty products in markets such as China.The companies said in a joint release that Carver Korea founder and Chairman Lee Sang-rok, who held a 60.2 percent stake in the firm at end-2015, will retain a minority stake and ""participate in day-to-day management"".Details, including the price and specific stakes the foreign buyers are getting, were not disclosed. But a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Goldman and Bain together are paying more than 350 billion won ($307.45 million) to get majority ownership of Carver. The acquisition comes as the so-called Korean Wave of culture exports, from soap operas and K-pop music to food and fashion, boost overseas demand for beauty products. Major domestic brands such as Amorepacific Corp (090430.KS) have been among the chief beneficiaries, with their share prices soaring on hopes for sustained growth.  Kyobo Securities said in a report South Korean exports of cosmetics products set a quarterly record of $874.3 million in April-June, thanks to growing shipments to China and the United States. January-May sales for Carver, which owns beauty product brands including flagship skincare line A.H.C., were up more than 200 percent from a year earlier and topped the 150 billion won figure for all of 2015, the joint statement from Carver, Goldman and Bain said. Carver sells about 1,000 products in South Korea, China and the U.S.  The acquisition follows other foreign investment into South Korean cosmetics firms, such as Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N) acquiring a stake of unknown size in the parent firm of Korean skincare brand Dr.Jart+ in October 2015.Also last year, China's Jumei International Holding Ltd (JMEI.N) invested about $125 million in the ""snail cream"" maker Its Skin Co Ltd (226320.KS), while another China investor Lancy Group acquired 10 percent of unlisted ""mask pack"" maker L&P Cosmetics Co Ltd for $51 million, according to Its Skin and L&P Cosmetics officials. Officials at Jumei and Lancy could not be immediately reached for comment.South Korea's cosmetics output grew to 10.7 trillion won in 2015, up 20 percent from the previous year, while cosmetics exports grew 44 percent from the previous year to $2.59 billion in 2015 due to growing overseas popularity of ""K-beauty"" products, according to the country's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

13,"  SEOUL An investment arm of French luxury goods giant LVMH (LVMH.PA) said it took a minority stake in South Korea's CLIO Cosmetics, swelling the ranks of global investors placing a bet on booming demand for Korean beauty products in major markets like China.The unit of LVMH, owner of beauty brands from Guerlain to Make Up for Ever, and CLIO said in a joint statement on Friday that L Capital Asia bought a minority stake in the Korean cosmetics firm, without saying how big a stake was involved nor how much was paid for it. A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters L Capital invested $50 million for about a 7 percent stake, saying CLIO plans to seek approval to launch an initial public offering as early as next week. The person declined to be identified because the matter was confidential. Foreign investors having been piling into the Korean cosmetics business in recent years, emboldened by the country's success in exporting a 'Korean Wave' culture built around music, fashion and beauty products. In 2015, South Korea become the second-largest cosmetics exporter to China after France, shipping $1.1 billion in goods, according to Seoul's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

L Capital Asia's move to buy into CLIO is not the first time LVMH has bet on South Korea's pop culture.
