3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HFSG)  announced this morning that it has reached a definitive agreement to sell  Hartford Life Insurance K.K. (HLIKK) to a subsidiary of Orix Corporation, a  publicly held international financial services organization based in Tokyo,  Japan, for consideration of approximately $895 million. HLIKK houses HFSG's  Japan annuity operations, the sale of which will, with the exception of  reinsurance on approximately $1.1 billion of fixed payout annuities written by  HLIKK, result in HFSG's exit from the Japan market. Despite the GAAP loss incurred by HFSG on the sale, Fitch views the elimination  of the company's exposure to the Japan variable annuity business as a  considerable offsetting factor. The sale of this unit is in line with  management's stated objective of refocusing HFSG on its ongoing property  casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses. HFSG estimates that the sale of HLIKK, which is expected to close in July 2014,  will result in a GAAP loss of approximately $675 million and a substantial  statutory capital benefit generated by the sales proceeds and a release of  capital backing reserves reinsured by HFSG's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries. Fitch affirmed the ratings of HFSG and most of its operating subsidiaries on  April 22, 2014. Concurrently, Fitch upgraded the Insurer Financial Strength  (IFS) rating of Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (HLA) to 'A' from  'A-', and downgraded the IFS ratings of Hartford Life Insurance Company (HLIC)  and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company (HLAIC) to 'BBB+' from 'A-'.  HFSG's ratings have a Stable Outlook. All of these rating actions incorporated  the potential for the sale of HFSG's Japan operations with terms that did not  violate the rating sensitivities that Fitch cited in the associated Rating  Action Commentary on April 22. Fitch views the terms of the transaction  announced today to be within expectations. Contact:  Primary Analyst Martha M. Butler, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-31911 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

Last year, it spent about $2.6 billion on Dutch asset manager Robeco.The sale of the Japanese unit, Hartford Life Insurance K.K., would come as Connecticut-based Hartford Financial has been shifting its focus to the more stable and less risky business of property casualty from annuities. In a statement on Monday, Orix said the deal is subject to authorities' approval but it aims to complete the acquisition by the end of July.Orix said it is planning to merge Hartford's Japan unit with Orix Life Insurance Corp.The merger would boost Orix Life's solvency margin, a closely watched gauge of insurers' financial health, to over 1,000 percent from 473.1 as of the end of December, the company said. The Hartford unit had the solvency margin of over 1,200 percent as of the end of December. Orix said it would book a 30 billion yen gain for the current financial year ending in March 2015 as negative goodwill stemming from the deal, whose value is under the Hartford unit's net worth of about 120 billion yen.Hartford said estimated pro forma effect of the transaction is a U.S. GAAP loss of about $675 million and pro forma capital benefit is about $1.4 billion as of the end of March.""This transaction materially reduces Hartford's risk profile by permanently eliminating the company's Japan variable annuity risk,"" Hartford CEO Liam McGee said in a statement. Hartford was one of several foreign insurers that actively wrote its Japanese variable annuity policies - which guarantee a minimum payout and then an additional payout based on investment returns - between 1999 and 2009 when consumers were suffering from years of ultra-low interest rates amid the country's prolonged deflation.The guarantees attracted customers. But they became a heavy drag on insurance companies that had aggressively sold such policies following the market plunge in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Hartford and other insurers selling similar policies, such as ING Groep, Allianz SE and Prudential PLC  subsidiary PCA Life, also suffered in the market turmoil and also stopped selling variable annuity policies in Japan.Orix said it would hedge the Hartford unit's minimum payout guarantee risks through reinsurers.JP Morgan was financial advisor for Orix and Deutsche Bank for Hartford, the companies said in their statements respectively.($1 = 102.0350 Japanese Yen)   (Editing by Dominic Lau and Christopher Cushing)",2014-04-28,HIG,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 4:22am EDT",UPDATE 1-Japan's Orix agrees to buy Hartford Japan unit for $895M,http://www.reuters.com//article/orix-hartford-fin-ser-idUSL3N0NK21B20140428?type=companyNews
