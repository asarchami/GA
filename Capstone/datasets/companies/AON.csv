7,"  * 16 bln pound deal the biggest in the UK* Hedges more than a quarter of scheme's old-age risk* Takes total UK issuance to nearly 50 bln pounds - Aon   (Adds reaction, background on the scheme)By Kate Holton and Simon JessopLONDON, July 4 The trustees of BT Group Plc's  pension scheme have taken out insurance against the costs associated with members living longer than expected, in the biggest such deal of its kind in Britain.BT, a former state telecoms group, has 320,000 members in its scheme, making it the country's largest private sector defined-benefit pension plan, which requires annual top ups from the parent company.The trustees said on Friday they had created their own insurance company with the Prudential Insurance Co of America  that would cover 25 percent of the scheme's total exposure to people living longer, or 16 billion pounds ($27 billion) of the scheme's liabilities.Chairman of the Trustees Paul Spencer said in a statement the deal was groundbreaking in terms of size and structure. The risk that some pension schemes would be unable to meet their obligations to pensioners has become particularly acute as people live longer.The International Monetary Fund estimates that for each extra year of life expectancy, current liabilities in a typical defined benefit pension scheme increase by 3 to 4 percent.That means companies may have to find billions of extra pounds and carry the risk of making a mistake in their calculations on their balance sheet. But a so-called longevity swap - such as BT's deal - helps to insure against that risk. Under these schemes, a pension fund makes regular payments to a third party, typically an insurer, reinsurer or investment bank, based on agreed expected mortality rates among the scheme's policy holders.The third party then agrees to take on the risk that those figures were underestimated and is liable to pay out to policy holders based on actual mortality rates.British companies have led the way in setting up such deals. Insurer Aviva in March this year agreed to transfer the risk of members of its staff pension scheme living longer than expected to three reinsurers.Deals done since the first one by engineering contractor Babcock in May 2009 total nearly 32 billion pounds. That figure has grown by half as much again as a result of the BT deal, data from consultants Aon Hewitt showed. And more deals are expected.Matt Wilmington, partner at Aon Hewitt, which advised on the deal, said: ""We have been talking for a number of months about the increasing capacity and appetite of the global reinsurance market to take on pension fund longevity risk.""2014 has already been a record year for risk settlement transaction volume and we expect a number of further transactions to add to the growing list of those completed.""BT said at the end of March its pension scheme had liabilities of 46.7 billion pounds and assets of 40 billion pounds. The company said the deal would not affect how much it pays into the scheme, although that is likely to increase when the latest review is completed, which is expected to be next year.BT currently pays annual deficit payments of 325 million pounds and analysts believe this could increase to nearer 500 million pounds following the next review.

17,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a 'BBB+' rating to the  proposed 30-year senior unsecured notes issuance by Aon plc (Aon). Additionally,  Fitch has affirmed all of Aon's ratings, including the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) and senior debt ratings at 'BBB+', and the commercial paper rating at  'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of ratings follows at the  end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  The new notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon Corporation (Aon  Corp.) and the ratings are therefore based on Aon Corp.'s existing Fitch 'BBB+'  IDR. Net proceeds from this new issuance will be used for general corporate  purposes likely including the refinancing of senior debt maturing later in 2015.  Fitch views the proposed debt favorably as the new senior debt will likely be  issued at an attractive rate given current market conditions and will have a  long-dated maturity, resulting in an improved liquidity profile with reduced  near-term refinancing risk. Ultimately, Fitch does not expect material change to  pro forma financial leverage, since the proceeds will likely be used in part to  refinance existing debt.  Financial leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDA (trailing 12 months; TTM) will  temporarily increase from roughly 2.2x to 2.3x, while being offset by growing  EBITDA and cash flow. Fitch expects financial leverage will continue to be  manageable and within both Fitch's expectations for the company and the broker  sector credit factor guidelines for the current rating category. The ratings affirmation reflects Aon's strong competitive position, balance  sheet and cash flow generation, very good financial flexibility, and manageable  financial leverage which are all within guidelines for the rating category.  Fitch believes Aon's liquidity profile is strong with cash and short-term  investments of $721 million as of March 31, 2015. Cash flow remains significant  with earnings-based EBITDA interest coverage of roughly 10x. The company  generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year 2014,  following $1.6 billion in 2013 and $1.4 billion in 2012. For the first quarter  of 2015, cash flow increased by $147 million to $136 million, also increasing  free cash flow (less capital expenditures), due primarily to reduced expenses.  Fitch notes that the fourth quarter is typically Aon's strongest cash flow  generator. Financial flexibility has been improving year-over-year. Interest coverage has  been improving due to higher EBITDA, reduced pension liabilities and  restructuring program expenses, decreasing capital expenditures, and only  moderate changes to debt levels. Although Aon's merger and acquisition activity  has increased in the last few quarters, it has been below its normal levels  following the Hewitt acquisition. Financial leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDA (TTM) was roughly 2.1x at  year-end 2014, and 2.2x through March 31, 2015, in line with historical levels.  Fitch expects leverage to remain relatively stable with some modest improvement,  assuming continued strong EBITDA growth and anticipated capital planning  including share repurchases. Leverage is currently at levels that Fitch views as  solid for the rating category.  The ratings continue to reflect Aon's favorable competitive position among the  top three global brokers, with major operations in (re)insurance brokerage and  human capital consulting/outsourcing. The company continues to demonstrate its  ability to retain clients and expand new business while improving profitability.  Partially offsetting these positive factors are continued earnings pressure from  pension liabilities, competitive insurance market conditions, and the global  economic downturn. Organic growth in the brokerage segment was on par with the  peer average in 2014. Favorably, the company reported organic revenue growth in  both the Risk Solutions and HR Solutions businesses in 2014 and through March  31, 2015.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include the following: --A sustained strong improvement in operating performance on an absolute basis  and relative to peers with operating EBIT consistently over $1 billion and an  operating EBIT margin near 15%;  --A run-rate debt-to-EBITDA ratio less than 1.5x;  --Interest coverage as measured by an EBITDA-to-interest more than 12x.  The key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include the following: --A sustained increase in debt-to-EBITDA to more than 2.25x;  --A deterioration of the company's average EBITDA-to-interest expense to lower  single digits;  --An impairment to goodwill that would materially impact the balance sheet and  related ratios.  Fitch expects to assign the following rating: Aon plc --Senior debt due 2045 'BBB+'(EXP). Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Aon plc --IDR at 'BBB+'; --$350 million 4% senior debt due 2023 at 'BBB+'; --$600 million 3.5% senior debt due 2024 at 'BBB+'; --EUR500 million 2.875% senior debt due 2026 at 'BBB+'; --$256 million 4.25% senior debt due 2042 at 'BBB+'; --$250 million 4.45% senior debt due 2043 at 'BBB+'; --$550 million 4.6% senior debt due 2044 at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

20,"  * After record 2014, Q1 saw company deals worth 800 mln pounds* Deficits, deal complexity hitting volume of deals* Just 27 pct of firms looking to do a full deal - AonBy Carolyn CohnLONDON, Aug 3 A revenue boost to British life insurers from companies looking to pass on their pension scheme risk is looking uncertain, as low interest rates make scheme deficits wider and deals harder to reach.Insurers are putting their faith in so-called bulk-annuity deals to fill a hole left by changes to the pensions industry earlier this year, which have at least halved demand from individuals for annuities providing an income for life.Leader of the pack in bulk annuities last year was Legal & General, with two deals alone bringing in more than 5 billion pounds ($7.8 billion) in premiums.But after a record 13 billion pound year for bulk business in 2014 for the sector as a whole, sales fell off in the first quarter of 2015 to 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) of premiums, compared with around 4 billion in the same quarter a year earlier, analysts say.While business traditionally picks up in the second half of the year, a weaker than expected showing as insurers begin to report earnings this week may cut overall revenue growth from annuity sales. The complexity of these bulk deals means some can take many months to be structured, making the deal pipeline irregular and hard to plan for. The administrative burden for scheme trustees and competition from new-entrant insurers also makes deals harder.Mark Paxton, bulk annuity consultant at Barnett Waddingham, said for insurers expanding into bulk annuities from individual deals, ""it's taking longer than they thought, they are finding out how difficult it is.""As a result, second-quarter data, due to be released as insurers begin reporting earnings this week, is expected to be light, said Gordon Aitken, analyst at RBC.Companies with big pension scheme deficits are looking to close them to new members and then either continue to run the schemes themselves, or sell the risk on to an insurer, thereby removing all liability from their balance sheets.But prolonged low interest rates means many company schemes do not have enough money in them. Funding is currently below 85 percent, data from the Pension Protection Fund showed. To close the gap, companies have several options. One is to invest in riskier assets to try to improve returns; another is to hope interest rates rise to help make their income-bearing investments more profitable.MORE CASH Companies can also pump more cash directly into the schemes to make a deal with an insurer more likely, or if a full deal is too hard to reach, they can do a partial deal, where an insurer buys some of the risk. Absent a closing of the gap, much of the 2 trillion pounds in defined benefit pension scheme liabilities currently with UK Plc is likely to remain there.That has not stopped more insurers including Scottish Widows, LV= and Canada Life looking to challenge existing providers such as Legal & General.Scottish Widows, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said last week it completed its first bulk annuity transaction in the first half and planned more deals this year, while Vanessa Owen, head of retirement solutions products at LV=, said it was a ""logical area for us to investigate and we are actively pursuing opportunities"".For Paul Traynor, international head of insurance at BNY Mellon, the need for data to provide an accurate estimate of how long pensioners will live could be a barrier to entry, as ""the established players have decades of data"".While company boards may be more prepared to make cash injections into their schemes as the year ends and they have a better idea of cashflows, the prospect of a UK base rate rise over coming months means some companies may prefer to wait and see if it helps close their deficits.Jay Shah, head of origination at bulk annuity provider Pension Insurance Corp, said that if interest rates were higher, ""we would be flooded with people wanting to buy out their pension schemes"".Consultants KPMG have predicted the bulk annuity market could grow to 20 billion pounds a year by 2020, which would more than compensate for a recent halving in the market for individuals to buy annuities.But a study by consultants Aon Hewitt on Monday showed that just 27 percent of schemes surveyed had identified a full bulk annuity deal as their long-term objective, with the remainder planning to keep running the schemes themselves.

22,"  LONDON Oct 12 Deals involving transferring the risk of British company defined benefit pension schemes to insurers are likely to total 10 billion pounds ($15.35 billion) this year, down on last year's record 13 billion pounds, consultants Aon Hewitt said on Monday.These ""bulk annuity"" deals are a good source of income for UK life insurers, particularly after government pensions reform has at least halved the sale of individual annuities.For companies, the deals remove the headache of running the pension schemes. Years of low interest rates mean many schemes are in deficit and these sometimes need to be filled by the company before the life insurer takes on the risk.Aon Hewitt said in a report there had been 3.6 billion pounds in bulk annuity deals in the second quarter, compared with only 800 million in the first quarter. ""With insurers busy on a substantial number of transactions which could conclude before Christmas, 10 billion pounds is not an unrealistic expectation for year."" But European Solvency II capital rules to be introduced in Jan 2016 are likely to mean insurers have to set aside more money to cover the cost of bulk annuity transactions and these have been a concern.""2015 has been a period of flux,"" Aon Hewitt said, pointing out that on Solvency II, ""some details have remained obstinately grey"". Life insurers are moving to reinsure this business outside Europe to soften the impact of the new rules.Prudential and Legal & General were the most active in the bulk annuity market in the year to date, the report said.

Under a buy-in, the scheme continues to pay the pensions of its members, but the insurer provides an insurance policy for a portion of the scheme, covering risks such as that members may live longer than expected or that investment returns may fall. A buy-out deal, meanwhile, is where the insurer takes on full responsibility for managing the scheme payments and liaises directly with the pensioner.

25,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all of Aon plc's (Aon)  ratings, including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior debt ratings at  'BBB+', and the commercial paper ratings at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings affirmation reflects Aon's continued favorable competitive position,  solid balance sheet and cash flow generation, and very good financial  flexibility, partially offset by a moderate run-rate level of financial  leverage, all of which are within guidelines for the current rating category.  Also partially offsetting the favorable factors is the fact that, similar to  other insurance brokers that Fitch rates, Aon faces contingent risks, including  reputational risk and as an occasional target of litigation and regulatory  actions that can have a financial impact.  Fitch believes Aon's liquidity profile is strong with cash and short-term  investments of $740 million as of Dec. 31, 2015. Cash flow remains significant  with earnings-based EBITDA interest coverage of roughly 9.2x for the period and  averaging roughly 10x over the past five years. For the full year 2015, cash  flow from operations increased by nearly $200 million to $2 billion compared to  2014, and free cash flow (less capital expenditures) also grew, due primarily to  reduced expenses. Financial flexibility has been improving year over year. Interest coverage  remains solid despite some earnings pressure and a temporary increase in  interest expense from prefunded debt due in part to lower expenses including  reduced pension liabilities and completed restructuring program expenses, and  decreasing capital expenditures. Fitch expects Aon's financial flexibility to  remain strong going forward.  Financial leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDA is managed at a moderately  higher level relative to some of its peers and Fitch considers it to be one of  Aon's key rating triggers. Leverage was roughly 2.3x at year-end 2015, and  including Aon's recent $750 million senior debt issuance, pro forma leverage  temporarily increased to roughly 2.6x (adjusting for the one-time legal  settlement in early 2015, pro forma leverage would be 2.4x). Aon paid off debt  during the fourth quarter of 2015, and the recent debt offering essentially  returns financial leverage to the third quarter 2015 level and may be used to  refinance near-term debt maturities. Excluding unusual items, leverage remains  in line with historical levels.  Fitch expects that leverage should remain relatively stable with some modest  improvement, assuming continued EBITDA growth, partially offset by continued  capital planning including share repurchases, which Fitch considers  discretionary. Leverage should continue to be manageable and within both Fitch's  expectations for the company and the broker-sector credit factor guidelines for  the current rating category, with any debt increases aligned with growing EBITDA  and increased cash flow.  The ratings continue to reflect Aon's favorable competitive position among the  top three global brokers, with major operations in (re)insurance brokerage and  human capital consulting/outsourcing. The company continues to demonstrate its  ability to retain clients and expand new business while improving free cash flow  and maintaining profitability.  Partially offsetting these positive factors are continued balance sheet and  earnings pressure from pension liabilities, competitive insurance market  conditions particularly in reinsurance, and the global economic downturn.  Organic growth in the brokerage segment was on par with the peer average in  2014. Favorably, the company reported organic revenue growth in both the Risk  Solutions and HR Solutions businesses in 2014 and through Sept. 30, 2015.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include the following: --A sustained strong improvement in operating performance on an absolute basis  and relative to peers with operating EBIT consistently over $1 billion and an  operating EBIT margin near 15%;  --A run-rate debt-to-EBITDA ratio approaching 1.7x;  --Interest coverage as measured by an EBITDA-to-interest more than 12x.  The key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include the following: --A sustained increase in debt-to-EBITDA to more than 2.5x (adjusted for large  one-time items) while maintaining an operating EBIT margin near 12%;  --A deterioration of the company's average EBITDA-to-interest expense to lower  single digits;  --An impairment to goodwill that would materially impact the balance sheet and  related ratios.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Aon plc --IDR at 'BBB+'; --$400 million 2.8% senior debt due 2021 'BBB+'; --$350 million 4% senior debt due 2023 at 'BBB+'; --$600 million 3.5% senior debt due 2024 at 'BBB+'; --$750 million 3.875% senior debt due 2025 'BBB+'; --EUR500 million 2.875% senior debt due 2026 at 'BBB+'; --$256 million 4.25% senior debt due 2042 at 'BBB+'; --$250 million 4.45% senior debt due 2043 at 'BBB+'; --$550 million 4.6% senior debt due 2044 at 'BBB+'; --$600 million 4.75% senior debt due 2045 at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

27,"  TORONTO, March 31 The financial health of Canadian pension funds declined in the first quarter of 2016, affected by volatile currency markets, weakness in equity markets and lower bond yields, consultancy Aon said on Thursday.The quarterly survey of 449 Aon-Hewitt-administered Canadian pension funds, which measures the plans' assets over liabilities to calculate their solvency-funded ratio, showed overall pension solvency dropped by 4.5 percentage points through the quarter.The median solvency was 83.1 percent, compared with 87.6 percent at the end of the previous quarter The survey highlighted the negative impact on the funds from the improved strength of the Canadian dollar, which staged a comeback to $0.77 in late March from $0.69 in mid-January. That diminished the pension funds' returns from non-Canadian assets. ""Uncertainty in global economies is causing volatility in commodities and currency, as well as raising concerns about equity valuations and interest rate direction,"" said Ian Struthers, partner at Aon's Investment Consulting Practice. Canada's largest public pension funds have continued to perform strongly, benefiting from their strategy of investing in assets such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity as an alternative to public market investments.The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Canada's third biggest public pension fund, reported on Wednesday a 13 percent return on its investments in 2015.
