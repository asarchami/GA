0,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), maker of surveillance drones and other military equipment, on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings despite a drop in revenues and said share buybacks would drive earnings per share higher in 2014.Chief Executive Wes Bush told analysts that a two-year budget agreement reached by Congress last year reduced some of the uncertainty that had been hanging over the aerospace and defense sector, and could stave off worse spending cuts in 2014.But he said the U.S. budget environment remained challenging, and the Pentagon's budget for researching or buying new weapons was likely to remain under pressure into 2015, since personnel cuts take longer to implement.International sales, by contrast, continued to grow, helping to offset declines in U.S. orders, he said. International sales grew 20 percent to $2.5 billion, or just over 10 percent of revenue, in 2013 and are expected to expand to about 13 percent of sales in 2014.""We see emerging opportunities around the globe that our portfolio should allow us to address,"" Bush said, citing demand for unmanned platforms, airborne surveillance by manned military aircraft, electronics, cyber, and other offerings. Bush said the company was making good progress on a program to build Global Hawk unmanned planes for NATO, and hoped to finalize a similar deal with South Korea this year.Northrop shares gained 84 cents to $112.97 on the New York Stock Exchange around midday.Northrop's quarterly net profit fell 10 percent to $478 million, or $2.12 per share, in the fourth quarter, from $533 million, or $2.14 per share, a year earlier. Sales fell 5 percent to $6.16 billion. Sales from the aerospace business fell 7 percent to $2.43 billion.Analysts had expected quarterly earnings per share of $1.94 on sales of $6.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it expects revenue of $23.5 billion to $23.8 billion in 2014, with short-cycle businesses likely to be hit particularly hard. But it said it planned to buy back about 8 percent of shares again in 2014, which would drive earnings per share higher to $8.70 to $9 a share. Earnings rose 7 percent to $8.35 per share in 2013. Northrop also expects to return a ""substantial amount of cash"" to shareholders in 2014 as it continues to balance investments, share buybacks and competitive dividends, Chief Financial Officer Jim Palmer said.Northrop repurchased 27.3 million shares for $2.4 billion in 2013, and still had authorization for $3.1 billion in buybacks.

14,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Navy said on Tuesday it continued to examine options for a system to help Northrop Grumman Corp's new MQ-4 Triton high-altitude unmanned spy plane detect and avoid other aircraft, and expected to decide on a new approach in less than a year.The Navy last year halted work on a complex ""sense and avoid"" radar being developed by Exelis Inc after the company ran into technical challenges in trying to develop a system small enough to fit on the nose of the drone.Sean Burke, deputy program manager for the Triton program, told reporters at an annual Navy League conference that the Triton was making good progress in flight testing and development, but it had proven technically challenging to scale down the complex, 360-degree radar needed for the new sensor.""We're taking a very hard look at what the right way forward is, and whether we continue with ours or whether we take a step in another direction,"" Burke said. He said a decision was expected within a year but declined to be more specific.Exelis confirmed that work had been halted on the radar last year but had no additional comment. Burke said there was no other sensors on the market now that met the Navy's requirements, and that officials were also looking at other technology options besides radar.The Navy needs the new sensor to help avoid other aircraft since operational plans for the Triton call for it to shift from its normal flight altitude of over 60,000 feet to as low as 5,000 feet to photograph and record areas of interest.Commercial aircraft do not fly at the higher altitudes where Triton will generally fly, but the sensor will give it ""eyes in the cockpit"" and allow it to move to lower altitudes safely. The plane will also need such sensors to get certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for broader integration into U.S. airspace, Burke said.The Navy plans to have two Triton aircraft operating in 2017, and four by 2018. The planes will carry out persistent wide area surveillance, but their capabilities will be expanded over time to help them listen for sonar buoys and other signals, and to relay airborne communications. Burke said if development had been completed, Triton would have been ideally suited to help hunt for the Malaysia Airlines plane that has been missing in the Indian Ocean for a month.He said the plane was in flight testing now, but could not be used in the global search since its cameras and other sensors would not be integrated and flight tested until September.An earlier demonstration plane built by Northrop could not be used because it relied on commercial satellites whose reach did not extend to the remote ocean area where the plane is believed to have crashed, Burke said.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)",2014-04-09,NOC,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 10:02pm EDT",U.S. Navy mulls options to help drones avoid other planes,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-northrop-exelis-unmanned-idUSBREA3804M20140409?type=companyNews

16,"  (Updates with UK, US statements confirming move)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, April 16 The U.S. Defense Department has approved the first trans-Atlantic flight of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet in July to take part in two international air shows near London, U.S. and British officials said Wednesday.The new warplane will make its international debut at the Royal International Air Tattoo, or RIAT, an annual military air show held outside London in July, followed by appearances at the show, held every other year, said the officials.""The U.S. and the UK have worked closely together on the F-35 project from the beginning. This fifth generation stealth combat aircraft will be a major boost to British combat air power and it is entirely fitting that the F-35's first stop outside the United States will be in the UK,"" British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said in a statement.Lockheed is the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier.The jet's appearance will be closely watched by potential buyers, including Canada and Denmark, which helped fund the plane's development but are rethinking their procurements. F-35 backers say the decision reflects growing confidence in the $392 billion program, the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, but skeptics say the plane still faces challenges with completing the software needed to integrate weapons on the jet.Britain, which contributed $2 billion to the development of the new radar-evading fighter jet and plans to buy 138 F-35s in coming years, asked for the jet's participation to help showcase the increasing maturity of the new radar-evading plane. Britain was also the first international partner on the program.Aerospace analyst, Richard Aboulafia with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said the F-35's first overseas appearance marked the start of a more aggressive drive to lock in foreign orders at a time when the U.S. military has repeatedly delayed its own.""What they really need to do is transform the program's economics by getting above that 30-something (annual production) plateau they're on,"" he said. ""They need to get to a virtuous cycle where numbers go up and costs go down  ... the opposite of a death spiral."" Pentagon officials say they expect the plane's costs to fall to the mid-$80 million range by 2018 or 2019 from around $112 million now, and are working closely with the industry to drive the price down further.But the Pentagon warned on Tuesday it would have to postpone orders for 17 more F-35s from fiscal 2016-2019 unless Congress reverses mandatory spending cuts due to resume in 2016.Lockheed is developing three models of the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight international partners: Britain, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Turkey and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also placed orders, and South Korea has said it plans to order F-35s later this year. Current plans call for several F-35s to participate in the air shows, including at least one of the three F-35 B-model jets already built for Britain, with a UK pilot at the controls.U.S. and UK officials agreed on the need to bring over a number of aircraft to avoid any technical flight disruptions.In 2011, Airbus' delayed and over-budget A400 military transport plane was forced to curtail its debut appearance at the Paris Air Show after the plane suffered a gearbox problem in one of its powerful turbo-prop engines.U.S. defense officials said the overseas flights would be used for additional training and would help the F-35 program office learn how the plane's logistics, maintenance, aerial refueling, and security systems work overseas.Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, builds the single engine that powers the plane.

17,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON An unmanned U.S. Navy helicopter built by Northrop Grumman Corp and a precision ship-landing system built by Raytheon Co face mandatory reviews that could lead to their cancellation after quantity reductions drove unit costs sharply higher in 2013, the Pentagon announced on Thursday.Senior defense officials said the cost increases were largely due to cuts in the numbers of items to be purchased, but federal law required a careful look at program performance and other factors.The Nunn-McCurdy law requires a mandatory, 60-day live-or-die review if weapons systems see an increase of more than 25 percent in their unit costs. In order for programs to survive, top defense officials must certify that the program is needed for national security and meets other conditions.In this case, senior defense officials suggested that both programs would likely survive since the cost spikes were due to reduced orders, but they said final decisions would not be made until the reviews were completed on June 17.The Defense Department's annual ""selected acquisition report"" on the cost of major weapons showed a slight 0.3 percent, or $4.4 billion, drop in the combined cost of 77 programs for a total cost of $1.62 trillion.The reduction was largely due to reduced quantities, changes in inflation rates, and reduced needs for support equipment, although they were partially offset by schedule delays and cost increases in other programs, including Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet, the report showed.Senior defense officials said budget-driven reductions in arms programs had less effect on the program costs in 2013 than expected, although unit costs were likely to edge higher in coming years as mandatory spending reductions took effect. ""I just don't think we're out of the woods yet,"" said one official who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""There will be effects on programs as budgets hold or come down further.""The Navy is buying 49 fewer Northrop Fire Scout helicopters after switching to a larger aircraft built by Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc, that can carry more than twice the fuel or cargo and can stay in the air for 12 hours. That compares to nearly five hours for the previous aircraft, which is no longer being produced.Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush said the program was going very well and the unit cost increase was due to the reduction in quantity. He said the Navy remained committed to the program and he expected it to survive the review now under way. The cut in quantities of Raytheon's Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) came after the Army and Air Force decided to pull out of the joint program, which resulted in the need for 10 fewer shore-based training systems, the report said.The cost increase in the JPALS program also was partly due to an extension in the development program aimed at increasing the capability of the system, and higher material costs.Two other programs showed cost increases of more than 15 percent, requiring notification to Congress, but not triggering the more arduous cancellation reviews, the report showed.Boeing Co's upgrade of the U.S. E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) saw a 19 percent jump in average unit procurement costs, mainly due to a reduction of seven airplanes, but also due to schedule changes, the report said. The cost of General Dynamics Corp's Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) to build handheld and other smaller radios, rose 19 percent due to a revised acquisition strategy, it said.Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet saw a $7.4 billion increase in acquisition costs to $398.6 billion, largely due to postponed orders from the U.S. military and international partners. The report showed a decrease of nearly 9 percent, or $97 billion, in the estimated cost of operating the F-35 aircraft through 2065.The Pentagon report estimated the total ""lifecycle"" cost of the U.S. F-35 fleet at $1.02 trillion, down from $1.11 trillion a year earlier, but the F-35 program office said improving reliability and other adjustments meant the number would be closer to $917 billion.Other changes included a $2.2 billion, or 4.2 percent, drop in the cost of Boeing's KC-46A refueling plane, and a 9.5 percent rise in Boeing's program to remanufacture AH-64 Apache helicopters, due to higher labor and material costs.The projected cost of the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship program dropped over 33 percent, or $11.3 billion, due to the Pentagon's decision to halt orders after 32 ships instead of buying all 52 that had been planned.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Eric Beech and Bill Trott)",2014-04-17,NOC,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 7:29pm EDT",Two U.S. arms programs face live-or-die reviews after costs jump,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-military-arms-idUSBREA3G2II20140417?type=companyNews

20,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, April 17  WASHINGTON, April 17 U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp on Thursday urged U.S. lawmakers to enact cybersecurity legislation that would limit the liability of U.S. companies and enable them to take more decisive action to protect their computer networks.""We need to move to a place as a country where the legal framework matches the technology framework, or even gets within a decade of the technology framework,"" Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush told Reuters after a speech to the Economic Club.""It has lagged so terribly today that it causes companies to be extraordinarily risk averse to doing some of the things that they really need to do to better protect the infrastructure,"" said Bush.He said it was critical to enact legislation that would allow better information sharing between industry and government on threats to computer networks. Northrop, which provides cybersecurity equipment and services to the U.S. Defense Department and other national security agencies, is participating in industry-wide efforts to improve cybersecurity and information-sharing, Bush said.U.S. lawmakers have been contemplating legislation to provide clarity about how private companies should be required to disclose security breaches and cyber threats, but disagreements over liability and other issues have thwarted passage of any cyber security bills thus far. High-profile data breaches at companies like Target Corp  and recent revelations of the ""Heartbleed"" Internet security flaw have fed debate over who should pay to improve cybersecurity and how much information should be disclosed.There are also widespread concerns about possible attacks on industrial control systems that run U.S. nuclear power plants and other critical infrastructure. Fred Schwien, Boeing Co's director of homeland security programs and strategy, this week said an existing program for sharing intelligence about cyber threats to the aviation industry is being expanded into a full-fledged Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) later this year.Schwien told a cyber conference hosted by Kaspersky in San Francisco that the new body would be modeled on a successful center focused on financial services, and would be managed by  the Department of Homeland Security.Schwien said a secure facility was being erected near National Security Agency headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, that will bring ""an unprecedented level of information sharing"" to the industry.Aviation companies already get classified briefings from the FBI, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Transportation Security Administration.

21,"  (Adds comments from Northrop, General Dynamics CEOs, updates shares)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, April 23 U.S. arms makers complain regularly that lower Pentagon spending on ships, jets and other hardware will hit their earnings, but a string of better-than-expected results this week show that layoffs and cost-cutting have kept profits flowing, and growing.Defense majors Lockheed Martin Corp, General Dynamics Corp, and Northrop Grumman Corp have all reported higher profits this week and raised their full-year forecasts. In response, the Dow Jones index that tracks the 10 biggest aerospace and defense companies rose 2.2 percent on Wednesday.Weapons makers turned to workforce cuts and other efficiency efforts as early as 2007 to shore up their profits, and have also concentrated on stock buybacks and strong dividends, said defense consultant Loren Thompson.""The gradual decline in military spending has given the companies fewer opportunities to invest in new programs, so they  are returning their cash flow to shareholders,"" said Thompson, who runs the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.He said the crisis in Ukraine and other emerging threats could strengthen demand for military equipment in the United States and overseas, and help stave off an expected decline in defense shares as spending cuts further erode revenues. Company executives say the budget environment remains tough,  since mandatory federal cuts are due to resume in 2016. Still, work on big-ticket items like ships, planes and satellites would shore up revenues since those orders are either already on the books or part of multi-year agreements being negotiated now.Lockheed shares were up 3.3 percent at $161.94 after Australia announced plans to buy 58 more of the company's F-35 fighter jets in coming years.Lockheed, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, had on Tuesday reported a 23 percent jump in first-quarter net profit and raised its 2014 earnings-per-share outlook by 2.5 percent. Lockheed, General Dynamics and Northrop all reported higher operating margins in the latest quarter, and said they would continue efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiency.Northrop, which makes unmanned planes, the B-2 bomber and electronic equipment, on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook by about 2 percent, to a range of $8.90 to $9.15 per share.  Northrop shares rose 1.8 percent to $121.96.CEO Wes Bush attributed the rise in Northrop's EPS in part to share repurchases; the company had about 9 percent fewer shares outstanding during the latest quarter.""While the U.S. budget environment continues to be challenging, particularly for our short-cycle businesses, we have a good long-term set of opportunities that includes ... potential for continued growth in international sales,"" Bush told analysts on an earnings call. He said the sale of Global Hawk unmanned planes now being negotiated with South Korea could lead to additional foreign sales of unmanned systems for the company.General Dynamics, which makes Gulfstream business jets, tanks and U.S. warships, raised its guidance for 2014 earnings per share by nearly 4 percent after posting higher-than-expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter. Its shares were up 3.6 percent at $111.90 in late trading.Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic told analysts that U.S. weapons spending had ""troughed,"" or hit a low point, and that a big rise in backlog showed the company is well-positioned. She said the firm planned to return ""most, if not all"" of its free cash flow to investors via stock repurchases or dividends.Novakovic described ""blocking and tackling"" to lower costs. ""I don't think you can ever get away from the absolute requirement to improve your operating performance quarter over quarter,"" she said. ""You are never done.""General Dynamics' combat systems division, which posted a quarterly operating loss, would show improved sales, earnings and margins over the course of the year, Novakovic said.The marine division also has ""considerable upside"" given that it expects to get a multi-year contract for more Virginia-class attack submarines from the U.S. Navy, and is working on a new submarine to replace the current Ohio-class submarines that carry nuclear weapons, she said.

Now it is in place to be implemented,"" Martin said.Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, said the agreement would allow the companies to recoup their investment and a small profit, but only after the plane's cost came down.He said the U.S. government could invest additional money from 2016 to 2018 if the initial cost reductions proved to be successful. Martin said the savings would cut the cost of each F-35 fighter jet by about $10 million to under $80 million, including an engine, by 2019.That is down from the $98 million cost of an Air Force F-35 A-model jet, without an engine, that was included in Lockheed's contract to build a seventh batch of jets for the U.S. military.Bogdan said the agreement meant the Pentagon and other countries would soon be able to buy a ""fifth generation"" fighter  with its unprecedented capability for a price that would nearly equal any ""fourth generation"" fighters on the market, but with far more advanced capability. He said the Pentagon was continuing to negotiate contracts with Lockheed and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, despite an engine fire last month that triggered a fleetwide grounding of the F-35.He said the department was ""in the end game"" on both contracts, but still had some additional work to do.Lockheed and Pratt executives said they expected to finalize the separate agreements soon. Pratt & Whitney had already invested $65 million to lower the cost of the F135 engine it builds for the plane under its ""war on cost"" since 2009, and planned further investments of $15 million over the next three years, said spokesman Matthew Bates.Bogdan said the Pentagon and the companies that build the jet were also looking at possible block buys of F-35s grouping U.S. and foreign orders, to achieve greater economies of scale and further lower the cost.Efforts were also underway to lower the operating and maintenance costs of the jets by 30 percent, Bogdan said.Martin said the engine failure was unfortunate but Lockheed and the other contractors would do whatever was needed to correct the issue and get back on schedule with the program.

34,"   By David Alexander | EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla., July 10  EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla., July 10 U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told military fliers on Thursday the stealthy F-35 attack plane had ""issues"" but was still ""the future for our fighter aircraft"" despite a fire that grounded the fleet and jeopardized its international debut in Britain.In a visit to the Florida base where the blaze occurred in late June, Hagel spoke with F-35 pilots and maintenance workers about the Lockheed Martin aircraft but was not able to say whether the planes would be cleared to resume flight in time to participate in air shows in Britain.Key F-35 contractors are Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc.Hagel, speaking in front of a pair of the F-35s, said the pilots and maintainers voiced ""tremendous confidence"" in the so-called fifth-generation aircraft, which has stealthy radar-evading technology and a suite of integrated sensors that digest and feed information to the pilot through a special helmet. ""Some of the pilots told me it was the best aircraft that they had ever flown and some said it was the easiest and simplest aircraft they'd ever flown,"" Hagel said.""I was particularly happy to hear that because I believe this aircraft is the future for our fighter aircraft for our services,"" he said. ""This is as big a project, the F-35, as we have at the Department of Defense and we've got a lot riding on this aircraft."" Hagel said he knew ""there are issues"" with the plane but he had ""strong, strong confidence in the people who make this aircraft fly (and) maintain it.""The F-35 is the world's largest arms program and is currently projected to cost about $398.6 billion. The plane, which will ultimately replace most of the U.S. military's fighters, has been sharply criticized over its huge cost growth. The plane had been scheduled to make its international debut at two air shows in Britain beginning this week - the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough International Airshow.But the military last week grounded the entire fleet of 97 aircraft in the aftermath of a fire at Eglin in late June in which a Pratt & Whitney engine on an Air Force variant of the plane broke apart and caught fire during takeoff. Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Corp.Eglin is one of the main bases where F-35 pilots and maintainers are being trained. Officials said there were 49 F-35s at the base, including all three variants of the plane.Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman and BAE on Thursday said they would invest up to $170 million over the next two years to cut the cost of each of the new warplanes to under $80  million each by 2019.

35,"  (Adds details on lessons learned)By Andrea ShalalFARNBOROUGH, England, July 14 The U.S. and UK militaries are ""not giving up"" on bringing the Lockheed Martin  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to Britain for a high-profile air show this week after an engine fire prompted a fleetwide grounding and derailed the plane's international debut, a top U.S. official said Monday.""We're not giving up yet. We still have a few more days left to try to get the airplane over here,"" Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program chief, told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow.U.S. Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall said the United States and other countries involved in the $400 billion multinational F-35 Joint Strike Fighter remained committed to the program despite the June 23 failure of the Pratt & Whitney  F135 engine on a U.S. Air Force jet that has grounded the entire F-35 fleet.Kendall said he hoped the grounding order could be lifted in time to bring jets to the Farnborough air show that began Monday and runs through Sunday, but said no decision had been made.Sources familiar with the situation said a key meeting had been set for later Monday to discuss the jet's flight status. Kendall said there was growing evidence that the failure of the engine - triggered by excessive rubbing in the third stage of Pratt's F135 engine - was not a systemic design flaw affecting the whole fleet. But he said officials were still trying to understand why the engine broke up.The United States' newest combat jet missed the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world's biggest military air show, last week where it was to make its international debut, and it remains unclear if it will still appear at the Farnborough show.Industry executives thronged around a static display model of the F-35 at the air show on Monday to take turns sitting inside the jet, while a large electronic billboard displayed the three different models of the aircraft in flight. Kendall and Bogdan were joined at a news conference at the show by top executives from the biggest contractors on the program - Lockheed, Pratt, Northrop Grumman Corp , and Britain's BAE Systems, as well as the acquisition chiefs of the U.S. Air Force and Navy.Kendall said no similar problems had been found on any of the other 98 engines in service, and underscored that the program was still in the development stage when technical problems are meant to be found and fixed.""It's unfortunate timing,"" he told the news conference, ""but it's not a major setback."" U.S. officials said they expected to adopt a more streamlined process for the different military services and countries to report mishaps and accidents after early delays in sharing information about the June 23 incident.Because the damaged jet belonged to the Air Force's education and training command, it took charge of the aircraft, quarantining it and going through its rigorous investigative process. But that left the other military services, Britain and the F-35 program office, in the dark, at least for a few days.Bogdan said it took about a week before engineers were able to take the airplane and the engine apart for more detailed examinations of what went wrong.Kendall acknowledged the delays in communication in this case, and said the Pentagon was learning from the experience. ""We'll make sure we do a better job of that going forward.""Kendall said he was satisfied that Pratt and the other parties involved were providing information for investigators as they worked to understand and resolve the incident.He said the F-35 program office was also working hard to keep the partners who helped fund the plane's development - Britain, Australia, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and Denmark - and Japan and Israel, which have ordered jets, up to date on the current situation.

General Dynamics, maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, said on Wednesday it expected to repurchase shares in the second half of 2014. The company has spent about $2.7 billion on share buybacks so far this year.""Such results will continue to build (General Dynamics') investors' confidence in the CEO's focus on profitability and cash deployment,"" RBC Capital Markets' Robert Stallard wrote in a note.The company raised its forecast for full-year earnings to $7.40-$7.45 per share from $7.05-$7.10.General Dynamics said its total potential contract value, the sum of all backlog, rose 29 percent to $99.5 billion in the second quarter ended June 29 - its highest in the past four years. ""Overall defense spending is still sluggish given U.S. budget concerns, but General Dynamics' defense units are looking like they'll do better this year than was initially expected,"" Christian Mayes, an analyst at Edward Jones Equity Research, told Reuters.General Dynamics reported an increase in orders in its marine systems division - which sells to the U.S Navy - suggesting that the government spending on defense may be stabilizing.However, smaller rival Northrop was not as optimistic.""While we are encouraged by the tone of fiscal year 2015 budget negotiations, we remain cautious regarding the longer term,"" Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush said on a conference call with analysts. The company, which makes unmanned aircraft, the B-2 bomber and electronic equipment, raised its 2014 earnings forecast to $9.15-$9.35 per share from $8.90-$9.15.Northrop said its profit was boosted by a lower pension liability - the result of higher interest rates that changed the discount rate used to calculate the company's pension liabilities.Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon's largest defense supplier, also reported a better-than-expected 3.5 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday and said it planned to resume share repurchases in the current quarter.General Dynamics' operating costs and expenses fell 5 percent to $6.53 billion, while Northrop's costs fell 6 percent in the second quarter.Falls Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics' net income fell 15.5 percent to $541 million. Excluding a charge of $105 million, income from continuing operations rose 1 percent to $646 million, or $1.88 per share.Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.77 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's shares were up about 1.3 percent at $120.07 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

41,"   By Sarah Young | LONDON  LONDON U.S. defense company Northrop Grumman Corp is in talks about selling its high-altitude surveillance drones in Europe, with Britain, Germany and Norway seen as the likeliest customers, a top executive said on Wednesday.Northrop developed the original Global Hawk unmanned aircraft for the U.S. Air Force and it has been used extensively over Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. The company has subsequently sought to sell versions of the Hawk to other countries.""At the moment I would say that the hottest three (potential European buyers) are Germany, UK and Norway, in the sense that we've got active dialogue going on with those countries,"" Northrop's UK and European chief executive Andrew Tyler told reporters on Wednesday.The aircraft, which is not armed, is designed to travel at 60,000 feet, high above the airspace used by commercial planes, and can fly non-stop for about 32 hours, gathering images and related information about conflict zones or natural disasters. A $1.7 billion contract the company signed with NATO for a five-drone surveillance and intelligence system in 2012 will help boost European sales, believes Tyler, as potential new customers will get a taste of the aircraft's capabilities.Germany is already familiar with it. Northrop remains in long-running talks with the country about a stalled 1.2 billion euro ($1.6 billion) purchase of four Euro Hawks, which Northrop developed with Europe's Airbus based on the Global Hawk design.""Our discussions with them (the Germans) continue ... we definitely remain hopeful,"" Tyler said.  Northrop also threw its hat into the ring as a contender to help fulfill Britain's need for new maritime patrol capability by providing the country with its un-manned aircraft. Since scrapping its former program - the delayed and over-budget BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 - as part of its defense review in 2010, experts say Britain has struggled, for example, to carry out aerial hunts for submarines and they expect the country to fire the starting gun on a maritime patrol aircraft competition in the coming years.

The company has subsequently sought to sell versions of the Hawk to other countries.""At the moment I would say that the hottest three (potential European buyers) are Germany, UK and Norway, in the sense that we've got active dialogue going on with those countries,"" Northrop's UK and European chief executive Andrew Tyler told reporters on Wednesday.The aircraft, which is not armed, is designed to travel at 60,000 feet, high above the airspace used by commercial planes, and can fly non-stop for about 32 hours, gathering images and related information about conflict zones or natural disasters. A $1.7 billion contract the company signed with NATO for a five-drone surveillance and intelligence system in 2012 will help boost European sales, believes Tyler, as potential new customers will get a taste of the aircraft's capabilities.Germany is already familiar with it. Northrop remains in long-running talks with the country about a stalled 1.2 billion euro ($1.6 billion) purchase of four Euro Hawks, which Northrop developed with Europe's Airbus based on the Global Hawk design. ""Our discussions with them (the Germans) continue ... we definitely remain hopeful,"" Tyler said.Northrop also threw its hat into the ring as a contender to help fulfil Britain's need for new maritime patrol capability by providing the country with its un-manned aircraft. Since scrapping its former programme - the delayed and over-budget BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 - as part of its defence review in 2010, experts say Britain has struggled, for example, to carry out aerial hunts for submarines and they expect the country to fire the starting gun on a maritime patrol aircraft competition in the coming years.Tyler said that the Triton maritime aircraft, also a part of the Global Hawk family, could work alongside an order for manned aircraft to patrol British seas, adding that due to the drone's lower fuel costs, a mixed fleet would be cheaper than going for a manned-only solution.Australia earlier this year opted to protect its maritime interests that way, supplementing its purchase of eight Boeing  P-8A Poseidon planes with a number of MQ-4C Tritons.

43,"  NEWPORT, Rhode Island, Sept 3 Russia and China are trying to close the technology gap with the U.S. military and developing weapons systems that appear designed to counter traditional U.S. advantages, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Wednesday.Hagel was speaking before a NATO summit expected to bring Russia's souring relations with the West into sharp focus and  the goals of NATO allies to strengthen defense spending.Hagel said the Pentagon was renewing a push to revamp how it works with the defense industry. The goal, he said, was to promote greater innovation needed to preserve America's technological edge, even at a time of tighter budgets.""While the United States currently has a decisive military and technological edge over any potential adversary, our future superiority is not a given,"" Hagel told a defense industry forum in Rhode Island.U.S. defense officials have watched as Moscow and Beijing have tested a string of sophisticated weapons, from radar-evading aircraft and anti-ship missiles that fly many times the speed of sound, to integrated air defenses. While the Defense Department's spending of around $500 billion is still more than the next six or seven countries combined, research and development spending has fallen more than 20 percent since President Barack Obama took office.In contrast, China and Russia have been rapidly increasing their security spending and have passed new technological milestones in recent years. ""China and Russia have been trying to close the technology gap by pursuing and funding long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs,"" Hagel said.""They are also developing anti-ship, anti-air, counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare and special operations capabilities that appear designed to counter traditional U.S. military advantages."" Leading U.S. weapons manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp , have urged the Pentagon to continue investing in research and development of new weapons and technologies despite less military spending.Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, said he had been asked to lead an initiative that would take a longer-term look at research and development spending.""When you cut R&D you are delaying modernization.

44,"  (Adds details)By Andrea ShalalNAVAL AIR STATION PATUXENT RIVER, Maryland, Sept 23 I mproved reliability of Northrop Grumman Corp's  unmanned MQ-4C Triton spy plane means the U.S. Navy may buy fewer of the drones than the 68 it now has on order, a senior navy official said on Tuesday, a move which may result in lower revenues for the planemaker.The Navy's goal is to have 20 of the huge drones available at any given time to use for five continuous ""orbits"" of maritime surveillance. It takes four planes to make up one orbit.Rising reliability rates mean the Navy may not need as many of the high-altitude aircraft as first thought, said Captain Jim Hoke, who runs the Triton program for the Navy.Northrop had no immediate comment on the matter. Hoke said he was mindful of tough budget pressures facing the Navy and also had a team looking for other ways to reduce the cost of building and operating the Triton unmanned system.The overall development program is slated to cost about $3 billion, Hoke said. The plane's design was based on the unmanned Global Hawk plane that Northrop builds for the Air Force, but the two planes have only about 20-30 percent in common, Hoke said.The Navy aims to start early operational use of two Triton aircraft by the end of 2017, with the formal ""initial operational capability"" to follow about six months later when two additional aircraft are delivered. The date slipped due to budget cuts that slowed Northrop's production, Hoke said. Each aircraft now costs about $100 million, but Hoke said the Navy hoped to drive the cost down by finding more efficient ways to build the planes in coming years.Hoke said all new weapons programs were vulnerable during lean budget times, but demand for maritime surveillance remained strong. He said the BAMS-D demonstration aircraft that preceded Triton has been used in the Middle East for six years.The Navy expects to award Northrop a small contract to buy certain components for the first low-production aircraft once the fiscal 2015 budget is approved, Hoke said. He said the number of aircraft in that first batch of orders would be determined as part of the fiscal 2016 budget deliberations. The first of three Triton planes arrived at the base in southern Maryland on Thursday after completing its longest flight ever, a 3,000-mile, 11-hour journey from California.Hoke said two more aircraft would arrive at the base in coming weeks. The planes are due to conduct about 2,000 hours of flight testing before it enters service in 2017. The second plane will have its first flight in California this week, Hoke said.Hoke said he hoped to resume work on an Exelis Inc  system that will allow the airplane to ""sense and avoid"" other aircraft before the end of the year, when he is due to retire.The Navy halted work on the system last year after running into technical issues, and has been working closely with prime contractor Northrop to find a way to fix the problem.Northrop's deputy Triton program manager Tim Kesecker said the company had pulled in experts from other divisions, and he was upbeat that agreement would be reached soon.

46,"  WASHINGTON Oct 1 The U.S. Air Force is close to announcing the winner of a three-way competition between Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co and Northrop Grumman Corp to build the next generation of long-range radars, senior military officials said.""We're close. We're working our way through the approval process,"" Air Force Lieutenant General Ellen Pawlikowski, the service's top military acquisition official, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.One source familiar with the process said Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, had approved the Air Force's acquisition plan for the new radar late Tuesday, and a contract announcement was likely early next week.The announcement will mark the next phase of a program that initially began in 2009, with the Air Force funding work on full-scale prototypes by all three companies. The initial contract will fund continued development and low-rate production of a few radar systems, followed by orders for nearly 30 more. Industry executives also see potential opportunities for selling the system to U.S. allies.Kendall had told Reuters in an interview earlier Tuesday that he was ""not quite finished"" looking at the Air Force's business plan for the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar program, or 3DELLR, but an announcement could come soon. The new system will replace the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. It will serve as the Air Force' primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. In its request for proposals, the Air Force said it expected the new system to be more accurate, reliable and give air controllers a precise view of aircraft and missiles.Pawlikowski said the Air Force had applied some of the lessons it learned on other large-scale acquisition programs in structuring the next-generation radar program, including efforts to strictly rein in military requirements and funding work on prototypes before choosing a design.Executives at the three companies have been expecting a contract announcement for several weeks.

47,"  BERLIN Oct 4 German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen wants to revive the high-altitude reconnaissance drone Euro Hawk after the government backed away from plans to buy some last year, a German newspaper said on Saturday.Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS) said it had learnt from the defence ministry that it wanted ""to get the Euro Hawk drone out of the garage"" to be able to test a reconnaissance system for it.In an advance copy of a report due to be published on Sunday, the newspaper said that was the result of a defence assessment due to be handed to the ministry on Monday.A spokeswoman for the defence ministry told Reuters she could not comment on such reports but added that the ministry would on Monday receive the assessment it had commissioned and then evaluate it. Germany backed away last year from its 1.2 billion euro plan to buy four more Euro Hawk drones, which  U.S. defence company Northrop Grumman Corp developed with Europe's Airbus based on the Global Hawk design.Back then Germany said meeting the standards required to win aviation approval would cost 500 million to 600 million euros. But Northrop remains in long-running talks with the country about the stalled purchase. FAS said the German armed forces had in recent months tested whether the reconnaissance system could be used on other platforms but had found that they could not be. It said if tests with the Euro Hawk prototypes proved successful, a carrier would need to be purchased and a new version of the Global Hawk was probably the only system that would be considered. The Euro Hawk is based on the Global Hawk.German news magazine Spiegel also said the Euro Hawk was under discussion again after consulting firm KPMG recommended in a report due to be presented this week remedying gaps in reconnaissance technology equipment in the armed forces with an 'unmanned' aircraft as a carrier.The magazine cited experts as saying the only possible solution for this in the foreseeable future was the 'Triton' drone which is developed by Northrop and is the successor to the  Global Hawk.

Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush said the company was raising its earnings forecast for the full year to a range of$9.40 to $9.50, up from an earlier outlook of $9.15 to $9.35.Northrop said it now expected revenue of $23.8 billion for the full year, the upper end of its previous range, and forecast segment operating margin in the high 12 percent range, up from an earlier outlook in the low 12 percent range. The company said a change in U.S. legislation on pension accounting standards had reduced its third-quarter earnings by $62 million, or 30 cents per share.

59,"  (Adds analyst comment and details on results, outlook)Oct 22 U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp  on Wednesday reported a higher-than-expected profit for the third quarter and raised its earnings outlook for the full year.Northrop, which makes unmanned planes and electronic equipment, posted a 5 percent drop in net earnings to $473 million, or $2.26 per share, from $497 million, or $2.14 a share, a year earlier, with the number of outstanding shares down 10 percent.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings per share of $2.14 for the latest quarter. Revenue fell 2 percent to $5.98 billion from $6.1 billion, while analysts had expected $5.89 billion.Segment operating margin rose to 14 percent from 12.5 percent. Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush said the company was raising its earnings forecast for the full year to a range of$9.40 to $9.50, up from an earlier outlook of $9.15 to $9.35.Northrop said it now expected revenue of $23.8 billion for the full year, the upper end of its previous range, and forecast segment operating margin in the high 12 percent range, up from an earlier outlook in the low 12 percent range. The company said a change in U.S. legislation on pension accounting standards had reduced its third-quarter earnings by $62 million, or 30 cents per share. That drop was partially offset by settlements of some legal claims, which boosted net earnings by $49 million, or 23 cents per share.Revenue was down in three of the company's four divisions, and a 2 percent increase in sales by the aerospace systems sector was due mainly to legal settlements, the company said.""There are a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, including the three-quarter pension catch-up ... and favorable legal settlements,"" said JPMorgan analyst Joe Nadol, ""but stripping all of that away, operating performance was slightly above our expectations.""

61,"  (Adds Raytheon statement)WASHINGTON Oct 21 Northrop Grumman Corp  on Tuesday said it had filed a formal protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office against the U.S. Air Force's decision to pick Raytheon Co  to develop a next-generation, long-range radar system.Raytheon beat out Northrop and Lockheed Martin Corp  to develop a replacement for the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s.The value of the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) contract is limited now, but could rise sharply in coming years, given the Air Force's plan to buy 30 of the new systems in coming years, plus orders from foreign militaries.Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said only that the company had protested the Air Force decision, but declined to provide further comment about the challenge. Air Force officials said they briefed the losing bidders about their decision last week.Spokeswoman Patty Welsh from Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts said the Air Force issued a stop-work order for the program after the protest was filed on Tuesday. Raytheon said it would work closely with the Air Force to mitigate any resulting delays once the issue was resolved.""The Air Force ran a very tough but very fair competition, and selected the world leader in radar to build 3DELRR,"" said Raytheon spokesman Mike Doble. ""We remain confident in our solution and we're eager to move forward and deliver this much needed 3DELRR capability to the U.S. and its friends and allies."" Lockheed officials said they were still reviewing the briefing they received from the Air Force about the contract award to Raytheon.Industry officials and analysts say the stakes are particularly high for Northrop Grumman, which lacks the large aircraft and ship programs that undergird Lockheed's more diverse portfolio.Northrop Grumman has lost out to Raytheon on several major radar contracts recently, including the Navy's next-generation jammer and a new air and missile defense radar, although it still makes critical radars for the F-22 in the tactical market.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli, Bernard Orr and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-10-22,NOC,"Tue Oct 21, 2014 | 8:06pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Northrop protests U.S. Air Force radar award to Raytheon,http://www.reuters.com//article/northrop-grumman-protests-idUSL2N0SG23A20141022?type=companyNews

Danielides sued under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers to sue on the government's behalf and share in recoveries.Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said the Falls Church, Virginia-based company does not discuss litigation.The Counter-MANPADS project overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was designed to protect civilian airliners from shoulder-fired missiles after a failed attack in 2002 against an Israeli aircraft taking off from Mombasa, Kenya. According to the complaint, Northrop's performance in the project's first two phases was a key factor in its winning the third phase, where it was expected to use its ""best efforts"" to test the defense system and fix problems.However, according to Danielides, who said he worked on the project for ""many years,"" despite being paid more than $62 million in the third phase, Northrop did ""virtually nothing"" to improve the design and reliability of the system. In letting most of the case go forward, Shah said Danielides alleged Northrop and the government agreed on a ""specific, shared definition"" of what ""best efforts"" meant: completing a task, or spending money in a legitimate effort to complete it.To prevail, Danielides will need to show Northrop knew what ""best efforts"" meant, and as a result lied when seeking payments, Shah said.The judge dismissed one claim concerning a $3 million addition to the Counter-MANPADS project, known as Mod 8.

68,"   By Andrea Shalal and David Alexander | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Senator John McCain's voice just got a whole lot louder.One of President Barack Obama’s noisiest detractors, McCain is expected to take the helm of the powerful Armed Services Committee in the new Republican-controlled U.S. Senate when the U.S. Congress convenes in January. The Arizona senator, a critic of the $399 billion Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet program, is likely to push for tougher congressional scrutiny of costly U.S. weapons programs, defense analysts say.He has in the past launched investigations into waste in the U.S. defense industry and shaped legislation to end cost overruns on major arms programs as a senior member of the Senate committee.McCain, a former Navy pilot and Vietnam War prisoner who lost to Obama in the 2008 election, has also criticized the administration on everything from fighting Islamic State militants to arming moderate Syrian rebels, while seeking a tougher U.S. response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. As committee chairman he could summon Pentagon officials to public hearings to explain their strategy on Syria. He has challenged the U.S. Air Force to end a monopoly rocket launch program with Lockheed and Boeing Co, the Pentagon's top two suppliers, and is pushing for development of a new U.S. rocket engine to end reliance on Russian-built engines that power one of the firm's rockets.In his new position, McCain would oversee policy legislation that underpins the Pentagon's budget, although the House and Senate appropriations committees oversee the Pentagon's actual finances.He would play a major role in writing the annual defense authorization bill. It sets policies on everything from defense spending and new weapons to military base closures and the elimination of specific weapons programs. The committee does not control how much money the Pentagon gets, but because it sets policies, it can control how the money is spent. ""I wouldn't forecast any huge shifts right away,"" said one defense industry executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, noting that McCain had worked closely for years on acquisition reform and weapons oversight with Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who now heads the committee.The executive said companies and defense officials were bracing for more requests for information, briefings and hearings from a McCain-led panel.U.S. weapons makers are wary of what they see as McCain's propensity to exaggerate problems when they occur, and worry that he does not understand their need as publicly traded companies to generate profits for shareholders.But, McCain also offers them a ray of hope. He wants to ease automatic across-the-board cuts in military spending that are squeezing defense industry revenues.  McCain's office did not respond to requests for comment.""LIGHTNING ROD PROGRAMS"" If McCain becomes chairman, he is expected to focus oversight on weapons programs that failed to meet their targets for cost and delivery schedules, said Brett Lambert, a former senior Pentagon official and industry consultant. In recent hearings, McCain has singled out the Navy's $34 billion Littoral Combat Ship program. On April 9, he said poor planning had led to a new class of ships that could not survive in combat, cost far more than expected and provide less capability than earlier warships. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has defended the program.Congressional aides and industry executives said the F-35, the Pentagon's biggest arms program, had made progress after years of cost overruns and technical setbacks, but McCain has vowed to keep close tabs on it given its importance.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program, told reporters last week that McCain was ""very, very discerning and critical"" in his oversight of taxpayer dollars and acknowledged the program could face increased scrutiny.""I would imagine that I'm going to see Senator McCain more than I have been,"" he said, when asked how a Republican-controlled Senate might affect the program.McCain is also likely to scrutinize a new presidential helicopter program under way by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and the Navy's stalled plan to develop an unmanned carrier-based drone, a program that is expected to draw bids from Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp and privately held General Atomics, said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant.McCain's dogged questioning of a 2001 Air Force deal to lease, not buy, 100 Boeing 767 aircraft as refueling tankers triggered a federal investigation and uncovered serious ethics violations by senior Air Force and Boeing officials, two of whom served prison terms.

As committee chairman he could summon Pentagon officials to public hearings to explain their strategy on Syria.He has challenged the U.S. Air Force to end a monopoly rocket launch program with Lockheed and Boeing Co, the Pentagon's top two suppliers, and is pushing for development of a new U.S. rocket engine to end reliance on Russian-built engines that power one of the firm's rockets.In his new position, McCain would oversee policy legislation that underpins the Pentagon's budget, although the House and Senate appropriations committees oversee the Pentagon's actual finances. He would play a major role in writing the annual defense authorization bill. It sets policies on everything from defense spending and new weapons to military base closures and the elimination of specific weapons programs. The committee does not control how much money the Pentagon gets, but because it sets policies, it can control how the money is spent.""I wouldn't forecast any huge shifts right away,"" said one defense industry executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, noting that McCain had worked closely for years on acquisition reform and weapons oversight with Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who now heads the committee.The executive said companies and defense officials were bracing for more requests for information, briefings and hearings from a McCain-led panel.U.S. weapons makers are wary of what they see as McCain's propensity to exaggerate problems when they occur, and worry that he does not understand their need as publicly traded companies to generate profits for shareholders. But, McCain also offers them a ray of hope. He wants to ease automatic across-the-board cuts in military spending that are squeezing defense industry revenues.McCain's office did not respond to requests for comment.""LIGHTNING ROD PROGRAMS""  If McCain becomes chairman, he is expected to focus oversight on weapons programs that failed to meet their targets for cost and delivery schedules, said Brett Lambert, a former senior Pentagon official and industry consultant.In recent hearings, McCain has singled out the Navy's $34 billion Littoral Combat Ship program. On April 9, he said poor planning had led to a new class of ships that could not survive in combat, cost far more than expected and provide less capability than earlier warships. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has defended the program.Congressional aides and industry executives said the F-35, the Pentagon's biggest arms program, had made progress after years of cost overruns and technical setbacks, but McCain has vowed to keep close tabs on it given its importance.Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program, told reporters last week that McCain was ""very, very discerning and critical"" in his oversight of taxpayer dollars and acknowledged the program could face increased scrutiny.""I would imagine that I'm going to see Senator McCain more than I have been,"" he said, when asked how a Republican-controlled Senate might affect the program.McCain is also likely to scrutinize a new presidential helicopter program under way by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and the Navy's stalled plan to develop an unmanned carrier-based drone, a program that is expected to draw bids from Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp and privately held General Atomics, said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant.McCain's dogged questioning of a 2001 Air Force deal to lease, not buy, 100 Boeing 767 aircraft as refueling tankers triggered a federal investigation and uncovered serious ethics violations by senior Air Force and Boeing officials, two of whom served prison terms.

70,"  (Adds details throughout)WASHINGTON Nov 21 The Pentagon said on Friday it had awarded Lockheed Martin Corp a contract valued at $4.7 billion for an eighth batch of F-35 fighter jets that lowered the average price per jet by 3.5 percent from the last contract, and 57 percent from the first batch.The Pentagon's F-35 program office said the deal includes 29 jets for the United States and 14 for five other countries: Israel, Japan, Norway, Britain and Italy.Once production of those jets is completed, more than 200 F-35s will be in operation by eight countries, according to the office that runs the $399 billion F-35 program for the Pentagon.The Pentagon has signed a separate contract valued at $1.05 billion for an eighth batch of engines built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, to power the jets. Pratt last month said the contract would lower the cost of the engines between 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent. The program office said the new contract reduced the cost of the A-model airframe built for the Air Force, without the engine, to $94.8 million.The cost of the F-35 B-model, which can take off from shorter runways and lands like a helicopter, would be $102 million, without an engine, while the Navy's C-model or carrier variant would be $115.7 million, it said. The Pentagon does not provide detailed cost breakdowns for Pratt's F135 engine, given the company's concerns about proprietary data, but U.S. officials have said they expect the cost of the aircraft, with an engine, to drop to about $80 million to $85 million by 2019.Lockheed's F-35 program manager, Lorraine Martin, said the latest contract showed the company was making steady progress in reducing the cost of the most advanced U.S. warplane. Lockheed and its key subcontractors, Northrop Grumman Corp  and BAE Systems Plc, as well as Pratt, are all investing in various measures aimed at simplifying production of the jets and reducing the cost to build and operate them.But the biggest driver in cutting the cost of the planes is the number of jets ordered in any given year.Lockheed had hoped to finalize orders for two dozen more F-35 jets for Israel this year or early next, but Israel may halve that order to around 10 to 15 jets, a cabinet minister told Reuters earlier this week.

Navy spokeswoman Commander Thurraya Kent said the Navy continued to consider acquisition strategies and options for replacing the current COD aircraft by 2026, and its recommendations would be part of the normal budget process.Marine Corps and Navy officials have lauded the performance of the V-22 aircraft, which takes off and lands like a helicopter but can tilt its propellers to fly like a plane, with far greater range and speed than a conventional helicopter.

82,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 20 Northrop Grumman Corp , one of the biggest U.S. weapons makers, said on Tuesday it hired Brett Lambert, a former top U.S. defense official and expert on mergers and acquisitions, to oversee corporate strategy.Lambert's hiring, effective Jan. 26, reflects growing pressure on Northrop to boost revenues and could help the company the navigate a future merger, said defense consultant Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.Analysts say consolidation in the sector is long overdue.Lambert will spearhead Northrop Grumman's corporate and business strategies. At the Pentagon, he initiate a drive to better understand the defense industrial base and represented the Pentagon on the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates proposed acquisitions by foreign companies. Lambert has worked as a consultant since leaving the Pentagon in August 2013.""If Northrop wants to keep growing, it will need to change its strategy,"" Thompson said, adding that Lambert's expertise in domestic and international mergers could be important to Northrop's future. Among major U.S. weapons makers, Northrop is the least exposed to commercial markets and foreign sales, he said, and its three major divisions all face pressures.Thompson said high stock prices have delayed a widely expected consolidation in the U.S. defense sector, but trends on demand indicate the need for fewer top defense companies in coming years. Northrop has lost several key U.S. weapons contracts over the past year, including one worth up to $1 billion to build and design the next-generation air defense for the U.S. Air Force. It was awarded to Raytheon Co.The Government Accountability Office is due to issue a ruling by Jan. 29 on a protest filed by Northrop over the contract award, and a separate protest filed by the other losing bidder in the competition, Lockheed Martin Corp.Northrop suffered another setback last month, when the U.S. Navy decided to use the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft built by Boeing Co and Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter unit instead of upgrading Northrop's older C-2A turboprop aircraft.The company is still in a high-stakes competition against a joint Boeing-Lockheed team for a huge contract to design and build the next bomber for the U.S. Air Force.

89,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Even in an era of shrinking U.S. military spending, the U.S. Defense Department remains reluctant to see further consolidation among big U.S. weapons makers, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) Chief Executive Wes Bush said on Wednesday.""I haven't seen any evidence that the department is thinking about things differently, but it will always come down to the case-by-case view of competition versus the benefit that the department would get from it,"" Bush told Reuters after a speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.Pentagon officials, who would have a role in reviewing any large defense mergers, have repeatedly said they are comfortable with the current number of large prime contractors, although they expect mergers and acquisitions among smaller players.Bush said Northrop remained focused on augmenting its capabilities in targeted areas. ""I'm excited about growing our company with what we have,"" he said. ""We get the biggest return on the things we do inside the company.""On Tuesday, Northrop, the third largest U.S. defense contractor, announced it had hired Brett Lambert, a former top U.S. defense official and expert on mergers and acquisitions, to oversee corporate strategy.  Analysts said Lambert's hiring reflected growing pressure on Northrop to boost revenues after several big contract losses, and could help the company the navigate a future merger.Bush declined to provide details about the company's plans. He said Lambert was a ""smart guy"" suited to help the company shape its strategy. In remarks at a Brookings conference on the U.S.-Australia alliance, Bush said he thought a slew of mergers triggered by the previous downturn in the defense sector in the late 1990s had made sense.During that time, Northrop acquired several companies including TRW, Litton Industries and Newport News Shipbuilding.. Bush said that consolidation had helped Northrop reduce costs and continue funding research and development efforts, even during the latest downturn.Northrop has since spun off several units, including the shipbuilder, now known as Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII.N).  Bush said half the company's 65,000 employees were scientists, engineers or technologists of some sort, and the scale of an organization that large offered many benefits.Lambert, who retired in August 2013 after four years as the Pentagon's point man on industrial base issues and foreign acquisitions, has long predicted an uptick in mergers and acquisitions in the defense sector, although uncertainty about budget levels and high share prices have slowed such deals.

The rules were amended in 1992 to include larger unmanned aerial vehicles.Northrop, which builds high-altitude Global Hawk drones, and other firms have long urged changes that would allow them to compete with Israel, the leading exporter, and other countries.  The U.S. government has been reluctant to tinker with the export controls for fear it may allow sensitive technology to fall into hostile hands, but industry and government officials say a revamped policy on exports may be released soon.Bush welcomed the U.S. government's support for sales of Northrop's Triton unmanned system to Australia, and recent interest in the Global Hawk system from Japan and South Korea. ""I do see a lot of progress,"" Bush said. ""We still have some work to do in front of us, but it's on the right vector.""Bush said most U.S. officials now realized it was better to work with allies on developing unmanned technologies than ring-fencing technologies that were available elsewhere.Speaking with Reuters after the event, Bush urged the government to develop a ""firm set of principles against which we can all operate,"" and said U.S. companies needed a broad understanding of how a new policy would be implemented. Bush said the U.S. government's interest in expanding ties with India could pave the way for drone exports to that country, but industry needed more than just isolated waivers.He said President Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary, Ashton Carter, had been a leader on the issue of drone exports during his previous tenure at the Pentagon.

97,"  WASHINGTON Feb 1 Northrop Grumman Corp, the third-largest U.S. weapons maker, played up its legacy of building advanced aircraft in its first ever Super Bowl advertisement, as it competes for a major new bomber contract.The maker of the B-2 bomber is competing with a team made up of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, the No. 2 and No. 1 Pentagon suppliers, respectively, to build a new bomber for the U.S. Air Force.Randy Belote, a spokesman for Northrop said the ad aired in just two markets: Washington and Dayton, Ohio, home to the Air Force's aviation contracting arm, which is gearing up to pick a winning bidder to build a new aircraft that is slated to cost half a billion dollars. He declined to say how much the ad cost.The ad, part of the company's ""national brand campaign,"" shows a series of the company's ""flying wings,"" including the YB-35 prototype from the 1940s, then the B-2 Spirit bomber developed in the 1980s and finally the X-47B unmanned system being developed for the Navy.

That represents a switch from its initial plan to offer an existing aircraft.The Air Force aims to launch a competition in 2017 to replace its aging fleet of T-38 planes. Analysts say it could eventually buy up to 600 of the new training planes.Northrop, anxious to score its first prime contract for a big military aircraft program in years, is also vying with a team of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp for a $50-billion plus contract to build a new long-range bomber. The company launched a national ad campaign last year to tout its work on some of the world's most advanced aircraft, and even bought air time during the Super Bowl.Northrop teamed up with Britain's BAE Systems Plc  in 2011, aiming to offer the Air Force BAE's proven Hawk plane and the associated training system, which is already in use in Britain and has been sold to Saudi Arabia, Oman and India.The companies switched to work on a ""clean sheet"" design about two years ago, betting that emerging manufacturing technologies would help meet evolving Air Force requirements. BAE and Northrop are still finalizing an agreement on using just the Hawk training system, not the aircraft, said Chris Addison, with BAE Systems Military Air & Information division.Other companies on the team include L-3 Communications Holdings and German robotics giant Kuka AG.Another key player is Scaled Composites, a Northrop unit that builds experimental aircraft like the X-47B, a drone that Northrop successfully tested on an aircraft carrier. General Electric will supply the engine for the prototype. The competition will be fierce: Boeing has teamed with Sweden's Saab AG to develop a new design, and Textron Inc will also offer a new airplane. Lockheed and a separate team made up of General Dynamics and Italy's Finmeccanica Spa plan bids based on existing planes.""Failure to win a new contract will force Northrop Grumman out of its historical role as prime contractor for military aircraft,"" said Loren Thompson with the Lexington Instiute.Marc Lindsley, director and head of Northrop's T-X ""capture team,"" gave no details about the new airplane, but said every company on the team was investing heavily in the project. It will include ground-based training equipment, advanced simulators and an open architecture to allow continual upgrades.He said a new design would allow the team to benefit from new technologies and advanced manufacturing techniques, which would help keep down the cost of the new planes.""We want to give the Air Force what they want,"" he said.

Pratt said it has cut the cost of the F135 engine by 55 percent since its first delivery.The U.S. government signs separate production agreements with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the plane, and Pratt, which builds the engine. The Pentagon plans to spend nearly $400 billion to develop and build 2,457 of the radar-evading warplanes over the next two decades. Croswell welcomed the start of a long-delayed increase in production of the F-35 in the fiscal 2016 budget, which funds 57 jets after 38 a year earlier, and said it would help Pratt, Lockheed and other key suppliers drive down the plane's cost.Pratt and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which makes the lift fan for the F-35 B-model, are finalizing plans for further reducing the engine's cost, Croswell said. He gave no details. Lockheed and the other key suppliers for the airframe - Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc  -launched a similar effort last summer, which maps out specific investments to reduce the cost to build and repair the planes.Croswell said Pratt had also developed plans to upgrade the F135 engine in two separate phases.If the Pentagon accepts and funds the plans, the first upgrades would begin in 2017 or 2018 and reduce the fuel burn of the engine by 5 to 7 percent, Croswell said. The next upgrades would begin around 2022, cutting fuel burn by a further 15 to 20 percent.The upgrades draw on research work funded by the Air Force and the Navy in recent years.

He gave no further details. Raytheon has 60 days to appeal the May 11 decision by a U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge, according to two sources familiar with the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly.A clerk with the court confirmed a decision had been made on May 11 but gave no details since the matter remains under seal.

121,"  (Corrects to show Northrop Grumman, not Boeing competing)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON May 22 The U.S. Defense Department on Friday announced plans to deploy a new long-range radar in central Alaska that would help the U.S. missile defense system better discern potential enemy missiles launched by Iran or North Korea and increase the capacity of interceptors in the ground in Alaska and California.Raytheon Co, Northrop Grumman Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp are competing to build the new radar, which is expected to cost just under $1 billion. The new radar would begin defensive operations in 2020, pending completion of required environmental and safety studies, the department said in a statement.It said the new long-range discrimination radar (LRDR) will help the multi-layered U.S. ballistic missile defense system better address potential countermeasures that could be launched by potential foe to confuse U.S. defensive systems. Missile Defense Agency Director James Syring and other senior Pentagon officials told Congress in March that the new radar was critically important to help defend against the increasing capabilities by North Korea and Iran to launch missiles at the United States.The radar would likely be placed at Clear Air Force Station, an Air Force Space Command radar station located in central Alaska, but the final decision would be made after completion of the environmental studies. Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said placing the new radar in central Alaska rather than in the Alaskan Aleutian islands would allow the system to keep an eye on threats from both North Korea and Iran.He said it would also considerably cost less to build the new radar in Alaska, which could free up funding for an additional radar in Hawaii.The Missile Defense Agency is moving ahead with the design and development of the long-planned new radar. It launched the competition in January and is expected to award a contract by Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal 2015 year.

122,"  (Adds background, details from the Pentagon)WASHINGTON, June 1 The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Japan of four E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft built by Northrop Grumman Corp, a deal valued at around $1.7 billion, the Pentagon announced on Monday.The deal includes the aircraft, four engines, radars and other equipment, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a notification to lawmakers. Congress now has 15 days to block the sale, but such action is rare since sales are carefully vetted with lawmakers before they are formally notified. Japan, which already operates an earlier model of the E-2 aircraft, has been interested in upgrading its fleet for several years. The move comes amid a big push by Japan to beef up its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment. The Pentagon said it was vital to the U.S. national interest to help Japan develop and maintain a strong and ready capability for self-defense. It said the sale would improve Japan's ability to defend its homeland and monitor air and naval activity in the Pacific region.

123,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, June 3  WASHINGTON, June 3 U.S. Navy officials this week voiced rare dissent with the Pentagon over a long-delayed competition for a new armed, carrier-based drone that could be worth billions of dollars to industry, and said the U.S. Defense Department's foot-dragging posed risks to the Navy's future aviation forces.Rear Admiral Mike Manazir, director of air warfare for the Navy's chief of naval operations, on Wednesday said the Navy's requirements for the new unmanned aircraft had been locked in for well over a year, but the Navy could not release the terms of the competition until the Pentagon completed its study.Manazir echoed growing frustration voiced by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus during a speech at a Washington think tank on Tuesday.Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp, maker of the X-47B unmanned, unarmed plane that has already been tested on U.S. carriers, Lockheed Martin Corp, and privately held General Atomics have already spent tens of millions of dollars to prepare to bid for the Navy's Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance Strike program. But the program - one of few new aircraft programs up for grabs for industry - has been on hold for nearly a year pending a Pentagon-wide review of intelligence and surveillance programs that has stretched on much longer than expected.Navy officials say they worry that further delays will put the U.S. military at a disadvantage versus potential enemies like China, which are rapidly developing their own drones. Manazir said the Navy also wanted to move ahead with the UCLASS program to help inform its requirements for a next-generation strike fighter.""We're going to fall behind on the benefits for having an unmanned attribute inside the air wing,"" he said. ""That's where I'm frustrated - when something's ready to go and ... it advances our warfighting capability why wouldn't you?"" Mabus told an event at the American Enterprise Institute think tank on Tuesday that the Pentagon should let the Navy proceed with the new aircraft, since it was intended to do more than just provide intelligence.Manazir said the Navy was studying the business case for using Northrop's X-47B to carry out more testing in the interim instead of retiring the experimental planes - a move backed by some lawmakers.Mabus said one key concern was how to keep working on that particular platform without giving its manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, ""a huge advantage"" in some future competition.

126,"   By Andrea Shalal, Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis | June 9  June 9 United Technologies Corp's board of directors is scheduled to meet later this week to review options for its $8 billion Sikorsky aircraft business after receiving offers for it, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.UTC is considering two potential tax-efficient transactions for Sikorsky: either a spin-off or a combination with peer Textron Inc, which submitted an offer for Sikorsky earlier this month, the people said.The merger between Textron and Sikorsky could be structured as a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT), a transaction that allows a parent company to sell its subsidiary while avoiding a hefty tax bill.Alternatively, UTC may decide to sell Sikorsky outright to another company. Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co  are among those that have expressed interest in a potential deal, according to the sources. UTC is carrying out extensive due diligence on the offers it received for Sikorsky and is unlikely to have made a decision by the time it meets with analysts at the Paris Air Show next week, some of the sources said.UTC is contemplating a tax-free spin-off of Sikorsky or an RMT with Textron because any takeover offers by suitors would need to surmount a steep $3 billion tax bill associated with an outright sale of Sikorsky. A tax-free spin-off of Sikorsky remains the most likely outcome given UTC's limited appetite to become an investor in Textron and the success that other defense companies, such as Northrop Grumman Corp and ITT Corp, have had with spinning off non-core units, one of the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. UTC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Textron declined to comment. Textron, the maker of Bell helicopters, Cessna aircraft and E-Z-GO golf cars, conducted a strategic review in 2012 which examined spinning off parts of its aerospace and defense conglomerate, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters at the time. It may have to sell some assets to make an RMT with Sikorsky work.Sikorsky last week said it would cut 1,400 jobs over the next 12 months and consolidate facilities due to a drop in production volumes and lower investment in offshore oil projects.United Technologies also shook up Sikorsky's management in April, naming Robert Leduc to succeed Mick Maurer as the company's president.Airbus Group SE is ""watching with interest"" to see whether UTC sells Sikorsky, the head of Airbus' U.S. division said earlier this week.

Lawmakers now have 30 days to block the possible sale, although such action is rare.South Korea is looking to upgrade 134 Lockheed-built F-16 fighter jets to include modular mission computers, scanned array radar, friend or foe identification systems, navigation systems and radar warning systems, among other items, the agency said. Seoul also has asked to purchase a number of precision weapons, including laser-guided bombs and bomb tail kits. It also is seeking training weapons, and U.S. government and contractor technical support. BAE Systems and South Korea remain locked in a legal battle over Seoul's decision to cancel its earlier contract with BAE.Seoul has sued BAE in South Korean court to collect $43 million involved in a bid guarantee on the program.BAE, in a lawsuit filed in the United States, has said it does not believe it owes Seoul any money for the canceled upgrade program. Company executives say the ""bid bond"" was never paid since the terms of the initial contract were changed to be a foreign military sale negotiated among the governments.

Revenue fell 2.4 percent to $5.89 billion.Analysts polled by Reuters I/B/E/S had expected earnings per share of $2.36 on $5.93 billion in revenue.The company said it expected full-year earnings per share of $9.55 to $9.70, up from an earlier forecast of $9.40 to $9.60. It left its target for full-year revenue unchanged at $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion, but said an anticipated change in tax methods was expected to improve the company's cash from operations while increasing unallocated corporate expenses and the effective tax rate in the second half.It said it now expected free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year, up from an earlier forecast of $1.7 billion to $2.0 billion.""We're very careful in looking at our expected cash flows and determining when and where we make those investments and maintaining a comfortable level of liquidity,"" a company executive said on a call with analysts.Northrop said it repurchased 6.8 million shares for $1.1 billion in the second quarter, and had now bought back 54.3 million shares toward its goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting.Up to Tuesday's close, Northrop's shares had risen 11 percent this year, outperforming the broader Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index, which had fallen 0.5 percent.

131,"   By Andrea Shalal | NATIONAL HARBOR, Md., Sept 14  NATIONAL HARBOR, Md., Sept 14 Upgrades for the Northrop Grumman Corp high-altitude, unmanned Global Hawk surveillance aircraft could cost as little as half the previous estimate of $4 billion, a senior U.S. Air Force official said Monday.Lieutenant General Robert Otto, deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, said two key upgrades were needed for the Global Hawks: a new electro-optical sensor and an optical camera with a wider field of view.Both items could be added to the Northrop drone for perhaps as little as half the earlier estimate of $4 billion, he said.The Air Force still hopes to retire its aging fleet of manned U-2 spy planes built by Lockheed Martin Corp  because it could not afford two high-altitude surveillance aircraft. The upgrades would be needed for the Global Hawks before the U-2 could be retired. ""We love the U-2 (but) we cannot afford both platforms,"" Otto told reporters at the annual Air Force Association conference, saying declining operating costs made the Global Hawks the preferred option.He said the earlier cost estimate for the upgrades also included some items that were not required, including a more robust sensor that would help the plane avoid hitting other aircraft. Lockheed, which is keen to continue operating the U-2 fleet, has proposed several upgrades and has started work on a smaller, next-generation aircraft that could be used with or without pilots.Congress rebuffed the service's earlier attempt to retire most of the Global Hawk fleet, as well as its bid in last year's budget, to start retiring the U-2 fleet in fiscal 2017. Otto said both aircraft could last perhaps as long as the 2040s before they were deemed ""not airworthy.""But budget constraints made it necessary to cut one of the two aircraft.Otto said he had not yet seen a proposal from Lockheed for designing a new stealthy, optionally manned spy plane based on the U-2, potentially using its engines, and dubbed TR-X.

132,"  NATIONAL HARBOR, Md., Sept 14 Northrop Grumman Corp on Monday said it agreed with the U.S. Air Force on a maintenance plan for its fleet of B-2 stealth bombers that will save $900 million, and make one more jet available for use at any time.Under the contract modification, signed in April, Northrop said it will give each B-2 a major overhaul, including a complete restoration of the jet's exterior surfaces, once every nine years, instead of the current seven-year cycle.""This new approach to B-2 maintenance is a win-win for the Air Force and the nation,"" said Brigadier General Eric Fick, program executive office for fighters and bombers at the Air Force's Life Cycle Management Center. Fick said the move would save the Air Force about $900 million in maintenance costs over the life of the fleet. The plan will also reduce the average length of B-2 maintenance by more than 35 days, to 365 days. The B-2 is the only long-range, large-payload U.S. military aircraft that can penetrate deeply into enemy air space. It can fly 6,000 nautical miles without refueling and more than 10,000 nautical miles with just one aerial refueling, allowing it to reach any target in the world within hours.

147,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Northrop Grumman Corp, maker of the stealthy B-2 bomber, beat out a team made up of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp to develop and build a next-generation long-range strike bomber, the U.S. Defense Department said on Tuesday.The announcement ended months of anticipation and marked the biggest contract award by the Pentagon in over a decade, a deal analysts have said could be valued at up to $80 billion if the U.S. Air Force buys all 100 stealth bombers now planned.Air Force Assistant Secretary Bill LaPlante told reporters  the service hoped to beat independent estimates that it would cost $23.5 billion to develop the new bomber, which will be able to deliver both conventional and nuclear weapons. It will cost an average of $564 million per plane to build the aircraft, with both sums expressed in fiscal 2016 dollars.""Building this bomber is a strategic investment in the next 50 years,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told reporters. ""It demonstrates our commitment to our allies and our determination to potential adversaries, making it crystal clear that the United States will continue to retain the ability to project power throughout the globe long into the future.""The award marks the Air Force's second drive to start replacing its aging B-52 and B-1 bombers in recent years. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates canceled the first program in 2010 because he thought it was too ambitious and expensive.Gates relaunched the classified program a year later with a strict cost cap of $550 million per aircraft in 2010 dollars or $606 million in fiscal 2016 dollars. The Northrop plane will cost $511 million in 2010 dollars, LaPlante said.The Air Force had hoped to select a winner during the spring, but the award was delayed several times. The program remains classified and the Air Force released few details about the aircraft, which company would build the engine, or any of its key characteristics. The Air Force also provided no artistic renderings of the new plane.LaPlante told reporters last week the new bomber would use some components that were already in use in other secret programs, which would help reduce the risk of technology problems later on and keep the program on track.The losing team may protest the contract action given the high stakes involved and the dearth of new programs in the current budget climate, said defense consultant Jim McAleese. Air Force officials said any company has the right to file a protest about the awarding of the contract. Boeing and Lockheed issued a joint statement saying they were disappointed by the decision and wanted answers on how the bids were scored in terms of price and risk. ""We will have further discussions with our customer before determining our next steps,"" the companies said in a joint statement after the Air Force announced the contract winner.Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush hailed the news. ""Our team has the resources in place to execute this important program, and we’re ready to get to work,"" Bush said.McAleese said the contract would ""give Northrop a fundamentally new lease on life and would return them immediately to growth."" The company's shares surged 6 percent in after-market trading after closing nearly unchanged at $180.60.The contract loss marked a significant blow for Boeing's defense business, which is facing an end to production of its F/A-18E/F and EA-18G fighter jets in the coming years, McAleese said.""The damage to Boeing is significant but not life-threatening because 75 percent of the value of the company's value is driven by commercial (aircraft production),"" he said. He said the likely renewal of the U.S. Export-Import Bank would also help Boeing weather the loss.Boeing shares were down 1.3 percent in after-market trading after closing 1.2 percent higher at $148.46.

Raytheon first won the contract in October, but the matter was quickly protested by both losing bidders, prompting the Air Force to take a fresh look at the bids.In her decision, Judge Margaret Sweeney said the Air Force's decision to reopen the competition was justified since the agency had violated rules on equal communications with bidders about whether they could recover internal research and development spending (IR&D) linked to the bid.The Air Force initially told bidders such costs were not allowable, but later told Raytheon it could recover certain IR&D costs, which allowed it to lower its pricing. It did not relay that change in approach to Northrop. ""That disparity in information favored Raytheon over Northrop,"" said the decision, which was dated Friday and posted on the court's website on Monday.The Air Force said the court's decision would allow it to ""continue source selection and take corrective action.""Justin Oakes, spokesman for Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, which is overseeing the process, declined comment on when a new contract award could be announced. The companies submitted final program revisions at the beginning of October.

157,"  WASHINGTON Hours after winning a multibillion-dollar contract to build a new U.S. bomber, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings on Wednesday, and increased its profit outlook for the full year.    Northrop, maker of the current B-2 bomber and Global Hawk unmanned planes, reported a 9 percent rise in third-quarter net profit to $516 million, or $2.75 per share, from $473 million, or $2.26 per share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $5.99 billion from $5.98 billion.    Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S looked for earnings per share of $2.19 on revenue of $5.86 billion.    The company's share price jumped 5.5 percent to $190.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.    On Tuesday Northrop beat out a Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) team to develop and build a next-generation long-range strike bomber for the U.S. Air Force. Analysts said the deal could be valued at up to $80 billion. In a conference call after the earnings release, Chief Executive Officer Wesley Bush said an organizational realignment announced earlier his month was not intended to separate its services businesses.    The realignment would lower costs in the long term, but the company did not expect any material effect on costs this year, said Chief Financial Officer Ken Bedingfield.    Northrop raised its outlook for full-year 2015 earnings to $9.70 to $9.80 per share, from $9.55 to $9.70. It now expects 2015 revenue at $23.6 billion to $23.8 billion, raising the lower end of the previous range from $23.4 billion.        Overall operating income rose 3 percent and the operating margin increased to 13.3 percent from 12.9 percent due to higher pension adjustments and a $21 million decrease in corporate expenses.

The aircraft, costing an average of $564 million to build, will be able to deliver both conventional and nuclear weapons.""Building this bomber is a strategic investment in the next 50 years,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told reporters. ""It demonstrates our commitment to our allies and our determination to potential adversaries, making it crystal clear that the United States will continue to retain the ability to project power throughout the globe long into the future.""The bomber is slated to be ready for initial combat use by 2025.The award marks the Air Force's second drive to start replacing its aging B-52 and B-1 bombers in recent years.

Gates relaunched the classified program a year later with a strict cost cap of $550 million per aircraft in 2010 dollars or $606 million in fiscal 2016 dollars. The Northrop plane will cost $511 million in 2010 dollars, LaPlante said.The Air Force had hoped to select a winner during the spring, but the award was delayed several times.The program remains classified and the Air Force released few details about the aircraft, which company would build the engine, or any of its key characteristics.

Boeing and Lockheed immediately said they wanted answers on how the competition was scored with regard to price and risk.Under federal law, companies have 10 days after an agency debrief to file with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress that rules on federal contract protests.

The GAO then has 100 days to evaluate the case.Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Boeing and Lockheed, said challenging the bomber award could be difficult given that the program was highly classified. The decision would ultimately hinge on how the Air Force evaluated the price and risk of the competing bids, he said. The fact that the deliberations had stretched out for days indicated it was not an obvious - or easy - decision.He said Boeing could also mount a political battle against the contract award, but faced some hurdles. ""It's a secret program, it's a high priority for the Air Force, and Northrop wants to build the bomber in California, a very powerful state,"" he said. Sources familiar with the issue said both companies had concerns about the use of historical bomber data to determine the pricing of the new plane since it did not give credit for innovations and new advanced manufacturing techniques implemented since the B-2 bomber two decades ago.Relying on historical data also affected projected life cycle costs for the planes, the sources said.Air Force officials have said only that Northrop's bomber represented the ""best value for the nation"" and would cost $511 million per plane, on average, in 2010 dollars, well below the program's cost cap of $550 million per plane.

Under federal law, companies have 10 days after an agency debrief to file with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress that rules on federal contract protests. In order to trigger a stop-work order, protests must be filed within five days of a required briefing, according to the GAO.The GAO then has 100 days to evaluate the case.Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Boeing and Lockheed, said challenging the bomber award could be difficult given that the program was highly classified. The decision would ultimately hinge on how the Air Force evaluated the price and risk of the competing bids, he said. The fact that the deliberations had stretched out for days indicated it was not an obvious - or easy - decision. He said Boeing could also mount a political battle against the contract award, but faced some hurdles. ""It's a secret program, it's a high priority for the Air Force, and Northrop wants to build the bomber in California, a very powerful state,"" he said.Sources familiar with the issue said both companies had concerns about the use of historical bomber data to determine the pricing of the new plane since it did not give credit for innovations and new advanced manufacturing techniques implemented since the B-2 bomber two decades ago.Relying on historical data also affected projected life cycle costs for the planes, the sources said.Air Force officials have said only that Northrop's bomber represented the ""best value for the nation"" and would cost $511 million per plane, on average, in 2010 dollars, well below the program's cost cap of $550 million per plane.

The decision to file the protest reflected concerns about the Air Force's use of cost data from earlier bomber programs to assess the pricing of the planes, devaluing innovations and new manufacturing processes implemented in recent years, according to two sources familiar with the companies' thinking.Boeing and Lockheed also believe the Air Force failed to properly evaluate the risks involved with Northrop's bid since the company has been a supplier, not prime contractor, on military aircraft programs in recent years, the sources said.Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Boeing and Lockheed, said the review led by Boeing General Counsel Michael Luttig, a former federal judge, concluded that there was solid grounds for challenging the award. ""This is shaping up to be a replay of the tanker award when Boeing challenged the way in which Northrop was awarded a future Air Force program,"" he said.

184,"   By Andrea Shalal | PALMDALE, Calif.  PALMDALE, Calif. Dec 15 Northrop Grumman Corp , riding high after its selection to build the next U.S. long-range bomber, says it is investing heavily and hiring workers as part of a focused plan to unveil at least one ""big, bold and ingenious"" new technology each year.Tom Vice, president of Northrop Aerospace Systems, told reporters that Northrop aims to drive innovation and develop new technologies that the Pentagon says it needs to stay ahead of Russia and China.Northrop, the third-largest U.S. weapons maker, scored a huge win in late October when it beat out Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp to win the Air Force bomber contract, a deal analysts say could be worth up to $80 billion.""The bomber win positions them as one of the two long-term combat aircraft players in the United States,"" said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. ""They're getting back into a leadership position.""Northrop builds key parts of both Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet and Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as the high-altitude Global Hawk and Triton unmanned planes, but it has not been the prime contractor on a major combat plane for years. Vice declined to discuss the bomber program, which remains classified, or a protest filed by the losing team.But company officials showed reporters an advanced manufacturing facility in Palmdale, California, where Northrop built all 21 B-2 bombers and now builds the center fuselage for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet, and a composites plant in El Segundo, California. About half the Palmdale building stands empty, with 1 million square feet of capacity available for new work on advanced aircraft, according to company officials. A huge photograph on display shows the building crammed full of B-2 bombers, each of which has a wingspan of 172 feet (52.43 m), during the heyday of that program.Vice, who started at Northrop Grumman in 1986 as an engineer testing the B-2 program, said the company is boosting spending on research and development of new technologies that might not be harnessed for a decade under its NG NEXT program.The company is also working on capabilities that could be available sooner, including hypersonic systems and new fiber-based lasers, he said. Northrop has set its gaze on two key aerospace programs: an $11 billion program to build 350 new training planes for the Air Force, and separate early efforts by both the U.S. Air Force and Navy to develop sixth-generation fighter jets.Vice showed reporters a model of the company's design for the so-called T-X trainer, which bears some resemblance to the T-38 trainer that Northrop built from 1961 to 1972. He said the first flight of the newly designed aircraft is scheduled for early next year, and declined to provide photographs of the new design.Northrop is also poised to win a contract this week from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for continued work on TERN, a new unmanned aircraft designed to operate on U.S. destroyers, said one U.S. defense official. The only other would-be competitor, Aerovironment, did not submit a bid.Chris Hernandez, sector vice president for research, technology and advanced design, showed reporters a model of the company's design - essentially a 40-foot flying wing with 10-foot counter-rotating fan blades that tilt vertically to land.Hernandez, another veteran of the B-2 program, said the TERN design was a product of what he called a ""cultural shift"" within the company toward more risk-taking, and greater emphasis on greater diversity and inclusion.

185,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Northrop Grumman Corp said on Saturday that it won a U.S. Air Force contract to build a new long-range bomber after a very thorough selection process and it argued that a new legal brief filed by Boeing Co had no merit.Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp on Friday said they would continue their protest against the Northrop contract, which is worth about $80 billion, calling the Air Force's acquisition process ""irreparably flawed"".The losing bidders issued a joint statement saying that they had filed a 133-page brief with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) in response to the Air Force's filing in the protest, which was first submitted last month.Northrop beat out the Boeing-Lockheed team to win the contract in October, but has had to stop working on the initial $21.4 billion development contract until GAO issues a ruling, which is due by Feb. 16.  Northrop said it also filed comments with the GAO, supporting the Air Force's handling of the decision. The move came after the Air Force's response to the protest. No comment was immediately available from the Air Force.""We are now even more confident that the Air Force followed an extraordinarily thorough and careful selection process and picked the right team in Northrop Grumman,"" Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said.

Boeing and Lockheed could still decide to take their protest to federal court, as Lockheed did this week in its challenge to the Army's $6.75 billion contract award for next-generation Humvees to Oshkosh Corp.Lockheed said it took the step in that case after the GAO declined to extend its review to consider additional evidence, but GAO said the company did not submit the necessary supplemental protest requesting the extension.

187,"  (Adds contract news)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Dec 21 Lockheed Martin Corp  met its goal of delivering 45 F-35 fighter jets to the U.S. government and key allies in 2015, a 25 percent increase from 2014 that brought the number of jets delivered to 154, the Pentagon said on Monday.Lockheed is on track to receive most associated performance fees, and marked a milestone for the $391 billion F-35 project, the Pentagon's largest arms program, as it prepared for a large production increase in coming years.""Meeting aircraft production goals is a critical stepping stone in demonstrating the program is ready for the expected significant production ramp up,"" said Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon.Late on Monday, the Pentagon said Lockheed had won a contract worth $1.17 billion to buy titanium and other materials needed to build an 11th batch of F-35 fighter jets. Lockheed remained in negotiations with the Pentagon about the next two batches of F-35 jets, a deal that could be worth $15 billion. The two sides had hoped to reach agreement before year end, but have pushed the date to the first quarter, said  sources familiar with the discussions.Lockheed is developing and building three models of F-35 jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as for Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Australia, Israel, Japan and South Korea.Key suppliers to Lockheed are Northrop Grumman Corp  and BAE Systems Plc. Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, builds the engines for the supersonic jets under a separate agreement with the government. Pratt is nearing a deal with the F-35 program office for the next two batches of jets, including 60 engines in the ninth set and 100 in the 10th, said Pratt spokesman Matthew Bates.The jets delivered in 2015 included 26 F-35 A-model jets for the U.S. Air Force, which now has 75 of the planes; two F-35As for Norway; and one F-35A for Italy, the F-35 program office said. Lockheed also delivered eight F-35 B-model jets, which can land vertically, to the U.S Marine Corps, as well as four F-35 C-model jets, which take off from aircraft carriers, to the Marines, and four F-35C jets to the U.S. Navy.The latest deliveries capped a busy year for the F-35 program. The U.S. Marine Corps declared an initial squadron of jets ready for combat use. Also during the year, Lockheed delivered the first F-35 jet from Italy's final assembly and checkout facility to the Italian military.The Italian plant, managed by Finmeccanica SpA, will build most of the 90 jets expected to be ordered by Japan, and some of the 37 jets to be ordered by the Netherlands.Earlier this month, the wings, fuselage and tails of the first Japanese-built F-35 were joined together for the first time at a facility in Nagoya, Japan. The assembly of the aircraft, designated AX-5, will be completed in 2017.Lockheed is building the first four F-35As for Japan in Fort Worth, Texas, while the remaining 38 ordered by Japan will be assembled in Japan.

190,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Marine Corps on Monday said it would send a pair of Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets to two air shows in Britain this summer, a key milestone for the $391 billion weapons program after its thwarted international debut in 2014.Some U.S. Air Force F-35 jets will also take part in the events, according to sources familiar with the plans. Air Force officials could not immediately be reached for comment. A fleetwide F-35 grounding ordered after an engine fire in 2014 prevented what would have been the jets' international premiere at the annual Royal International Air Tattoo and an appearance at the world's biggest air show in Farnborough, outside London, both that year.Since then, an F-35 jet assembled in Italy has made its inaugural flight there, but this year's appearance at RIAT will be the first by the stealthy, supersonic new warplane at an international air show.""The U.S. Marine Corps is looking forward to demonstrating the capabilities of the F-35B Lightning II in the skies over the United Kingdom this July,"" Deputy Commandant for Aviation Lieutenant General Jon Davis said in statement to Reuters.Davis said a joint U.S. Marine Corps and UK detachment would use the flights to validate overseas deployment activities and prove program interoperability. The Pentagon's F-35 program office and Lockheed would support the work, he said. The British defense ministry had no immediate comment.One of the sources said Britain planned to send at least one of the four F-35 jets it has already received to the air shows. The British jets are currently training in the United States.Lockheed is developing three models of the jet, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, or Lightning II, with key suppliers Northrop Grumman Corp and Britain's BAE Systems Plc. Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, builds the engines. Besides Britain, seven other countries helped fund development of the jets: Norway, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Turkey, Italy and the Netherlands. All but Canada and Denmark have since ordered jets, as have Israel, Japan and South Korea.The F-35 program, the Pentagon's single largest weapons project, ran into technical problems and cost overruns for years, but U.S. officials say it has improved and that costs have fallen for the past five years.The Marine Corp's F-35B model can take off from warships and aircraft carriers and land like a helicopter. The service branch plans to buy a total of 420 F-35B-model and C-model jets, which can fly onto and take off from aircraft carriers. The Air Force plans to buy 1,763 A-model jets, which take off and land on conventional runways.Davis said lessons identified from the deployment would help the Marines as they set up a second F-35 fighter attack squadron this summer and prepare for the first one to move to Iwakuni, Japan, in 2017.The Marine Corps in July announced an initial squadron of 10 F-35 jets ready for combat, and the Air Force is due to follow suit this summer.

Earnings per share came to $2.49, after analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expected $2.01. Revenue of $5.7 billion missed analysts' estimates of $5.9 billion.

195,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Facing a hostile Congress in an election year, President Barack Obama will be hard-pressed to push through many of the proposals in his final budget as U.S. leader. But that could be a silver lining for investors: If the long-shot plans gain traction, companies that stand to win new business or funding from proposed spending, such as auto suppliers, hospital chains and construction firms, could get an unexpected boost to their shares.Some details of the budget plan, set to be unveiled on Tuesday, already are known. It will include $4 billion over 10 years for development of safe-driving vehicles, an area already of interest to many companies. Added funding could benefit suppliers such as Delphi Automotive, Autoliv and Mobileye, which are developing safety features for autonomously driven cars, and Lear, which makes electrical power systems, according to Brian Sponheimer, analyst at Gabelli & Co. ""The market discounts that any proposals by this administration will be if not ignored, then outright put down,"" Sponheimer said. ""There clearly is upside if it passes, but there is a very healthy skepticism that that is likely to take place.""Obama's plan to fund an overhaul of the nation's infrastructure through a $10-a-barrel tax on crude oil could also boost engineering and construction firms such as Granite Construction said Morris Ajzenman, an analyst at Griffin Securities. ""But I give very very little probability that it comes to pass.""Similarly, Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street, said it was doubtful the Republican Congress would approve Obama's plan to aid the 19 state governments that passed up an earlier offer to expand the Medicaid program for low-income Americans. Such a plan, she said, would benefit hospital companies including Tenet Healthcare and HCA Holdings and Medicaid insurers such as Centene and Molina Healthcare.More palatable to Congress could be Obama's push for $755 million to jumpstart cancer research. But that level of investment without being more targeted may not benefit any specific firms, given that so many drug and biotech companies are invested in developing cancer therapies. Major defense contractors - including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics - stand to benefit from the budget, said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment.""It’s an election year, national security is at the top of the priority list and a lot of elected officials – they don’t want to be tied to cutting defense,"" Arment said.

She said the Air Force's own investigation showed Lombardi was not involved in the source selection process for the bomber contract and he was not the service acquisition executive at that time.James said she hoped the incident did not further delay the Long-Range Strike Bomber, or LRS-B program, which was halted in November after Boeing Co filed its protest. A supplemental protest could delay work on the program for an additional 100 days. She declined to say if the Lombardi revelation could provide grounds for Boeing to amend its challenge.""We'll see what happens next,"" James said after a breakfast hosted by the Air Force Association. The Government Acountability Office, which is due to rule on Boeing's protest on Tuesday, said it could not speculate on what actions the parties to the protest might consider.Boeing has not commented on the matter. Lockheed, a subcontractor to Boeing on the losing bid, referred all questions to Boeing. Northrop on Thursday said it was clear that Lombardi was not involved in the source selection and the company remained convinced that the Air Force had chosen the best option to meet its requirements for a new long-range strike bomber.James said senior officials were required to fill out financial disclosure forms annually, including information about their assets, and those of their spouses and children under the age of 18. It was not immediately clear when Lombardi's wife worked for Northrop.James said she removed Lombardi from his acquisition duties on Feb. 4, a day after learning about his voluntary disclosure.Lombardi, a former Air Force officer and long-time public servant, assumed the role of acting assistant secretary for acquisition and service acquisition executive on Dec. 1 when William LaPlante resigned to take a job in private industry.

209,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Raytheon Co, a top U.S. weapons maker, on Monday said it would team up with Finmeccanica SpA to offer a variant of the Italian company's Aermacchi M-346 jets in an upcoming U.S. Air Force competition for 350 new training planes.The U.S. Air Force plans to launch a competition valued at $8 billion to $10 billion in 2017 to replace its aging fleet of T-38 planes, which are nearly 50 years old. It could eventually buy up to 600 planes, analysts said. Raytheon and Finmeccanica said using an existing aircraft instead of designing a new one would save the Air Force money, and could allow the planes to enter into service years before the target of 2024.Unlike other contenders, the M-346 aircraft had already demonstrated its capabilities for U.S. Air Force officials in Italy in 2014 as they were finalizing their requirements for the new training planes, officials from the companies said.The planes are already being used to train Israeli, Italian and Dutch pilots who will fly Lockheed F-35 fighter jets. Poland and Singapore also recently ordered the Finmeccanica jets for their pilot training programs, Jim Hvizd, vice president of business development for Raytheon's space and airborne systems division, told reporters at a joint news conference with Finmeccanica.He said Raytheon's T-100 aircraft, an advanced variant of the M-346, would also keep pilots safer than potential competitors since it had flight control technology that would stabilize the plane automatically if a pilot lost control. Raytheon and Finmeccanica began talks about a joint bid about 16 months ago, he said. Honeywell International Inc  will build the twin F124 turbofan engines to power the planes, and CAE Inc  will supply the ground training system.Raytheon officials said the company was assessing several sites where it would build portions of the plane, but gave no further details. Hvizd said the site would be chosen before the company submitted a full bid.Finmeccanica had previously planned to bid together with another U.S. arms maker, General Dynamics Corp, but General Dynamics said it later withdrew from the team. Lockheed Martin Corp earlier this month said it would offer the Air Force a modified version of its T-50 training jet developed jointly with Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd . Boeing Co is working with Sweden's Saab AB to develop a new training plane, while Textron Inc and Northrop Grumman Corp are each designing their own new planes.

210,"  (New throughout, adds details, comments)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Feb 25 Boeing Co has told senior U.S. Air Force leaders that it will not take legal action challenging an $80 billion long-range bomber contract awarded to Northrop Grumman Corp, two sources familiar with the decision said on Thursday.The decision came hours after Boeing, the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier, replaced Chris Chadwick as the head of its defense division with Leanne Caret, head of the defense division's services and logistics business.It followed a pledge by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain to block the Air Force's use of a cost-plus type of contract, which holds the government responsible for cost overruns, for the Northrop bomber program.Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher declined to confirm the news. ""If we choose not to pursue our protest further in the interest of our Air Force customer and the war fighter, or otherwise, we will inform the Air Force and other stakeholders of the decision first. We have no new information to share at this point,"" he said.Northrop and the Air Force declined to comment. Air Force Secretary Deborah James was expected to reveal the name of the new bomber at an industry conference in Orlando on Friday, according to a source familiar with the matter.Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to Boeing, said Boeing officials expected the bomber program to face tough scrutiny by Congress given reports that Northrop had submitted a lowball bid for the work.""Just because they won't go to court doesn't mean they're giving up,"" he said of Boeing's thinking on the bomber contract. ""They believe that as time goes by this program will look less and less executable under the terms that were agreed to."" McCain told reporters he would block authorization of the new long-range strike bomber program in its current form, arguing that cost-plus deals inevitably lead to cost overruns.The Air Force said it understood McCain's concerns and looked forward to briefing him on the program in coming weeks.It said only the engineering and development phase of the program, valued at $21.4 billion, is structured as a cost-plus contract with incentive fees. Production of the first five sets of new bombers, usually the most expensive planes in a new class of aircraft, would be structured with a firm, fixed-price.The Air Force has not disclosed the full projected cost of the program, although it has said that it expects to pay $511 million per plane in 2010 dollars.

I will not authorize a program that has a cost-plus contract,"" McCain said, when asked about the contract, which the U.S. Air Force has already signed with Northrop.McCain said the military often argued that cost-plus contracts were necessary in cases involving cutting-edge technologies since unknown problems could emerge, but such practices were unheard of in Silicon Valley.The Air Force said that only the engineering and development phase of the program, valued at $21.4 billion, was structured as a cost-plus contract with incentive fees. The second part of the contract, which would cover initial production of the first five sets of new bombers, usually the most expensive planes in a new class of aircraft, would be structured with a firm, fixed-price.The Air Force has not disclosed the full projected cost of the program, although it has said that it expects to pay $511 million per plane in 2010 dollars.""The Air Force values the oversight role that Senator McCain has and looks forward to continuing to work with him and the committee on moving forward with this critical capability for the department and the nation. The Department looks forward to being able to provide the Senator a complete briefing of the program at his earliest convenience,"" the aerial warfare service said. Officials were expected to brief McCain in the next couple of weeks, a spokeswoman said.Northrop declined comment. The Senate Armed Services Committee and its counterpart in the House of Representatives approve legislation that sets defense policy, while funding for the military is governed by the House and Senate appropriations committees.McCain also took issue with the high level of secrecy shrouding the bomber program, and the Air Force's refusal thus far to divulge the names of key suppliers on the program.""If someone wants to build an engine for an airplane that requires congressional authorization, then it must be known who’s making it and under what circumstances,” he said.

Reuters reported last week that a number of undelivered Airbus jetliners are stranded outside the plants, including A350s awaiting cabin equipment in Toulouse. Lawson said Boeing is ""very optimistic"" about the prospects for so-called aftermarket parts, or those sold after an airplane is delivered. Boeing recently ending an agreement with Spirit for this production as part of a renewed effort by the jetmaker to build its own aftermarket business.As a result of the change, Lawson said Spirit will ""sell all the parts to Boeing now and will provide our services to Boeing and our MRO business will continue,"" referring to maintenance and repair operations. ""And I think Boeing is very optimistic about the aftermarket."" Spirit sees scope to increase its defense business to about 20 percent of revenue in coming years, Lawson said, and that it would seek to do so through a combination of acquisitions and bidding on new work. The Wichita, Kansas-based company was recently picked as a supplier for the U.S. Air Force B-21 bomber being built by prime contractor Northrop Grumman Corp.Spirit earlier on Friday posted first-quarter earnings of $1.29 a share, beating consensus estimates of $1.07 a share from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

241,"  BERLIN, June 10 Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon's top supplier, on Friday said it hoped to complete quickly long-delayed contract negotiations with the Pentagon for the next two batches of F-35 fighter jets, orders worth about a combined $15 billion.Jack Crisler, vice president of business development for Lockheed's F-35 program, told Reuters the negotiations were continuing nearly every day, and the two sides were ""really close"" to an agreement for the more than 150 aircraft in the net two batches.Lockheed and Pentagon officials had initially hoped to complete the negotiations by the end of the year, and later moved their target to the end of March, only to miss that mark as well.Crisler said the discussions were complicated by the scope of the contract - which includes over 150 aircraft - and the subcontractors involved. ""It becomes more and more difficult as you get closer to the end,"" Crisler said. He declined to give any details about the substance of the negotiations.A source familiar with the process confirmed that the two sides had made progress and were nearing agreement. ""We're aiming to get it done within the next month,"" said the source, who was not authorised to speak publicly.

243,"   By Andrea Shalal | FARNBOROUGH, England  FARNBOROUGH, England The U.S. Defense Department on Monday extended by two years a  project that has cut the cost of Lockheed Martin Corp's (LMT.N) F-35 fighter plane by more than $1 million per jet, and kicked off a similar project to cut operating and maintenance costs.The Pentagon's F-35 program office is working closely with industry to drive down the cost of the jets - now running just over $100 million per jet - to around $85 million by 2019.The F-35 program is the Pentagon's costliest arms program. The U.S. military plans to spend $379 billion to buy a total of 2,457 F-35 warplanes over the next decades.Under the Blueprint for Affordability cost-cutting program first announced two years ago, Lockheed and its key suppliers, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and Britain's BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) were due to invest $170 million in new technologies, materials and processes to lower production costs.They are due to recoup their initial outlays from the government once the accrued savings are verified. Specific programs included boosting efficiency through improved tooling, automating production by introducing robotics, and even modifying assembly instructions. The project funded 193 separate initiatives, of which 75 were still in process. The investments are expected to save $1.15 million per aircraft in the ninth production lot, and $1.7 million in the 10th. Over the life of the program, the changes will save around $4 billion, according to the F-35 program.Over the next two years, the companies have agreed to invest $24 million left over from the original program, and up to $170 million more on continued work to lower the cost of the jets, the program office said.In addition, the three companies agreed to invest up to $250 million in projects aimed at cutting the cost of operating and maintaining the jets, with a goal of saving $1 billion over a five-year period, the F-35 program office said. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said the extra  investment by industry would help the military bridge to an F-35 block purchase planned in coming years for international customers that could cut the cost of building the jets by over $2 billion.Kendall told reporters that the department was ""basically ready to move forward"" on the block buy, initially with a group of other countries, and then later with the U.S. military.""We’d like to see that proceed as soon as possible,"" he said. ""We think we’re basically ready to move forward on that."" Kendall said the separate program to cut operating costs would help the Pentagon achieve its goal of lowering the overall lifecycle cost of the program - now estimated to be over $1 trillion through 2070 - by 30 percent.Bennett Croswell, who heads the military engines business of Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies which makes the F135 engine that powers the F-35, said his company would also set new cost-cutting targets after completing the engine's development program by the end of this month.He said the new program would involve Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L), which makes the lift fan for the F-35B model, which can land vertically like a helicopter.

249,"   By Tim Kelly | TOKYO  TOKYO Japan's defense ministry on Wednesday asked for a hike in spending to record levels, as it juggles its responses to a growing ballistic missile threat from North Korea and China's assertive moves in the East China Sea.If approved, the hike of 2.3 percent will take the defense budget to 5.17 trillion yen ($51.47 billion) in the year starting April 1, for a fifth consecutive increase as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe bolsters Japan's military.The nation's Self Defense Forces are pivoting away from guarding the north against a diminished Russian threat to reinforce an island chain stretching 1,400 km (870 miles) along the southern edge of the East China Sea.That means opting for fewer tank divisions as they build a mobile amphibious force from scratch.The costly rejig comes as Japan is also forced to spend more to guard against ballistic missiles being developed by North Korea capable of striking most areas. PATRIOT UPGRADE    The single biggest expenditure is 99 billion yen ($970 million) to upgrade Japan's warhead-killing Patriot batteries, a last line of defense against missile strikes.The improvements will double their range to around 30 km (19 miles) and sharpen targeting to hit arriving ballistic warheads.  They will take five years to complete, with the first four enhanced Patriots expected to be ready for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.In June, North Korea test-fired what appeared to be two mobile Musudan rockets, one of which climbed to 1,000 km (600 miles), or enough to fly more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles) down range. On Aug. 24, Pyongyang also fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) toward Japan that traveled 500 km (311 miles).  Japan's biggest defense contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (7011.T) will upgrade the PAC-3s under license from Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co, sources familiar with the plan told Reuters last month. The budget request also includes funding to improve Aegis destroyers that are Japan's first line of defense against ballistic missiles. Japan and the United States are developing a new warhead killer, the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3), to destroy targets in space, but no decision on a full rollout has yet been made.SOUTHWEST SHIFT     Other proposed defense buys will reinforce the East China Sea, where Japan and China are locked in a territorial dispute over a group of islets 220 km (140 miles) northeast of Taiwan known as the Senkakus in Tokyo and the Diaoyus in Beijing. Japanese air scrambles against Chinese aircraft are running at a record high, with Beijing's navy probing deeper and more frequently into the Western Pacific beyond Japan's island chain. Chinese military activity in the region was ""escalating,"" Japan's Self-Defence Forces chief Admiral Katsutoshi Kawano said in June. Defence officials want 95 billion yen next year to buy six Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters, and a combined 92 billion for four Boeing Co (BA.N) and Bell Helicopter (TXT.N) V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and six Boeing Chinook twin-rotor  helicopters. The SDF also wants 11 BAE Systems (BAES.L) AAV7 amphibious assault craft, and two long-range Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) C-2 military cargo jets.Other buys will include a Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) unmanned Global Hawk surveillance drone and a new larger-class diesel-electric submarine designed by Mitsubishi Heavy and Kawasaki Heavy.

250,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Mike Stone  U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) reported a 16.7 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by higher sales in its aerospace systems business that makes the center fuselage of the F-35 fighter jets.Northrop shares hit an all-time high of $229.45 and were still up 3.9 percent at $228.10 in afternoon trading. Last October, Northrop won the contract to produce the ""Raider,"" the U.S. Air Force's new B-21 long-range bomber. The estimated $80 billion program, expected to produce 100 aircraft, has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception.

255,"   By Mike Stone | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) concluded negotiations on their ninth contract for F-35 fighter jets after 14 months of negotiations on the more than $6.1 billion deal, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. The unilateral agreement on the contract for 57 of the new war planes, will give profit margin certainty to Lockheed and its partners who have been producing the jet under a placeholder agreement known as an ""undefinitized contract action"".People familiar with the contract negotiations who spoke under condition of anonymity said the tenth production contract, a 94-plane deal, was still under negotiation. In a statement, Lockheed said that the contract was ""not a mutually agreed upon contract, it was a unilateral contract action, which obligates us to perform under standard terms and conditions, and previously agreed-to items."" Adding, ""We are disappointed with the decision by the government to issue a unilateral contract action."" People familiar with the procurement process said that the unilateral decision was rare.The previous lot of 43 jets, lot 8, had an average unit price of $108 million per plane. Planes in lot 9 are about $107 million per plane, 3.7 percent less, making it the lowest price per jet thus far. The F-35 is the Pentagon's costliest arms program. The U.S. Defense Department expects to spend $391 billion to develop the plane and buy 2,443 of the supersonic, stealthy new warplanes, in the coming decades. The ninth batch of jets includes 42 F-35 A-model jets for the U.S. Air Force, Norway, Israel and Japan; and 13 F-35 B-model jets, which can handle short takeoffs and vertical landings, for the Marine Corps and the British navy, as well as two carrier-variant F-35C jets for the U.S. Navy.Lockheed, and its main partners including Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) and BAE Systems (BAES.L), have been developing and building F-35s for the U.S. military and 10 allies. Lockheed's F-35 program manager Jeff Babione had previously said that the price of the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing version of the jet would drop to under $100 million per plane in the 10th low-rate production batch.On Oct. 25 Lockheed, the world's largest defense contractor, reported a quarterly profit that handily beat analysts' expectations, as sales of its Sikorsky helicopters pushed total revenue up 14.8 percent.
