2,"  Feb 14 Campbell Soup Co, the world's largest soup maker, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong soup sales, helped in part by cold weather and a later Thanksgiving in the United States.Campbell's shares rose as much as 7 percent after the company also maintained its full-year sales forecast.Campbell said a late Thanksgiving holiday last year pushed shipments to retailers into the second quarter ended Jan. 26.The company also said that while the severe winter weather during the quarter helped soup sales grow, the recent storms also led to lost sales as retailers shut shops and Campbell was forced to close plants.""We believe the weakness that Campbell and other food companies experienced in January was partially related to the extreme weather conditions, which dealt a blow to the U.S. economy,"" Chief Executive Denise Morrison said on a post-earnings call. The company said soup consumption levels in the quarter were below shipments leading to higher inventory levels at retailers at the end of the second quarter.Campbell has been facing stiff competition from private-label brands and smaller rivals and has had trouble attracting younger, more health conscious consumers to its canned soup offerings.The company said it expected its U.S. soup business to be boosted this year due to eight new soups it launched last month, including its first Latin-inspired cooking soups and new varieties in its Healthy Request line. Campbell maintained its full-year sales forecast of a 4-5 percent growth, which translates to sales of $8.37-$8.45 billion.That is higher than analysts' average expectation of $8.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Pfizer shares advanced 1.7 percent to $29.60 before the opening bell. * AT&T lost 2.5 percent to $35.83 in premarket trade after the telecom company said it will acquire DirecTV  for $48.5 billion, highlighting AT&T's pressing need for fresh avenues of growth beyond the maturing U.S. cellular business. DirecTV shares lost one cent at $86.17 in premarket. * Equities have come under pressure recently, with consecutive weekly declines for the first time since January as investors have become leery of growth prospects as a result of mixed economic data.* Small-cap stocks, often seen as the first beneficiary of growth, have tumbled. The small-cap Russell 2000 index  has several times approached correction territory, defined as a decline of 10 percent from a recent high, only to bounce back slightly.* The defensive posture by investors has been reflected by a sector rotation into groups such as utilities, telecoms and energy, which have outperformed the broader S&P 500 over the past three months. * S&P 500 e-mini futures lost 4 points and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures declined 42 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures  lost 6.5 points.* Campbell Soup Co fell 4.8 percent to $42.95 in premarket after the world's largest soup maker posted weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its full-year sales guidance.* Earnings season will effectively draw to a close this week, with 23 companies scheduled to report, including retailers Home Depot and Lowe's Cos.* Of the 464 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Friday, 69.2 percent beat expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent and the 66 percent average over the past four quarters.

""This is the stuff that dreams are made of. It's incredible. ""When we saw that world record set in 2009 we thought, 'well that's it for the next 10 years and this is beyond incredible."" Of the 43 records set at the Foro Italico in Rome, 21 still remain on the books.""A world record in itself is a milestone but a supersuit world record is something that's incredibly special,"" Campbell added.""It was pandemonium in 2009 with those world records going.

They didn't swim the race for you but jeez they made a difference in the last 25m when it really hurts. It was a gutsy performance for all the girls.""Suits or not, the fact the Australians snatched the country's first world record since 2009 should not have come as too much of a surprise.The Australians are the Olympic champions, with Cate Campbell and Schlanger veterans of the quartet that captured the only gold by the country in the London pool.  All four members of the team that swam the final are also ranked in the top-nine for the 100 freestyle this year.""It wasn't something we spoke of at any point but I think we had an inkling that we had a chance,"" Schlanger told the newspaper about their feelings before the final.""It's pretty cool.

10,"  (Recasts paragraph 2 on Campbell position; adds comment from Sweetener Users Association, adds dropped word in paragraph 18)By Chris PrenticeNEW YORK Aug 4 In Washington, a pivotal battle over sugar is heating up. One small corner of the wider culture war over public health and sweeteners, this fight isn't about how much sugar should be in your food, but how much you should know about it.U.S. food regulators say the public needs to know how much sugar manufacturers add to their products, beyond the sweetener that naturally occurs in the raw ingredients. Companies such as Campbell Soup Company oppose the addition. While the company says it supports better food labels, it warns that making a distinction in the source of sugar risks dangerous confusion.This week the Food and Drug Administration will begin reviewing thousands of public comments on proposed new labeling regulations that would require food makers to specify how much sugar they are adding to products. Current labeling laws only require them to list total sugar content.The move marks U.S. regulators' first significant step to address a growing clamor from health groups and scientists who say that excessive sugar consumption is a key culprit in the nation's obesity and diabetes epidemics.It also comes amid growing public demands for greater transparency in the U.S. food supply chain, fueled by interest in everything from animal welfare to genetically modified grain.""There's been an increasing drum beat on the part of public health advocates to give consumers that information,"" says Michael Jacobson, the head of nonprofit food advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which has spent decades crusading to tackle high sugar levels.Jacobson said he was ""delighted and almost in disbelief"" when he heard of the FDA's plans, which were announced in February.Not everyone is thrilled. If added, the line would be a major blow for sweetener companies already battling each other in an overcrowded industry as the growth of America's massive sweet tooth stalls.That the proposed change will hurt U.S. demand was a key discussion topic at an industry conference in Stowe, Vermont.""Unfortunately, it doesn't send domestic (sugar) deliveries but one direction,"" Randy Green, an agricultural policy expert and consultant for the Sweetener Users Association, said during a Monday presentation.It is impossible to determine how many sugars have been added to a container of yogurt, unless companies choose to disclose it. Sugar is used to enhanced flavor in a wide range of products, beyond cookies, candy and sodas. The fight is about to get serious, with lobbyists on either side expected to step up pressure as the FDA reviews public comments ahead of issuing a final rule. From there, it would likely be years before companies are required to update their labels.'SUGAR IS SUGAR' U.S. government data shows that per capita consumption of caloric sweeteners has been declining for over a decade, but health groups say it is well above healthy levels.Some nutrition experts and scientists say sugars that are added to foods are greater contributors to weight gain, adding calories without the benefit of other nutrients. A few even say sugar itself is toxic.That stance remains a controversial one. Food manufacturers and sugar companies resoundingly say there is not enough evidence to suggest ""added sugars"" contribute differently to weight gain than sugars that are intrinsic to food, such as a piece of fruit. ""Sugar is sugar, regardless of the source,"" Campbell Soup Company, the maker of Pepperidge Farm and Prego products, wrote in a letter to the FDA.The company says it supports FDA efforts to improve labeling in order to give consumers additional information to make informed choices. But it feels that focusing on the origin of the sugar - rather than total calorie count - is misguided.""Giving consumers a false impression that reducing added sugars without reducing calories may actually delay finding a real solution to the problem"" of obesity, wrote Lisa J. Thorsten, the company's director of regulatory affairs and nutrition.The Sugar Association, which represents the makers of household brands, including Domino Sugar and Imperial Sugar, went further, saying the lack of scientific evidence to justify the line sets an ""alarming precedent.""But CSPI's Jacobson and a number of other health advocates insist that added sugars are different and are hidden sources of empty calories at the very least.The American Heart Association recommends that women, for example, consume no more than about 6 teaspoons of added sugars each day. That is less than the amount in a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola. The World Health Organization in March issued a draft of new guidelines advocating people cut the recommended amount of added sugars they eat in half, updating the guidelines it introduced a decade ago.""The big difference between now and then (is) we have a system to provide the guidelines,"" said Francesco Branca, the WHO's nutrition department director. ""We have credibility from the scientific point of view that make these guidelines easier to defend.""FOR 'JUNK FOOD' CRITIC, A LONG TIME COMING Some critics doubt the effectiveness of the so-called ""facts panel"" overhaul. The U.S. government earlier this year said that just around half of all consumers read the labels and make decisions based on the information.""The people who read labels are the people who are already watching their health and their weight. This isn't going to cause a dramatic change,"" said Baylen Linnekin, head of nonprofit Keep Food Legal and a critic of the labeling measure as well as other government involvement in the food sector, including subsidies.The Sugar Association also said the move represents a concerning extension of regulatory power in requiring food makers to turn over private records to the U.S. government.The regulators' move underscores the growing public scrutiny of sugar consumption, a trend that cheers Jacobson, who has targeted soda makers and sued food companies in a self-appointed role as the nation's ""food cop.""Washington-based public relations specialist and industry advocate Rick Berman says Jacobson is in the ""food hysteria business"" and dismisses the anti-sugar craze as a fad.With industry lobbying efforts building up, Jacobson, 71, said he is ""not planting the white flag yet.""

24,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Packaged foods maker Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) on Friday reported an unexpectedly better quarterly profit, helped by lower spending on promotions, higher prices for its products and cost cuts.  Shares of the company, known for its soups, Pepperidge Farm cookies and Goldfish crackers, rose about 1.5 percent. Campbell, like others in the packaged food industry, is struggling to grow as consumers in developed markets shift away from processed foods to fresher, healthier items. The industry is facing pressure from investors to boost its margins by slashing costs. Campbell announced a cost-cutting plan in February to save at least $200 million annually over the next three years and said it was reorganizing its business units by product categories.In May, it said that 471 employees had taken buyouts that the company is offering workers close to retirement age.Campbell said its gross margin rose to 35.9 percent in the third quarter from 34.3 percent a year earlier. Sales in Campbell's U.S. simple meals business, which includes soups, fell 6 percent in its third quarter as the company cut promotional spending, which caused retailers to buy less soup.But Campbell Chief Executive Denise Morrison told analysts in a conference call that consumer consumption of soup, as well as the company's market share, was stable in the third quarter.

Additionally, it will launch new organic products, such as purees under its Plum line for kids and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers made with organic wheat.""What we've been doing is reinventing the company for a better growth trajectory,"" said Denise Morrison, Campbell's chief executive, in an interview. ""We recognize an important part of that is reshaping the portfolio.""Campbell also said it would remove artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of its North American products by July 2018, and that it would move away from using high fructose corn syrup in certain products, such as its line of Pepperidge Farm fresh breads by the end of fiscal 2017. Most new products it is launching in 2016 also will not contain corn syrup. The company is struggling to grow as U.S. consumers shift away from the processed items found in the center aisles of the grocery store and opt for fresher products on the perimeter.Earlier on Wednesday, Campbell reduced its long-term organic sales growth forecast to 1-3 percent from 3-4 percent to reflect the slow-growth environment in the packaged food industry. The company's organic sales have not increased for two quarters now.   In an effort to its top line, Campbell said that it aims to increase sales of biscuits and snacks in developing markets like Indonesia and China. Campbell executives said in interviews that the company is looking for acquisitions in fast-growing categories.

Gross margin increased to 36.1 percent from 34.1 percent in the year earlier period as the company cut costs and raised prices. Still, like others in the industry, Campbell is struggling to increase its top line as people opt for food items that are organic, gluten-free, high in protein and generally perceived as healthier.Sales, adjusted for acquisitions and an extra selling week in the year earlier period, increased 1 percent during the quarter, driven by increases in the company's simple meals segment, which includes broth and Prego pasta sauces, and the Bolthouse Farms business, which includes refrigerated beverages and salad dressings. Ken Goldman, an analyst at JP Morgan, said in a note that the results were slightly positive. Organic growth came in lighter than he expected, but he called the company's gross margin strong.Shares were little changed at $47.75 in Thursday morning trading.

51,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A small but growing number of companies are starting to target Generation Z - the 69 million high school-age kids and younger who will soon outnumber the millennials before them - and they are not just pitching typical teen products such as acne creams and video games.Companies ranging from Macy's Inc to Campbell Soup Co to Charles Schwab Corp are talking to investors about their long-term plans to appeal to the post-millennial generation, a group that Pew Research expects to make up 40 percent of the U.S. workforce by 2020 and ultimately surpass the 75.4 million millennials and 74.9 million baby boomers.""It's a matter of survival to get new customers. Today's 18 year old is only 10 years away from being someone with a job and savings and trying to figure out a 401(k) for the first time,"" said Peter Tuz, portfolio manager of the $84 million Chase Growth Fund. He is shying away from mall-based  retailers as teens increasingly shop online.Gregg Fisher, portfolio manager of the Gerstein Fisher Multi-Factor Growth Equity fund, said that he is buying shares of Google-parent Alphabet and Apple IncO> in part because he expects that they will be able to adapt and continue to appeal to Generation Z, a group that he is familiar with by watching the habits of his 13 year old son.“It’s like someone in the U.S. who was investing in China in the early 90s. There’s a huge opportunity here for companies that are willing to take some risk and bet on the future,” he said.  Generation Z differs from previous generations in that its members have grown up with smartphones and the internet, making them more focused on speed of service. Many also saw their parents struggle during the Great Recession, making them more risk-averse, said Sean Mahoney, editorial director at advertising agency Sparks and Honey.   Ten major companies have specifically addressed Generation Z in earnings calls and investor presentations since the start of the year, according to a Reuters analysis of transcripts, more than the previous number of mentions by all companies over the last six years combined. Campbell cited Generation Z's focus on transparency as part of its decision to stop opposing labeling for foods containing genetically modified ingredients.Charles Schwab said that its financial advisers would transition more to becoming ""life coaches"" rather than making specific investment decisions as technology-trusting Generation Z comes of age and places more faith in computer models than humans when investing. All of the companies mentioning Generation Z are consumer-focused, suggesting that they are the most pressed to demonstrate to investors that they have a pipeline of future customers, investors say. SIGNS OF A NEW GENERATION   Companies have targeted teens for generations, but what makes this effort different is that the majority of the 10 companies talking about Generation Z now are not traditional teen marketers. They are instead focused on making their products appealing to customers years away from their typical customers. Food is increasingly viewed as an entertainment choice, with teens spending 20 percent more of their dollars at restaurants than millennials were in 2003, according to a report from Piper Jaffray.Restaurant-equipment maker Middleby Corp, for instance, told investors that with smartphones and apps such as that of food-delivery service Seamless, Generation Z now expects all restaurants to offer delivery. That should lead to increased demand for its high-speed ovens to handle greater volumes, the company said. ""When I look at the next five to 10 years, Middleby is so well-positioned with this generation,"" the company's chief executive, Selim Bassoul, told analysts.

52,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Investors looking for stability and dividends have been pouring money into consumer staples stocks of late, ignoring warnings from Wall Street's analysts about pricey valuations for companies like Clorox (CLX.N) and Campbell Soup (CPB.N).Widely viewed as relatively safe bets in a world of macroeconomic worries, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like processed food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors in the past year, and fund flow data suggests investors expect more of the same.The number of new institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, of Campbell Soup in the last quarter has jumped 92 percent, according to research firm Morningstar. New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent.In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com.With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector. ""We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,"" said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies. ""The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,"" he said. The S&P consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data. Following the consumer staples index's 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P 500. ""On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar's impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods.But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for ""natural"" and organic food. The S&P 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago.

57,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Campbell Soup Co reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly adjusted profit due to a product recall as well as higher costs and lower sales of carrots, issues that the company expects will dent sales for the rest of the year.The world's largest soupmaker also gave a full-year adjusted earnings forecast that fell short of analysts' estimates, sending its shares tumbling 6.5 percent to a more than six-month low on Thursday.The company's problems in the quarter were centered around its Campbell Fresh business, which it has been boosting through acquisitions to cater to consumers' increasing preference for fresh and organic foods over processed foods.Campbell Fresh operating profit plunged 62 percent in the quarter and sales fell 5 percent, hurt by a recall of protein drinks in June, higher carrot costs and lower sales of carrots and carrot ingredients – all in the Bolthouse Farms unit.Campbell Soup said it harvested carrots – the best known products of Bolthouse – prematurely in spring.

Campbell Soup said it was improving oversight of the entire Campbell Fresh supply chain and that it had rectified the problems in its manufacturing equipment and process that led to protein drinks being spoiled and then recalled.The net loss attributable to Campbell Soup was $81 million in the quarter due to a $141 million pre-tax impairment charge related to Bolthouse.
