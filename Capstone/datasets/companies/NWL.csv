0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a rating of 'BBB'  to Newell Rubbermaid, Inc.'s (Newell) proposed notes offering. Newell will be  accessing the debt market today for five-year and 10-year notes with proceeds  used to partially refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions.  The new notes are expected to contain a Change of Control Repurchase Event. Upon  the occurrence of both a Change of Control and ratings below investment grade by  at least two of the three rating agencies and unless Newell exercises its right  to redeem the notes, the company will be required to make an offer to purchase  the notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus  accrued and unpaid interest. KEY RATING DRIVERS Improved Business Profile Since the last recession, and with the sale of its hardware and teach platforms  in late 2013, Newell has divested or exited $850 million (15% of 2009 revenues)  in product lines or businesses where commodities such as resin comprised a  significant percentage of costs and margins were low and or there was little  brand differentiation. Of the $850 million divested, approximately $500 million  was in resin intensive product lines which will reduce the company's exposure to  volatile commodity costs.  Concurrently, the company has undertaken several restructuring actions to reduce  fixed overhead and increase the variable portion of its cost structure. Newell's  organizational flexibility has increased with EBITDA margins continuing to  improve modestly near the 17% range, up sharply from the 12% seen in the  cyclical trough experienced in 2008. Fitch expects less pronounced variability  in margins and cash flows during cyclical peaks and troughs going forward  supporting an improved business profile incorporating cyclical elements. Benefits from Economic Cycle Fitch estimates that the portion of Newell's product lines facing cyclical  end-users or markets has declined modestly in the past two years to 60% with the  recent dispositions. Nonetheless, the portfolio should benefit from relative  economic stability in North America. Revenues generated from North America,  represent more than 73% of the company's $5.7 billion in revenues last year.  Fitch expects positive GDP growth in the U.S. in 2014 and 2015 and growth in  construction to benefit Newell's tools and commercial products segments  (approximately 30% of revenues) going forward. This provides support for  low-single digit organic growth rates despite the pressure in the office supply  superstore market, which is one of the end markets for Newell's writing segment. Strong FCF Despite Cyclicality Importantly, despite the fact that Newell has been restructuring for much of the  past decade that included several economic downturns, it has generated positive  free cash flow since at least 1996. Newell's FCF (operating cash flow less  capital expenditure and dividends) ranged from $250 million to $375 million  annually over the past four years and the LTM period despite significant cash  restructuring and pension payments. Fitch expects FCF to remain within this band  from 2014 through 2016.  Strong Credit Protection, Leverage Temporarily High The company has lowered its costs, simplified its capital structure and reduced  debt such that credit protection measures have improved markedly since 2008.  However, through the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2014, Newell's leverage of 2.3x is  temporarily higher than the 1.9x to 2.2x seen in the recent past with the recent  acquisition of Ignite Holdings, LLC for $308 million. It is likely to trend  modestly upward by year end with the bubba brands, inc. acquisition which closed  in Oct 2014 for $83 million. Much of the funding for the acquisitions, which are  in the beverage container space, will be with debt. Nonetheless, as both  acquisitions are accretive, FCF and leverage should improve in 2015 with a full  year of the attendant EBITDA and cash flows. Ample Liquidity, No Near-Term Maturities Liquidity is ample. The company has almost $133 million of cash and more than  $1.1 billion in credit facilities. The $1.1 billion is comprised of an $800  million revolving credit maturing in 2018 and a $350 million receivable facility  maturing in 2015. Fitch expects Newell to extend the receivable facility  maturity. With this debt issuance and refinancing of $250 million due in 2015  and $20.7 million in 2019, the next long term debt maturities are moderate with  a $350 million 2.05% note due in December 2017 and a $250 million 6.25% note due  in April 2018. Based on Fitch's expectation of low single-digit organic revenue  growth, small but accretive bolt-on acquisitions, and SG&A to revenues  maintained in the 25% range, EBITDA should improve moderately with leverage  remaining around 2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES What Could Trigger a Rating Action: --Continued good business momentum exemplified with low single-digit organic  growth, stable or increasing margins and FCF in or above recent ranges; --Operating with leverage near 2x on a sustained basis. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action or reinstatement of the Stable Outlook include: --A lengthy recession in the U.S. given that Newell's profitability and cash  flows have historically bounced back to normal levels within 12 - 18 months  after the end of previous economic downturns; --Intention of sustaining leverage well above 2x on a sustained basis. This  could be caused by a change in management's financial strategy or a sizeable  debt-financed acquisition. Fitch affirms Newell's ratings as follows:  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'; --$800 million revolving credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) for Newell Rubbermaid, Inc. (Newell) to 'BBB+' and affirmed  the short-term IDR and commercial paper rating at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The company substantially met Fitch's expectations for an upgrade, which were  based on a continuation of positive business trends, stable or increasing FCF  levels and leverage sustained near 2x.  Newell's operating environment from a macro-economic perspective remains fair to  modestly positive, particularly due to the company's still large reliance on the  U.S. market. Organic/core sales growth has been consistent in the low single  digit range over the past three years, and the company has had sequential  improvement in both operating and EBITDA margins by approximately 125 basis  points.  Fitch expects Newell's leverage to fall to 2.3x or less in the near term from  2.54x, a level that Fitch considers temporary due to three debt funded but  accretive acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter. FCF of $290 million  paralleled the previous three-year average of $287 million. Fitch anticipates  FCF (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures less dividends) to  improve meaningfully as incremental revenues contributed by acquisitions and  organic/core sales growth more than offset the potential pressure from  currencies.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS: --Newell maintains SG&A/Sales in the 25% range, and gross margins remain near  current levels.  --Mid-single digit organic growth and contributions from late 2014 acquisitions  are expected to fully offset currency pressure and lead to meaningful  improvement in FCF to the $350 million level by 2016 compared to an average of  $287 million over the past four years.  --Fitch sees Newell operating with leverage near 2X on a sustained basis. The  company has increased its share repurchase program. However, given strong FCF,  the company is expected to balance the mix of internal cash generation and  additional debt to maintain its leverage target.  --Newell's portfolio has a large cyclical component but macroeconomic factors in  its key U.S. market (approximately 70% of revenue) are expected to remain stable  to positive. While there is some macroeconomic slowdown in a few of its emerging  markets, the company still has a solid weighting towards the U.S. market whose  fundamentals have been improving.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Improved Business Profile Since the last recession, Newell has divested or exited more than $1 billion  (15% of 2009 revenues) in product lines or businesses sensitive to commodities  such as resin, generated low margins or minimal growth prospects, or provided  little brand differentiation. Of the amount divested, approximately $500 million  was in resin intensive product lines, which will reduce the company's exposure  to volatile commodity costs. Two of Newell's recent bolt-on acquisitions in the  on-the-go hydration bottles category that would have added roughly $130 million  to 2014's revenues on a pro forma basis have a higher resin component. However,  at less than 3% of 2014 revenues, their contribution to the overall portfolio is  modest. Concurrently, the company has undertaken several restructuring actions to reduce  fixed overhead and increase the variable portion of its cost structure. Newell's  organizational flexibility has increased with EBITDA margins expanded to over  17%, up sharply from the 12% seen in the cyclical trough experienced in 2008.  Since the portfolio is modestly less cyclical due to some of the business line  exits, Fitch expects less pronounced variability in margins and cash flows  during cyclical peaks and troughs going forward. Further, accretive acquisitions  should provide a modest boost to margins in 2015. Benefits from Economic Cycle Fitch estimates that the portion of Newell's product lines facing cyclical  end-users or markets such as the Tools segment, or higher end products in other  segments such as Calphalon cookware in Home Solutions, has declined modestly in  the past two years to approximately 60% with recent dispositions. Nonetheless,  the portfolio should benefit from relative economic stability in the United  States. The domestic market represented approximately 70% of the company's $5.7  billion in revenues last year. Fitch expects positive GDP growth in the U.S.  during 2015 and growth in construction to benefit Newell's tools and commercial  products segments (approximately 30% of revenues) going forward. This provides  support for low-single digit organic growth rates despite the pressure in the  office supply superstore market, which is one of the end markets for Newell's  writing segment. Strong FCF Despite Cyclicality Importantly, despite the fact that Newell has been restructuring for much of the  past decade that included several economic downturns, it has generated positive  free cash flow in every year since 1996. Newell's FCF ranged from $250 million  to $293 million annually over the past four years despite significant cash  restructuring and pension payments. Fitch expects FCF to improve to the $350  million range by 2016. Strong Credit Protection, Leverage Temporarily High The company has lowered its costs, simplified its capital structure and reduced  debt such that credit protection measures have improved markedly since 2008.  However, at year end, Newell's leverage of 2.5x is temporarily higher than the  1.9x to 2.2x seen in the recent past with three fourth quarter acquisitions  totaling $602 million. Much of the funding for the acquisitions, which are in  the beverage container space and baby and parenting space, was with debt.  Nonetheless, as the acquisitions are accretive, Fitch expects leverage to trend  downward to 2.3x or less by the end of 2015. Ample Liquidity, Moderate Maturities Liquidity is ample. The company had almost $200 million of cash, much of which  is offshore, and more than $1.1 billion in credit facilities. The $1.1 billion  is comprised of an $800 million revolving credit facility due December 2019 and  a $350 million receivable securitization facility maturing September 2015. There  is no long-term debt maturity in the next two years and $400 million due  annually from 2017 through 2019. To maintain its existing capital structure and  liquidity, Newell is likely to refinance upcoming debt maturities and renew and  extend its $350 securitization facility. RATING SENSITIVITIES What could trigger a positive rating action: --Given Newell's targeted leverage of 2.0x-2.2x and its product mix that is  susceptible to macroeconomic shifts, Fitch does not expect ratings upside in the  intermediate term. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Top line deceleration or margin deterioration, or a deep and lengthy downturn  of one or more major markets that causes FCF to decelerate meaningfully and  leads to sustaining leverage above 2.5x. Newell's profitability and cash flows  have historically bounced back to normal levels within 12 - 18 months after the  end of previous economic downturns; --Intention of sustaining leverage well above 2.5x caused by a change in  management's financial strategy or a sizeable debt-financed acquisition. Fitch has taken the following rating actions on Newell: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --$800 million revolving credit facility upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. --Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F2'; --Commercial paper affirmed at 'F2'.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed Newell Rubbermaid Inc.'s  (Newell) 'BBB+' long term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and F2 short term IDR on  Rating Watch Negative upon today's announcement that it will acquire Jarden  Corporation (Jarden) for about $20 billion including assumed debt.  The  acquisition will be funded by Newell shares and approximately $10 billion in new  debt issuances.  The new debt will be also be used to refinance Jarden's debt.   Fitch anticipates a two-notch downgrade to 'BBB-' upon completion of the  acquisition.  Newell will have meaningfully higher leverage for two to three  years and higher-than-normal execution risk in achieving $500 million in  synergies given Jarden's highly decentralized business profile. The transaction  is pending regulatory approvals and other customary conditions but is expected  to close in the first half of 2016.   A full list of rating actions follow at the end of the release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Improved Business Profile Fitch has previously cited Newell's effort to reshape its portfolio towards  businesses and categories with higher margins, less cyclicality or better  revenue growth prospects as a credit positive.  The Jarden acquisition provides  several of these attributes.  The acquisition will markedly reduce the cyclicality in Newell's portfolio.  The  company had several quarters of double-digit revenue decline with higher  leverage in the last recession, though metrics and performance bounced back  about a year later.   Increased Leverage Fitch expects initial pro forma leverage near 5.5x including combined debt  issued in fourth quarter 2015 to close several acquisitions, but leverage should  trend to under 3.5x by the end of 2018 assuming underlying trends remain strong  and targeted synergies are realized. The company is committed to using the  strong cash generation from the combined entity to reduce debt.  Newell has historically operated with leverage in the 2.5x range but has now  publicly committed to operate in the range of 3.0x-3.5x, which is essentially a  change in financial policy. The rationale for the previous the 2.5x level was  necessitated by the company's more cyclical profile.  The business profile will  improve markedly, but Fitch notes there would be little flexibility in the  ratings if gross leverage were managed at 3.5x and business trends came in worse  than expected.   Scale and Strong Free Cash Flow (FCF) Generation With $16 billion in pro forma revenues, the combined companies will have scale  with both vendors and customers, particularly in international markets. Jarden  is a cross-selling enterprise and could bring additional benefits by gaining new  distribution and vice versa.  Fitch views the increased diversification of the product portfolio as positive;  however, there is some concern related to the potential impact of SKU  proliferation given Jarden's 120+ brands (ranging from plastic cutlery to snow  skis) on Jarden's much lower cash conversion cycle and thus a negative impact on  Newell's working capital.  Nonetheless, both companies have had strong FCF margins in the 5%-6% range over  the past three years and the combined company should generate nearly $1 billion  in FCF annually, absent higher interest expense.    Vastly Different Operating Models Jarden is a highly decentralized and entrepreneurial sales enterprise which grew  via acquisitions from approximately $300 million in 2001 to a pro forma $10  billion with several large acquisitions this year. It is a holding company with  a relatively hands-off management style over the myriad of companies and  management teams purchased over the years.   Newell, on the other hand, operates under a centralized business model, raising  the possibility of a conflict in business approaches that could hinder  integration. As a result, integration activities to achieve synergies have to be  more thoughtful than most combinations to avoid meaningful disruption or loss of  business. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Newell on a standalone before the Jarden acquisition  include: --Newell maintains SG&A/Sales in the 25% range, and gross margins remain near  current levels.  --Mid-singledigit organic growth and contributions from late 2014 acquisitions  are expected to fully offset currency pressure and lead to meaningful  improvement in FCF to the $350 million to $400 million level in 2015-2016,  compared to an average of $287 million over the past four years. --Barring meaningful acquisitions and/or shareholder-friendly actions, Fitch  expects that the company can sustainably operate with leverage of 2x-2.3x and  should be in this range after 2016. Fitch's key assumptions for Newell on a combined basis with Jarden include: --Pro forma revenue around $16 billion in 2016 growing approximately 3% in 2017  and 5% in 2018, and 2018 EBITDA margin of 19.5% assuming synergies are realized --Initial leverage of near 5.5x, trending down to under 3.5x both on EBITDA  growth and debt reduction by 2018. --FCF generation of nearly $1 billion annually in 2017 and 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Fitch anticipates that any downgrade would likely be limited to two  notches once the acquisition closes. Future developments that may individually  or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: Marked and sustained declines in organic revenue to 1% or less in the near term  could be an early indication of internal issues with integration of the two  businesses. Organic sales have been particularly healthy for both companies and  in the 5% rate recently with sector organic growth rates in the 2% to 5% range.   Failure to achieve the targeted $500 million of synergies in a timely manner as  well as lack of significant debt reduction such that leverage of 3.5x or less is  not achieved by the end of 2018.   Positive:  Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near term.  However, positive ratings momentum could result from a commitment to operating  with leverage under 3x while maintaining strong business momentum as exemplified  by organic growth rates in the 2% to 5% range.   LIQUIDITY FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has placed the following ratings on Negative Watch. --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), 'BBB+'; --$800 million revolving credit facility, 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes, 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR, 'F2'; --Commercial paper, 'F2'.

9,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Newell Rubbermaid Inc (NWL.N), known for its food containers, agreed to buy Sunbeam and Coleman products maker Jarden Corp JAH.N for more than $15 billion in a deal that will give it more leverage with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).The deal announced on Monday comes amid growing pressure for retailers to hold down prices as they compete with online players such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).Reuters reported in October that Wal-Mart, which provides nearly 13 percent of Newell Rubbermaid's revenue, was asking suppliers to cut prices.The deal, while primarily aimed at accelerating growth, will make it easier for Newell to fend off demands for price cuts, Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, told Reuters.Based on 220.35 million Jarden shares outstanding as of Oct. 30, the deal has a value of $13.22 billion.However, Newell Rubbermaid said that on a fully diluted basis the offer was valued at $15.4 billion.The combined company, to be called Newell Brands, will have annual sales of $16 billion.Newell Brands' revenue from Wal-Mart is expected to be more than 2.6 times Newell Rubbermaid's 2014 revenue from the retailer, the Newell Rubbermaid said in an investor presentation, while revenue from Target Corp (TGT.N) stores is expected to be 1.9 times bigger. From Amazon, revenue is expected to grow by 1.8 times after the deal closes in the second quarter of 2016.The deal - which gives Newell Rubbermaid ownership of more than 120 Jarden brands, including Yankee Candle, Crock-Pot cookware and class rings maker Jostens Inc - will also significantly increase its U.S. distribution network.PREMIUM DISAPPPOINTS  Newell Brands will be led by Newell Rubbermaid Chief Executive Michael Polk. Martin Franklin, Jarden's founder and executive chairman, will be on the board.Jarden shareholders will receive $21 in cash and 0.862 Newell shares for each share held, implying a $60 per share offer. The offer is at a 24 percent premium to Jarden's closing stock price on Dec. 4, the day before reports emerged that the company was in talks to combine with Newell.Jarden's shares were up 1 percent at $53.30 in early afternoon trading, far below the offer price, while Newell's stock was down 10.5 percent at $40.51.Analysts attributed the gap between the offer price and  Jarden's shares to disappointment in the premium and the exclusion of Franklin from an executive role in the new company. Newell Rubbermaid shareholders will own about 55 percent of Newell Brands.The companies said they expected to realize cost savings of $500 million in the four years after the transaction closes.Goldman Sachs was lead financial adviser to Newell Rubbermaid, while Centerview Partners advised the board.Barclays was the lead financial adviser to Jarden, with UBS Investment Bank also advising.Jones Day and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett provided legal counsel to Newell Rubbermaid, while Greenberg Traurig LLP and Kane Kessler PC were legal advisers to Jarden.
