That pressured bond and stock holdings and forced investors to exit in favor of assets perceived as relatively safe, like the yen and U.S. and German government debt.* The concerns drove the price of protection against further drops on the S&P 500 to its highest in 13 months. The CBOE Volatility Index on Monday rose 16.5 percent to close at its highest since Dec. 28, 2012. The VIX is up 56 percent so far in 2014. * S&P 500 e-mini futures rose 11 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 70 points and Nasdaq 100 futures added 18 points.* Of the 250 companies in the S&P 500 that have recently reported earnings, 69.7 percent have beaten analysts' profit expectations, while 66.0 percent have exceeded revenue expectations, according to the latest data from Thomson Reuters. * Michael Kors Holdings Ltd reported a 77 percent jump in third-quarter profit as shoppers snapped up its handbags and accessories, sending its shares up more than 19 percent in premarket trading.* Bank shares could get a bump as U.S-traded shares of UBS  and Itaú Unibanco rallied in premarket trading. Itaú, Brazil's largest private-sector lender, reported record fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates. UBS swung to a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and announced higher dividends and bonuses.

2,"  Feb 4 International Paper Co, the largest North American producer of corrugated shipping boxes, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday due in part to write-downs and pension costs.The company spent more than $400 million in the fourth quarter to write down the value of its xpedx distribution business, which is being combined with Bain Capital-backed Unisource Worldwide Inc and is expected to be spun off as a publicly traded company this year.""These write downs will make xpedx a more competitive business going forward,"" IP Chief Executive John Faraci said in an interview.Overall, earnings nearly doubled, helped largely by strong sales to Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers.Online retail sales, a small but fast-growing part of the company's revenue base, jumped more than 10 percent in the period, helped by a near-record holiday season for Internet shopping. Amazon's fourth-quarter sales, for instance, jumped 20 percent. ""Demand in the fourth quarter was better than it was in the fourth quarter of 2012,"" Faraci said. ""We finished the year on a strong note.""For the quarter, the company posted net income of $436 million, or 98 cents per share, up from $235 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding the distribution and pension charges, which together cost roughly 36 cents per share, and other one-time items, the company posted profit of 83 cents per share.By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 87 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 2.5 percent to $7.25 billion from the year-ago period. Analysts expected revenue of $7.38 billion.Demand from China, Russia, Brazil and other emerging economies has cooled somewhat, Faraci said, prompting the company to focus closely on operations there.""We've got good businesses in all those markets,"" Faraci said. ""But we're running the businesses aggressively, managing pricing and being careful about reinvestment. There's plenty of capacity in those markets.""Shares of Memphis-based IP have gained nearly 9 percent in the past 52 weeks to close Monday at $46.06.",2014-02-04,IP,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 8:11am EST",UPDATE 1-International Paper profit below expectations on one-time charges,http://www.reuters.com//article/internationalpaper-results-idUSL2N0L90HV20140204?type=companyNews

6,"  (Adds Russia quotes from CEO, earnings comparisons, stock price)April 30 International Paper Co posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday due to rising North American demand for its corrugated shipping boxes.Box demand, which had been weak, improved during the first quarter and into April, showing signs that the economy is improving, Chief Executive Officer John Faraci said in an interview.""Box demand in April, looks like it's taken a turn both seasonally and in terms of economic activity, to the plus side,"" he said.IP, which has a large joint venture in Siberia, is closely monitoring the tension between Russia and the Ukraine, but so far has taken no action. The declining Russian ruble actually helps IP, as the company exports pulp from its Siberian mill to China, Faraci said. ""I think our Russian business is in good shape,"" Faraci said, adding that IP has financing contingencies in place should any sanctions affect its access to financing for its Siberian operations.IP, the largest North American producer of corrugated shipping boxes, reported a first-quarter net loss of $95 million, or 21 cents per share, compared with year-earlier net income of $318 million, or 71 cents per share.

9,"  June 29 Shares of International Paper may increase about 40 percent in the next 12 months on an improving global economy and use of its cash for stock buyback and higher dividend, Barron's said in its latest edition published on Sunday.The biggest North American producer of corrugated shipping boxes, based in Memphis, Tennessee, had seen its stock hurt from weak box demand earlier this year. It also took a $495 million charge in the first quarter for the closure of its Courtland, Alabama mill.IP Chief Executive Officer John Faraci has said the company's business is regaining its stride. Sales of its industrial-packaging business rose 3 percent year-over-year in April, the strongest such gain in over three years, Barron's said.""The combination of improving fundamentals and the return of cash to shareholders should translate into a higher stock valuation and outstanding total return for shareholders,"" the financial weekly said. Faraci told Barron's there is potential to increase IP's per-share dividend to between $1.80 to $2.00 from the current $1.40. Barron's cited some Wall Street analysts who projected IP shares rising in the next 12 months to $66 to $70 a share, as much as 43 percent above current levels.On Friday, IP stock closed at $49.05, which was at the high end of its 52-week range.
