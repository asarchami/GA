0,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Jan 13 If the stock market rally continues, last year's laggards may be this year's winners.Many of the sectors that could do well are late bloomers in the five-year bull run. They may not seem like obvious choices, yet are worthwhile if you're contrarian or slightly defensive.Assuming economic fundamentals and corporate earnings remain solid, it could be a decent year for stocks overall and even better for companies that were neglected in 2013.""I'm optimistic,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial in Chicago, who predicts three-percent GDP growth and the creation of up to three million jobs this year.""I haven't felt bullish in a long time,"" Swonk said at the annual economic outlook luncheon of the Executive Club of Chicago on Jan. 9.REAL ESTATE REBOUND A surge in institutional buying came in 2012 among homebuilding stocks. But last year, Wall Street moved on and real estate underperformed every sector in the S&P 500 except for basic materials, rising just 6 percent for the year through Jan. 10, according to Morningstar.This year could be different if the economy continues to create more jobs and spur long-term demand for all kinds of real estate, from single-family homes to commercial storage units. The most recent Case-Shiller Home Price index report showed U.S. home prices posting their strongest annualized gain in seven years. There's still much pent-up demand for homes and commercial properties. With mortgage rates expected to remain relatively low, the real estate sector still has some promise.Exchange-traded funds that invest in real estate investment trusts are a worthy consideration, especially if you are looking for extra yield.Consider the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF, which holds developers and property managers like Simon Property Group Inc, American Tower Corp and Public Storage . The fund was up only 1 percent last year, but yields nearly 4 percent. It charges 0.46 percent for annual expenses.MATERIALS MAKE SENSE  The materials sector was the most unloved group among the Standard & Poor's industry sectors last year, gaining less than 3 percent for the year through Jan. 10.  A highly-cyclical basket of metals, chemical, mining and paper stocks, this cadre tends to do best during mature economic cycles.But laggards can become leaders if U.S. economic growth - pegged at more than four percent in the 3rd quarter - continues.The Materials Select Sector SPDR owns stocks like Monsanto, Dow Chemical Co and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold. The SPDR charges 0.18 percent for annual management expenses and outperformed the materials sector as a whole, gaining 26 percent last year.ENERGY SURGE  Energy was another lackluster sector last year, returning a modest 10 percent for the year ending Jan. 10, compared to the best-performing technology group, which gained 56 percent. Improving demand for energy globally bodes well for companies that produce oil and natural gas, though.The Vanguard Energy ETF owns leading producers and service companies such as ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp  and Schlumberger NV. The fund charges 0.14 percent for annual expenses and returned 26 percent last year.UTILITIES STILL DEFENSIVE Companies that produce or distribute power, natural gas and water seldom light up any investor's radar screen during bull rallies. These high-dividend companies only become alluring when investors retreat from the most popular sector of the moment or there's widespread uncertainty.Since the bull rally will fizzle at some point, it's always good to have a fallback. Utilities fit that bill. Although these companies were firmly in the bottom tier last year, they could rebound if the market runs into trouble.Consider an ETF such as the iShares U.S. Utilities, which holds blue chips such as Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources and Exelon Corp. The fund returned almost 15 percent last year and yields about 3 percent with a 0.46 percent annual expense ratio.Feeling skittish about picking a lackluster U.S. sector and hoping it rebounds? A wiser choice would be to spread your portfolio among every sector through a broad-based world stock fund such as the iShares MSCI ACWI Index ETF, which holds the biggest stocks from around the world such as Apple , Nestle SA and General Electric Co. The fund rose 22 percent last year and charges 0.34 percent for annual expenses.",2014-01-13,SPG,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 2:52pm EST",COLUMN-Will last year's stock market laggards be 2014's winners?,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-wasik-laggards-idUSL2N0KN1K720140113?type=companyNews
1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the following credit  ratings for Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and Simon Property Group,  L.P. (collectively, Simon): Simon Property Group, Inc.  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A-'; --$75 million preferred stock to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. Simon Property Group, L.P.  --IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities to 'A' from 'A-'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes to 'A' from 'A-'. In addition, Fitch has assigned a rating of 'A' to Simon Property Group, L.P.'s  $300 million unsecured term loan due 2018, $600 million 2.2% notes due 2019, and  $600 million 3.75% notes due 2024.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade to 'A' has two elements: first, improvements in the quality of the  company's retail real estate portfolio and second, improved liquidity. Pro forma  for the spinoff of the strip center business and smaller enclosed malls to  Washington Prime Group, Inc. (the spinoff) in 2Q'2014, fixed-charge coverage is  appropriate for the 'A' rating level.  The company has robust pro forma  liquidity coverage, driven in part by a low expected adjusted funds from  operations (AFFO) payout ratio.  This enables Simon to build unrestricted cash,  enhancing the company's ability to fund future investments and/or repay  unsecured debt as needed.   Credit strengths include Simon's excellent access to capital and management  track record as a capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and  capital recycling).  Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but  expected to decline over the next 12-to-24 months.   Spinoff Improves Asset Quality In December 2013, Simon announced the spinoff of its strip center business and  its smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating  income (NOI) of approximately $10 million or less).  The spinoff entity,  Washington Prime Group, Inc. (WPG) will hold 54 strip centers and 44 mall  properties, and the spinoff is expected to occur in 2Q'2014.  The transaction  should improve SPG's asset quality as evidenced by higher mall occupancy (96.5%  pro forma compared with 96.1% at year-end) and higher tenant sales per square  foot ($616 pro forma compared with $582 at year-end).   The company's mall portfolio pro forma for the spinoff will include 178 mall  properties, 13 The Mills properties and 62 community/lifestyle centers.  Fitch  considers the portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum  Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia  Mall in King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL.  Simon has  consistently outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis  points (bps) above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to  2013, evidencing 'prime' asset quality. Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.1x in 2013 (3.2x in 4Q'2013) from 2.9x in both 2012  and 2011.  Releasing spreads averaged 14.9% in 2013 following 10.2% in 2012 and  9.5% in 2011.   Recently signed rents per square foot relative to 2014-2015 average expiring  rent per square foot indicate further upward momentum on releasing spreads pro  forma for the spinoff of WPG.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will  remain in the low-to-mid-3x range over the next 12-to-24 months, which is  consistent with an 'A' rating.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in  which the company's same-store NOI growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth  (its weakest reported periods), fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x  range, which would still be adequate for the 'A' rating.  Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures  and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and  preferred stock dividends. Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.   The company recently expanded its international investment base beyond its 28.9%  equity stake in Klepierre SA and ownership interests in international Premium  Outlets, by acquiring interests in five operating properties in the U.K.,  Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its joint venture with McArthurGlen.   Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated bond offering in October 2013  indicates the company's commitment to match-funding its European investments and  reducing currency risk.  Simon has been equally as opportunistic domestically.  In January 2014, Simon acquired its joint venture partners' remaining interest  in Kravco Simon Investments, a portfolio of 10 assets, including King of Prussia  Mall. Excellent Access to Capital The company has multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6 billion, aggregating  the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector.  In addition to the abovementioned  Euro-denominated bond offering, in January 2014 Simon Property Group, L.P.  issued $600 million of 2.20% five-year senior notes and $600 million of 3.75%  10-year senior notes.  During 2013, the company also closed or locked rates on  30 new secured loans totaling approximately $5.1 billion, of which SPG's share  is $3 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the new loans is 3.31% and  the weighted average term is 7.5 years. Strong Liquidity  Liquidity coverage is solid at 1.8x for the period Jan. 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015  pro forma.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by  liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under  revolving credit facilities, and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities pro forma for the repayment of the Sawgrass Mills mortgage, January  2014 unsecured bond offerings, and WPG spinoff.  Liquidity uses include pro  forma debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures.   If 90% of secured debt maturities through 2015 are refinanced, liquidity  coverage would improve to 2.6x.  In addition, near-term debt maturities are  manageable as approximately 5.7% of pro forma debt matures in 2014 followed by  10.5% in 2015, although 2016 pro forma debt maturities are somewhat heavy at  15.6%.   Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low (AFFO payout ratio, which was 59.2% in  2013.  Fitch calculates that the AFFO payout ratio will increase to 62.6% in  2014 pro forma for the spin-off of WPG, which should still provide strong  internally-generated liquidity of over $1.3 billion per year for future  investments and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool,  which now includes Sawgrass Mills, one of Simon's stronger assets.  Unencumbered  assets (pro forma Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.7x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating.  The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at  year-end 2013 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately $1  billion to fund the business and/or repay corporate unsecured debt. Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets.  This program should improve  asset quality going forward.  As of Dec. 31, 2013, the pipeline had a pro rata  net cost of approximately $1.3 billion and pro rata cost to complete of $853  million, representing 2.0% of gross assets, which is manageable especially  considering it can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow.  Cost to  complete is still below year-end 2007 levels of 2.3%. Leverage Expected to Decline Pro forma leverage is 5.5x compared with 5.2x in 4Q'2013 (5.6x for full year  2013).  The company reduced leverage from 6.0x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth  along with a build-up of cash via retained cash flow.  Fitch's base case  projects that leverage will approach 5x over the next 12 months and potentially  a high 4x by 2016 due to EBITDA growth, either of which would be appropriate for  the 'A' rating given SPG's improved asset quality.  Under Fitch's stress case,  leverage would remain around 5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A'  rating. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between Simon's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'A'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5.0x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x over the near- to medium-term.  The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality and that qualitative credit strengths will include excellent access to  capital and a strong management team.  The company has sufficient liquidity to  fund its active development pipeline. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.2x in 4Q'2013); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (pro forma leverage is  5.5x though expected to trend just below 5.0x over the next 12-to-24 months). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x.

",2014-03-12,SPG,"Wed Mar 12, 2014 | 5:39pm EDT",Fitch Upgrades Simon Property Group's IDR to 'A'; Outlook Stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-upgrades-simon-property-groups-idr-idUSFit69326520140312?type=companyNews
2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A' credit ratings to  the $900 million aggregate principal amount 3.375% coupon senior unsecured notes  due 2024 and $400 million aggregate principal amount 4.25% coupon senior  unsecured notes due 2044 issued by Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating  partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG, collectively, Simon).  The 2024 notes were priced at 99.804% of par to yield 3.398% to maturity, or 100  basis points over the benchmark treasury rate and the 2044 notes were priced at  99.409% of par to yield 4.285% to maturity, or 115 basis points over the  benchmark treasury rate. Simon intends to use the net proceeds of the offerings primarily to fund the  redemption of a series of outstanding notes of a subsidiary and the purchase of  any and all of five series of outstanding notes that are validly tendered upon  the terms and subject to the conditions in an offer to purchase dated September  3, 2014, and for general corporate purposes.  Fitch currently rates Simon as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock to 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --IDR 'A'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A' rating takes into account the strong quality of the company's retail  real estate portfolio, fixed-charge coverage appropriate for the 'A' rating  level, and robust pro forma liquidity coverage, driven in part by a low expected  adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio. Credit strengths also  include Simon's excellent access to capital and management track record as a  capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and capital recycling).  Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but expected to decline over the  next 12-to-24 months. Strong Asset Quality On May 28, 2014, Simon completed a spinoff of its strip center business and its  smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating income  (NOI) of approximately $10 million or less) to Washington Prime Group, Inc.  (NYSE: WPG; Fitch IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook). Simon's portfolio as of  June 30, 2014 included ownership or interests in 228 properties, comprised on  181 U.S. malls and premium outlets, 13 The Mills properties, 20 international  premium outlets and designer outlets, among other investments. Fitch considers  the portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum Shops at  Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia Mall in  King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis points (bps)  above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to 2013, evidencing  'prime' asset quality. Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.2x for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2014  (3.1x in 2Q'2014) from 2.9x in both 2012 and 2011. Releasing spreads were 20% in  2Q'2014 and 21.1% in 1Q'2014 after averaging 14.9% in 2013 and 10.2% in 2012.  Recently signed rents per square foot relative to average expiring rent per  square foot over the next several years indicate further upward momentum on  releasing spreads.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will remain in the low-to-mid-3x range  over the next 12-to-24 months, which is consistent with an 'A' rating. In a  stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company's same-store NOI  growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth (its weakest reported periods),  fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x range, which would still be  adequate for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities less recurring capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments,  divided by total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.  Over the past year, Simon expanded its international investment base beyond its  equity stake in Klepierre (28.9% as of June 30, 2014 and 19.3% pro forma for the  merger of Klepierre and Corio announced on July 29, 2014) and ownership  interests in international Premium Outlets, by acquiring interests in five  operating properties in the U.K., Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its  joint venture with McArthurGlen. Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated  bond offering in October 2013 indicates the company's commitment to  match-funding its European investments and reducing currency risk. Simon has  been opportunistic domestically. In January 2014, Simon acquired its joint  venture partners' remaining interest in Kravco Simon Investments, a portfolio of  10 assets, including King of Prussia Mall. Excellent Access to Capital The company has multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6 billion comprised of  a $4 billion facility and $2 billion supplementary facility, aggregating the  largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector. In April 2014, the company amended and  extended the $4 billion facility and reduced the rate to LIBOR plus 80 basis  points from LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In addition to the abovementioned Euro  and Dollar denominated bond offerings, over the past year the company also  closed or locked rates on 30 new secured loans totaling approximately $5.1  billion, of which SPG's share is $3 billion. The company also retained $1  billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on the WPG assets prior to the  spinoff. Adequate Liquidity Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.2x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31,  2016 pro forma for the bond offerings and tender offers. Fitch defines liquidity  coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity sources  include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities, and  projected retained cash flows from operating activities pro forma for the WPG  spinoff. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2016 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to  1.7x.  Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 66.4% in 2Q'2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in  2012. Fitch estimates that Simon generates approximately $1.2 billion in  internally-generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future  investments, development and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool.  Unencumbered assets (Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed  7% capitalization rate) covers unsecured debt by 2.4x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating. The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at June  30, 2014 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately $1 billion to  fund the business. Unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, net of readily  available cash, is 2.5x as of June 30, 2014.  Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of June 30, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.6 billion and pro rata cost to complete of $1.2 million,  representing 3.1% of gross assets, which is manageable especially considering it  can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow.  Leverage Expected to Decline Leverage as of June 30, 2014 was 5.6x compared with 5.6x for full year 2013. The  company reduced leverage from 6.0x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth along with a  build-up of cash via retained cash flow. Fitch's base case projects that  leverage will approach 5x over the next 12 months and potentially a high 4x by  2016 due to EBITDA growth, either of which would be appropriate for the 'A'  rating given SPG's improved asset quality. Under Fitch's stress case, leverage  would remain around 5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A' rating.  Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between SPG's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' Criteria Report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  SPG's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by SPG and thus have readily triggered loss absorption provisions in a going  concern. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5.0x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x over the near to medium term. The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality, that the company will have sufficient liquidity to fund its active  development pipeline and that qualitative credit strengths will include  excellent access to capital and a strong management team. On June 19, 2014,  Simon announced that Andrew Juster will become Chief Financial Officer in early  2015, succeeding retiring CFO Stephen Sterrett. Mr. Juster has served as Simon's  Treasurer since 2000. Fitch does not expect a change in Simon's financial  policies as a result of this announcement.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.1x in 2Q'2014); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.6x  though expected to trend just below 5.0x over the next 12-to-24 months). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x.

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a short-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'F1' to Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating  partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG or the company).  In  addition, Fitch has assigned short-term ratings of 'F1' to Simon Property Group,  L.P. and Simon CP 2's $500 million commercial paper (CP) note program.  Simon  Property Group, L.P. and Simon CP 2 (together Simon Property Group) are the  issuers of the CP paper, which has a maximum term of 379 days for the U.S. notes  (USCP notes) and 183 days for the Euro notes (ECP notes).  Simon Property Group,  L.P. guarantees the obligations of Simon CP 2.    On Oct. 7, 2014 SPG announced that under its global unsecured CP note program,  Simon Property Group may issue unsecured CP notes denominated in U.S. dollars,  Euros, and other currencies up to a maximum amount of $500 million or the  non-U.S. equivalent.  The CP program has been utilized by both issuers, and the  CP notes rank pari passu with all of the operating partnership's other senior  unsecured indebtedness, all of which is rated 'A' by Fitch.   The time horizon of investment-grade short-term ratings does not explicitly  relate to the 13 months immediately following a given date.  Instead, it relates  to the continual liquidity profile of the rated entity that would be expected to  endure over the time horizon of the long-term IDR. Corporate CP issuers need sufficient liquidity reserves (including liquid  assets, committed bank facilities, or liquidity from a parent or third party) to  withstand two types of liquidity challenges: systemic risk and credit, or event  risk.  Fitch's initial view on the short-term IDR generally considers the  issuer's long-term ratings based on the mapping in the Rating Correspondence  Table in Fitch's 'Short-Term Ratings Criteria for Non-Financial Corporates,'  dated Aug. 5, 2013.  In this table, a long-term IDR of 'A' corresponds with a  short-term IDR of 'F1'. The global unsecured CP note program is a credit positive in that it establishes  another source of unsecured debt capital -- albeit not a committed long-term  source -- for the company and may allow for borrowing arbitrage opportunities.  As of June 30, 2014, the company's $4 billion credit facility, which has an  initial maturity of June 30, 2018, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.8%.  The company's $2 billion supplemental credit facility, which has an initial  maturity of June 30, 2016, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.95%.  Conversely, recent U.S. CP rates for comparably rated issuers are 0.21% for 3  months and 0.24% for nine months and Euro CP rates for comparably rated issuers  range from 0.22% (three months) to 0.52% (nine months).  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's long-term IDR of 'A' takes into account the strong quality of the  company's retail real estate portfolio, fixed charge coverage appropriate for  the 'A' rating level, and robust pro forma liquidity coverage, driven in part by  a low expected adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio. Credit  strengths also include SPG's excellent access to capital and management track  record as a capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and capital  recycling). Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but expected to  decline over the next 12-to-24 months.  Strong Asset Quality On May 28, 2014, SPG completed a spinoff of its strip center business and its  smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating income   of approximately $10 million or less) to Washington Prime Group, Inc.  (NYSE: WPG; Fitch IDR of 'BBB-'; Stable Outlook). SPG's portfolio as of June 30,  2014 included ownership or interests in 228 properties, consisting of 181 U.S.  malls and premium outlets, 13 The Mills properties, and 20 international premium  outlets and designer outlets, among other investments. Fitch considers the  portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum Shops at  Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia Mall in  King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. SPG has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis points (bps)  above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to 2013, evidencing  'prime' asset quality.  Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.2x for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2014  (3.1x in 2Q'14) from 2.9x in both 2012 and 2011. Releasing spreads were 20% in  2Q'14 and 21.1% in 1Q'14 after averaging 14.9% in 2013 and 10.2% in 2012.  Recently signed rents per square foot relative to average expiring rent per  square foot over the next several years indicate further upward momentum on  releasing spreads.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will remain in the low- to mid-3x  range over the next 12-to-24 months, which is consistent with an 'A' rating. In  a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company's same-store NOI  growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth (its weakest reported periods),  fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x range, which would still be  adequate for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities less recurring capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments,  divided by total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.  Over the past year, Simon expanded its international investment base beyond its  equity stake in Klepierre (28.9% as of June 30, 2014 and 19.3% pro forma for the  merger of Klepierre and Corio announced on July 29, 2014) and ownership  interests in international Premium Outlets, by acquiring interests in five  operating properties in the U.K., Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its  joint venture with McArthurGlen. Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated  bond offering in October 2013 indicates the company's commitment to  match-funding its European investments and reducing currency risk.  SPG has been opportunistic domestically. In January 2014, the company acquired  its joint venture partners' remaining interest in Kravco Simon Investments, a  portfolio of 10 assets, including King of Prussia Mall.  Excellent Access to Capital In addition to the newly established CP program, the company has multicurrency  credit facilities totaling $6 billion comprising a $4 billion facility and $2  billion supplementary facility, aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S.  REIT sector. In April 2014, the company amended and extended the $4 billion  facility and reduced the rate to LIBOR plus 80 bps from LIBOR plus 95 bps. In  addition to the abovementioned Euro and U.S. dollar denominated bond offerings,  over the past year the company also closed or locked rates on 30 new secured  loans totaling approximately $5.1 billion, of which SPG's share is $3 billion.  The company also retained $1 billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on  the WPG assets prior to the spinoff. Adequate Liquidity Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.2x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31,  2016 pro forma both bond offerings and tender offers completed in September.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities pro  forma for the WPG spinoff. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities,  projected recurring capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of  secured debt maturities through 2016 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would  improve to 1.7x. Liquidity is enhanced by SPG's low AFFO payout ratio, which was 66.4% in 2Q'14  compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in 2012. Fitch estimates that the company  generates approximately $1.2 billion in internally generated liquidity per year,  which can be deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool.  Unencumbered assets (Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed  7% capitalization rate) covers unsecured debt by 2.4x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating. The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at June  30, 2014 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately billion to  fund the business. Unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt, net of readily  available cash, was 2.5x as of June 30, 2014. Active Development Pipeline SPG's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of June 30, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.6 billion and projected cost to complete of $1.2 million,  representing 3.1% of gross assets, which is manageable especially considering it  can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow. Leverage Expected to Decline Leverage (net debt as of June 30, 2014 divided by TTM recurring operating  EBITDA) was 5.1x compared with 5.6x for full-year 2013. The company reduced  leverage from 6x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth along with a build-up of cash via  retained flow. Fitch's base case projects that leverage will remain around 5x  over the next 12 months and could decline below 5x by 2016 due to EBITDA growth,  either of which would be appropriate for the 'A' rating given SPG's improved  asset quality. Under Fitch's stress case, leverage would increase to between 5x  and 5.5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A' rating. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between SPG's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' criteria report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  SPG's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by SPG and thus have readily triggered loss absorption provisions in a going  concern.  Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3x over the near- to medium-term. The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality, that the company will have sufficient liquidity to fund its active  development pipeline and that qualitative credit strengths will include  excellent access to capital and a strong management team. On June 19, 2014, SPG  announced that Andrew Juster would become Chief Financial Officer in early 2015,  succeeding retiring CFO Stephen Sterrett. Mr. Juster has served as Simon's  Treasurer since 2000. Fitch does not expect a change in the company's financial  policies as a result of this announcement. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.1x in 2Q'14); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.1x at  June 30, 2014). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x. Fitch currently rates the company as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'; --CP notes 'F1'. Simon CP 2 --CP notes 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

6,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 12 Sears Holding Corp  made a huge splash last week when it said it might spin off hundreds of its stores as a real estate investment trust. But the struggling retailer's move to tap into a surging commercial property market comes as the sector looks increasingly rich.The temptation is understandable. REITs, those formed around retail properties in particular, have been one of the post-financial crisis stars. The reason: juicy dividends. And, of course, six years of low-interest rate policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which have pushed bond yields to historic lows.The S&P 1500 Retail REIT industry group, which includes the likes of mall and shopping plaza owners Simon Property Group Inc., Macerich Co. and National Retail Properties Inc., delivered a total return of nearly 500 percent since March 2009. That's more than double the return of the wider stock market.This year alone, the benchmark MSCI U.S. REIT index has surged 26 percent compared with 10 percent for the S&P 500.Yet, just as Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert considers diving into this game, fund managers and analysts in the sector worry that the best days for publicly traded REITs are now behind them because they are too expensive.""We're turning over rocks for opportunities, but it's clear that REITs are not cheap,"" said Joel Beam, manager of the Forward Income Opportunity fund.Beam is not alone. The average equity income fund now holds 7.8 percent of its portfolio in REITs, according to Lipper, the same percentage as in 2009. FED THREAT A top risk for the group is the Fed, which is widely expected to start raising interest rates next year for the first time since the recession.Investors have been drawn into REITs by dividend yields that now average 3.5 percent, more than a full percentage point above the yield on safer assets such as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note and roughly a half-point higher than the yield on investment grade corporate bonds.As such, shares of REITs are highly sensitive to any hint that interest rates could rise, a prospect that would make bonds more attractive by comparison. In 2013, for instance, the S&P 1500 Retail REIT industry group fell 21 percent during the three months of the so-called ""Taper Tantrum,"" which erupted following hints by the Fed that it would end its bond-buying stimulus program - and pivot toward a tighter monetary policy.REITs have since recovered to record highs. But analysts say that rich valuations, at a time when the expanding U.S. economy should send interest rates higher, mean that another significant drop could be in the making.The group is also substantially more levered than most other stocks. The average long-term debt-to-equity multiple among the 22 members of the S&P retail REIT industry group is 143.2 compared with just 94.7 for the S&P 500 as a whole.Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for new or refinanced debt, a factor that will further impede profit growth. To be sure, some analysts say that certain REITs could do well, even in a rising interest rate environment - largely because they could pass on  costs to their tenants in the form of rising rents.A lack of new supply in the REIT market, as well as concerns that the European Union economy is in recession, should keep a floor on any price declines if rates were to rise, said Alexander Goldfarb, a senior REIT analyst at Sandler O'Neill.PRICEY But even Goldfarb sees valuations stretched for several of the companies he covers.Added Todd Lukasik, a Morningstar analyst: ""REITs look to be on average about 10 percent over-valued...what we've seen recently is that on days when you have a big movement upward in the yield of the 10 year Treasury, you get a pretty noticeable decline in REIT stock prices.""Income fund managers, too, say that they are put off by high valuations in the sector.REITs now trade at an average of 23 times cash flow, Beam, the Forward fund manager said, compared with their historical average of 16 times. Should interest rates rise, he added, it will be ""a little bit scary.""        (Reporting by David Randall.

7,"  * Magnus Peterson found guilty on eight counts* Could be jailed for up to 10 years; sentencing on Jan. 23* Investors lost $536 million   (Adds quotes, background, detail)By Kirstin Ridley and Nishant KumarLONDON, Jan 19 The boss of collapsed UK hedge fund Weavering could be jailed for up to 10 years after being found guilty of fraud by a London court on Monday, giving Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) one of its most senior financial scalps since the credit crunch.Magnus Peterson, 51, was found guilty of eight counts of fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading and was acquitted on seven other charges after a 12-week trial that delved into the complex world of hedge fund investing. The fraud cost investors $536 million.""Whilst Mr Peterson knew full well what the true value of the fund was when it collapsed, his investors did not. To them, the extensive losses they suffered came as a complete shock,"" the SFO said in a statement.Peterson has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Jan. 23, the SFO said. Swedish-born Peterson, a charismatic former interest rate and foreign exchange trader, pitched his flagship fund to institutions and wealthy individuals as a low-risk investment offering stable returns.But he was found guilty of covering up rising trading losses by weaving a web of deception that unravelled in March 2009, six months after the bankruptcy of Wall Street's Lehman Brothers sent panic through global markets and prompted investors to clamour for redemptions. Weavering could not pay up.The SFO, which investigated trades between the Weavering Macro Fund and Weavering Capital Fund (WCF), an offshore company owned by Peterson, said the fund manager artificially inflated his fund's investment performance and misled investors into putting $780 million into the Macro Fund over a six-year period.He was found not guilty of one count of fraudulent trading and six counts of fraud by false representation. ""The verdicts returned by the jury clearly show that they rejected much of the SFO's case, but we will need to consider the position very carefully,"" said Matthew Frankland, Peterson's lawyer. ""Regrettably, winning much of the case is of no comfort to Mr Peterson in all the circumstances.""SHAM TRADES  The SFO said the fund failed because its net asset value had been grossly inflated by sham over-the-counter interest rate swaps with WCF.However, British Virgin Islands-based WCF really only existed on paper, prosecutors said. It had small stakes in ventures such as a failed stage musical. By 2003 it had no external investors, no administrator and no auditors.When the Macro fund collapsed, the bulk of its assets were found to be $600 million of interest rate swaps with WCF as the counterparty, alongside $260 million of unpaid redemptions.Prosecutors said the swaps were designed solely to flatter the Macro fund's paper accounts, allowing it to attract more investors and Peterson to pay himself millions in performance fees. The swaps, however, were worthless.Peterson paid himself 5.8 million pounds ($8.8 million) between 2005 and 2009, the SFO statement said.The Weavering business was a family affair. Peterson's wife Amanda was a director of Mayfair-based Weavering Capital UK (WCUK), which acted as investment adviser to WCF and the Macro fund. His stepfather and brother were Weavering Macro Fund directors.Peterson's conviction is a welcome victory for the SFO, which was lambasted for dropping its investigation in 2011, citing no reasonable prospect of conviction. The case was re-opened under new head David Green shortly after liquidators won a civil suit against Peterson.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 09 (Fitch) The proposal by Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG) to acquire The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC, Macerich) for $91.00 per share  in cash and SPG shares, if consummated as proposed, would likely have negative  credit implications for SPG according to Fitch Ratings.  The proposed  transaction would increase SPG's leverage materially above the 5.1x level as of  Dec. 31, 2014 while also lowering the company's unencumbered asset coverage of  unsecured debt.  If an agreement is reached, Fitch would review revised  transaction terms, if any, and the company's ratings and Outlook.  Currently,  the company's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A' with a Stable  Outlook.   PROPOSED TRANSACTION  On March 9, 2015, SPG announced a proposed transaction to acquire MAC for  approximately $22.4 billion, including the assumption of MAC's approximately  $6.4 billion of debt outstanding, including MAC's pro rata share of mortgage  debt from unconsolidated entities.  SPG also reached an agreement in principle  to sell certain Macerich assets to General Growth Properties, Inc. (NYSE: GGP,  Not Rated) in connection with the closing of the acquisition. The GGP sale would  not be a condition to closing the transaction.  The proposed agreement between  SPG and GGP removes a potential bidder for MAC, thereby increasing the  probability of SPG winning MAC. However, hostile public-to-public REIT  transactions oftentimes pose challenges to the bidder by the target.  POTENTIAL CREDIT IMPLICATIONS Credit concerns inherent in the proposed transaction include a weakening of the  balance sheet as measured by net debt-to-EBITDA. Fitch's expectation of leverage  sustaining above 5.5x would be one factor inconsistent with the 'A' IDR.   Moreover, the company's unencumbered assets (based on a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) to net unsecured debt ratio of 2.6x would weaken if the MAC  transaction closes as proposed.  If consummated, Fitch anticipates that SPG  would maintain adequate liquidity and excellent access to capital. The company's  liquidity coverage ratio is 1.4x for the period Jan. 31, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016,  driven by an industry-leading revolving credit facility capacity, which will  enable the company to fund upcoming debt maturities and capital expenditures,  along with $1.3 billion of expected development costs.  Moreover, SPG's adjusted  funds from operations payout ratio was 64% during 2014; based on the current  payout ratio, the company retains over $1 billion annually in organic cash flow.  Credit positives inherent in the proposed transaction include the potential to  acquire a high-quality mall portfolio as measured by MAC's strong sales per  square foot and occupancy ratios.  Nevertheless, SPG has outperformed MAC on  both measures, with SPG's sales per square foot at $619 as of Dec. 31, 2014  compared with $587 - both high levels compared to the mall industry at large.   SPG's occupancy in its U.S. malls and Premium Outlets was 97.1% as of Dec. 31,  2014 compared with MAC at 95.8%.   SPG's average same-store net operating income (NOI) has outperformed MAC by 110  basis points from 2008-2014, which speaks to Simon's stronger property level  performance, while SPG also has materially lower general and administrative  costs as a percentage of total revenues when compared with MAC.

15,"  * Macerich says offer ""substantially undervalues"" company* Sets poison pill trigger at 10 pct* Changes board structure* Shares fall as much as 5 pct   (Adds Breakingviews link, updates stock prices)By Sagarika JaisinghaniMarch 17 Macerich Co, the third-largest U.S. shopping mall owner, rejected a $14.39 billion unsolicited offer from larger rival Simon Property Group Inc, saying the proposal ""substantially undervalues"" the company.Macerich also said on Tuesday it adopted a poison pill, or a shareholder rights plan, with a 10 percent trigger and changed its board structure to thwart a hostile takeover.Shares of Macerich, which received the $91 per share offer earlier this month, fell as much as 5 percent to $90.29 in early trading. Including debt, the offer was valued at $22.4 billion. ""Macerich's rejection is based on a rosy view of its future prospects,"" Simon Property Chief Executive David Simon said in a statement, calling the rejection an ""extreme, scorched-earth response"".Macerich's directors will now be divided into three classes and their term will be three years, the company said, adding that it would review this structure in 2016.Macerich is incorporated in Maryland, which allows a company's board to take steps to ward off a hostile takeover without having to seek shareholder approval. The company said it rejected the offer partly due to antitrust concerns and its inability to evaluate Simon Property's ""claims regarding its margins.""""Simon's next step is likely to be to raise its offer,"" Cowen & Company analyst James Sullivan wrote in a note.Macerich has been selling off underperforming malls to focus on redeveloping its more lucrative malls. It plans to spend $400 million-$500 million annually on such actions over the next five years.The deal would have helped Simon Property boost its portfolio of high-end malls, which are performing better than those with mid-range brands, and expand in California and other western states. High-end malls generally house expensive brands such as Apple Inc and Macy Inc's Bloomingdale's.Macerich said its rights plan, which came into effect immediately, would expire on the date of its 2016 annual investor meeting.Shareholders of record as on March 30 will have the right to buy one preferred share for each common share held.Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co and JP Morgan Securities LLC are Macerich's financial advisers, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Goodwin Procter LLP and Venable LLP are its legal advisers.Macerich's shares closed down 3.5 percent at $91.60 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Simon Property fell 0.5 percent to $186.13.(Additional reporting by Rohit T.K. and Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)",2015-03-17,SPG,"Tue Mar 17, 2015 | 4:30pm EDT","UPDATE 4-Macerich rejects Simon Property offer, adopts poison pill",http://www.reuters.com//article/macerich-ma-simon-prop-grp-idUSL3N0WJ49220150317?type=companyNews

18,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Whether a ploy to drive bidding higher or an effective roadblock, Macerich Co.'s (MAC.N) moves this week to ward off Simon Property Group Inc's (SPG.N) $14.39 billion hostile takeover gives the target company a stronger defense against a formidable adversary.Macerich's adoption of a staggered board and a poison pill, announced on Tuesday, makes Simon Property's bid to take over the third-largest U.S. shopping mall owner more difficult.The poison pill will grant shareholders the right to buy Macerich shares at half their market value if any person or group acquires 10 percent or more of the company. Staggered boards are also considered a powerful anti-takeover defense.With Macerich's moves, management has greater control over the real estate investment trust, making it tough for Simon Property to force a resolution, analysts say.""Unless Macerich wants to do a deal, there won't be a deal,"" said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill + Partners LP in New York. Historically, hostile takeovers of REITs are very difficult, he said.Macerich's stock price suggests traders expect a sweetened bid. Shares hit a high of $94.18 on Thursday, up 3.5 percent from the offer price of $91 a share. The stock has climbed 35 percent since the day before Nov. 19, when Simon Property announced it had accumulated a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich. The governance changes Macerich implemented this week aim to give it more breathing room when it comes to assessing its options, the company's board said on Tuesday.The anti-takeover measures are not as unfriendly to shareholders as they may seem, Todd Thomas, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note, adding that the company could hold out for a higher offer.Simon Property's chairman and chief executive, David Simon,  is considered a savvy foe. Investors give Simon credit for being disciplined in pursuing acquisitions that make sense, while dropping a deal that is not valuable, said Paul Adornato, senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. For example, Simon Property withdrew a $4.5 billion offer for the UK's Capital Shopping Centers in 2011 when the company refused to share information.""David Simon has shown discipline over the years in walking away when either the numbers don't make sense or the deal is dead,"" Adornato said.Sandler O'Neill's Goldfarb said Simon Property's offer of $91 a share is ""pretty healthy,"" though he recognized it could go higher. ""Obviously people don't lead with their 'best-and-final,' but the number that they've put out on our valuation is close to our forecast,"" Goldfarb said.If Simon Property's offer were to rise to $115 a share, it would drive a real estate measure known as the ""cap rate"" down to 4.0 percent, a high price but not too high, Adornato said.

19,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK, March 19  NEW YORK, March 19 Whether a ploy to drive bidding higher or an effective roadblock, Macerich Co.'s  moves this week to ward off Simon Property Group Inc's  $14.39 billion hostile takeover gives the target company a stronger defense against a formidable adversary.Macerich's adoption of a staggered board and a poison pill, announced on Tuesday, makes Simon Property's bid to take over the third-largest U.S. shopping mall owner more difficult.The poison pill will grant shareholders the right to buy Macerich shares at half their market value if any person or group acquires 10 percent or more of the company. Staggered boards are also considered a powerful anti-takeover defense.With Macerich's moves, management has greater control over the real estate investment trust, making it tough for Simon Property to force a resolution, analysts say.""Unless Macerich wants to do a deal, there won't be a deal,"" said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill + Partners LP in New York. Historically, hostile takeovers of REITs are very difficult, he said. Macerich's stock price suggests traders expect a sweetened bid. Shares hit a high of $94.18 on Thursday, up 3.5 percent from the offer price of $91 a share. The stock has climbed 35 percent since the day before Nov. 19, when Simon Property announced it had accumulated a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich.The governance changes Macerich implemented this week aim to give it more breathing room when it comes to assessing its options, the company's board said on Tuesday.The anti-takeover measures are not as unfriendly to shareholders as they may seem, Todd Thomas, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note, adding that the company could hold out for a higher offer. Simon Property's chairman and chief executive, David Simon,  is considered a savvy foe. Investors give Simon credit for being disciplined in pursuing acquisitions that make sense, while dropping a deal that is not valuable, said Paul Adornato, senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York.For example, Simon Property withdrew a $4.5 billion offer for the UK's Capital Shopping Centers in 2011 when the company refused to share information. ""David Simon has shown discipline over the years in walking away when either the numbers don't make sense or the deal is dead,"" Adornato said.Sandler O'Neill's Goldfarb said Simon Property's offer of $91 a share is ""pretty healthy,"" though he recognized it could go higher.""Obviously people don't lead with their 'best-and-final,' but the number that they've put out on our valuation is close to our forecast,"" Goldfarb said.If Simon Property's offer were to rise to $115 a share, it would drive a real estate measure known as the ""cap rate"" down to 4.0 percent, a high price but not too high, Adornato said. A cap rate is determined by dividing a property's net operating income with an asset's price. Falling cap rates indicate rising values.""While that might seem excessive, one has to keep in mind there's a lot of growth that's not yet in Macerich's numbers,"" Adornato said, referring to Macerich's acquisition of New York properties Kings Plaza in Brooklyn and Green Acres on Long Island, where a turnaround strategy has just begun.

Macerich shares fell 8.4 percent in early trading, suggesting that investors doubt the deal would go through, given the company's strong defensive actions this week, including a change in its board structure.""I guess people are saying Macerich won't bite,"" Sandler O'Neill & Partners analyst Alexander Goldfarb said. ""Macerich's history has been very independent and marching to their own beat and I don't know if this is enough to compel them.""The new offer values Macerich at $15.10 billion, based on 158.16 million shares outstanding as of Feb. 20. Simon Property said it would not nominate directors to Macerich's board ""or otherwise prolong this process.""The company said all other terms of its offer were unchanged, including a ratio of 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in Simon Property common stock.Macerich said it would review the new offer. ""The 'this is the best and final offer' wording is never going to be viewed favorably by the market,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Ki Bin Kim said.Simon Property had disclosed a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich in November, seen by many at the time as a precursor to a bid.Macerich had said the earlier offer ""undervalued"" the company. Simon Property, however, has maintained that its offer was higher than the $71 per share deal that Macerich struck with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in November for a sale of 10.9 percent stake in return for full ownership of a joint venture.Macerich said on Thursday that the November deal was not representative of its value.""We believe this type of 'apples and oranges' comparison is just a tactic Simon is employing as part of its effort to force the sale of Macerich at the lowest possible price,"" Macerich told Reuters.Macerich shares were down 7 percent at $87, giving up nearly all the gains made since March 6, a day before Simon Property made its first offer.

23,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Simon Property Group Inc's (SPG.N) failed bid to buy U.S. upscale shopping center operator Macerich Co (MAC.N) is unlikely to crush either company's stock price for a simple reason: No one is building any more ""Class A"" malls.Macerich late on Tuesday rejected Simon's sweetened cash-and-stock offer, which was valued at $95.50 a share, or $23.2 billion including debt. Macerich Chief Executive Officer Arthur Coppola said in a statement that the revised bid did not reflect the full value of the company, the third-largest U.S. real estate investment trust. Analysts suggested Coppola had a point because upscale malls such as Macerich's Tysons Corner Center in northern Virginia are unique assets that cannot be built as easily as hotels, apartment or office buildings.Simon's bid and Macerich's rejection underpin the value of Class A malls, said Cowen and Co analyst James Sullivan. ""They only get sold when a seller chooses to sell them,"" he said. ""Mall development just isn't happening today. That makes the ones that are in place increasingly valuable."" The uniqueness of upscale malls gives them ""fortress-like"" characteristics, as Sullivan and other REIT analysts point out. ""As we say in the real estate business, malls are not fungible,"" Sullivan said. ""You can't just turn around and build another one in the same market.""The only U.S. regional mall under construction is the International Market Place in Hawaii, a property controlled by Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N).Macerich shares were down 5.9 percent at $79.34 in afternoon trading, while Simon rose 1.3 percent to $198.24.  MALLS VS. SHARES Upscale mall valuations are generally the highest in the real estate industry, but their operators' shares still trade at a discount to the individual assets, Sullivan said.General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the second-largest U.S. REIT behind Simon, sold a stake in its Ala Moana shopping center in Hawaii to Australian pension fund AustralianSuper in March at a 3.7 cap rate, Sullivan said.A cap rate is the net operating income of a property divided by its price. The lower this measure is, the higher the asset's price.  While Sullivan said Ala Moana was an exceptional asset, its cap rate suggested the better mall REITs have lower values than what their assets are selling for in the private market.To reflect a 4.0 cap rate, Macerich shares would have to rise to $115 from about $80 today, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato. He said in an interview two weeks ago that Simon's first bid of $91 a share on March 9 equated to a 4.8 cap rate.Sandler O'Neil + Partners analyst Alex Goldfarb said Simon CEO David Simon would not let Macerich's rejection of his bid discourage him. The company has bid for and was rejected by Taubman Centers and General Growth in the past.Sandler O'Neil said it expected to receive or intended to seek compensation from both Macerich and Simon for investment banking services in the next three months. ""David is extremely shrewd and has run an incredible company,"" Goldfarb said. ""They'll certainly find other investment opportunities.""

32,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK With Sears Holdings Corp's second joint venture announcement this month on Monday, one question left to be answered is how much of the struggling mall anchor's property will be devoted to new, and potentially lucrative, retail space.Sears and Simon Property Group Inc said they would form a 50-50 joint venture to boost the value of 10 Sears properties at Simon-managed malls, similar to its April 1 announcement with mall operator General Growth Properties.As part of the agreement, up to half of the space Sears sold will be available for redevelopment for new tenants who will pay higher rents. The deal is part of the retailer's effort to get value out of its extensive land holdings. ""The way they struck that deal made a lot of sense to us,"" Daniel Busch, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, California. ""Sears can work with these partners, with the mall landlords, to come up with a better use for their space.""

The option to redevelop parts of the Sears footprint in the malls was a major driver of why General Growth and Simon Property agreed to the joint ventures, Busch said. Sears does not need as much space as it has and it can capitalize on  releasing space, he said. The Sears properties sold in the joint ventures is considered A Class because of their location, the quality of tenants and little, if any, vacancy.

Plans to form a REIT were first floated in November.The GGP transaction suggested Sears is more motivated to sell off assets. Busch said both GGP and Simon Property probably cherry-picked Sears holdings, however, leaving the question of how much value is left in the remaining properties.

33,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK, April 13  NEW YORK, April 13 With Sears Holdings Corp  's second joint venture announcement this month on Monday, one question left to be answered is how much of the struggling mall anchor's property will be devoted to new, and potentially lucrative, retail space.Sears and Simon Property Group Inc said they would form a 50-50 joint venture to boost the value of 10 Sears properties at Simon-managed malls, similar to its April 1 announcement with mall operator General Growth Properties .As part of the agreement, up to half of the space Sears sold will be available for redevelopment for new tenants who will pay higher rents. The deal is part of the retailer's effort to get value out of its extensive land holdings.""The way they struck that deal made a lot of sense to us,"" Daniel Busch, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, California. ""Sears can work with these partners, with the mall landlords, to come up with a better use for their space.""

34,"   By Mike Stone  Macerich Co's (MAC.N) fourth largest shareholder, Cohen & Steers Inc (CNS.N), asked the shopping mall company on Wednesday to produce a plan that will deliver as much value as the takeover offer by Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) it turned down last month.The comments, made by Cohen & Steers' Executive Chairman Martin Cohen to Reuters on the sidelines of the NYU REIT Symposium in New York, make the investment manager the largest Macerich shareholder to publicly criticize the company after it rejected a sweetened offer of $95.50 per share by Simon, equivalent to $23.2 billion including debt.""At least give us a plan of how Macerich will exceed Simon's offer over time,"" Cohen said, adding that he favored Simon's offer.A Macerich spokesman declined to comment. Cohen & Steers owns 6.35 percent of Macerich's common stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. It is one of the biggest investors in real estate investment trusts and is also a shareholder in Simon, as well as other major real estate companies such as Equity Residential (EQR.N), Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N) and SL Green Realty Corp (SLG.N).Smaller Macerich investor, Land and Buildings Investment Management LLC, headed by activist investor Jonathan Litt, is also currently challenging Macerich with a proposal for a slate of four directors to its board. Macerich is seeking to quash Land & Buildings nominations in court, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters. Macerich's complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City states Land and Buildings was not a shareholder by March 20, the date of record when shareholders can vote in upcoming board member elections and make nominations.A merger between Indianapolis-based Simon and Santa Monica, California-based Macerich would have joined the No. 1 and No. 3 U.S. shopping mall owners. Simon argued the deal would boost their ability to negotiate leases with store owners at a time when mall operators are experiencing a fall in traffic as consumers take to shopping online, which is more convenient and often cheaper. Macerich countered that Simon's offer ""substantially"" undervalued it. It adopted a poison pill, or a shareholder rights plan, with a 10 percent trigger, and changed its board structure to thwart a hostile takeover.

35,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on Simon  Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and certain rated subsidiaries (collectively,  Simon), including SPG's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of Simon's long-term IDR at 'A' reflects the strong quality  of the company's retail real estate portfolio that generates robust cash flow in  excess of fixed charges, as well as the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established $2 billion common stock repurchase program and its  bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a more shareholder-friendly  capital allocation policy. The program, combined with the unsuccessful bid for  MAC, would have increased leverage by approximately a turn. However, the company  has reiterated a commitment to maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon  withdrew its bid for MAC and Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate  amount of common stock over the next two years.  Appropriate Leverage; Share Repurchase Program a Wildcard Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for the  cash acquisitions of Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park  Village in Fort Worth, Texas in January 2015. Fitch expects leverage to be in  the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer to 5.5x this year,  following the stabilization of development and re-development projects. Leverage  sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating, thus Fitch's  projections are towards the high-end of the range.  Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines leverage as debt less  readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities, which include dividends from  Klepierre.  Strong Asset Quality As of Dec. 31, 2014, Simon owned or had an interest in 228 properties comprising  189 million square feet in North America, Asia and Europe. Additionally, pro  forma for Klepierre SA's acquisition of Corio N.V., the company had an 18.3%  equity interest in Klepierre, a Paris-based shopping center company, and also  has an interest in a joint venture with McArthurGlen Group formed to own and  develop designer outlets primarily in Europe.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. Simon's 4Q2014 sales PSF was $619 ($631 for Simon's 109  malls), the second highest among the company's U.S. peers, trailing only Taubman  Centers, Inc. (unrated by Fitch) at $809.  Fitch considers SPG's portfolio as 'prime' as it includes productive assets such  as Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of  Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. The  portfolio has scale and diversity, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls.  Robust Fixed-Charge Coverage Simon's pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio is 3.9x, compared with 3.7x in  2014 and 3.3x in 2013. Mid-single-digit releasing spreads and occupancy gains  drove SPG's same-store NOI growth of 5.1% on comparable malls and Premium  Outlets in 2014. Releasing spreads for malls and Premium Outlets were 16.6% in  2014 compared with 18.2% in 2013 and 10.8% in 2012. This same-store NOI growth  and a reduced cost of debt capital improved fixed-charge coverage. Recently  signed rents per square foot relative to upcoming average expiring rent per  square foot indicate that strong re-leasing spreads are achievable for the next  several years. Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in low 4.0x range over the  next 12-to-24 months, which is strong for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures  and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and  preferred stock dividends. Lower Relative Overhead & Potential Operating Synergies Simon's general and administrative expenses as a percentage of recurring  operating EBITDA was 4.1% in 2014, indicative of its significant scale as the  largest publicly traded REIT. The company's equity market capitalization and  total market capitalization excluding limited partnership units were $56.6  billion and $83.7 billion, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2014 ($66.3 billion and  $93.4 billion, respectively, including limited partnership units). Lower general  and administrative expenses and moderately lower capital costs (primarily via  unsecured bond and bank borrowings) have historically comprised the few scale  advantages available to REITs generally. Outside of the mall sector, not many  REIT property types have been able to generate meaningful property level savings  and/or operating synergies through increased scale. Market Leading Access to Capital In addition to a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014--the first  such program established by a U.S. equity REIT?and upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015, the company has two multicurrency credit facilities  totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities are comprised of a $4 billion  facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility (upsized from $2 billion in  March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector.  Simon was active in both the unsecured and secured debt markets in 2014. It  retired $2.9 billion of senior notes at a weighted average coupon rate of 5.76%  and completed two senior notes offerings totaling $2.5 billion, with a weighted  average coupon rate of 3.32%. Simon also closed 16 new secured loans during 2014  totaling approximately $2.8 billion, of which SPG's share is $1.6 billion. The  weighted average interest rate on these loans is 3.29% and the weighted average  term is 8.4 years. Good Liquidity and Financial Flexibility Liquidity coverage is good at 1.3x for the period Jan. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016  pro forma. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by  liquidity uses. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under  revolving credit facilities pro forma for first quarter 2015 acquisitions, and  projected retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include  pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and  development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2016 are  refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to 2.2x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in 2012.  Fitch estimates that the company generates approximately $1.5 billion of  internally generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future  investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($2.6 billion of EBITDA in 2014) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.7x,  which is adequate for the rating. Fitch estimates that the unencumbered  portfolio is levered 5.6x as compared to the encumbered portfolio at 5.4x on a  gross basis and also excluding recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, thus the unencumbered pool is slightly more levered than the  encumbered pool.  Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of Dec. 31, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.3 billion, representing 3.4% of gross assets, exceeding the  2.3% level reached at year-end 2007. However, redevelopment is a significantly  larger component of development expenditures today than it was then at 84%  compared to 37%. Redevelopments are lower risk due to smaller scale and  demonstrated leasing activity and sales history. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million over the next two years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.2x pro  forma for the acquisitions of Jersey Gardens and University Park Village). --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (this ratio  is 3.9x pro forma). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock at 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --$6.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities at 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan at 'A'; --$13.4 billion senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --$409.2 million commercial paper notes at 'F1'. Simon CP 2 --$409.2 million commercial paper notes at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

36,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Even as the rise of online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc leads analysts to predict the eventual death of the American shopping mall, real estate fund managers are betting some will prosper – if they can lure the right kind of consumer.Simon Property Group Inc, the largest high-end mall operator in the country with properties including Palo Alto, California's Stanford Shopping Center and suburban Philadelphia's King of Prussia Mall is the top holding in 53 of the 71 U.S. real estate funds tracked by Lipper. The average real estate fund devotes 8.8 percent of its portfolio to Simon, a bigger average bet than the 7.6 percent that tech funds invest in Apple Inc and almost one percentage point more than the weight of Simon in the benchmark S&P U.S. REIT index.Still a symbol of a car-based, middle-class suburban America, malls are increasingly seen as viable only if they attract the affluent. Fund managers are bullish on so-called Class A malls, anchored by department stores like Bloomingdale’s and featuring retailers like Apple, reflecting how better-off consumers have thrived since the end of the financial crisis while middle and lower income consumers have struggled. ""Class A malls are repositioning themselves to be destinations, with more restaurants, which is making them more resilient to what's going on with the Internet,"" said Rick Romano, a portfolio manager of the $3.8 billion Prudential Global Real Estate fund, who holds 4.5 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his top holding.Class A malls are also the only shopping centers able to attract an Apple store, which can post annual sales of more than $5,000 a square foot - the highest of any U.S. retailer - and boost sales growth for other retailers throughout the mall, Romano said. As a result, Simon has been able to post rent increases of 18.9 percent for new leases over the last 12 months, according to Paul Morgan, an analyst at MLV & Co.Simon's average rent per square foot – which includes ongoing and new leases – rose 4.5 percent in the first quarter compared with the year before, or about six times the 0.8 percent pace of inflation in the U.S. Bloomingdale's is the most frequent anchor store at the highest-rated malls in the country, followed by Nordstrom.Those Americans in the top 20 percent of income – or Class A mall shoppers – have seen their household assets jump from about $15 trillion in 2010 to $25 trillion in 2014, according to Green Street Advisors. Household assets for Class B and lower mall customers rose from about $7 trillion in 2010 to a little over $10 trillion in 2014. Class B malls are often saddled with struggling department stores such as Sears or J.C. Penney as anchors, making them less attractive to prospective tenants. Some 24 such malls have closed since 2010, and an additional 60 are on the brink of closure, according to Green Street Advisors.No REIT fund hold Class B or lower mall operators as their largest holding, according to Lipper. J.C Penney and Sears are the most frequent anchor stores at Class C and lower malls, according to Green Street.There are about 1,000 enclosed shopping malls in the U.S. Foot traffic at malls during the November and December holiday shopping season fell from approximately 35 billion visits in 2010 to 17.6 billion in 2013, according to an October Cushman and Wakefield report. Online commerce now accounts for 15 percent of retail sales - just 5 percentage points less than the percentage of retail sales that come from malls and gaining, according to a report from Green Street Advisors.      DEMAND FOR HIGH-END RISING  Investor demand for high-end malls will rise even if consumer spending overall flattens or starts to slow, said Jason Ko, a co-portfolio manager of the $2.1 billion J.P. Morgan Realty Income fund who has 7.8 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his largest position.Macerich Co, the third-largest mall owner in the U.S., rejected a $16.8 billion takeover offer from Simon Property on April 1, a merger that would give Simon an even larger hold of the high-end mall market. Simon is not expected to come back with a higher offer, analysts and fund managers said.""What that attempt signifies is that high quality malls are irreplaceable: difficult to build and difficult to buy,"" Ko said.Shares of Simon Property are down 5.5 percent since Macerich rejected its takeover offer, while shares of Macerich have fallen 2.2 percent over the same time. Over the last 12 months, shares of Simon are up 5.7 percent, or about 2 percentage points less than the 7.9 percent gain in the benchmark index. Simon shares closed Wednesday at $181.31, compared with the average target price of $217.05 among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. At that price, Simon is selling at 39 times trailing 12 month earnings, slightly below the average 45 times earnings among its peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.Class B malls, meanwhile, will not only feel the effects of sales declines at J.C. Penney and Sears, but will see increased competition from so-called power centers - suburban developments that are often next to a major highway and include a Home Depot or Best Buy alongside a traditional strip mall, said Ian Goltra, who helps oversee $2 billion in real estate investments at San Francisco-based Forward Funds.Goltra has several short positions for Class B mall operators in his funds, yet expects shares of Simon to rise, even with its high percentage of fund ownership. He has been adding shares of Simon as it has traded in the $180s, down from a high of $205.31 on Jan 28th.""They have the largest portfolio of blue-chip tenants, and that's something their competitors have not been able to replicate,"" he said.   (Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",2015-05-14,SPG,"Thu May 14, 2015 | 1:31am EDT",Fund managers make big bet on high-end malls via Simon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-funds-malls-analysis-idUSKBN0NZ0B620150514?type=companyNews
37,"  (Updates volume data, adds reporting credit)By Herbert LashNEW YORK, June 19 Shares of mall operator Macerich Co fell as much as 7.3 percent on Friday on reports rival Simon Property Group Inc was selling a 3.6 percent stake, months after its failed takeover bid.Sources told Reuters that Simon Property, the largest U.S. mall operator, was selling 5.7 million shares of Macerich, the No. 3 U.S. mall operator. The shares had been offered in a range of $80.50 to $81 a share, lower than Macerich's close of $82.45 a share on Thursday, sources said.Citigroup was in charge of the block trade, the sources said. Evercore reported the same on Thursday. Macerich declined to comment, and Simon Property did not immediately return a telephone call.Macerich shares were last down 6.2 percent at $76.80, after dropping to as low as $76.40 in early trading. Simon in March offered $95.50 a share for Macerich in a deal valued at $23.2 billion, but Macerich adopted a poison pill and its board unanimously rejected the offer at month's end. On April 1 Simon withdrew its bid.More than 9 million shares of the stock changed hands on Friday, the company's busiest trading day since March 20, when Simon made what it called its final offer for Macerich. Shareholders have questioned Macerich's decision. At the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' annual REIT Week conference last week an unidentified person demanded to know how Macerich had decided to reject the takeover offer.Art Coppola, chairman and chief executive officer at Macerich, said after talking to investment bankers he did not name and Eastdil Secured, a well-known property brokerage, the board concluded Simon's bid was ""substantially inadequate.""Simon shares dipped 0.4 percent to $181.10.

38,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to the  EUR750 million issuance of 1.375% senior unsecured notes due 2022 by Simon  International Finance SCA, a subsidiary of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG). The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Simon Property  Group, L.P., the operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. The company  expects to use the net proceeds to reduce its existing euro-denominated  borrowings and for general corporate purposes. A full list of ratings follows at  the end of the release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established and partially utilized $2 billion common stock  repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a  more shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. The program, combined with  the bid for MAC (should it have been successful), would have increased leverage  by approximately a turn. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon withdrew its bid for MAC, and  Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate amount of common stock over  the next two years. APPROPRIATE METRICS; SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM A WILDCARD Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.3x as of Sept. 30, 2015 as compared to  5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for certain acquisitions. Fitch expects  leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer  to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization of development and re-development  projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A'  rating, thus Fitch's projections are towards the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Through 3Q15, SPG has repurchased $343  million though the effects on leverage were mitigated by the sale of $454  million of marketable and non-marketable securities (i.e. the MAC shares) in  2Q15. Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, which include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in the low 4x over the next  12-to-24 months (4x in 3Q15 and 3.7x in 2014) driven by mid-single digit  releasing spreads. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring  capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total  interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 3Q15 $616 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL  Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014 (the first such  program established by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two  multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities  are comprised of a $4 billion facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility  (upsized from $2 billion in March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the  U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has traditionally been active in both the  unsecured and secured debt markets.  ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.4x for the period from Oct. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016 and  0.9x through Dec. 31, 2017 pro forma for the notes issuance. Fitch defines  liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity  sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities pro forma and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2016 and 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would  improve to 2.5x and 1.7x, respectively. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 72.8% in 3Q15, 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013  and 57% in 2012. Fitch estimates that the company generates approximately $1  billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for  future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($2.6 billion of EBITDA in 2014) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.9x,  which is adequate for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million cumulative over the next two  years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.3x at  Sept. 30, 2015); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x  (fixed-charge coverage was 4x at Sept. 30, 2015). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to $1.35  billion of senior unsecured notes issued by Simon Property Group, L.P, the  operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc.  The offering totalled $550 million of 2.5% senior unsecured due July 15, 2021  and $800 million of 3.3% senior unsecured notes due Jan. 15, 2026. The company  expects to use the net proceeds to retire three existing mortgage loans, to  redeem the 6.1% notes due 2016, to repay a portion of borrowings under their  unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of the release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established and partially utilized $2 billion common stock  repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a  more shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. The program, combined with  the bid for MAC (should it have been successful), would have increased leverage  by approximately a turn. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon withdrew its bid for MAC, and  Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate amount of common stock over  the next two years. APPROPRIATE METRICS; SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM A WILDCARD Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.3x as of Sept. 30, 2015 as compared to  5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for certain acquisitions. Fitch expects  leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer  to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization of development and re-development  projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A'  rating, and thus Fitch's projections are towards the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Through 3Q15, SPG has repurchased $343  million though the effects on leverage were mitigated by the sale of $454  million of marketable and non-marketable securities (i.e. the MAC shares) in  2Q15. Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, which include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in the low 4x over the next  12-to-24 months (4x in 3Q15 and 3.7x in 2014) driven by mid-single digit  releasing spreads. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring  capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total  interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 3Q15 $616 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL  Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014 (the first such  program established by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two  multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities  are comprised of a $4 billion facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility  (upsized from $2 billion in March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the  U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has traditionally been active in both the  unsecured and secured debt markets.  ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.0x for the period Oct. 1, 2015 through Dec. 31, 2017 pro  forma for the notes issued in January 2016, the EUR denominated notes issued in  November 2015 and the redemption of the 6.125% and 7.375% notes due 2018. Fitch  defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities pro forma and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to  1.6x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 72.8% in 3Q15, 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013  and 57% in 2012.

42,"  Department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) said it is pursuing a potential sale and partial leaseback of its headquarters in Texas to reduce debt and costs. J.C. Penney employs more than 3,000 workers at its Plano, Texas headquarters, which it has occupied since 1992. The retail chain's decision comes at a time when several U.S. department store operators are looking to create value from their vast real-estate holdings as their core business of selling clothes and home goods come under pressure.Hedge fund Starboard Value LP urged Macy's Inc (M.N) last month to enter into joint ventures for its stores, including its flagship Herald Square store in New York, to realize greater value from its real estate assets. Struggling retailer Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) laid out plans in April last year to raise more than $2.5 billion by creating a real estate investment trust, Seritage Growth Properties (SRG.N), that would hold about 254 Sears and Kmart stores.     The company also entered into three joint ventures with mall operators, including Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) and Macerich Co (MAC.N), to sell some of its stores.J.C. Penney said on Friday the cost of leasing space would be offset by reducing maintenance costs, property taxes and lower interest expenses through paying down debt with proceeds from the sale. CBRE Group Inc's (CBG.N) Capital Markets unit has been selected to find buyers for the 1.8 million-square-foot office campus located in Legacy Business Park in Plano.J.C. Penney had in 2014 decided to contribute a significant portion of the land surrounding its headquarters to a joint venture with a team of developers.

43,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Stock mutual funds based in the United States posted $2.1 billion in withdrawals last week for the second consecutive week, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday, as U.S. equities broke a five-week winning streak.The stock funds posted outflows after attacks in Belgium weighed on investor sentiment. Returns were also held back by a stronger U.S. dollar and comments by U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers suggesting the potential for an April hike in benchmark interest rates. U.S.-based mutual funds that invest mainly in companies based within the country posted $2 billion in outflows in the week that ended March 23.Outflows from international stock funds moderated to $108 million in the latest week, compared with $558 million the previous week, as investors took less money from emerging-markets funds. U.S.-based funds invested in those riskier markets posted just $79 million in outflows during the week, compared with $1 billion the previous week.Investors ended an 11-week streak of inflows that had brought a total $22 billion to funds invested in developed markets outside the United States, like Europe and Japan, during the week. Those funds posted $29 million in outflows, according to ICI.""Investors continued to favor bonds funds over equity funds, with municipal bonds and investment-grade taxable bonds dominating,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, who directs mutual-fund research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Within equities, the recent willingness to take on risk through small and mid-cap U.S. funds has disappeared, causing outflows.""Bond funds enjoyed another strong week, taking in $4.7 billion. Investment-grade bond funds attracted $1.6 billion, while lower-grade high-yield funds took in $420 million, ICI said. Prices on corporate debt have improved in recent weeks as fears that some energy companies would default abated and oil prices improved. Municipal-bond funds took in $1.6 billion, their 25th straight week of inflows.

45,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Tracy Rucinski  Teen apparel retailer Pacific Sunwear of California Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday, succumbing to mounting losses and intense competition from fast-fashion retailers and online rivals.The company, which joins recent U.S. Chapter 11 filings by surfwear brand Quicksilver and teen retailer American Apparel, plans to be taken private by investment firm Golden Gate once it emerges from bankruptcy, it said in a statement on Thursday.Its shares fell to a record low of 5 cents on Thursday and were still down 42 percent at 5.5 cents in late afternoon.Citing ""significant and unusual trading,"" lawyers for the retailer asked a judge to restrict trading on Thursday due to concerns that a significant change in ownership could impair its ability to use tax benefits on operating losses down the road.Founded in 1982 as a surf shop, PacSun has posted an annual net loss since the financial crisis hit in 2008. It had about $342.7 million of net operating losses as of Jan. 31, which can be used to reduce tax liabilities if it becomes profitable again.""The company believes that this is an extremely valuable asset of the bankruptcy estate,"" Joseph Barry of Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor said at an emergency hearing in Delaware on Thursday.

46,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Tracy Rucinski  Teen apparel retailer Pacific Sunwear of California Inc PSUN.O filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday, succumbing to mounting losses and intense competition from fast-fashion retailers and online rivals.The company, which joins recent U.S. Chapter 11 filings by surfwear brand Quicksilver and teen retailer American Apparel, plans to be taken private by investment firm Golden Gate once it emerges from bankruptcy, it said in a statement on Thursday. Its shares fell to a record low of 5 cents on Thursday and were still down 42 percent at 5.5 cents in late afternoon.Citing ""significant and unusual trading,"" lawyers for the retailer asked a judge to restrict trading on Thursday due to concerns that a significant change in ownership could impair its ability to use tax benefits on operating losses down the road.Founded in 1982 as a surf shop, PacSun has posted an annual net loss since the financial crisis hit in 2008. It had about $342.7 million of net operating losses as of Jan. 31, which can be used to reduce tax liabilities if it becomes profitable again.""The company believes that this is an extremely valuable asset of the bankruptcy estate,"" Joseph Barry of Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor said at an emergency hearing in Delaware on Thursday.

47,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to EUR500  million of 1.25% senior unsecured notes issued by Simon International Finance,  S.C.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG). The  notes are guaranteed by Simon Property Group LP. A full list of ratings follows  at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, its significant scale, and its  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders relates to whether Simon's partially  utilized $2 billion common stock repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich  Company (NYSE: MAC) last year reflect a more shareholder-friendly capital  allocation policy. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings.  APPROPRIATE METRICS  Fitch calculates Simon's leverage was 5.4x and 5.5x for the trailing 12 months  (TTM) and quarter ended March 31, 2016 as compared to 5.2x and 5.1x for 2015 and  2014, respectively. Fitch expects leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the  next 12-to-24 months but closer to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization  of development and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and  5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating, and thus Fitch's projections are towards  the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage could trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. During 1Q16, SPG did not complete any  share repurchases but maintains $1.66 billion in capacity on its $2 billion  share repurchase program announced in April 2015 and authorized for a 24-month  period. When including 50% of preferred stock in total debt, SPG's leverage was  5.5x and 5.4x for the quarter and TTM ended March 31, 2016. Fitch defines  leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA  including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated entities, which  include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the low 4x over the  next 12-to-24 months (4.3x and 4.1x for quarter and TTM ended March 31, 2016 and  4.1x in 2015) driven by mid-single digit releasing spreads. Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including cash distributions  from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures and  straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and preferred  stock dividends. STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 1Q16 $613 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2015 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 100 basis points from 2005-2015. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program in 2014 (the first such program  created by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from $500 million  in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two multicurrency credit  facilities totalling $7.5 billion. The credit facilities are comprised of a $4  billion facility and $3.5 billion supplementary facility (upsized from $2  billion in March 2015 with the accordion option exercised in April 2016),  aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has  traditionally been active in both the unsecured and secured debt markets. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.2x for the period April 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2017  pro forma for the EUR denominated notes issued in May 2016, the exercised  accordion option on the revolving line of credit and the closing of the  acquisition of The Shops at Crystals. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as  liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata  debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2017 are refinanced,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.8x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 64.5% in 1Q16 and 66.7% in 2015 compared with 64%  in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates greater  than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($3 billion of EBITDA in 2015) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by 2.8x,  which is adequate for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million cumulative over the next two  years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.4x at  March 31, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x  (fixed-charge coverage was 4.1x at March 31, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates SPG as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Preferred stock 'BBB+'.

48,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Simon  Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and the obligations of its subsidiaries  (detailed at the end of this release), including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's 'A' IDR reflects the company's high-quality retail real estate portfolio,  cycle-tested management team, its market-leading access to capital, and its  significant scale which influences efficiencies and the aforementioned access to  capital. Other strengths include its financial flexibility that stems from a low  dividend payout ratio and a sizable unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting  these strengths is leverage that is low on an absolute basis but high relative  to the rating sensitivities for the 'A' rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific  about its financial policies and credit rating targets and has demonstrated a  willingness to flex the balance sheet for external growth opportunities.  LEVERAGE STABILIZING AT CURRENT LEVELS Fitch expects leverage will be in the 5x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24  months but closer to 5.5x for 2016, following the stabilization of development  and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x-5.5x is  appropriate for the 'A' rating and thus Fitch's projections are towards the  high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has  operated recently with leverage at 5.4x and 5.5x for the trailing 12 months  (TTM) and quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to 5.4x and 5.2x for full years  2015 and 2014.  Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities,  which includes dividends from its investment in Klepierre shares. Leverage when  including 50% of preferred stock and preferred units was 5.5x, 5.4x and 5.2x for  the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and the years 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x  range over the next 12-to-24 months as compared to 4.1x for the TTM ended March  31, 2016. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA  including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital  expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest  incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which  has supported operating performance despite tenant headwinds and should be more  financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with  interests in properties in North America, Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium  Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's 1Q16 $613 sales per square foot and  outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by SSNOI growth) as  further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable NOI growth exceeding  peers by an average of 240 basis points (bps) from 2005-2015 and occupancy  outperforming peers by 100 bps from 2005-2015. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to  smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and  reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects. Fitch  notes nonetheless that persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity  and financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital, and its  relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A'  rating. Substantiating this view are the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG  has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR),  across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at  all points in the cycle. SPG re-opened the REIT unsecured debt market in 2009  when it issued $650 million of 10-year notes at 10.4%.  SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RELATIVE TO OBLIGATIONS SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its  obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash and  availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion  and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool.  Liquidity coverage is consistent with the sector at 1.2x for the period April 1,  2016 through Dec. 31, 2017 pro forma for the EUR-denominated notes issued in May  2016, the exercised accordion option on the revolving line of credit and the  acquisition and financing of The Shops at Crystals. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata  debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2017 are refinanced,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.9x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 64.5% in 1Q16 and 66.7% in 2015, compared with  64% in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates  greater than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Unencumbered  assets (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by  2.7x, which is appropriate for the rating. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will  remain favorable over the next 12-to-24 months and that the issuer will maintain  leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch  considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of  SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets and its overall  access to capital.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from  mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to match redevelopment and expansion capex to retained cash flow  from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and  unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (TTM leverage was 5.4x  at March 31, 2016) --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (TTM  coverage was 4.1x at March 31, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that  result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on  an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio  specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing  distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and  financeability of SPG's portfolio;  --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Simon Property Group, Inc.  --Long-Term IDR at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB+'.  Simon Property Group, L.P.  --Long-Term IDR at 'A';  --Short-Term IDR at 'F1';  --Senior unsecured revolving credit facilities at 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --CP notes at 'F1'.  Simon CP 2  --CP notes at 'F1'.  Simon International Finance, S.C.A.  --Unsecured guaranteed notes at 'A'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has affirmed and withdrawn the 'A' rating on term loans as a class of  obligations for Simon Property Group, L.P., as the obligation ($240 million  senior unsecured term loan) was repaid early.

Other strengths include its financial  flexibility that stems from a low dividend payout ratio and a sizable  unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting these strengths is leverage that is low  on an absolute basis but high relative to the rating sensitivities for the 'A'  rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific about its financial policies and credit  rating targets and has demonstrated a willingness to flex the balance sheet for  external growth opportunities. LEVERAGE STABILIZING AT CURRENT LEVELS Fitch expects leverage will be in the 5x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24  months but closer to 5.5x for 2016, following the stabilization of development  and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x-5.5x is  appropriate for the 'A' rating and thus Fitch's projections are towards the  high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has  operated recently with leverage at 5.3x for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016,  compared to 5.4x and 5.2x for full years 2015 and 2014.  Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities plus  dividends from its investment in Klepierre shares net of distributions to  noncontrolling property interests. Leverage when including 50% of preferred  stock and preferred units was unchanged. Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x  range over the next 12-to-24 months as compared to 4.5x for the quarter ended  Sept. 30, 2016. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA plus cash distributions from unconsolidated entities net of distributions  to noncontrolling property interests less recurring capital expenditures and  straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest incurred and preferred  stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which  has supported operating performance despite tenant headwinds and should be more  financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with  interests in properties in North America, Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium  Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's 3Q16 $604 sales per square foot and  outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by SSNOI growth) as  further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable NOI growth exceeding  peers by an average of 240 basis points (bps) from 2005-2015 and occupancy  outperforming peers by 100 bps from 2005-2015. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to  smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and  reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects.  Nonetheless, persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity and  financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital, and its  relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A'  rating. Substantiating this view is the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG  has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR),  across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at  all points in the cycle. SPG re-opened the REIT unsecured debt market in 2009  when it issued $650 million of 10-year notes at 10.4%.  SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RELATIVE TO OBLIGATIONS SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its  obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash and  availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion  and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool.  Liquidity coverage is consistent with the sector at 1.7x for the period Oct. 1,  2016 through Dec. 31, 2018 pro forma for the notes issued in November 2016.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities and projected retained cash flows from operating activities.  Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital  expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities  through 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to 2.2x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 67% in 3Q16 and 66.7% in 2015, compared with 64%  in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates greater  than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Unencumbered  assets (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by  2.7x, which is appropriate for the rating. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will  remain favorable over the next 12-to-24 months and that the issuer will maintain  leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch  considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of  SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets and its overall  access to capital.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from  mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to match redevelopment and expansion capex to retained cash flow  from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and  unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.3x for  the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016) --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (fixed  charge coverage was 4.5x for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that  result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on  an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio  specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing  distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and  financeability of SPG's portfolio;  --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x.
