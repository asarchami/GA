0,"  By Bill BerkrotJan 13 U.S. biotech company Celgene Corp  raised sales and profit forecasts for 2015 and 2017 on Monday, saying its improved long-term outlook was based on current momentum for its blood cancer medicines.The relatively conservative increases, however, and a 2014 forecast that was slightly lower than current Wall Street estimates, dampened shareholder enthusiasm and Celgene shares fell more than 3 percent.""While Celgene tends to be conservative with its guidance, we believe heightened expectations had set a high bar for the stock (prior) to today's release,"" Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said.Celgene shares had been rising over the past few weeks, touching a new all-time high prior to Monday's announcement.""The numbers for 2014 are a little light of expectations and the stock has been very strong heading into this announcement, so some sell off was probably inevitable,"" said Geoffrey Porges, analyst with Sanford Bernstein.Celgene raised the 2017 forecast for its flagship drug Revlimid by $1 billion to $7 billion, and now expects 2017 sales of $1.5 billion for its newer blood cancer drug Pomalyst, up from a prior view of $1 billion. Celgene Chief Executive Robert Hugin told analysts and investors that the early sale performance of Pomalyst ""certainly exceeded our expectations in the U.S. and Europe.""Celgene Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fourse, in a breakout session following the formal presentation, appeared to leave room for future forecast increases, saying that the numbers ""can evolve.""She called the forecasts ""a new base case"" and said the outlook was ""based on conservative estimates of worldwide pricing."" Fourse also said further upside could be driven by positive results from ongoing late-stage clinical trials.In addition, the long-term forecasts were based on expected growth only from Celgene's blood cancer drugs, which does not take into account potential sales strides by Abraxane, its drug for breast cancer and other solid tumor cancers. ""Abraxane continues to have very meaningful growth,"" JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham said in a research note.The forecasts were issued during Celgene's presentation at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco.For 2014, Celgene expects sales of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion and adjusted earnings, excluding one-time items, of $7 to $7.20 per share. Analysts, on average, are looking for sales of $7.43 billion and earnings of $7.29 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""The 2014 guidance looks solid and potentially conservative, given strong commercial momentum,"" Meacham said.For 2015, Celgene now expects sales of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $9 to $9.50 per share, up from its prior view of sales of $8 billion to $9 billion and EPS of $8 to $9.For 2017, Celgene sees sales growing to $13 billion to $14 billion, up from its prior view of at least $12 billion, and adjusted earnings of a about $15 per share versus its earlier forecast of $13 to $14 per share.""While positive, we think the magnitude of this guidance raise is generally in-line with buy-side expectations,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said.The company also provided preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2013, saying it expects to report adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, including a 10 cent per share impact from collaboration-related payments.That would be about 4 cents shy of average analysts' expectations of $1.55 per share.Celgene shares were down $5.67, or 3.3 percent, at $164.14 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.",2014-01-13,CELG,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 2:57pm EST",UPDATE 3-Celgene raises forecasts on cancer drug sales strength,http://www.reuters.com//article/celgene-outlook-idUSL2N0KN1CZ20140113?type=companyNews

3,"  (Adds treatment price, details on how drug works, updates share price)By Bill BerkrotMarch 21 U.S. health regulators approved on Friday a Celgene Corp drug to treat psoriatic arthritis, a type of arthritis associated with the skin disease psoriasis that causes joint pain, stiffness and swelling.The drug, a pill known chemically as apremilast, will be sold under the brand name Otezla. It is also being studied by the U.S. biotechnology company as a treatment for psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.Celgene projects Otezla sales of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year by 2017.""We're cautious about achievability of management's guidance for this product,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said.""It's a highly competitive category and there are a lot of drugs with greater efficacy,"" added Porges, who forecasts annual sales will reach $800 million by 2019. Celgene has set a wholesale price of about $22,500 for a year of treatment. It expects to begin selling the medicine this month.Both Porges and ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the price was higher than they had expected even though it represents about a 25 percent discount to current biologic market leaders.Otezla works by blocking an enzyme called PDE4, or phosphodiesterase 4, associated with inflammation. It offers the convenience of being a pill, while the current leading treatments are injected drugs. ""Relief of pain and inflammation and improving physical function are important treatment goals for patients with active psoriatic arthritis,"" Curtis Rosebraugh, director of the Food and Drug Administration Office of Drug Evaluation II, said in a statement.""Otezla provides a new treatment option for patients suffering from this disease,"" he added.The FDA is expected to make a decision by September on Otezla for psoriasis, a much larger market than psoriatic arthritis. ""We think that the psoriatic arthritis market will be a solid fit for Otezla given the dissatisfaction with current drugs,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mara Goldstein said in a research note. ""We think the drug has a good chance of widespread use.""Current treatments for the condition include corticosteroids and a class of injected biotech medicines known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, such as AbbVie Inc's  Humira and Enbrel from Amgen Inc. The TNF blockers are highly effective but have more potentially serious side effects.As a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring a registry of pregnant women who use the drug so it can assess the risks to them related to Otezla exposure, the agency said.It also said Otezla patients should be monitored for potentially significant weight loss. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, the weight loss should be evaluated and discontinuation of treatment should be considered, the FDA said.In clinical trials, the Celgene drug was also associated with an increase in reports of depression by a small percentage of patients.Celgene shares, which had been off as much as 4.6 percent amid a wider biotech selloff on Friday, recovered somewhat and closed down $5.61, or 3.7 percent, at $144.40 on Nasdaq.

6,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Mylan Inc on Thursday sued Celgene Corp to stop the latter's effort to keep generic versions of two drugs that generate $4.5 billion of annual sales off the market.The lawsuit accuses Celgene of maintaining unlawful monopolies over Revlimid, which treats disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells; and Thalomid, which treats lesions associated with a variation of Hansen's Disease, or leprosy.Revlimid is a branded version of lenalidomide, and is a derivative of thalidomide, a drug introduced in the 1950s for which Thalomid is a branded version. Mylan said both drugs can cost more than $100,000 for a year's supply.In its lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, Mylan accused Celgene of using federal limits on the distribution of Revlimid and Thalomid, which were designed to promote the drugs' safety, as a pretext to keep generic drug makers from obtaining their own samples. Mylan said this prevents generic drug makers from conducting ""bioequivalence"" tests required by U.S. regulators before generic drugs can be launched.""The effect of Celgene's conduct is that no generic manufacturer, including Mylan, has been able to bring generic versions of Thalomid and/or Revlimid to market,"" Mylan said.

In a February 13 regulatory filing, Celgene said it sold $4.28 billion of Revlimid and $244.5 million of Thalomid in 2013, together accounting for nearly 70 percent of all revenue.Celgene also said its exclusive U.S. rights, whether through patents or primary regulatory approvals, to Revlimid and Thalomid expire in 2027 and 2023, respectively.The case is Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc v.

15,"   By Kate Kelland | LONDON  LONDON An anti-cancer drug made by the U.S. biotech firm Celgene can re-activate hidden HIV in patients so that it can be detected, bringing researchers closer to being able to treat it, Danish scientists said on Tuesday.In a small study presented at an international AIDS conference in Australia, the researchers said the finding was a ""step in the right direction"" toward finding a cure for the viral disease but that many years of research are still needed.""There is still a long way to go and many obstacles to overcome before we can start talking about a cure against HIV,"" said Ole Schmeltz Sogaard, who led the research team from Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, in a statement.The drug, known generically as romidepsin and under the brand name Istodax, is licensed to treat a type of cancer called T-cell lymphoma. In this study, however, it was investigated as a potential HIV therapy.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can be kept at very low levels by anti-AIDS drugs, but there is still no cure that can eradicate HIV from the body.  Some 35 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, and the global AIDS epidemic has killed 39 million since it began in the 1980s, according to the latest data from the United Nations AIDS program, UNAIDS. Scientists working to find a cure know the virus can hide in a state of hibernation in cells called CD4 cells, which are part of the body's immune system.CD4 cells cannot fight the AIDS virus themselves, but killer T-cells can if they are able to tell whether or not a CD4 cell contains the hibernating HIV.      Sharon Lewin, co-chair of the AIDS2014 conference in Melbourne Australia and a professor of infectious diseases who was not directly involved in this study, said the results of the study were significant and encouraging because they showed ""we can wake up the virus reservoir and make enough of (it) to leave the cell, making it visible to an immune response"".The Danish team gave three once-weekly infusions of romidepsin to six HIV-positive adult patients who were already taking antiretroviral AIDS drugs and whose so-called ""viral load"" was undetectable.They found that romidepsin increased the virus production in HIV-infected cells between 2.1 and 3.9 times above normal and that the viral load in the blood increased to measurable levels in five out of six patients. ""We have now shown that we can activate a hibernating virus with romidepsin and that the activated virus moves into the bloodstream in large amounts,"" Schmeltz Sogaard said in a statement about the results.When the virus is activated and moves toward the bloodstream it leaves a trace on the outside of the infected CD4 cells, he explained. In principle, this means killer T-cells would be able to trace and destroy the HIV-infected CD4 cells.The Danish team said the next step is a larger trial where the researchers will combine romidepsin activation of hidden HIV with an experimental vaccine called Vacc-4x being developed by  the Norwegian biotech firm Bionor Pharma to strengthen the ability of T-cells to fight HIV.

32,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded the authorized use of Celgene Corp's cancer drug Revlimid to include newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, the company said on Wednesday.Previously the drug was only approved for patients who had received at least one previous therapy. Physicians in the United States have long been prescribing Revlimid for new patients on an ""off-label"" basis, but the company had not been allowed to promote its use in this population.The FDA's action means Celgene can market Revlimid, in combination with a different drug, dexamethasone, as a treatment for all multiple myeloma patients and helps validate the company's premise that treating patients earlier and for a longer period of time increases progression-free survival.The approval is expected to only modestly increase sales in the United States since doctors are already prescribing the drug for newly diagnosed patients. In Europe, where physicians are not allowed to prescribe off-label, the situation is different. Celgene expects European regulators to also approve the drug for newly-diagnosed patients within the next few weeks. If they do, the move could add meaningfully to sales.About 50 percent of patients with multiple myeloma are newly diagnosed. The remainder have received one or more prior therapies.Revlimid generated total sales in 2014 of $2.92 billion in the United States and $2.06 billion in the rest of the world. The drug is approved in 70 countries for previously treated patients. The company hopes approvals in the U.S. and Europe will pave the way for other countries to also approve the drug for newly diagnosed patients. John Newman, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a research note that he expects sales of Revlimid to reach $10 billion by 2020.About 93,600 patients are living with multiple myeloma in Europe and about 88,499 patients are living with it in the United States, Celgene said. Revlimid is also approved in the United States and some other countries for a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes.

Core earnings per share, which exclude certain items, fell 7 percent but came in 1 cent above forecasts at $1.08.The results were helped by the partial sell-off of a number of drugs, leaving some investors sceptical and the shares fell 2 percent by 0805 GMT.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said its new cancer alliance with Celgene would maximise the potential of immune system-boosting drugs in blood cancers and a tie-up with Innate Pharma would further strengthen immuno-oncology. AstraZeneca will get an upfront payment of $450 million from Celgene by giving it the right to work with MEDI4736, a so-called anti-PD-L1 immune system medicine, in blood cancers. Innate will receive an initial $250 million from AstraZeneca.Despite the loss of sales on profitable old drugs like Nexium and Crestor for cholesterol, which loses U.S. patent protection next year, AstraZeneca argues new cancer drugs can help lift sales to $45 billion in 2023 from 2014's $26 billion.Analysts view the forecast as a stretch, although confidence is building in its immuno-oncology portfolio, with the next focus being updates at the May 29-June 2 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. AstraZeneca now has 72 oncology trials under way, including 31 in immuno-oncology.In the short-term, Soriot has his work cut out to hit 2015 financial targets and the Celgene deal highlights a drive to gain revenue by ""externalisation"", or selling rights to some research, which generated $309 million in the quarter.""Quarterly results confirm that this 'engineering' is needed if management is to hit its full-year EPS targets,"" Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a note.The group reiterated its forecast of a low single-digit percent increase in 2015 core earnings at constant exchange rates, despite a mid single-digit percent fall in sales.Industry analysts had on average forecast first-quarter group sales of $5.98 billion and earnings of $1.07 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.

51,"  (In paragraph 7 corrects spelling of analyst's name to Liisa Bayko from Lisa Bayko)By Olivia OranMay 6 The hefty premium Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc has agreed to pay to acquire Synageva BioPharma Corp highlights how the popularity of so-called orphan drug makers is leading to valuations many investors now deem frothy.Alexion shares fell as much as 10 percent on Wednesday on investor concerns the $8.4 billion cash and stock deal overvalued Synageva, whose drug for a rare and potentially fatal condition that causes a build-up of fat in the blood and liver awaits regulatory approval.Alexion offered Synageva nearly a 140 percent premium, versus an average takeover premium of 41 percent for biotechnology companies so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other recent big deals involving orphan drug makers that focus on rare diseases include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd's $3.5 billion purchase of Auspex Pharmaceuticals announced in March and Shire Plc's acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in January. Reuters also reported last week that Pfizer Inc had made a preliminary offer for rare-disease drug maker Swedish Orphan Biovitrium AB. Orphan drug companies are seen as attractive because they can typically charge higher prices for their drugs, which serve small patient populations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval process for these drugs is also often quicker - around 10 months versus at least 1 year for non-orphan drugs. This is because these drugs treat serious or life threatening diseases when other treatment options may not exist.""Rare-disease companies are profitable businesses and the cost to market a product is pretty low, which makes them attractive targets,"" said Liisa Bayko, an analyst with JMP Securities. ""The drugs seem to sell themselves to some degree."" In turn, major drug companies such as Pfizer, Celgene Corp  and Novartis AG are investing heavily in orphan drugs. While rare diseases were historically ignored by large pharmaceutical companies in favor of those with larger patient populations such as cardiac disease and diabetes, orphan made up almost half of the 41 new drugs approved by the FDA last year.Sales of orphan drugs are expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 11 percent per year through 2020, compared with 4 percent for drugs treating larger populations, according to a recent report from research firm EvaluatePharma.However, some experts argue that orphan drug companies do not necessarily make for the best investments, because they are overvalued by the market and may carry R&D risk.""When you have large pharmaceutical companies that aren't already in the orphan sector paying large premiums, it enters into really risky territory,"" said Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities LLC. ""It's going to be problematic for companies and investors that don't understand all the processes of manufacturing, development and patient advocacy.""U.S. pharmaceutical merger activity has topped $107.3 billion so far this year, more than double the volume a year ago.

52,"   By Bill Berkrot  Celgene Corp on Thursday said the European Patent Office revoked a key patent on the company's flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, a move that could shave a year or two from the medicine's exclusivity in Europe.The so-called polymorph patent in question would have kept cheaper versions of Revlimid off the European market until September 2024.The New Jersey-based biotechnology company said it plans to  appeal the ruling, a process that could take at least three years to run its course. ""While this would remain under appeal, the patent remains valid and enforceable during that time,"" said Celgene spokesman Greg Geissman.Other Revlimid patents provide Celgene with protection in Europe through 2022 or 2023.

""While this would remain under appeal, the patent remains valid and enforceable during that time,"" said Celgene spokesman Greg Geissman.Other Revlimid patents provide Celgene with protection in Europe through 2022 or 2023. ""The worst-case scenario in the EU for Celgene would be generic entry in July 2022, after the expiration of their composition of matter patent,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note, adding that the appeals process could take as long as five years.A similar patent challenge is under way in the United States. But due to differences in U.S. patent law, both the company and analysts have said the European ruling is highly unlikely to be a predictor of the outcome in the world's largest market.

""Juno has the best-in-class CAR-T and T cell receptors,"" Celgene Chief Executive Bob Hugin said.  Celgene, which said it does not expect deal costs to affect near-term profit and loss, will have the option to buy up to 30 percent of Juno's common stock between the ninth and 10th year of the collaboration, provided it exercises an option to raise its stake to 19.9 percent between years four and five.""Celgene is making a big commitment to CAR-T as we think this will be an important hematological platform,"" RBC Capital Partners analyst Michael Yee wrote in a note.

Receptos shares closed at $207.18 on Nasdaq and rose to $228.14 after hours.Celgene has been on something of a deal spree in recent months. The Receptos move comes just two weeks after Celgene said it would invest $1 billion in Juno Therapeutics to gain access to its cancer immunotherapy portfolio in a deal that would allow Celgene to buy up to 30 percent of Juno over the next decade.The company also has collaborations with Agios Pharmaceuticals, which has a very promising leukemia drug in development as well as other oncology prospects, and with AstraZeneca in immuno-oncology.""We have been fortunate to have been able to act on several major transactions that position us for sustained and enhanced long-term growth,"" Celgene Chief Executive Bob Hugin said on a conference call.

62,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak  U.S. stocks edged lower on Wednesday following comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, as a decline in energy shares outweighed gains in the financial sector in the latter stages of trading. The energy sector .SPNY, down 1.6 percent, was the worst performer of the 10 major S&P groups as oil prices retreated on concerns increased exports from Iran will add to a global supply glut. Brent LCOc1 settled down $1.46 at $57.05 while U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $1.63 at $51.41 a barrel.""We were positive the whole day and we sort of lost our gains right at the tail end,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. ""If crude were to be going down, that would mean there is an assumption this deal may get through Congress or the President’s veto won’t get overturned by Congress such that this Iranian flood of crude comes onto the market.""Financials .SPSY, up 0.7 percent, helped curb declines. The group was buoyed by a 3.2 percent rise in Bank of America (BAC.N) to $17.68 and a 3.8 percent gain in U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) to $45.53 after their quarterly results.The S&P snapped a four-session winning streak, its longest run of gains since January.  Celgene (CELG.O) climbed 7 percent to $131.39 after touching a record high of $135.98. The company said it would buy Receptos RCPT.O to get a potential multibillion-dollar drug.Yellen said she expects the economy to grow steadily for the rest of the year, allowing the Fed to hike rates, but gave no direct hint on the timing or pace of a hike. The Fed is broadly expected to hike rates in September or December.The Fed's Beige Book showed U.S. economic activity continued to expand from mid-May through June, with lower energy prices helping boost consumer spending but remaining a drag on manufacturing. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 3.41 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,050.17, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.55 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,107.4 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 5.95 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,098.94.Corporate America is expected to report its worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, while profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.

Buying Receptos gives Celgene access to ozinamod, a product that it estimates to have peak annual sales of $4-$6 billion in treating ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.Celgene's Revlimid had worldwide sales of $1.34 billion in the first quarter.

71,"   By Deena Beasley  Oct 16 The most influential source for U.S. oncology treatment guidelines on Friday unveiled ratings aimed at helping doctors and patients assess the costs versus benefits of current therapies for two types of blood cancer.The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), a nonprofit alliance of 26 leading cancer centers, said its new ""Evidence Blocks"" for multiple myeloma and chronic myelogenous leukemia are the first in a series that by the end of next year will encompass all oncology therapies, other than surgery or radiation. The blocks give each therapy a score of between one and five in five categories: efficacy, safety, quality and consistency of evidence and affordability. They will supplement NCCN's widely followed guidelines for oncology care.In examples released on Friday, NCCN rated primary treatments for CML: Bristol-Myers Squibb's Sprycel, and Novartis AG's Gleevec and Tasigna. Ratings for all three were nearly identical: highly effective and very expensive. For newly diagnosed myeloma patients eligible for a stem cell transplant, NCCN lists six ""preferred"" regimens, four of which contain Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's Velcade and various chemotherapies, one that includes Celgene Corp's  Revlimid and another that combines Velcade and Revlimid. The Velcade/Revlimid/dexamethasone regimen is rated as the most effective and the most expensive. NCCN lists Amgen Inc's Kyprolis, in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone, as another upfront therapy for myeloma. The Kyprolis regimen was rated highly effective, mildly toxic, average in terms of evidence, mainly consistent in terms of trial data, and very expensive.Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, while CML starts in certain blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in about 27,000 Americans each year, and CML is occurs in about 7,000, according to the American Cancer Society.

They rose 12 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter.The U.S. biotechnology company, however, assured investors about the long-term prospects of Revlimid, saying the drug will likely gain approval for new indications and reach new markets as more trial data comes in.Sales of the multiple myeloma drug came in at $1.56 billion - in line with consensus estimates - accounting for about 61 percent of the company's total revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31.The company said the drug is expected to generate sales of $6.6 billion-$6.7 billion in 2016, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. Celgene has been spending heavily to expand Revlimid's use and geographical reach as well as to develop other drugs.For the fourth quarter, Celgene's adjusted R&D expenses jumped about 36 percent to $649 million, including a $70 million milestone payment for OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc (OMED.O).The company, which bought Receptos Inc last year to gain access to its inflammatory bowel disease drug, on Thursday forecast first-quarter adjusted profit of $1.27-$1.30 per share. Wall Street analysts were expecting the company to earn $1.30 per share on average. Celgene's net profit fell to $561 million, or 69 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $613.9 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.18 per share, underwhelming the average analyst estimate of $1.22, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's revenue rose about 23 percent to $2.56 billion in the quarter. Analysts were expecting revenue of about $2.54 billion. The company stuck to its 2016 earnings and revenue forecast it issued earlier in January, which was slightly below analysts' expectations.Chief Executive Bob Hugin said earlier this month he would step down as of March 1 and hand over the reins to President and Chief Operating Officer Mark Alles.

83,"  NEW YORK The tumble in share prices for biotechnology stocks has created some buying opportunities, with drugmakers Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) poised for a 30 percent rise over the next year, Barron's said. Both companies currently rely on closely related medications for the bulk of their income, creating risk, but the potential for diversification either through developing new treatments or being bought out could provide substantial upside, the publication said. Celgene, which specializes in treatments for a blood plasma cell cancer called myeloma, could see double-digit growth for its Revlimid drug for years to come, with significant growth potential from overseas, Barron's said.  Despite negative publicity related to high prices on its hepatitis-C drugs, Gilead Sciences' products often cure patients within months, the publication said.""That word, cure, isn't used often enough by Big Pharma,"" Barron's said.

91,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson's therapy for advanced multiple myeloma sharply reduced the risk of disease progression when taken with two standard treatments for the blood cancer, according to research the company hopes will pave the way for wider use of the treatment.The drug, Darzalex, received U.S. approval in November for use by itself among patients who had received at least three prior treatments for myeloma, a cancer of infection-fighting white blood cells. Data from a late-stage trial involving 498 patients who had previously undergone one or more myeloma treatments was released on Sunday. In the study, one group received Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's Velcade and the steroid dexamethasone, while the other group received Darzalex in combination with those two drugs. After more than seven months, 61 percent fewer patients taking the Darzalex combination experienced a worsening of their disease compared with those taking the standard two-drug regimen, meeting the trial's main goal. The median time to progression of disease has not yet been reached for the Darzalex group, compared with 7.2 months for patients taking the two-drug combo.The study was stopped in March after an independent data monitoring committee found the Darzalex regimen showed a statistically significant benefit. Some 19 percent of patients in the Darzalex group showed no further sign of disease, versus 9 percent of those taking  Velcade and dexamethasone. Significant disease reduction was seen in 83 percent taking the Darzalex regimen, versus 63 percent in the two-drug combination.The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in Chicago.The infused medicine, which has a list price of $135,000 for the first full year of treatment, blocks the CD38 protein found on myeloma cells. It was approved based on favorable data from two smaller trials, including a study in which tumors shrank in 29 percent of patients. Dr. Antonio Palumbo, the study's lead researcher, said in an interview that overall toxicity in the Darzalex regimen was similar to that seen with the two standard treatments. That may help the J&J drug become a second-line treatment, in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone, he said.The most common side effects for both drug combinations included low blood platelets, diarrhea and anemia.  Palumbo, melanoma unit chief at the University of Torino, Italy, said data from another late-stage study of Darzalex is expected later this month and will probably mirror strong results seen in his own study. In that trial, patients received Darzalex in combination with Celgene Corp's leading Revlimid (lenalidomide) treatment and with dexamethasone.Mark Wildgust, global head of hematology at J&J, said the company hopes the trial results will allow it to market Darzalex as an earlier treatment, and in combination with standard medicines.The National Cancer Institute estimates there are 26,850 new cases of multiple myeloma each year in the United States. The average life expectancy is four years.

108,"   By Natalie Grover  Amgen Inc said on Tuesday its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, did not fare better than Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's older therapy Velcade in a study involving patients who had not yet been treated for the disease.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved Kyprolis for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have previously undergone treatment.Patients treated with Kyprolis did not show a statistically significant improvement in slowing the cancer's progression compared with those given Velcade in the late-stage study.Expectations of peak annual sales of about $2.3 billion for Kyprolis are now likely to cool, particularly since newly diagnosed patients constitute the largest market in terms of the number of patients and duration of therapy, some analysts said.Multiple myeloma, a type of aggressive and incurable blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, kills about 12,600 people annually and will be diagnosed in about 30,000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society.Baird analyst Brian Skorney said approval for previously untreated patients was ""off the table"" for now. The head-to-head study tested Kyprolis against the older Velcade in patients who were also given the chemothereutic agent melphalan and the immunosuppressant prednisone, and were deemed to be ineligible for stem-cell transplants.On a conference call with analysts, the company and experts said the ""treatment landscape"" for multiple myeloma was evolving dramatically and that melphalan/prednisone-based regimens were now rarely used due to their low efficacy and high toxicity. Dr. Andrzej Jakubowiak, who was involved in the development of the Amgen drug, said on the call that the study was not the ideal way to evaluate Kyprolis in previously untreated patients. Amgen, whose shares were down 1.2 percent at $171.45, said it would continue to explore the drug's benefit in combination with other agents.Kyprolis is also being tested in a separate late-stage trial in combination with Celgene Corp's Revlimid and the steroid dexamethasone, or KRd, in this ""front-line setting.""Jakubowiak said KRd was his first choice for previously untreated patients, and the results of the melphalan/prednisone study would not change this. Kyprolis has already been shown to be superior to Velcade, which is expected to go generic in 2017, in the later stages of multiple myeloma.Kyprolis faces greater competitive pressure as newer entrants in the multiple myeloma market gain traction, including Johnson & Johnson's Darzalex, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Empliciti and Takeda's Ninlaro.The Amgen drug generated $172 million in revenue in the second quarter.

112,"   By Natalie Grover  U.S. biotechnology company Celgene Corp (CELG.O) raised its profit and revenue forecast for the year after posting third-quarter results ahead of Wall Street estimates, lifted by higher demand for its flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid.Celgene's shares jumped about 6.9 percent to $105.29 in Thursday morning trading.The drugmaker's top-selling treatment generated sales of $1.89 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $1.74 billion, according to Barclays. Revlimid sales accounted for about two-thirds of Celgene's total revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30.Revlimid is in ""beast mode"" and had a ""monster"" quarter, Cowen & Co analyst Eric Schmidt wrote in a client note, adding that European sales may finally be seeing the inflection that investors had hoped for following reimbursement approval in previously untreated myeloma patients.With Revlimid sales driven by new patient market share gains and longer duration of use, Celgene raised its full-year sales forecast for the medicine to $7 billion from $6.8 billion. Data from multiple studies on the drug is still to come, which could be a major growth driver for Revlimid, Celgene executives highlighted on a post-earnings call. Celgene also upped its adjusted full-year earnings forecast to a range of $5.88-$5.92 per share from a previous forecast of $5.70-$5.75 per share.The Summit, New Jersey-based company revised its revenue forecast to $11.2 billion from a previous estimate of $11 billion. The drugmaker said it now expected adjusted earnings and net product sales in the higher end of its projected 2017 forecast, and sales of Revlimid to cross $8 billion.Celgene has forecast full-year 2017 earnings of $6.75-$7.00 per share on net product sales of $12.7 billion-$13.0 billion.The company's new psoriasis drug Otezla, which is also being tested for atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, generated sales of $274.6 million in the third-quarter, roughly in line with the consensus estimate of $275 million. Its cancer treatment Abraxane generated sales of $233 million, trailing the consensus estimate by $17 million, while its other multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst brought in $341.1 million, ahead of expectations of $327 million.Excluding items, Celgene earned $1.58 per share in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose about 28 percent to $2.98 billion, in the quarter, above the average analyst estimate of $2.83 billion, driven primarily by rising sales volumes.

NXP's shares rose 2.32 percent, while Qualcomm was the top stock on the S&P at 4 percent higher. Stocks of other chipmakers including Micron Tech were also higher.The health sector rose 0.78 percent, the top gainer among the 11 major S&P 500 indexes, led by gains in Bristol-Myers and Celgene following strong results.The health sector has been among the worst performers this month as investors remain concerned about policies such as drug pricing which has been a key point of discussion in the run-up to the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. ""Thus far with low expectations for earnings growth, profits have pleasantly surprised to the upside and there is a little bit of a rotation taking place out of big single names like Apple into other names like Tesla,"" said John Brady, senior vice president at R.J. O'Brien & Associates in Chicago.""Likewise, energy names are under-owned and if crude stays around the $50 level, money is going to come out of the sidelines and into these companies.""Oil prices rose for the first time this week on Thursday as a further drop in U.S. crude inventories countered investor doubts that OPEC will be able to implement a production cut.At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 30.44 points, or 0.17 percent, at 18,229.77. The S&P 500 was up 3.84 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,143.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 16.57 points, or 0.32 percent, at 5,266.84.Data on Thursday showed the number of American filing for jobless claims fell last week, pointing to a firming labor market, while a separate report showed new orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods unexpectedly fell in September amid weak demand for electronic products.The data will play into the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates at its policy meeting next week. Though a rate hike is not the likely outcome of the meeting that falls days before the U.S. presidential election, traders expect the Fed to chalk a more definite path for a move in December.Twitter rose nearly 5 percent after its quarterly results beat expectations. The technology sector was the second biggest boost on the S&P.Tesla jumped 4.4 percent to $211.33 after the electric carmaker reported its first quarterly net profit in more than three years.F5 Networks jumped nearly 10 percent and was the biggest gainer on the S&P, after its quarterly revenue beat estimates.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,395 to 1,200. On the Nasdaq, 1,400 issues rose and 763 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 32 new highs and 24 new lows.
