HP Inc's shares were down 7.1 percent in extended trading on Tuesday, while HPE's shares were up 2.3 percent.""Looking ahead, we expect the PC market to remain challenged for more quarters to come,"" HP Inc's Chief Executive Dion Weisler said on a conference call with analyst.PC sales have been falling sharply worldwide and the recent launch of Windows 10 has so far failed to reboot the industry.Revenue in HP's personal computer and printer businesses fell about 14 percent in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, pushing Hewlett-Packard Co's overall revenue down for the fifth straight quarter. The results are the last for Hewlett-Packard Co, the tech pioneer that split into two separate companies this month, before HP Inc and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co start to report separately.The 76-year-old company has struggled in recent years to keep up with newer technologies and trends, such as the shift by consumers to smartphones and tablets and by businesses to the Internet to store and manage large amounts of data.HP Inc forecast adjusted profit of 33-38 cents per share for the quarter ending January, missing analysts' average estimate of 42 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also cut its 2016 adjusted profit forecast to $1.59-$1.69 per share from $1.67-$1.77 per share.Hewlett-Packard Co's revenue from enterprise services division fell 9 percent, while revenue from its enterprise group rose 2 percent.Overall, revenue at Hewlett-Packard Co fell 9.5 percent to $25.71 billion.Net income fell to $1.32 billion from $1.33 billion a year earlier. But on a per share basis, profit rose to 73 cents per share from 70 cents, based on fewer shares outstanding.Up to Tuesday's close of $13.69, HPE shares had fallen 7 percent since their market debut on Nov. 2.In contrast, HP Inc's shares, which closed at $14.64, had risen about 20 percent.

He has proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States and declined a journalist's invitation on Sunday to condemn the Ku Klux Klan, the violent white-supremacist group.Christie, who scrapped his own presidential bid earlier this month, became the most prominent Republican figure to break ranks with party leadership by endorsing Trump on Friday ahead of this week's ""Super Tuesday"" contests, when voters in 11 states go to the polls.Whitman, who was a co-chairwoman of the national finance committee of Christie's campaign, said in a statement to reporters that Trump would take the country on ""a dangerous journey"" and that Christie was aware of this.""Chris Christie's endorsement of Donald Trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism. Donald Trump is unfit to be president"", said the statement from Whitman, who is chief executive and president of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and chairman of HP Inc (HPQ.N). She called on Christie's donors not to follow him to Trump, who has predominantly funded his campaign with personal loans. Representatives of Christie and Trump did not respond to requests for comment.Earlier on Sunday, Trump was asked repeatedly if he would unequivocally condemn the Klan and other support from white supremacists.""I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,"" Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper after being asked about his endorsement by David Duke, a former Klan leader. ""If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong."" Previously, Trump had seemed less uncertain about his views on Duke. ""David Duke endorsed me?"" he said in a response to a reporter. ""Alright. I disavow. OK?"" His latest backer, Senator Sessions, has had to defend his own controversial comments about the Klan in the past. In 1986, he admitted during an unsuccessful confirmation hearing to become a federal judge that he had said he thought the Klan was ""OK"" until he came to believe that some members smoked marijuana. He explained that these remarks were a joke and has since called the Klan ""destestable.""    In a separate interview on Sunday, Trump also defended posting on his Twitter account a quote sometimes attributed to Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini. He told NBC News he did not realize that the quote - ""It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep"" - was associated Mussolini but said it did not matter because it was a good aphorism all the same.Many party leaders hope U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will somehow overtake Trump before the party's nominating convention in July, despite Rubio's not having won any states and lagging behind in Trump in opinion polls.

11,"  MUMBAI Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) is nearing a deal to acquire Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) (HPE.N) controlling stake worth about $940 million in Indian IT outsourcing services provider MphasiS Ltd (MBFL.NS), according to three sources directly involved in the deal.HPE owns roughly 60.5 percent stake in MphasiS, and the U.S.-based parent had been looking to exit from the Indian venture to shore up its capital.Bids for buying the MphasiS stake were submitted earlier this month and the U.S. private equity firm has emerged as the front-runner for taking majority ownership of the mid-sized Indian IT services exporter, the sources said.Financial details of the possible deal were not immediately known. Based on MphasiS' stock price on Thursday, the HPE stake in the Bengaluru-headquartered company is valued at about $940 million. The company's total market value is about $1.6 billion.Blackstone and HPE declined to comment, while MphasiS did not respond to emails seeking comment.MphasiS, whose rivals include outsourcers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS.NS) and Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS), is not likely to command a very high valuation as a major part of its business depends on subcontracting by HPE, one of the sources said. Until a few years ago, MphasiS generated roughly half of its revenue by providing services to HPE's clients. This has now come down to 24 percent of the firm's total revenue, it said in its latest annual report.The MphasiS deal, if closed, will be one of the biggest M&A transactions in India's $150 billion outsourcing sector, and underscores foreign investors' confidence in growth potential as western clients send more jobs to India to cut costs. Last month, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte [GIC.UL] and PE investors Advent International and Bain Capital jointly bought a minority stake in India-focussed outsourcing firm QuEST Global Services for $350 million.MphasiS was formed in 2000 and six years later Electronics Data Systems Corp acquired a majority holding in the company. In 2008, EDS was acquired by Hewlett Packard, which resulted in the transfer of the shareholding to the computer maker.A pact on the deal could be signed by early next month, two of the sources said, cautioning the acquisition terms had not yet been finalised.

28,  May 25 S&P: * Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. 'BBB' rating affirmed on planned Enterprise Services business divestiture; outlook stable  Source text - bit.ly/247pJoy Further company coverage:  ,2016-05-25,HPE,"Wed May 25, 2016 | 8:55am EDT",BRIEF-S&P affirms Hewlett Packard Enterprise's 'BBB' rating,http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSFWN18M0AA?type=companyNews
29,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Computer  Sciences Corporation (CSC), including the 'BBB' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings  (IDR), on its plan to merge with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) information  technology (IT) services segment, Enterprise Services (ES). Fitch's actions  affect $5.1 billion of total debt, including the undrawn $2.5 billion revolving  credit facility (RCF). The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this release.  The affirmation reflects Fitch's belief the merger of CSC and ES is modestly net  credit positive, given meaningfully increased scale and diversification and  significant merger related cost synergies, which should partially offset the  addition of $18 billion of revenues with lower profit and cash flow margins. CSC announced on May 24, 2016 its board approved a plan to merge the company  with HPE's ES segment in a tax-free transaction. HPE first will spin off the ES  segment to HPE's shareholders, excluding the small cloud management systems  business. The subsequent merger of CSC and ES should deliver approximately $8.5  billion to HPE's shareholders, including a more than $4.5 billion equity stake  in the combined company, $1.5 billion cash dividend, the retirement of $1.6  billion of HPE debt, the assumption of $300 million of Electronic Data Systems  senior notes due 2029 and transfer of $600 million HPE net pension liabilities  to CSC. Fitch expects the combined company will fund the cash dividend and retirement of  HPE debt with approximately $3.1 billion of incremental debt. Pro forma for the  combination, Fitch estimates total leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA)  will be 2.2x (1.7x including $1 billion of cost synergies), roughly flat from  Fitch's estimates of total leverage on a standalone basis, as well as for fiscal  2016. Fitch notes CSC has been on track to deleverage over the intermediate term  with FCF from elevated total leverage due to the partially debt-financed  acquisitions of UXC and Xchanging. Over the longer term, Fitch expects CSC will  maintain total leverage below 2x. Pro forma for the merger, shareholders of CSC and HPE will each own 50% of the  combined company. CSC expects to close the merger by March 2017, pending  customary regulatory approvals. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Increased scale and diversification: Fitch expects increased scale and  diversification as a result of the merger will smooth operating performance. The  deal adds approximately $18 billion of revenue and creates the third-largest  global IT services company with $26 billion in annual revenue. Fitch also  expects CSC's strength in insurance, healthcare and financial services combined  with ES's strength in pharma, transportation, travel and telecom, with minimal  customer overlap, should reduce operating volatility. --Significant cost reduction roadmap: Fitch expects the combined entity's  significant cost reduction roadmap will drive pro forma blended profit margin  expansion. CSC expects $1 billion of total cost synergies in year one and $1.5  billion of run-rate cost savings from synergies exiting year one. As a result,  Fitch expects operating EBITDA margin will increase to the high-teens over the  intermediate term from the mid-teens, pro forma for the combination, and a Fitch  estimated 17% for fiscal 2016 on a standalone basis.  --Constrained top-line: Fitch expects organic constant currency revenue growth  will remain constrained over the intermediate term, driven by secular shifts to  the cloud from on-premise solutions and, to a lesser extent, a more cautious  spending environment and customer rationalization initiatives. However, Fitch  also expects significant revenue growth in next-generation service offerings  (cloud, cyber and applications), which will be $3 billion on a combined basis,  to remain robust and offset declines in legacy in the intermediate term,  resulting in a low-single-digit long-term top-line CAGR.  --Meaningfully stronger FCF: Fitch expects the combination to result in  meaningfully stronger annual FCF beyond the near term, driven by the addition of  roughly $1.8 billion of operating EBITDA and anticipated $1 billion of total  cost synergies in year one, and $1.5 billion of run-rate cost savings from  synergies exiting year one. Fitch projects $1 billion to $2 billion of annual  FCF through the forecast period, excluding cash payments related to cost  synergies. Fitch expects the company will use FCF for debt reduction (term loan  amortization), as well as tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases. --Ongoing acquisitions activity: Fitch believes CSC's ongoing acquisition  activity will strengthen the company's operating profile over the longer term  but present near-term integration risks. CSC closed the acquisitions of UXC and  Xchanging during the fourth fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2016, and they should  add next-generation capabilities and potential cost synergies in the back half  of fiscal 2017. The merger with ES more than triples CSC's revenue base but we  believe the integration of ES, UXC and Xchanging heighten execution risks over  the intermediate term.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the Rating Case for CSC include:  --CSC and ES merge at the beginning of FY2018.  --Flat to low-single-digit organic constant currency revenue growth in FY2017  and beyond.  --Operating EBITDA margin expands to 17% in fiscal 2017, to 19% in fiscal 2018  and more than 20% beyond, driven by the achievement of merger-related cost  synergies.  --Restructuring costs to achieve synergies and integration costs are $1.5  billion in fiscal 2018 and $800 million in fiscal 2019.  --FCF used for debt reduction and, to a lesser extent, tuck-in acquisitions and  share repurchases. --Capex remains near 6.5% of revenues through fiscal 2017 then declines to  approximately 5%.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions could occur if Fitch expects:  --Sustained positive organic revenue growth, resulting from growth in  next-generation services offsetting declines in legacy services; and  --Annual FCF of more than $5 billion through the cycle.  Negative rating action could occur if Fitch expects:  --Total leverage sustained above 2x from weaker than expected profitability;  --CSC does not expect positive organic revenue growth in the intermediate term  or positive operating trends in the near term, indicating heightened investments  in cloud-based solutions are not sufficiently competitive to offset declines in  legacy offerings.  LIQUIDITY Fitch believes CSC's liquidity was solid at April 1, 2016 and supported by:  --$1.2 billion of cash and investments;  -- $2.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under a revolving credit  facility expiring 2020; --$200 million of available capacity under a committed leasing facility for  capital expenditures on IT equipment and associated software. More than $500 million of annual FCF also supports liquidity.  Total debt was $2.6 billion at April 1, 2016.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Computer Sciences Corp.  --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';  --Revolving Credit Facility at 'BBB';  --Senior Unsecured Term Loan at 'BBB';  --Senior Unsecured Debt at 'BBB';  --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'.  CSC Capital Funding Limited  --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: CSC Capital Funding Limited  --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'.  CSC Computer Sciences UK Holdings Limited  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB';  --Senior Unsecured Term Loan at 'BBB'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Whitman could not immediately be reached for comment.     A billionaire and former supporter of failed candidate New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Whitman has been actively working to stop Trump's nomination, including fundraising for an anti-Trump Super PAC.  In February, the technology CEO called Trump ""unfit"" to be president.

After weeks of holding out, Ryan endorsed the New York businessman in early June, breaking with a number of establishment Republicans who see Trump's rhetoric as damaging to the party. The opponents include Romney, Republicans' 2012 presidential nominee, who chose Ryan as his running mate.Romney has blasted Trump in recent weeks for attacks he has made on the Mexican-American judge presiding over a case against him, with Romney warning on Friday about the effect that ""trickle-down racism"" could have on the country. As the presumptive nominee, Trump now has to balance maintaining the outsider style that helped propel him to the nomination, while courting Republican insiders, who could be critical to financing a general election campaign against a well-funded Clinton.

""It seems the recent deterioration in survey and inflation data is still not enough to push the ECB to ease further. While today's inaction on policy is not too surprising, given their traditionally deliberate nature, we were expecting some language that would help prepare the market for easing later this year,"" said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets EMEA.The STOXX 600 was down 0.9 percent by 1330 GMT, dropping from near eight-month highs. The index is down around 5 percent in 2016, although it has rallied over the last two months from lows reached in June after Britain's shock 'Brexit' vote to quit the European Union.Pearson was the top faller on Thursday, tumbling 7.1 percent on readacross from disappointing results from U.S. peer John Wiley.Chip makers also came under pressure, with Austria Microsystems, ASML and Dialog Semiconductor  down 3-5.5 percent, after Apple, a major user of chips, released a new iPhone which analysts said was underwhelming.Among risers, British software company Micro Focus  surged around 17 percent, the best-performing stock on the STOXX 600 index, after sealing an $8.8 billion deal for Hewlett Packard Enterprise to merge its non-core software assets with Micro Focus's business.However, Rocket Internet fell 3.3 percent after the German e-commerce investment company cut the valuation of its Home24 online furniture business.

Micro Focus rose around 20 percent, the best-performing stock on the STOXX 600 index, after sealing an $8.8 billion deal for Hewlett Packard Enterprise to merge its non-core software assets with Micro Focus's business.However, Rocket Internet fell 5 percent after the German e-commerce investment company cut the valuation of its Home24 online furniture business. Many investors were also focusing on a European Central Bank meeting later in the day.Expectations of more pledges to help the sluggish euro zone economy from ECB President Mario Draghi have pushed down bond yields, which in turn has driven investors over to the better returns available from stocks and company dividends.""Draghi isn't anywhere near to achieving his goals, and he might very well continue to assure the market that there might be more to come and that he still has tools available to boost growth,"" said Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets Limited. The euro zone economy is widely expected to need more stimulus from the central bank, but it may not come at the bank's policy meeting on Thursday.Growth and inflation remain weak, but the ECB has already exhausted much of its firepower, so Draghi has to pick his time and probably has enough arguments to wait a bit longer.Nonetheless, it is probably just a matter of months before the ECB eases policy further, acknowledging that inflation is not moving higher, despite free credit to banks, record-low interest rates and money printing worth 1.2 trillion euros ($1.35 trillion) in the past year and a half.The STOXX 600 index is down around 4 percent so far in 2016, although it has rallied over the last two months from lows reached back in June after Britain's shock 'Brexit' vote to quit the European Union.

56,"   By Guy Faulconbridge, Kate Holton and Andrew MacAskill | LONDON  LONDON Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union chilled deal making activity involving British companies to the lowest level in at least two decades as bosses grapple with what Brexit will cost, Thomson Reuters data shows.The figures give a glimpse of how Brexit and an array of wider global uncertainties are affecting the behavior of chief executives, and the teams of bankers, lawyers and advisers who make money from buying and selling companies.Headline-grabbing deals such as the audacious $32 billion bid by Japan's SoftBank (9984.T) for Britain's most valuable technology company ARM ARM.L might make it appear that all is well in the world of mergers and acquisitions (M&A).However, the aggregate number paints a different picture.The number of deals involving UK companies fell to 707, a total value of $87.43 billion, in the 11 weeks since the Brexit vote. That was down from 1,060 deals worth a total of $125.22 billion in the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data of pending and completed mergers and acquisitions.While the total value of deals where British companies were targets rose to $45.77 billion from $45.66 billion over the period, it was bolstered by the Softbank-ARM deal. The number of deals involving British companies and the number of deals where British companies were takeover targets both fell to the lowest level in at least two decades.""There is no doubt about it: M&A activity has declined,"" Tim Gee, London-based M&A partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie, told Reuters. ""You see very significant caution.""""There is still a reasonable amount of activity by outside investors buying into the UK but there is very little UK to UK activity,"" Gee said. ""This year is going to be off -- there is no doubt about that.""SOFTBANK STEPS IN The Brexit vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar.But less than a week after Theresa May entered Downing Street to replace David Cameron as British prime minister, Softbank founder Masayoshi Son made his move for ARM.Despite warnings before the vote that Brexit would shatter economic confidence, some positive data since the vote has stoked the perception that the British economy could prosper.The Confederation of British Industry said this month that the economy had largely avoided a big hit from the Brexit vote but ratings agency Standard & Poor's said that signs of a recovery may prove to be a ""mirage"". The Softbank deal and much better economic data than was predicted have been cited by May as evidence that investors are confident that Britain will make a success of Brexit.""The single biggest vote of confidence on investment in the United Kingdom since we had the vote to leave ​the European Union came, of course, from a Japanese company - from SoftBank with its 24 billion pound takeover of ARM,"" May told parliament last week.Softbank's takeover of ARM accounts for more than a third of the value of deals involving UK companies in the post-Brexit vote period, Thomson Reuters data shows.""The Softbank-ARM deal really skews the data on the value of deals. If you take out Softbank-ARM, it was pretty quiet,"" said one top banker who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.""For a bank the revenue pool is driven by the number of deals which is a better approximation of the available fee pot than volume because of the lumpiness of volume,"" the banker added.Without Softbank-ARM, the value of M&A involving British companies and deals targeting British businesses would also both be significantly below trend for the last decade, and around the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.PIERCING THE GLOOM  The ARM deal generated several hundred million dollars in fees for bankers and advisers and also ensured Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Lazard and UBS topped the ranking of post-Brexit UK involvement M&A, according to Thomson Reuters data.Goldman, which said before the June 23 vote that it may restructure its British operations if voters opted to leave the EU, was top of the ranking, advising on $49.6 billion of UK deals, followed by Lazard and UBS (UBSG.S).Softbank advisers Raine, a U.S. boutique investment bank, London-based Robey Warshaw and Japan's Mizuho Securities MZFGX.UL came fourth equal in the rankings, again due to the ARM purchase.Even after the turmoil triggered by the Brexit vote, bankers said the deal data was better than they had expected on June 24 -- the day of the Brexit result.Bankers pointed to other big transactions including last week's proposed purchase by Britain's Micro Focus (MCRO.L) of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co's (HPE.N) software business in an $8.8 billion deal.""The summary is that UK M&A activity is stronger than we would have anticipated in the aftermath of the UK's EU vote"" said Matthew Smith, co-head of UK investment banking at Barclays.""Based on what we have seen in the last three months we expect a fairly robust pattern of M&A,"" said Smith, who pointed to the devaluation of sterling and cheap borrowing as positive for the British M&A market. The decline in sterling has made it cheaper for foreign companies to snap up British targets, said Eamonn O'Hare, chief executive of the listed investment firm Zegona, set up to buy TMT companies in Europe.""UK assets are very vulnerable to international takeovers because of the impact of the 20 percent depreciation,"" he said. ""There are quite a few companies that have got foreign currency incomes and their share prices have fallen.""GLOBAL SLOWDOWN For sure, 2015 was a record year for global M&A, marked out by Anheuser-Busch InBev's (ABI.BR) $100-billion-plus bid for SABMiller SAB.L.Worldwide deal making totaled $4.7 trillion during 2015, an increase of 42 percent compared to 2014 and the strongest annual period for merger activity since records began in 1980. Over the first eight months of this year, global M&A fell to $2.2 trillion with 28,720 deals from $2.9 trillion on 30,894 deals in the same period last year.Even before the vote, Brexit jitters had taken a toll with M&A activity in Britain and Europe at its lowest as a proportion of global activity in a generation.Bankers, many of whom warned before the vote that Britain would lose business from Brexit, said they saw a host of concerns that could dampen sentiment, including the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November, French and German elections next year, terrorism and euro zone growth.In Britain, bankers said they were looking for clarity on what Brexit might mean for companies, the new government's views on takeovers of British companies and a decision by PM May on the $24 billion Hinkley Point nuclear power project.British politicians have objected in recent years to some international takeovers including Pfizer's (PFE.N) failed bid to buy AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and the successful move by Kraft to buy British chocolate maker Cadbury.""Brexit is one of the headwinds we face in M&A including the U.S. presidential election,"" the senior banker who asked not to be named said.""It is too early to say how 2017 will look.

62,"   By Nate Raymond  The former chief financial officer of British software company Autonomy has been indicted on U.S. charges of engaging in a fraudulent scheme to deceive investors and Hewlett Packard (HPE.N) about his firm's performance before its sale in 2011.Sushovan Hussain, a UK resident who was Autonomy's CFO at the time of its $11 billion acquisition by HP, was charged in an indictment filed on Thursday in federal court in San Francisco with conspiracy and wire fraud.The indictment alleged that beginning in October 2009, Hussain and others sought to deceive Autonomy's investors and HP about the company's performance, financial condition and prospects for growth.The scheme had several objectives, the indictment said, including to artificially increase and maintain Autonomy's share price to make the company attractive to potential buyers like HP. Hussain, who remains in the United Kingdom, has not been arrested. John Keker, his lawyer, said in a statement on Friday that Hussain was innocent and would be acquitted at trial.""He defrauded no one and, as Autonomy's CFO, acted at all times with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and competence,"" Keker said.The indictment marked the latest fallout from the deal, which was supposed to form the central part of HP's move into software but instead led the U.S. company a year later to write-off three-quarters of Autonomy's value. Last year, HP sued Autonomy's co-founder Mike Lynch and Hussain, seeking $5.1 billion in a lawsuit that accused them of engaging in fraudulent activities to boost the company's value.Both men have denied wrongdoing. Lynch countersued HP last year, saying at the time that ""HP was simply incompetent in its operation of Autonomy, and the acquisition was doomed from the very beginning."" Hewlett Packard Enterprise did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for former Autonomy management, including Lynch and Hussain, said that the group is certain of Hussain's innocence and HP lied to the markets and shareholders.The case is U.S. v. Hussain, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-cr-00462.
