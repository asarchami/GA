0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has revised Edison International's  (EIX) Rating Outlook to Positive from Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the  ratings of EIX and its core utility operating subsidiary, Southern California  Edison (SCE), as follows: EIX --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured at 'BBB'. SCE --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Senior secured at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured at 'A'; --Senior secured pollution control revenue bonds at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured pollution control revenue bonds at 'A'; --Preferred at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'; --Short-term secured at 'F1'.     The Rating Outlook for SCE is Stable.  Approximately $11.2 billion of EIX and SCE long- and short-term debt outstanding  as of Sept. 30, 2013 is affected by the rating actions.  Key rating drivers for EIX and SCE include: --Uncertainty regarding claw-backs in Edison Mission Energy's (EME) bankruptcy  proceeding; --The balanced regulatory compact in the state of California and the ability to  timely recover prudently incurred costs in rates; --Strong projected utility operating cash flows, earnings and credit metrics; --SCE's tiered rate structure and long-term concerns around competitive inroads  from alternative energy supply. The Positive Rating Outlook at EIX reflects the meaningful improvement to its  consolidated creditworthiness as greater clarity emerges during pending EME  bankruptcy proceedings.  While the timing of the acquisition of EME by NRG Energy, Inc.(NRG), targeted by  NRG to close by the end of first quarter 2014, is uncertain, the proposed  acquisition, in Fitch's view, moves EME closer to resolution of its  restructuring in bankruptcy. Fitch believes a reasonable outcome regarding  claw-back efforts by certain EME creditors later this year would support  improving EIX credit ratings and a potential equalization of EIX and SCE's IDRs  over time in a reasonable worst-case scenario. Future adverse developments in the EME bankruptcy from an EIX credit  point-of-view cannot be ruled out and are a source of uncertainty for investors.  Nonetheless, a reasonable solution to pending claw-back issues is a likely  catalyst for future EIX credit rating upgrades and supports the Rating Outlook  revision to Positive at EIX. The affirmation of EIX and SCE's ratings primarily reflects the strong credit  profile of the holding company's core operating electric utility subsidiary,  SCE. The utility benefits from a balanced state and federal regulatory environment  that includes, among other credit-supportive features, revenue decoupling,  forward test years in regularly scheduled general rate cases (GRC), bifurcation  of cost-of-capital proceedings from GRCs, pre-approval of capex, and riders for  recovery of key expense items outside of GRC proceedings. The balanced regulatory compact in California mitigates concerns regarding SCE's  large capex program, which is expected to be approximately $18 billion-$21  billion during 2013-2017. Fitch estimates that EIX and SCE's EBITDA-to-interest  and debt-to-EBITDA ratios will be better than 7.0x and 3.0x, respectively,  during 2013-2017.  Fitch's 2013 and 2014 estimates reflect revenue increases approved by the  California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in SCE's 2012 GRC. In addition to  a test-year rate increase of $272 million, the CPUC's final decision in the 2012  GRC approved attrition-year rate increases of $358 million and $356 million,  respectively, in 2013 and 2014.  In its final 2012 GRC decision, the CPUC approved total rate increases during  2012-2014 representing approximately 54% of the utility's request. Going forward, Fitch assumes that the final decision in SCE's pending 2015 GRC  will be generally consistent with the balanced outcome in the utility's 2012  GRC.  Fitch notes that an unexpected, significant deterioration in the regulatory  compact in California that would result in debt-to-EBITDA weakening to 3.4x or  worse on a sustained basis would likely trigger future credit rating downgrades  for SCE. Fitch believes a material deterioration in California regulation is a  low probability event in the near- to intermediate-term.   The utility and its parent company's credit ratings reflect potential secular  risks associated with California's strong commitment to low carbon energy policy  and technologies. In this regard, Fitch believes that enactment of A.B.327 is a  constructive development.  The legislation provides authority to the CPUC to adjust residential rates and  implement fixed charges, among other things, to address residential  cost-shifting issues and provide appropriate incentives to balance the interests  of customers and the investor-owned utilities (IOU). Fitch's ratings for SCE and EIX consider the utility's investment in the retired  San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) and the commission's pending order  instituting investigation (OII) to consider related cost recovery issues. Fitch  believes precedent in the state supports full recovery of SCE's prudently  incurred costs related to the utility's investment in SONGS. SONGS related  operating issues are not expected by Fitch to trigger future credit rating  downgrades. Fitch notes that SCE recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $575 million ($365  million after tax) in second quarter 2013 due to the early retirement of SONGS  and its reclassification as a deferred asset.  The retired nuclear facility represents approximately $1.2 billion of rate base  and $2.1 billion of net investment, which compares to a year-end 2013 expected  SCE rate base of more than $20 billion and total assets as of Sept. 30, 2013 of  $46.3 billion.  SCE announced its decision to permanently retire SONGS Units 2 and 3 in June  2013 due to unexpected heat transfer tube wear in replacement generators at both  units. SONGS had been out-of-service since January 2012 when a tube leak was  discovered in Unit 3. The ratings for EIX and SCE also consider CPUC regulations that limit dividends  and cash distributions from the utility to EIX. EIX relies on dividends from SCE  and benefits from its tax-sharing agreement to meet its obligations. There are  no cross defaults, inter-company loans or guarantees between EME and either EIX  or SCE. RATING SENSITIVITIES Greater clarity with regard to EIX's exposure to the EME restructuring in  bankruptcy could result in an upgrade for EIX.  The following might lead to a downgrade: Conversely, significant deterioration in the regulatory compact in California  could result in credit rating downgrades at EIX and SCE. In addition, an  unexpected change in EIX management strategy that tilted toward aggressive  diversification and/or shareholder-friendly actions, including debt-funded share  repurchases, could lead to future credit downgrades. In the longer term,  increasing competitive pressure from alternative technologies could result in  future credit downgrades.  Contact:  Primary Analyst Philip W.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 18 (Fitch) Bankruptcy court approval of the plan of  reorganization (POR) moves Edison International (EIX) closer to a final  resolution of its exposure to Edison Mission Energy's (EME) insolvency and, in  Fitch Ratings' opinion, represents a positive development for EIX's  creditworthiness. On March 11, 2014, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern  District of Illinois, Eastern Division, approved EME's POR, positioning EME to  emerge free of liabilities. From a broader industry perspective, EME's insolvency underscores the challenges  facing merchant generators. Among these challenges are Fitch's expectations for  a continuation of relatively low power and gas prices, as well as rising costs  related to environmental regulations and modest prospective sales growth due to  competitive pressures from both energy-use efficiency and renewable generation.  The approved POR incorporates the settlement agreement reached between EME, EIX  and certain EME creditors in February 2014. Fitch upgraded EIX's ratings and  placed them on Rating Watch Positive on Feb. 21, 2014, in anticipation of  bankruptcy court approval of the POR. Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch  Positive upon closing of the pending sale of certain EME assets to NRG Energy,  Inc. and the formation of the new trust contemplated by the settlement  agreement. Under the terms of the POR, EME will remain a subsidiary of EIX, while EIX will  assume certain income tax and pension liabilities approximating $350 million and  retain certain tax attributes totaling an estimated $1.191 billion. All assets  and liabilities of EME that are not assumed by EIX, discharged in bankruptcy or  transferred to NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) under the POR will be transferred to a  newly formed trust to be controlled by EME creditors. The closing of the sale of EME assets to NRG and the settlement transaction is  expected to occur around late March or early April 2014. Upon closing, EIX will  pay $225 million to the trust. EIX will make two additional payments in  September 2015 and 2016 following the final determination of tax attributes to  be shared between both EIX and EME's creditors under the terms of the POR. Total  payments from EIX to the trust are expected to approximate $635 million,  approximately one-half of the value of the tax attributes.   Contact:  Philip W.

4,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared ready to give Edison International employees who accused the utility of favoring higher-cost mutual funds over lower-cost ones in its retirement plan a chance to revive some of their claims.Based on questions asked during a one-hour oral argument, the nine justices look set to throw out an appeals court ruling that limited the number of claims that could be made in the case involving Edison's retirement plan management. There appeared to be consensus among the justices that a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of Edison was flawed. But it was uncertain how far the justices will go in explaining exactly when the role of a fiduciary like Edison in monitoring a plan's performance can trigger liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA.The plaintiffs and Edison both agree that there is a duty to monitor, but they disagree over what that entails. Depending on how the decision is written, the case could give 401(k) plan participants more leeway to sue their employers for putting investments that impose excessive fees into their plans. Justice Stephen Breyer indicated that he favored sending the case back to the lower courts, saying ""there is a problem with me suddenly, or any of us, describing this fiduciary duty, the nature of it, whether it's violated here or not"" when it was not fully addressed earlier in the litigation.

13,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by Edison International employees in California who accused the utility of favoring higher-cost mutual funds over lower-cost ones in its retirement plan, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling backing the workers. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said that while the Supreme Court in May 2015 ruled that federal law imposes an ongoing duty to monitor investments on fiduciaries like Edison, the workers failed to raise that argument in lower courts.The Supreme Court decision, which revived the Edison case and sent it back to the 9th Circuit, will likely make it easier for 401(k) plan participants to sue their employers for choosing investments that impose excessive fees, especially when those decisions were made years before lawsuits are filed.But the 9th Circuit on Wednesday said that before reaching the Supreme Court, Edison employees argued merely that changes to their plan triggered a duty to monitor, and not that the obligation was ongoing, so they could not make that claim now.The case concerned exactly when the role of a retirement plan administrator in monitoring a plan's performance can trigger liability under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. The plaintiffs and Edison agreed there was a duty to monitor, but disagreed over what that entailed.Employees filed suit against Edison subsidiary Southern California Edison Company, which said in a statement that Wednesday's ruling reflected the company's efforts to act in the best interests of 401(k) plan participants. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment.The employees argued the company breached its fiduciary duty by, among other things, offering higher-cost mutual funds to plan participants despite the fact that identical lower-cost funds were available.The main legal issue was whether some of the lawsuit's claims were barred by a six-year statute of limitations under ERISA. The Supreme Court said liability is triggered by the fiduciary's ongoing role monitoring the plan's performance, so the six-year clock routinely resets.  In 2010, a federal judge in California said the claims against Edison were barred. The 9th Circuit agreed in a 2013 decision that the high court last year overturned.The case is Tibble v. Edison International, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 10-56406.
