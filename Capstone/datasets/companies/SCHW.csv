2,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A strong January prompted brokerage Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) on Wednesday to raise its forecasts for revenue and profit margins for 2014.Revenue, which totaled $5.4 billion in 2013, will likely grow at a ""high single-digit rate"" this year, Chief Financial Officer Joe Martinetto said in a ""business update"" conference with analysts on Wednesday. In late October, Martinetto more cautiously estimated the rise would be in the ""mid-to-high single digits.""Robust trading volume and the addition of almost $12 billion in new money to customer accounts last month spurred his rosier projections.The forecast assumes that the S&P 500 index will gain 6.5 percent this year, client trades will grow 5 to 6 percent over last year and short-term U.S. interest rates will stay at rock-bottom levels.Martinetto did not make a direct earnings forecast but said pretax profit margin, a key indicator of profitability, should jump to ""around 34 percent"" this year from 31.4 percent in 2013. Three months ago he was vaguer, saying the margin would likely top 30 percent.Merrill Lynch, Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) wealth and investment management unit, had a pretax profit margin of 26.6 percent last quarter, and senior executives said Tuesday that the margin should rise above 30 percent if interest rates rise to more ""normal"" levels. Most economists expect rates to remain low through most of 2014. Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) wealth business had a margin of 19 percent last quarter and aims to elevate it to between 22 and 25 percent by the end of 2015.Low interest rates remain a key factor depressing profit at Schwab and other large brokerage firms that make much of their money by investing the cash that clients keep in their brokerage accounts. Although longer-term rates have inched up slowly in a reviving U.S. economy, Schwab remains captive to short-term rates that remain stalled well below 1 percent, Martinetto said.Out of about $252 billion of interest-rate sensitive assets, some $240 billion is invested in short-term markets keyed to the federal funds rate that sits at 0.25 percent. ""There is still pressure at the short end, and we're very levered to short rates,"" Martinetto said. Last year, for one example, Schwab waived $674 million of fees on clients' money-market accounts because the charge would have led to a negative return.In a more normal rate environment, Schwab makes more money on cash kept in its bank than in money market funds. Chief Executive Walt Bettinger said Tuesday that when rates rise the firm is likely to make it more difficult for clients to have their cash swept into money funds. ""There may be opportunities to modify money fund eligibility and free up significant dollars that can be moved into the bank, with wider spreads and very attractive returns on equity,"" he said.Schwab currently opens money-market funds to clients who have minimum accounts per household of $500,000, or $100,000 for clients of independent investment advisers who use Schwab for trades and custodial services. Schwab's upbeat 2014 forecast was underscored by its report that clients averaged 588,000 trades a day in January, up 17 percent from December and January 2013. Total clients assets at the end of January were $2.2 trillion, up 10 percent from a year earlier.If Schwab has excess cash to use going forward, priorities will be to raise employee compensation, which had been constrained since 2009, Martinetto said. Bettinger said the firm also hopes to open more full-service branches in wealthy areas of the United States, and singled out Charlotte, North Carolina, the headquarters of Bank of America, as one area where it needs representation.Schwab, which has been shifting its emphasis from do-it-yourself traders to people who want advice on their investments, has about 200 full-service branches, well below the more than 500 that competitors such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch boast.Shares of Schwab, up 52.4 percent over the past 12 months, inched up 16 cents, or .62 percent, in trading on Wednesday.(Reporting By Jed Horowitz; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-02-12,SCHW,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 5:44pm EST",Schwab raises revenue and profit outlook for 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-schwab-revenue-forecast-idUSBREA1B29Z20140212?type=companyNews

4,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 20 A family brokerage team who had been at Wells Fargo Advisors for more than a decade and manage more than $300 million of assets for wealthy clients resigned on Wednesday to start an independent registered investment advisory firm.Gerald Strid, his sons Erik and Paul and two other brokers folded the Strid Wealth Management Group at Wells' Berwyn, Pennsylvania, branch to form Concentus Wealth Advisors in King of Prussia. The group offers planning services and has discretion to select investment managers for about 150 wealthy families. They plan to continue requiring clients to have a minimum of $1 million of assets and plan to start a family office with a higher minimum.""We were already a long way to feeling independent but we got to the point where it was time to take the last step and be totally objective and transparent (about the practice),"" said Erik Strid, who joined his father's team in 1992 when they were at Merrill Lynch.""There were certain instances where there was a shadow of doubt in clients' minds about where the 'vig' was for the bank,"" he said, using a gambling term for interest kept by the house or lender.The Strids also wanted more equity in their practice and to be less tied to long-term bank stock incentives whose value they cannot control. Despite some incentives that bank-owned brokerage firms give advisers to sell products, the Strid team was successful enough to do what was best for clients without bank interference and benefited from Wells' vast resources, said Erik Strid. Wells Fargo Advisors is a broker-dealer subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co., the fourth-biggest U.S. bank company.The Strids are part of a small but growing trend of traditional stockbrokers who are becoming independent advisers, typically offering fee-based investment accounts and broad financial planning services.The number of wealth managers who registered as investment advisers grew at an annual rate of 8 percent between 2004 and 2012, while brokers at traditional firms fell an average of 1.2 percent in those years, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based wealth management consulting firm. To help structure their new business, including creating an equity structure to help them expand, the Strids have affiliated with Dynasty Financial Partners, a New York firm founded by former Smith Barney and Citigroup executives that designs technology and investment products for independent advisers.Dynasty helps manage 20 independent wealth management firms with 63 advisers and about $20 billion in assets. It charges a small percentage of the non-cash assets managed by its advisory firms. Concentus, Latin for ""harmony,"" is using Charles Schwab Corp  to hold client assets and execute transactions. The group will continue to buy research and tactical strategies from Dorsey Wright & Associates, a Richmond, Virginia-based ""technical"" money manager. It will retain web-based financial planning software from eMoney Advisor, and use Envestnet's  reporting and portfolio balancing tools.The Strids were part of a small unit at Wells called ""Profit Formula"" that allows brokers to keep about 75 percent of the revenue they collect from clients but charges them for the costs of running their practices. Most big brokerage firms pay top brokers about 45 percent of the commissions and fees collected from clients, but provide overhead and other services gratis.Wells is not allowing new advisers into Profit Formula, said brokerage spokeswoman Rachelle Rowe, because it has separate ""channels"" to accommodate those who want to be completely independent and others who are full-time employees. Many of the most successful of Wells' more than 15,000 retail brokers are in Profit Formula and tend to move less often, she added.The bank is likely restricting growth of Profit Formula to maintain better risk control, since advisers in the unit have more latitude to manage clients' money, or for reasons related to profit margin but the Strids did not feel pinched by any changes, Erik Strid said.The spokeswoman declined to comment on the Strids or on the number of Profit Formula advisers. A headhunter and two Wells Fargo insiders estimated the unit has 350 teams with 1,000 advisers.",2014-02-20,SCHW,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 10:00am EST",ON THE MOVE-Veteran Pennsylvania Wells Fargo brokers go independent,http://www.reuters.com//article/wellsfargo-strid-idUSL2N0LO2BD20140220?type=companyNews

10,"   By Jed Horowitz and Suzanne Barlyn | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Charles Schwab Corp has dropped a fight to require customers to waive their rights to participate in class action lawsuits, the company said on Thursday.Schwab, the San Francisco-based pioneer discount brokerage, has agreed to pay $500,000 to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for violating the group's arbitration rules when it barred clients in 2011 from joining class actions. It had more than 6.8 million clients then, and now has more than 9 million.In 2013, a FINRA hearing panel said Schwab's class-action ban was valid under the Federal Arbitration Act, even though the ban violated the group's own rules. On Thursday, FINRA's board overturned that finding, determining that the federal act does not preclude FINRA from enforcing its rules.""We are pleased to resolve this dispute with FINRA, and to put to rest any client concerns on this issue,"" Schwab said in an e-mailed statement that noted it has removed the waiver from its account agreements.""Over the last year, we heard clearly that a number of our clients and members of the general public have strong feelings about maintaining access to class-action lawsuits. In a business like ours where our reputation and public trust are key to our success, we take perspectives like those very seriously."" Schwab could have fought the decision in court but decided it was more expedient to settle, said people familiar with its decision. It also failed to rally support from other companies in the securities industry, despite their long-held opposition to litigating in courts rather than in arbitration.""We believed, and still believe, that FINRA arbitration is the best means for investors to resolve disputes with their brokerage firm, but we will maintain their access to class action lawsuits should they prefer that option,"" Schwab said.Plaintiffs' lawyers and consumer advocates, who have been waging an unsuccessful fight against a range of class-action waiver agreements in other types of consumer contracts, had rallied support among Schwab clients. They argued that arbitration cases are often too expensive for small investors to bring on their own, and that public court cases can shine light on abusive sales practices while FINRA arbitrations are private. ""It's a huge victory for investors,"" said Christine Hines, consumer and civil justice counsel at watchdog group Public Citizen, which organized a public campaign to oppose the Schwab waivers and mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer contracts.""I think other brokerage firms will be deterred from including class action waivers in their contracts,"" Hines said.

It had more than 6.8 million clients then, and now has more than 9 million.In 2013, a FINRA hearing panel said Schwab's class-action ban was valid under the Federal Arbitration Act, even though the ban violated the group's own rules. On Thursday, FINRA's board overturned that finding, determining that the federal act does not preclude FINRA from enforcing its rules.""We are pleased to resolve this dispute with FINRA, and to put to rest any client concerns on this issue,"" Schwab said in an e-mailed statement that noted it has removed the waiver from its account agreements. ""Over the last year, we heard clearly that a number of our clients and members of the general public have strong feelings about maintaining access to class-action lawsuits. In a business like ours where our reputation and public trust are key to our success, we take perspectives like those very seriously.""Schwab could have fought the decision in court but decided it was more expedient to settle, said people familiar with its decision. It also failed to rally support from other companies in the securities industry, despite their long-held opposition to litigating in courts rather than in arbitration.""We believed, and still believe, that FINRA arbitration is the best means for investors to resolve disputes with their brokerage firm, but we will maintain their access to class action lawsuits should they prefer that option,"" Schwab said. Plaintiffs' lawyers and consumer advocates, who have been waging an unsuccessful fight against a range of class-action waiver agreements in other types of consumer contracts, had rallied support among Schwab clients. They argued that arbitration cases are often too expensive for small investors to bring on their own, and that public court cases can shine light on abusive sales practices while FINRA arbitrations are private.""It's a huge victory for investors,"" said Christine Hines, consumer and civil justice counsel at watchdog group Public Citizen, which organized a public campaign to oppose the Schwab waivers and mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer contracts. ""I think other brokerage firms will be deterred from including class action waivers in their contracts,"" Hines said.""Schwab overreached,"" said Joseph Peiffer, a lawyer in New Orleans who represents investors.The FINRA appeals panel also upheld the hearing panel's rejection of Schwab's attempt to prohibit clients from participating in group arbitrations.Critics of class-action cases argue that are often frivolous, and that settlements often yield very low sums to each plaintiff while generating hefty fees for lawyers.Schwab's attempt to ban customer class-action lawsuits followed its $235 million settlement of a class action charging it misled thousands of clients about its YieldPlus money-market fund, which had huge losses during the financial crisis in 2008.

14,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 12 Carrie E. Dwyer, who has overseen Charles Schwab Corp's legal, compliance, risk management, audit, fraud investigations and lobbying efforts for more than a decade, has retired from the retail brokerage, said people familiar with the move.A Schwab spokesman did not return requests for comment on Monday, but a person answering Dwyer's phone confirmed that she is no longer general counsel. Schwab is using her retirement to narrow the reporting lines and responsibilities she carried in her broader role as ""head of corporate oversight"" because regulators have raised governance concerns about her broad remit, said another person familiar with the company's plans.Dwyer joined the San Francisco-based company in 1996 from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, where she was senior counselor to then-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. ""She's so multi-faceted that wherever she went she would have had a pretty broad portfolio,"" said Levitt, who knew that Dwyer had retired but not that Schwab was redefining the job. ""She made everyone she worked for look a lot smarter than they are.""Jeff Brown, who has been running Schwab's regulatory and legislative affairs activities in Washington, has moved to San Francisco and is serving as acting general counsel. The company is considering him as well as outsiders for the general counsel role. As executive vice president and head of corporate oversight, Dwyer was one of the company's highest-paid executives. Since early March, she has sold $1.7 million of Schwab stock, according to regulatory filings.After building its image as a discount broker taking orders from self-directed investors looking for cheap commissions, the firm, founded in 1973, now offers full-service brokerage and banking activities as well as financial advice to more than 9,000 individuals and clients of more than 7,000 independent investment advisers. Dwyer helped oversee several sensitive areas as the firm's profile changed. For a time, she even oversaw the firm's internal auditing function, an area regulators were watching closely since Schwab took the unusual step several years ago of outsourcing many of its audit functions to Ernst & Young. Schwab in 2012 hired an E&Y official to run internal audit, though it still outsources some functions to the outside firm.Dwyer, is a 1973 graduate of Santa Clara University and also received her law degree from the California school. She could not be reached for comment.In 2008, the last time she was listed among Schwab's five highest-paid executives, she earned total compensation of $4.1 million, including a salary of $500,000 and other long- and short-term stock, option and cash awards.

15,"   By Jed Horowitz  May 15 The chief executive officer of Charles Schwab Corp on Thursday suggested that regulators require brokerage firms to disclose how much they are paid for selling their clients' orders.Companies like Schwab receive hundreds of thousands of orders daily and have long sold many of them to trading firms known as market makers or to exchanges. The controversial practice, known as payment for order flow, has received new attention because it was mentioned in Michael Lewis' new book ""Flash Boys"" about high-frequency trading that claims the markets are rigged.The controversy raised concerns among investors in brokerage companies that regulators might prohibit the lucrative payments and that these companies might lose the loyalty of customers who felt that their orders were being exploited. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has begun issuing subpoenas and other demands to brokerage companies to learn how they handle their clients' orders.""One idea for the regulators to consider ... is maybe a requirement that we put on a trade confirmation the actual amount of order-flow payment that we receive, and maybe who we receive it from,"" Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said at the company's annual meeting in San Francisco on Thursday. Bettinger said last month that Schwab had no plans to end the practice, which amounts to fractions of a penny a share but can add up among all orders to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. But he also said that retaining the confidence of investors in the fairness of markets and brokerage firms is a major priority for Schwab.He is the first brokerage executive to suggest that regulators require companies to tell each customer what their trade is worth. Schwab and its competitors do not return the money directly to clients, but say the payments help subsidize the very low commissions charged by discount brokers and lead to trade executions that have never been faster. They also insist that their first priority in handling trades is to make sure that customers get the most efficient executions, not that the brokerage gets the highest payment. Trading companies, including market makers such as UBS  , KCG Holdings and hedge fund Citadel LLC, are willing to compete for retail investors' orders because they are considered ""dumb money"" that shows the professionals where markets are headed.In reporting first-quarter earnings last month, Schwab said that it expects to earn about $100 million this year from selling client orders, the first time it gave out a specific number, and higher than the estimate it had given a few weeks earlier to Reuters. E*Trade Financial Corp said it collected about $25 million in the first quarter from payment-for-order flow. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, which includes a large number of active and professional traders among its clientele, declined to disclose its order-flow revenue. Several analysts estimated the number at $130 million to $200 million annually.(Reporting By Jed Horowitz; Editing by Jan Paschal)",2014-05-15,SCHW,"Thu May 15, 2014 | 7:46pm EDT",Schwab CEO: Disclose payment for selling client orders,http://www.reuters.com//article/schwab-ceo-proposal-idUSL1N0O12EC20140515?type=companyNews
16,"   By Emily Flitter and Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. regulators are investigating Charles Schwab Corp and Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch brokerage over whether they are doing enough to learn about their clients' identities, sources said, the latest sign a crackdown on money laundering is expanding.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether the brokerages missed red flags that could indicate attempts to move money illicitly or to feed proceeds from drug trafficking and other crimes into the financial system by failing to know their customers well enough, the sources said.Both the SEC and Merrill declined to comment. Schwab said in an emailed statement that it had several anti-money laundering measures already in place.""All of us at Schwab are troubled by the suggestion that we are not complying with anti-money laundering regulations, and further troubled by the manner in which these allegations have apparently been made via anonymous press leaks,"" a Schwab spokeswoman said in the statement.""In addition to a variety of controls, such as striving to know our customers, we do not accept cash to fund a brokerage account. As a good corporate citizen serving the needs of millions of legitimate customers, we take seriously our anti-money laundering responsibilities."" Schwab is conducting an internal investigation, one of the sources said.The investigations are part of the SEC's sweep of the brokerage industry to make sure brokerages are following anti-money laundering rules. The sweep was described to Reuters by two former government officials with knowledge of the agency's thinking.It was not clear what penalties the SEC would seek or whether it planned to also charge individuals or any other financial institutions for any violations. The investigation is not yet complete and the timing of any cases against the companies could not be learned. Broker-dealers are required to establish, document and maintain procedures for identifying customers and verifying their identities under sections of the Bank Secrecy Act. In 2008, the SEC fined E*Trade Financial Corp $1 million for failing to verify the identities of more than 65,000 secondary account holders in joint accounts, resulting in false reporting.U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen began urging regulators two years ago to make sure financial institutions are identifying the true beneficial owners of their accounts. Cohen's exhortations came amid concerns that bad actors, such as drug cartel members and terrorists, are growing more creative in their attempts to secretly transfer tainted funds. The SEC's investigation so far has found Charles Schwab and Merrill accepted shell companies and individuals with fake addresses as clients, two sources said.In both cases, some of the accounts, whose ownership the brokerages did not adequately investigate, were eventually linked to drug cartels, they said.One of Charles Schwab's clients, a rancher in Texas, was found to be transferring money to a holding company that was revealed to be a shell company, according to one of the sources.The source said most of the suspect account holders in the Schwab case were located near the Mexican border and some were linked to drug money in Mexico. Some accounts contained hundreds of thousands of dollars while others held millions, the source said.(Additional reporting by Brett Wolf; Editing by Grant McCool and Miral Fahmy)",2014-05-22,SCHW,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 9:08am EDT","Exclusive: SEC probes Schwab, Merrill, for anti-money laundering violations - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-sec-brokerages-investigation-idUSBREA4K15S20140522?type=companyNews

19,"   By Beth Pinsker | NEW YORK, June 2  NEW YORK, June 2 For many single or childless individuals, the question of how to distribute their worldly wealth after they die is wide-open and complicated. A charity? Alma mater? Distant nieces and nephews? A cat?And who will take care of making sure dying wishes are fulfilled?This dilemma faces not just the 17 million unmarried Americans over 65 who are retired or putting their ducks in a row for retirement. Charitable foundations and financial advisers report that an increasing number of young people are facing these decisions before they are married or have children. That is especially true for tech entrepreneurs who, for example,  come into a large amount of money from stock options or the sale of a start-up business.""There are definitely more young people coming in than 10 years ago,"" says Mari Ellen Loijens, chief business, development and brand officer for the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which granted $367 million in 2013 and is handling the disbursement of a $1.1 billion donation of Facebook stock from Mark Zuckerberg. ""There's been a real shift in the dynamic.""Case in point is Jeff Kolesky. The 37-year-old software engineer for San Francisco-based OPower Inc says he values the examples that people such as Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have set with their giving.""For me, I'm not going to be giving away that kind of wealth, but I take value from donating to charity now and not when I'm dead,"" Kolesky says.WHEN TO PLAN  When it comes to charitable planning, financial advisers say it is not about how old you are but how rich. If you have $100,000 or more, you do not want to die without a will or estate plan and leave it to a court-appointed executor to decide what happens to the assets you leave behind, says John Pettee, a trust, tax and estate specialist with Charles Schwab's  private client division.""We say to people: 'If you do nothing, your money will go to the state. Is that what you want?' That's enough to make them want to consider something else,"" says Andrew Russell, a certified financial planner in San Diego.You also have to consider your healthcare directives and who should manage your affairs should you become incapacitated in an accident or because of illness. A person needs a line-up of contingency names to put on legal forms, and all of those people need to be aware of your desires for medical intervention. STAY FLEXIBLE What generally keeps people - with children or without - from estate planning is that they do not want to face their mortality.""People don't like to talk about death. If you add on top of that they do not have a child who would be a natural heir, they really don't want to deal with it,"" says Kevin Ruth, head of private wealth planning at Fidelity.One route to make the process easier is a donor-advised fund, offered by brokerage firms such as Fidelity, Vanguard and Schwab and charitable foundations. These act like mutual funds designated for charitable giving and allow an individual to make a one-time or ongoing contribution through the institution, alleviating many fees and paperwork requirements. Donors can designate the funds to be distributed right away or can direct grants later. Amy Danforth, president at Fidelity Charitable, says most donors grant their money within 10 years.Kolesky chose that option late last year shortly before OPower went public. After watching friends deal with tons of paperwork to create their own charitable giving structure after an IPO, Kolesky opened up a donor-advised fund through the San Francisco Jewish Community Federation.His rationale? It was a well-known entity, the set-up was easy and he has a lot of flexibility to make grants once he is ready. Plus, he gets a tax benefit, because he can claim his donations when he makes them, not when the money is granted to charities.""It gives me an opportunity to put money away without thinking immediately about where it will go,"" Kolesky said. ""It will create a nest egg of philanthropic, and, in the future, I can give a more impactful amount of money.""People now give just about anything they can assign a monetary value, from unsecured stock options to art and even bitcoins. That helps young tech workers because they can give away some of what they have today, keeping with the principles of the Giving Pledge made by some of the world's wealthiest people, including Gates and Warren Buffett.""They don't want to delay until 20 or 50 years down the road,"" says Schwab's Pettee.And that goes even if kids come later. ""Earlier, it didn't matter how rich you were, you were still worried about family legacy,"" says Loijens. ""Now, megarich or not, your obsession with legacy is not the same.""

20,"  New York Charles Schwab Corp. is once again baring its teeth at large rivals, particularly full-service firms such as Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co's Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS AG's UBS Wealth Management Americas.The San Francisco-based pioneer of low-commission brokerage has been on a campaign in recent years to offer advice and fee-based accounts to clients with more than $250,000, similar to the strategy increasingly used by the four big firms, known as wirehouses.    ""The wirehouse model continues to lose favor,"" Schwab executive vice president John Clendening said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit on Tuesday. About $750 billion moved out of full-commission firms to independent advisers, discount brokers and other firms last year, because clients want ""a straight answer"" about what they're investing in and what they are paying advisers. In 2002, Schwab raised the enmity of its Wall Street rivals with a television ad showing a brokerage firm executive telling salesmen, ""Let's put some lipstick on this pig."" It coincided with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's accusation that brokers at Merrill and other firms were recommending stocks that their analysts were privately calling ""dogs.""Clendening, an executive vice president who coheads Schwab's retail brokerage business, said assets moving to the firm from  wirehouses have grown in the ""upper-single digit"" percentage range in the last few years. About 17 percent of its assets are in fee-based accounts, but should rise to 30 percent within 10  years. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management President Gregory Fleming said at the Wealth Summit on Monday that he expects fee-based accounts to rise to more than 40 percent from 37 percent at the end of the first quarter.Clendening also said there is booming demand from Schwab clients for financial plans to help them meet goals. Schwab created 30,000 such plans in the first quarter, up 30 percent from a year earlier. He contrasted the plain-English plans to the thick binders prepared by wirehouses that often ""end up on a shelf, completely useless to most investors.""  Schwab advisers create some complex plans, too, for a fee, but the vast majority of clients get free plans, he said. He also said that when wealthy prospects come to discuss the possibility of moving assets, Schwab advisers encourage them to ask their current firm for explanations of charges. ""The most stunning indictment of our industry is ... folks coming to me who say I thought bond purchases were free,"" Clendening said.The wirehouses, to be sure, say they are embracing more simplicity and clarity in plans and financial statements, and on whether clients are on track in meeting their goals. ""The industry has not done a reliable job of telling people what their funding status is,"" Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management head John Thiel said at the Reuters Summit on Tuesday. ""The biggest issue with trust, our clients tell us, is transparency."" However, he and other executives said Schwab is exaggerating its success in accumulating assets from wealthy clients to become what Clendening termed ""truly the growth story in the industry.""From 2010 through the end of 2013 total client assets in all parts of Schwab grew by $827 billion, equal to the combined growth at Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, TD Ameritrade Holdings and E*Trade Financial Corp, he said.  A spokesman at Morgan Stanley said the comparison was inappropriate since Schwab included low-margin assets that it holds for independent investment advisers. A TD Ameritrade spokesman said its double-digit growth in net new client assets over the past five years ""outpaces that of our competition.""Merrill's Thiel response? “I would just say it’s a challenge to do that math, based on how people report,” he said.(This story corrects 9th paragraph to read ""...and on whether clients are on track..."" to show that issue is about clients, not the wirehouses; in 10th paragraph, corrects to read ""he and other executives"" to clarify the speakers) (Reporting by Jed Horowitz)",2014-06-17,SCHW,"Tue Jun 17, 2014 | 7:35pm EDT",Charles Schwab aims arrows at full-service rivals,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-wealth-summit-schwab-idUSKBN0ES2NM20140617?type=companyNews
21,"   By Jed Horowitz | New York  New York The ""accountability guarantee"" that Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) unveiled with fanfare in December has to date cost the San Francisco-based financial company pocket money only.In a press tour and national ad campaign featuring the caring sincerity of its eponymous founder, Schwab promised to refund the previous quarter's advisory fee to any customer in certain fee-based accounts who complains about service or other issues. So far, Schwab has paid about $500,000 to 400 clients out of about 340,000 account holders who are eligible for the rebate, Schwab executive vice president and co-head of retail brokerage John Clendening said at Reuters Wealth Management Summit last week. A spokeswoman said the clients receiving rebates subsequently transferred about $3 million of new money to the firm.Company officials say the campaign aims to build investor confidence in its brand as distrust of large banks and bank-owned brokerage firms among consumers remains high five years after the U.S. financial crisis.  ""[W]e’ll refund your program fee from the previous quarter and work with you to make things right,"" says a webpage for the guarantee featuring a photo of a bespectacled Chuck Schwab looking determinedly into the distance. ""You won’t find that kind of accountability everywhere — but you will find it here."" (Link to Schwab accountability guarantee: bit.ly/1nkiA3v )  The campaign also underscores Schwab's attempt to change its image from a low-commission discount broker to one that also offers guidance and advisory accounts to wealthier clients. The guarantee applies to five of the company's in-house fee-based investment and advice programs. Like full-service competitors such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of America's (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, Schwab prefers fee-based accounts because they provide more stable income than commissions that rise and fall with investors' engagement in the markets.   Clendening said only 17 percent of assets from clients who work through Schwab's approximately 300 branches are in fee-based accounts, giving it room to grow. About 25 to 40 percent of client assets at full-service firms are in advisory programs.  Schwab is not featuring the guarantee in its new ad campaign launched two weeks ago but will market it ""on and off"" and continue highlighting it on websites and other client-facing material. Complaints induced by the guarantee help Schwab avoid the loss of new money from disgruntled but silent customers who want to avoid the awkwardness of firing their broker, he said.""We want all of our clients to know that the guarantee is there,"" Clendening said.

Merrill Lynch and its 13,845 financial advisers generated 83 percent of the sector's total revenue, with the rest coming from the bank's U.S. Trust private banking unit and money-management services within the bank's branches.The high costs and sluggish asset growth at Merrill contrasts with a report rival Charles Schwab Corp  issued on Wednesday. The firm that once focused only on gathering commissions from self-directed investors said the $22.7 billion in new assets it gained in the quarter was the highest in six years, while net income jumped 27 percent from the year-ago quarter. Merrill Lynch boasted that its client balances reached a ""milestone"" $2 trillion by quarter end due to new assets and stock market advances. But Schwab ended the quarter with $2.4 trillion in client assets.Unlike Merrill, Schwab obtains the bulk of those assets from independent investment advisers who direct clients to place assets with and make transactions through the discount broker.Executives at Bank of America made no apologies for the performance of Merrill and its other wealth management businesses. New assets under management, $12.0 billion, were the lowest in four consecutive quarters but were 74 percent higher than in the second quarter of 2013. ""We were pleased with yet another strong quarter of long-term AUM flows of $11.9 billion,"" said a spokesman.The bank said it has had 20 consecutive quarters of ""positive"" flows into client accounts and continues to progress in its core goal of selling more mortgages and portfolio-secured loans through its brokerage force. Loan balances in the wealth management business grew $4 billion during the quarter, to $123 billion, up 7.4 percent from a year earlier.But costs in the wealth businesses nevertheless grew 5.4 percent, to $3.3 billion, while total revenue inched up only 2.0 percent to $4.59 billion.The discrepancy between revenue growth and expense growth,  known as ""operating leverage,"" hurt profit at Merrill, although bank executives said they are investing for long-term growth. Profit from services for the wealthy is much more stable than other sectors such as investment banking and corporate lending. ""We have made some near-term investments, including training programs and hiring people in the branches,"" BofA Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in a conference call with investors. ""But (operating leverage) is something we have to monitor closely.""Merrill Lynch paid out more in bonuses and other compensation to brokers than a year ago and has poured $100 million into combining a crazy-quilt of money-management and investment choices for investors into a single platform called Merrill One. The program will increase broker productivity, create efficiencies for clients and limit the ability of brokers to offer reduced commissions to top clients, the company said.Merrill Lynch wealth management, like most large U.S. brokerage firms, has been trying to shift clients from transaction-based commission accounts to fee accounts that charge the clients a percentage of their account assets. As of the end of June, 46 percent of the firm's advisers had at least half of their client assets in a fee-based relationship, up from 45 percent three months earlier.At Schwab, about 50 percent of clients receive a fee-based advisory service, the company said.Asset management fees at Merrill Wealth in the second quarter grew 16.6 percent from a year ago, to $1.5 billion, while revenue per average broker - measured by fees and commissions collected by each - was unchanged from the previous quarter at $1.06 million.

27,"  (Refiles to add Aug 26 in dateline)By Suzanne BarlynAug 26 Charles Schwab Corp. has lost a $15 million arbitration case against Morgan Stanley, which it accused of improperly recruiting brokers from a Schwab San Francisco branch who left with confidential information.The ruling by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel in San Francisco, dated Monday, ends a two-year-long dispute.Schwab accused Morgan Stanley of maliciously organizing an ""actionable raid"" of the branch. Schwab also accused Morgan Stanley of inducing Schwab brokers to breach their contracts.Claims involving the practice of so-called ""raiding"" are typically made when a firm loses 30 percent to 40 percent of the production, the amount brokers generate in revenue during a year, from a branch office to another firm in one swoop or over a short period of time, according to lawyers. ""We strongly disagree with the panel's decision and are evaluating our legal options in this situation, a Schwab spokesman said. ""The claims in this case were compelling, including instances of taking proprietary information, manufacturing evidence, and operating a steady raid on staff and clients resulting in significant damage to Schwab.""A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment on the ruling and did not immediately respond to requests to comment on Schwab's statement. While the arbitrators denied Schwab's claims, they ordered Morgan Stanley to pay Schwab $72,000 in sanctions. The three-member panel, as is customary, did not provide reasons for the decision.The ruling did not identify the brokers who left Schwab.Schwab has a reputation in the securities industry for  taking legal action against brokers and the firms that hire them, said Thomas Lewis, a lawyer in Lawrenceville, New Jersey who advises brokers about moving between firms. The cases typically arise against brokers who take clients' contact information or send out announcements about their affiliation with new firms, said Lewis, who was not involved in the case. Schwab can use that strategy because it does not participate in an industry agreement intended to minimize legal disputes when brokers switch firms, known as the Protocol for Broker Recruiting, Lewis said.The agreement allows brokers to bring very limited information when switching firms, but only if both firms involved in the transition participate. Details typically include client names, telephone numbers and email addresses.Schwab, last month, filed a lawsuit in a Seattle federal court against former Schwab adviser Christopher Canorro and the firm he started in May, Basilica Wealth Management in Bainbridge Island, Washington. Canorro, whose firm employs two other former Schwab advisers, breached contracts with Schwab, in part, by taking confidential client information, Schwab said in its complaint.""Schwab's claim is a strategy of intimidation designed to protect its parochial business model at the expense of fair competition,"" said Clinton Marrs, Canorro's lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

30,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) has dropped the Pimco Total Return Fund from its 10 target date funds and collective trusts, a company spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday.The firm completed its review of the fund this week on the heels of the announcement last Friday that Bill Gross, Pimco co-founder and manager of the fund, was leaving to join Janus Capital Group (JNS.N).The retail target date funds have $2.9 billion in assets - $141 million of which had been in the Pimco Total Return Fund.  Schwab is looking for a replacement for the Pimco fund and has temporarily reallocated the Pimco assets into the Schwab Total Bond Market Fund (SWLBX.O) and the Loomis Sayles Investment Grade Bond Fund (LIGRX.O), the spokeswoman said.In its collective trusts, which are institutional versions of the retail funds and are designed for large 401(k) plans, Schwab began reducing its allocation to the Pimco fund in September and hired Wells Fargo (WFC.N)'s asset management arm as an additional subadviser.  Schwab will reallocate the Pimco assets among its different strategies in the portfolios until it finds a permanent replacement for Pimco, the spokeswoman said. It could not immediately be determined how much in assets is in the collective trust, but it totals billions of dollars.A Pimco spokesman was not immediately available to comment.Target date funds - portfolios that adjust their allocations based on a target retirement date and become more conservative by shifting more assets from equities into fixed income over time - are in over 72 percent of 401(k) plans, according to San Francisco-based retirement plan consultant Callan Associates. Schwab's decision to replace Pimco shows how significant the headline risk is for 401(k) plan managers to keep Pimco in their funds, said Janet Yang, a fund analyst at Morningstar.""It's not surprising given how much has flowed out of the fund at this point,"" Yang said.Earlier this week Morningstar downgraded its analyst rating on the Pimco Total Return Fund to ""bronze"" from ""gold,"" citing uncertainty about outflows and the reshuffling of management responsibilities after Gross' sudden exit.  Pacific Investment Management Co had a record $23.5 billion of withdrawals from its flagship Pimco Total Return Fund in September, with its largest daily outflow occurring on the day of Gross' surprise resignation.

31,"  (Follow the author at twitter.com/bethpinsker)By Beth PinskerNEW YORK Oct 7When Chris Costello wanted to test his new online 401(k) advice service called blooom, he asked his sister if she would let him peek under the hood of her account.What Costello found was typical of workers who do not pay much attention to their accounts - it was allocated badly, leaving her behind on her retirement goals.In his sister's case, she had put her funds in a money market account when the recession hit in 2008 and never moved them back into the market.""It's been like four or five years of recovery, and she had made like $10,"" says Costello, who is co-founder and chief executive of blooom (www.blooom.com/).Overall, workers have more than $4.3 trillion invested in 401(k) plans, according to the Investment Company Institute. Yet many of the 52 million workers who participate in 401(k) are not good at making their own investment choices, experts say.Studies show that workers who get investment advice from any source do better than those who receive no advice.The difference can be more than 3 percent a year on returns or up to 80 percent over 25 years, according to a recent study by benefits consultant Aon Hewitt and 401(k) advice service Financial Engines.""Left to their own devices, people either do nothing at all or pick poorly,"" says Christopher Jones, chief investment officer at Financial Engines, the largest provider in the advice sector as ranked by assets under management.So where can employees turn for guidance? 1. Start with your human resources departmentYou might already have access to advice, says Grant Easterbrook, an analyst who tracks online financial services  for New York-based consulting firm Corporate Insights. He says even his own colleagues do not know they have access to free financial advice as an add-on benefit.If you work at a big company, you might be one of the 600 clients of Financial Engines. Their free services include allocation advice and performance data. Other companies may employ consultants to give advice during open-enrollment periods or give access to calculators and other advice through the website of the 401(k) provider.Employees at smaller companies might have to venture further to get help. ""Three out of four participants don't have access to an employer-based advisory tool,"" says John Eaton, general manager of 401K GPS. ""But there are a lot of DIY solutions out there."" 2. Get free advice on the WebThe Web offers a lot more these days than standard retirement calculators. You can obtain detailed advice on allocating funds in your specific retirement plan from several providers.At FutureAdvisor (www.futureadvisor.com/) and Kivalia (www.kivalia.com/), to name two, all you have to do is type in the name of your company and the system will generate a sample portfolio. You will then have to take that allocation advice and implement it on your own.3. Pick managed funds or target-date funds If you do not want to get too involved in the process - even to just pick a simple selection of index funds - your company will typically offer some kind of managed fund or target-date fund, a diversified fund linked to a future retirement date that gradually gets more conservative as you age, in their mix of choices.When you allocate your money into these types of funds, you are buying the management expertise that comes with them, timed for a retirement date in the future. Sometimes that comes with stiff fees, so be sure to check the fine print, says Easterbrook.""Absent engagement, it's a reasonable approach to take,"" adds Shane Bartling, a senior retirement consultant for benefit provider Towers Watson & Co.4. Pay to have somebody manage it for youFinancial Engines has 800,000 subscribers who pay a percentage of their assets under management to monitor their 401(k) accounts and make changes accordingly. Others are GuidedChoice (www.guidedchoice.com/), which offers its services through providers such as ADP, Schwab, and Morningstar, which reaches 99,000 different plans.Start-ups are emerging as well, either charging a flat fee such as $10 a month or a fee based on how much money you have.401K GPS (www.401kgps.com/), which launched in 2011, operates primarily through investment advisers and small employers. There is also blooom, MyPlanIQ (www.myplaniq.com/), Co-Piloted (www.copiloted.com/) and Smart401k (www.smart401k.com/).5. Do not opt out of auto-enrollmentThe majority of people will still do nothing but that may a savvy option. Financial Engine's Jones says some companies are making workers re-enroll in 401(k) plans to get them to diversify. Typically, employees will be placed in a target-date fund based on their age if they do not opt out.""When we do that, about 60 percent of population will stay in these programs,"" says Jones. About 15 percent of active investors will opt out because they are already getting advice.

Yet many of the 52 million workers who participate in 401(k) are not good at making their own investment choices, experts say.Studies show that workers who get investment advice from any source do better than those who receive no advice.The difference can be more than 3 percent a year on returns or up to 80 percent over 25 years, according to a recent study by benefits consultant Aon Hewitt and 401(k) advice service Financial Engines.""Left to their own devices, people either do nothing at all or pick poorly,"" says Christopher Jones, chief investment officer at Financial Engines, the largest provider in the advice sector as ranked by assets under management.So where can employees turn for guidance? 1. Start with your human resources departmentYou might already have access to advice, says Grant Easterbrook, an analyst who tracks online financial services  for New York-based consulting firm Corporate Insight. He says even his own colleagues do not know they have access to free financial advice as an add-on benefit.If you work at a big company, you might be one of the 600 clients of Financial Engines. Their free services include allocation advice and performance data. Other companies may employ consultants to give advice during open-enrollment periods or give access to calculators and other advice through the website of the 401(k) provider.Employees at smaller companies might have to venture further to get help. ""Three out of four participants don't have access to an employer-based advisory tool,"" says John Eaton, general manager of 401K GPS. ""But there are a lot of DIY solutions out there."" 2. Get free advice on the WebThe Web offers a lot more these days than standard retirement calculators. You can obtain detailed advice on allocating funds in your specific retirement plan from several providers.At FutureAdvisor (www.futureadvisor.com/) and Kivalia (www.kivalia.com/), to name two, all you have to do is type in the name of your company and the system will generate a sample portfolio. You will then have to take that allocation advice and implement it on your own.3. Pick managed funds or target-date funds If you do not want to get too involved in the process - even to just pick a simple selection of index funds - your company will typically offer some kind of managed fund or target-date fund, a diversified fund linked to a future retirement date that gradually gets more conservative as you age, in their mix of choices.When you allocate your money into these types of funds, you are buying the management expertise that comes with them, timed for a retirement date in the future. Sometimes that comes with stiff fees, so be sure to check the fine print, says Easterbrook.""Absent engagement, it's a reasonable approach to take,"" adds Shane Bartling, a senior retirement consultant for benefit provider Towers Watson & Co.4. Pay to have somebody manage it for youFinancial Engines has 800,000 subscribers who pay a percentage of their assets under management to monitor their 401(k) accounts and make changes accordingly. Others are GuidedChoice (www.guidedchoice.com/), which offers its services through providers such as ADP, Schwab, and Morningstar, which reaches 99,000 different plans.Start-ups are emerging as well, either charging a flat fee such as $10 a month or a fee based on how much money you have.401K GPS (www.401kgps.com/), which launched in 2011, operates primarily through investment advisers and small employers. There is also blooom, MyPlanIQ (www.myplaniq.com/), Co-Piloted (www.copiloted.com/) and Smart401k (www.smart401k.com/).5. Do not opt out of auto-enrollmentThe majority of people will still do nothing but that may a savvy option. Financial Engine's Jones says some companies are making workers re-enroll in 401(k) plans and defaulting them into managed accounts to get them to diversify.""When we do that, about 60 percent of population will stay in these programs,"" says Jones. About 15 percent of active investors will opt out because they are already getting advice.

In foregoing management and transaction fees, Schwab intends to be ""disruptive"" to competitors, company officials said in a conference call. Most automated investment programs charge about 0.25 percent of the money that clients invest.

39,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Charles Schwab Corp, Wells Fargo Advisors and Raymond James & Associates have all dropped Pimco funds from some investment portfolios they offer clients over the past several weeks, following the September resignation of fund manager and company co-founder Bill Gross.The moves could make it more difficult for Pimco to stem outflows that have accelerated in the wake of Gross's departure.A growing number of advisers put their clients into these pre-assembled portfolios, known as managed accounts, so the advisers can spend more time on client service and prospecting and less time on managing money. Wells Fargo and Schwab made their decisions based on the organizational changes at Pimco, according to a spokeswoman at each firm. A Raymond James spokeswoman declined to comment.     Pacific Investment Management Co has seen huge outflows since Gross, who ran the Pimco Total Return Fund, announced on Sept. 26 that he was joining rival Janus Capital Group. The firm posted outflows of $48.3 billion across its open-ended funds in October, compared with $25.5 billion the previous month, according to Morningstar.Pimco, which had assets under management of $1.876 trillion as of Sept. 30, has been aggressively reassuring clients that the firm remains committed to the same investment strategies following Gross' exit. The firm was not immediately available for comment. Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage arm of Wells Fargo & Co, has removed the Pimco Total Return Fund and the Pimco Low Duration Fund from its FundSource managed account platform. The St. Louis-based firm has moved assets from the Pimco Total Return Fund to at least three portfolios: the MetWest Total Return Bond Fund, the AMG Managers Bond Fund and the Fidelity Advisor Strategic Income Fund, according to a source familiar with the changes, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak to the media. Clients in the Pimco Low Duration Fund were moved to the Fidelity Advisor Short Fixed Income Fund, the source said.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on how much in assets is in the FundSource platform or how much was with the Pimco funds.  Meanwhile, Raymond James & Associates has dropped the Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund from its Freedom managed account platform, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. The Raymond James Freedom platform had $26 billion as of June 30, according to the firm's website, but it was unclear how much of that was in the Pimco fund. Gross took over management of the Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund in December 2013.    Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, the division that manages its Managed Portfolios, decided to remove the Pimco Total Return Fund on Sept. 30, the spokeswoman said.  In October, the Pimco Total Return Fund suffered a record $27.5 billion in withdrawals. The fund, which is the world’s biggest bond mutual fund, now has $170.9 billion in assets, down from a peak of $293 billion in 2013.The Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund has seen its assets drop by half since January to $13.8 billion. Pimco's $17.6 billion Low Duration Fund saw $2.5 billion in outflows in October, bringing year to date outflows to $6.36 billion, according to Morningstar. Schwab moved its clients from the Pimco Total Return Fund into different funds depending on the account, according to Schwab. The replacing funds are the Baird Core Plus Bond Fund, Metropolitan West Total Return Bond Fund and the Western Asset Core Plus Bond Fund, the spokeswoman said. Schwab's managed portfolios had $17 billion as of Sept. 30. The spokeswoman declined to comment on how much of that was in the Pimco Total Return Fund.

41,"   By Linda Stern | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 26 Every industry has its loss leaders, and the investment world is no different. The theory is that you will go to the store for the $12 turkey and stick around to buy dressing, cranberries, juice, pies and two kinds of potatoes. Mmmm, but I digress.In the investment world, the role of the cheap turkey is played by broad stock index exchange traded funds. While investment firms say they make money on even low-fee funds, their profit margins on these products have been narrowing.There's been a bidding war among issuers of exchange traded funds that mimic large stock indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 or the Wilshire 5000 stock index. Companies including Blackrock Inc, Vanguard and Charles Schwab have been competing to offer investors the lowest cost shares possible on these products. Right now, Schwab - which will begin offering pre-mixed portfolios of ultra-low-cost ETFs early in 2015 -  is winning.Their theory? You'll come in the door for the index ETF and stay for the more expensive funds, the alternative investments, the retirement advice.""We believe we will keep that client for a long time,"" said John Sturiale, senior vice president of product management for Charles Schwab Investment Management. Investors, of course, are free to come in and buy the cheap TV and nothing more. Here are some points to consider if you want to squeeze the most out of low-cost exchange traded funds.A few points don't matter, but a lot of points do.""Over the long term, cost is one of the biggest determinants of portfolio performance,"" said Michael Rawson, a Morningstar analyst. If you have a TD Ameritrade brokerage account, you can buy the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF for no cost beyond annual expenses of 0.05 percent of your assets in the fund. At Schwab, you can buy the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF for an annual expense of 0.04 percent. That 0.01 percentage point difference is negligible.But, compare that low-cost index fund with an actively managed fund carrying 1.3 percent in expenses. Invest $50,000 at the long-term stock market average return of 10 percent and you'll end up with $859,477 after 30 years of having that 0.05 percent deducted annually. Pay 1.3 percent a year in expenses instead (not unusual for a high-profile actively managed mutual fund) and you'll end up with $589,203. You'll have given up $270,274 in fees, according to calculations performed at Buyupside.com (here).Don't pay for advice you don't need. The latest trend in investment advice is to charge clients roughly 1 percent of all of their assets to come up with a broad and diversified portfolio - with index funds at their core. Why not just buy your own core of index funds and exchange traded funds directly, and then get advice on the trickier parts of your portfolio? Or pay an adviser a onetime fee to develop a mostly index portfolio that you can buy on your own?You won't give up performance.High-priced actively managed large stock funds as a group do not typically beat their indexes over time. Even those star managers who do outperform almost never do so year after year after year.Build a broad portfolio.Not every category of investment lends itself to low-cost indexing. You may do better with a seasoned stock picker if you're taking aim at small-growth stocks, for example. But you can make the core of your plan a diversified and cheap portfolio of ETFs at any of the aforementioned companies, and save your fees for those extras that will really add value - the gravy, if you will.

42,"  NEW YORK Dec 18 John Clendening, the former co-head of Charles Schwab Corp's retail brokerage business, will collect a cash payment of $5.17 million as part of a separation agreement he signed on Dec. 10, the San Francisco-based brokerage firm said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.Clendening, who could not be reached for comment, will collect the cash in two installments, provided he does not work with any ""competitor business"" before the end of 2015, according to the filing.Schwab said on Nov. 21 that Clendening and his co-head of investor services, John Gill, had stepped down from running the  business that deals with Schwab's retail investors. It did not give a reason for the change other than to say that their replacement, Terri Kallsen, ""is the right person to execute on our plans and strategies.""Kallsen joined Schwab in 2012 to help run the company's approximately 300 branches. Earlier this week, she filed a regulatory form saying she owned more than 21,000 restricted shares of Schwab stock, as well as options to buy almost 57,000 additional shares. Shares of Schwab closed up 2.8 percent at $30.01. Clendening, who specialized in marketing and product creation, was responsible with Gill for Schwab's effort to sell clients financial planning advice and fee-based services rather than the company's traditional discount brokerage services. Clendening joined Schwab in 2014 and took the top retail brokerage job with Gill in March 2012.In addition to the lump-sum cash payment, Clendening is eligible for a 2014 bonus, other benefits and a base salary of $153,125 for the first quarter of 2015, after which he will leave Schwab's payroll. He will give up a pro-rated portion of the salary if he takes another job as an employee, consultant or director of another company, according to the filing.

43,"  Charles Schwab Corp reported earnings of $350 million in the last quarter of 2014 as higher interest income and $33 billion of new client assets supplemented modest gains in client trading revenue during a bullish quarter for stocks.The emphasis on collecting fee-based assets reflects Schwab's shift from pure discount brokerage to offering advice to its clients.

49,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A U.S. appeals court on Monday revived a class-action lawsuit accusing Charles Schwab Corp of stuffing risky mortgage-backed securities into a bond index mutual fund, causing the fund to significantly lag its benchmark.By a 2-1 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and other claims by plaintiffs led by Northstar Financial Advisors Inc over alleged losses in the Schwab Total Bond Index fund.Also known as a discount brokerage, Schwab is one of a handful of companies to face litigation over alleged surprise losses in fixed-income mutual funds during the housing and financial crises. Other companies that have been sued include Fidelity Investments and Morgan Keegan.The plaintiffs said that by investing more than 25 percent of assets in non-agency mortgage securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, Schwab portfolio managers ignored the fund's fundamental investment objectives of tracking the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and avoiding big industry bets. They said this caused the fund to lag its benchmark from Sept. 1, 2007 to Feb. 27, 2009, losing 4.80 percent while the index posted a positive total return of 7.85 percent.Writing for the appeals court, Judge Edward Korman, who normally hears cases in Brooklyn, New York, said Schwab's adoption of the fund's fundamental policies were ""sufficient to form a contract"" between the shareholders and the fund itself.Circuit Judge Carlos Bea dissented, saying Northstar lacked standing to sue because it did not own shares of the Schwab fund. Northstar pursued its case after being assigned the rights of an investor who had claims against Schwab. The 9th Circuit took nearly 22 months to decide the case. It returned the case to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, who dismissed Northstar's lawsuit in August 2011.Sarah Bulgatz, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Schwab, said: ""We are reviewing the opinion and expect to continue to defend the allegations in court.""

55,"   By Suzanne Barlyn | March 13  March 13 Financial advisory firms are so busy trying to prevent computer hacking that they sometimes neglect an equally vital issue: what to do when hackers succeed.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street's self-funded watchdog, in a February report faulted  some firms for having shoddy security policies, including their responses after cyber attacks.In one case, a firm ignored or missed computer-generated alerts warning of a successful cyber attack. The management woke up only when the hackers attempted to extort money, according to the report.A firm's response to a breach is as important as trying to prevent one, compliance experts say. Their warnings come as FINRA and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission make computer-security preparedness a priority for their examiners to review when they visit firms this year. Firms must have emergency response plans in place for cyber attacks, just as they would for other business disruptions, such as a fire, compliance experts say. While the largest brokerages typically have manpower to respond to crises, smaller firms often rely on outside professionals.Wade Chessman, president of Chessman Wealth Strategies Inc in Dallas, subscribes to a service that monitors his systems for viruses. A local company also services his computers.They would be his first lines of defense to hacking, a response that would likely mirror that of other small firms. ""I'd probably scream like a little girl and call them,"" Chessman said. A general plan and swift action may appease regulators, but technology experts suggest fine-tuning.Small advisory firms that rely on large companies, such as Charles Schwab Corp, to hold clients' assets, should not assume they are immune to hackers. These advisers have other data on their networks that hackers want, such as clients' personal information and emails, said Raj Bakhru, a partner at ACA Aponix, a cyber security firm. Another common mistake by cyber attack victims is to shut down the computer and reformat the hard drive to wipe out viruses. But that destroys vital information that cyber forensic analysts need to determine whether hackers made off with client data, Bakhru said.Instead, advisers should first call a forensics firm. Advisers with a thorough response plan retain those companies in advance, said Brian Lozada, information security director for Abacus Group LLC, a technology firm supporting hedge and private equity funds.A lawyer who can navigate state and federal laws on when a firm must notify clients of a breach is also critical. Running afoul of these laws can trigger civil and even criminal penalties. In New York, for example, consequences could include a $150,000 fine, said Michael Yaeger, a New York lawyer who advises firms on cyber security issues.The burgeoning cyber industry even offers cyber insurance, which can help firms offset the tab for those services and also defray expenses for notifying clients and providing credit-monitoring services. Some policies even cover the cost of one very specific expertise required by firms after hackers have made off with a motherlode of client data: a public relations consultant.

59,"  NEW YORK Walter Bettinger, president and chief executive of Charles Schwab Corp, earned $11.8 million in cash, options and restricted stock awards in 2014, 7 percent below the $12.7 million he was paid in 2013.Five other senior executives of the San Francisco-based brokerage firm also had pay cuts between 5.4 percent and 10.3 percent to an average of $3.4 million. Base salaries for Bettinger and all but one executive remained constant and cash bonuses increased, but each received fewer restricted stock grants than in 2013, according to Schwab's annual proxy document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Schwab's compensation committee ties cash bonuses to earnings per share, which rose 22 percent in 2014. But long-term stock awards and options reflect how much Schwab's return on equity equals or exceeds its cost of equity. The proxy did not go into detail but said the formula ""reflects the creation of financial value for stockholders in all phases of the business cycle and measures the earnings power of the company.""Bettinger received a salary of $1 million, $4.2 million of cash bonuses, and stock and option awards valued at their grant date at a cumulative $6.5 million. He took home another $117,179 consisting primarily of dividends and matching contributions from a retirement plan.  His $11.84 million total, which could change based on the value of Schwab's stock when the options are exercised and his restricted stock vests, outpaced those of top executives at competing firms that offer discount services to retail investors.TD Ameritrade Holding Corp CEO Frederic Tomczyk was paid $7.5 million in the company's fiscal year ending at the end of September 2014.

His previous year's compensation was not disclosed because he was not previously among the company's most senior executives.

60,"  NEW YORK, March 27 Walter Bettinger, president and chief executive of Charles Schwab Corp, earned $11.8 million in cash, options and restricted stock awards in 2014, 7 percent below the $12.7 million he was paid in 2013.Five other senior executives of the San Francisco-based brokerage firm also had pay cuts between 5.4 percent and 10.3 percent to an average of $3.4 million.Base salaries for Bettinger and all but one executive remained constant and cash bonuses increased, but each received fewer restricted stock grants than in 2013, according to Schwab's annual proxy document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.Schwab's compensation committee ties cash bonuses to earnings per share, which rose 22 percent in 2014. But long-term stock awards and options reflect how much Schwab's return on equity equals or exceeds its cost of equity. The proxy did not go into detail but said the formula ""reflects the creation of financial value for stockholders in all phases of the business cycle and measures the earnings power of the company."" Bettinger received a salary of $1 million, $4.2 million of cash bonuses, and stock and option awards valued at their grant date at a cumulative $6.5 million. He took home another $117,179 consisting primarily of dividends and matching contributions from a retirement plan.His $11.84 million total, which could change based on the value of Schwab's stock when the options are exercised and his restricted stock vests, outpaced those of top executives at competing firms that offer discount services to retail investors. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp CEO Frederic Tomczyk was paid $7.5 million in the company's fiscal year ending at the end of September 2014. E*Trade Financial Corp Chief Executive Paul Idzik received $5.3 million. Charles Schwab, chairman of his eponymous firm, took home $4.97 million in 2014, down 9.4 percent from 2013. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Martinetto, who is giving up the title this year, was awarded $3.2 million, down 10.3 percent from 2013.Bernard Clark, who leads Schwab's fast-growing business for independent financial advisers, was paid $2.62 million.

Earnings per share of 22 cents were off 8 percent from a year ago, and also missed the consensus analyst estimate of 24 cents per share.Expenses rose 9 percent in the first quarter to $1.04 billion on seasonally higher compensation and benefit expenses, including a previously unannounced decision to accelerate its 401(k) matches for many of its 14,900 employees.  ""Even as our business growth remained strong, environmental factors contributed to a disappointing rate of revenue growth for the first quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Joe Martinetto said in a statement. Client trading volume slowed as the quarter progressed, dropping 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014, he said. He also cited ""flat-to-lower interest"" rates, an issue that has plagued the investment returns of Schwab and its competitors since the Federal Reserve took rates close to zero over six years ago to stimulate the economy.  Discount brokerages rely on investing idle cash in its customers' trading accounts at much higher rates than it pays on the cash, but rock-bottom rates have sidelined that profit source. Schwab earned an average of just 1.67 percent on the $149.4 billion of cash and interest-earning assets on its balance sheet during the quarter. It also waived $184 million of fees on $165.4 billion of money-market funds held by clients to protect them from negative returns on the investments. Martinetto said that although Schwab is driving ""business growth"" by spending heavily on products such as its automated ""Schwab Intelligent Portfolios"" offering, it expects to hit its 2015 goal of raising expenses by a ""modest"" 4 percent.Schwab also said it continues to transform itself from a low-commission broker to a full-service firm giving advice for a fee. While it added 274,000 new brokerage accounts to bring its total to 9.5 million active accounts during the quarter, about half of clients' $2.5 trillion of assets are enrolled in a Schwab-related advice program, it said.

The San Francisco-based company last week reported a 7 percent decline in its first-quarter net income.TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, which competes with Schwab for discount brokerage customers as well as for independent investment advisers with wealthy clients, also blamed persistently low interest rates earlier this week for lower-than-expected quarterly results. Both companies said they will continue to invest in new technology and products, lifting their expenses in the short term even as revenue is constrained by low rates. Schwab pulled back on some projects in 2014 when it became clear that the Federal Reserve was not raising interest rates, but is more committed to its spending plans this year, executives said on the conference call.When rates do rise, Schwab and TD Ameritrade said their earnings should skyrocket because the money they earn from investing customers' cash will rise faster than what they pay for that cash. Asked if the new ""robo"" product was cannibalizing such accounts, Schwab executives said about 11 to 12 percent of the $1.5 billion in Intelligent Portfolios came from advised accounts at the company. Bettinger also said that Schwab has been building its overall market share by attracting clients from large ""wirehouse"" firms such as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Bank of America's Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Schwab has modified its business model in recent years from pure discount brokerage to a full-service model that offers advice to customers in return for fees.

Nash highlighted the $3 service fee Betterment charges on accounts under $10,000 if customers do not auto-invest $100 monthly in their accounts. ""At $3 per month, an investor opening an account at $100 would be paying an annual management fee of 36 percent in the first year,"" Nash wrote. He also contended that almost one-third of Betterment's revenue comes from the $3 fee.Betterment, which does not have a minimum account size and whose management fee ranges from 0.15 percent to 0.35 percent, called Nash's post ""wildly misleading.""""He used screen shots that are months old and his projection of our revenue is insanely inaccurate,"" Betterment communications manager Joe Ziemer said in an interview. He said the firm never tried to hide the $3 fee and planned to post a comment disputing Nash's post on the medium.com site on Tuesday evening. Wealthfront, which went live in 2011, charges a flat management fee of 0.25 percent on amounts of $10,000 and above.  It has $2.5 billion under management and about 31,000 customers.Betterment, launched in 2010, has $2.3 billion under management and 95,000 customers. The privately held robo-advisors have spawned a wave of other upstarts, but the biggest challenge to conventional brokerage companies is coming from Charles Schwab Corp  and The Vanguard Group.Schwab launched a robo-service called Intelligent Portfolios this year that requires a $5,000 account minimum but charges no management fee. Schwab makes money by including many of its own funds in clients' portfolios and by investing for its own benefit cash it requires customers to keep in their accounts.Vanguard requires a $50,000 minimum for its Personal Advisor Services robo-model, and charges 0.30 percent of a customer's assets as a management fee.(Reporting By Jed Horowitz and Elizabeth Dilts; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2015-07-07,SCHW,"Tue Jul 7, 2015 | 6:46pm EDT",Robo-advisor Wealthfront lowers account minimum to $500,http://www.reuters.com//article/investment-wealthfront-idUSL1N0ZN2CW20150707?type=companyNews

Like many competitors, Schwab has waived hundreds of millions of dollars of management fees so clients do not lose money on the low-return investments.

83,"  By Jed HorowitzNEW YORK Aug 18 James McCool, a longtime Charles Schwab Corp executive who most recently ran its client solutions group, has moved to a new position involving ""key corporate strategic initiatives,"" according to a filing on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The change was announced internally on Aug. 12 and effective immediately, the filing said.Schwab has shaken up its management team several times in recent years as it switches from a pure discount brokerage firm serving self-directed investors to a full-service firm offering fee-based advice along with brokerage. Andy Gill, who until last November co-headed Schwab's retail brokerage business, is assuming most of McCool's duties overseeing products and services sold to customers, Schwab spokesman Greg Gable wrote in an email to Reuters.McCool, who retains his executive vice president title, will be working on projects that are in their early stages, Gable said. In November 2014, Schwab replaced Gill and John Clendening as co-heads of its retail brokerage business with Terri Kallsen, who has announced plans to open many more branches.  Clendening is no longer with the company.McCool's shift to a strategic role was unexpected because of his more than 30-year association with Schwab Chief Executive Walt Bettinger. They began working together in 1984 at The Hampton Company, an Ohio-based retirement plan company that Bettinger founded in 1983 and sold to Schwab in 1995. When Bettinger was elevated to President and CEO in 2008, he made McCool head of Schwab's retirement division and its rapidly growing unit servicing independent financial advisers and their customers. Schwab subsequently merged the retirement business into another unit.In addition to his recent role overseeing products, McCool ran Schwab's international businesses and focused on cash and margin lending products, its charitable foundation and new advisory businesses, according to the company's website. Those responsibilities are being dispersed among several executives.Earlier this year, Schwab said it was seeking a replacement for Joe Martinetto, its longtime chief financial officer who was promoted to senior executive vice president and expanding his role beyond finance. On Tuesday, Gable wrote that Martinetto will remain CFO ""for the foreseeable future.""

They said this caused the fund to lag its benchmark from Sept. 1, 2007, to Feb. 27, 2009, losing 4.80 percent while the index posted a positive total return of 7.85 percent. Writing for the appeals court, Judge Edward Korman, who normally hears cases in Brooklyn, New York, said Schwab's adoption of the fund's fundamental policies were ""sufficient to form a contract"" between the shareholders and the fund itself.A district court judge had dismissed Northstar's lawsuit in August 2011.The case is Schwab Investments v. Northstar Financial Advisors Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 15-134.

94,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Charles Schwab Corp, the discount brokerage pioneer that is expanding into fee-based advisory accounts, said on Thursday that third-quarter profit jumped 17 percent on higher trading commissions and interest revenue.The San Francisco-based company's net income totaled $376 million, or 28 cents a share, a penny higher than the average analyst estimate in a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue was boosted by heavy trading in late August as global markets were roiled by fears about the Chinese economy, but falling stock prices curbed client enthusiasm as the quarter ended.During the week of Aug. 24, Schwab made an average of 514,260 daily trades for clients who paid commissions or bond markups, compared with 294,888 trades the week of Sept. 28. Average daily trades for the quarter rose 13 percent to 304,000, while trading revenue jumped 9 percent to $228 million on slightly lower commission prices. Prodded by a modest quarterly rise in short-term interest rates, net interest income rose 11 percent to $635 million.Total revenue of $1.59 billion was up 3 percent, while expenses fell 2 percent to $1 billion, in line with executives' earlier forecasts. Schwab's pretax profit margin soared to 36.5 percent, its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2008.By comparison, pretax profit margin at Bank of America's global wealth and investment management division, dominated by its Merrill Lynch franchise, was 23 percent in the third quarter. Profit at Schwab and other retail brokerage firms is tied closely to interest rates, because firms invest clients' cash balances at rates higher than they pay for the cash. As a result, Schwab profit is expected to soar when the Federal Reserve raises rates. In anticipation of a rate hike, Schwab in the third and fourth quarters is moving about $4.0 billion of cash in money-market funds to its bank, which typically pays clients lower rates than the funds. Schwab also has been aggressively marketing accounts that charge fees tied to the value of client portfolios as opposed to traditional commission accounts. Retail brokers view fee-based accounts as more stable revenue sources because retail investors curb their trading when markets fall. Schwab opened about 36,000 advisory accounts during the quarter but fee revenue rose just 2 percent while total client assets of $2.4 trillion were up only 1 percent. Falling stock prices have shaved $117.5 billion from client portfolios in the past year, Schwab said.

99,"  (Adds credit to Wall Street Journal)By Trevor HunnicuttNEW YORK Nov 10 Two top asset managers said Tuesday they are slashing costs on some of their exchange-traded funds, ushering in a new level of low fees for investors in funds that track the stock market.BlackRock Inc, the largest manager of ETFs through its iShares brand, said it is cutting fees on seven of its over 700 exchange-traded funds.One such fund - iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF  - is being cut from 0.07 percent of assets to 0.03 percent. That sent the sticker price of that $2.8 billion fund below that of larger funds, such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, at 0.05 percent, and the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF, at 0.04.Charles Schwab Corp struck back later Tuesday, saying it would lower the expense ratio on that fund to 0.03 percent, according to spokesman Greg Gable. The timing of that price cut was not immediately clear. Gable said the firm would also ""look at"" a rate cut on its 0.04 percent U.S. Broad Market ETF. While those fees may seem small, they equate to millions in revenue for asset managers and in potentially increased performance for investors.Three U.S. brands - BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Corp - control 88 percent of the ETF market's assets. They continue to trim prices, as has Schwab. Both Schwab and Vanguard have expanded their shares of the ETF market dramatically over the past several years.Overall, the expenses attached to ETFs have dropped for each of the last three years, to 0.51 percent for the average stock ETF in 2014, according to Lipper. ""At the end of the day, this kind of fee competition benefits investors,"" said Michael Rawson, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. ""It's good to see.""BlackRock's reduction could cut an estimated $1 million of management fees BlackRock collects on the product each year, a 57 percent reduction. But cost reductions can drive a wave of new assets into those funds, raising the fees they collect. ""Our goal is to be present in the core of investors' portfolios,"" said Ruth Weiss, head of the U.S. iShares product team, in an interview. ""We know that price is an important factor in the decision.""New York-based BlackRock is also replacing the Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF's underlying index with one that includes more small companies. Expenses on six other so-called core iShares ETFs will be cut. The funds are aimed at buy-and-hold retail investors.The Schwab price cut was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Vanguard spokesman David Hoffman said that company's ETF lineup has average expense ratios of 0.13 percent. Vanguard delivers its ETF products at cost, so the expense ratios cover costs of running the funds but do not include profits, the spokesman said.""Being an all-the-time, across-the-board cost leader is in our DNA,"" he said in an email. ""Other investment firms may lower costs on a small sub-set of funds or have a separate brand of low-cost products as a business strategy to attract assets.""

Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Journal said Alibaba felt the core business is not attractive, ""given the difficulties successive managers have had in turning it around."" (on.wsj.com/1jAjb0T) Yahoo's board, which includes co-founder David Filo,     Wal-Mart Stores Inc former Chief Executive H. Lee Scott Jr. and Charles Schwab Corp Chairman Charles R. Schwab, was also expected to discuss the planned spinoff of Yahoo's 15 percent stake in Alibaba.Alibaba will be interested in buying back its shares from Yahoo only at a steep discount, the WSJ said, citing the person.After earlier urging the company to spin off the Alibaba stake, Starboard reversed course. It had first urged the sale of the core business in a November letter to Yahoo. It is unclear what the board's decision will mean for the future of Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who has pushed for the spin-off of the Alibaba stake but has not publicly commented on the possible sale of the core business.Yahoo shareholders could end up paying billions in taxes if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service deems a spin-off taxable. The company had sought a private letter ruling from the IRS to confirm a spin-off would be tax-free, but the agency denied the request in September. The board is ""seriously considering"" pausing on a spin-off until there is more clarity on the tax implications, Re/code reported, citing sources. (on.recode.net/21xJA1w)Yahoo had earlier planned to complete an Alibaba spinoff by the end of December. But the company said in October the transaction was expected to close in January.Alibaba and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment.Yahoo's shares were down more than 4 percent in afternoon trading, and Alibaba was down more than 3 percent.

106,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  An accounting firm for a financial services company that advised former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and other athletes violated a rule designed to safeguard customer funds, U.S. securities regulators said on Friday.The accounting firm, Santos, Postal & Co P.C. and one of its partners, Joseph Scolaro, conducted shoddy ""surprise exams"" of customers' assets at SFX Financial Advisory Management Enterprises in Washington, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a settlement with the firm.SFX is owned by  Live Nation Entertainment Inc.A 2010 industry rule requires that advisers who directly hold customers' assets hire an independent accountant to conduct surprise exams of accounts to ensure that customers' funds actually exist. The violations by Rockville, Maryland-based Santos Postal and its partner, Scolaro, included not confirming account activity with clients and filing false statements with the agency. The firm, for example, representing that it complied with certain procedures to verify assets when it never did, the SEC said.Most advisers rely on outside ""custodial"" companies, such as Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade Holiding Corp , to hold each clients' funds in separate accounts and send them statements. That set-up generally does not trigger the surprise exam rule. The SEC's case against Santos Postal followed an SEC administrative judge's ruling last month that former SFX president, Brian Ourand, embezzled more than $671,000 from customers' accounts. Ourand was barred from the securities industry and ordered to pay more than $971,000 in sanctions, according to the ruling. ( 1.usa.gov/1QFLHHq  )Last year, SFX agreed to pay $150,000 to settle related SEC charges, including failure to properly supervise Ourand. Representatives for Santos Postal and Live Nation could not be immediately reached for comment. Scolaro did not return a call requesting comment.Neither Santos Postal nor Scolaro admitted to nor denied the SEC's findings. Both agreed to suspensions from practicing before the SEC as accountants. Santos Postal can apply for reinstatement after one year, while Scolaro can apply in five years. Santos Postal and Scolaro also agreed to pay sanctions of $44,000 and $15,000, respectively.SFX's troubles with the SEC followed a $5 million lawsuit against the firm filed by former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2013.Tyson alleged that he discovered in July 2011 that Ourand had stolen more than $300,000 from him, and that Ourand's misconduct delayed his emergence from bankruptcy and forced him to give up lucrative business opportunities.",2016-04-29,SCHW,"Fri Apr 29, 2016 | 4:55pm EDT",Shoddy exams trigger U.S. sanctions for accountant to athletes' adviser,http://www.reuters.com//article/live-nation-sec-accounts-idUSL2N17W2CR?type=companyNews

109,"   By Ross Kerber | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) customers call in, there is one thing they consistently seek: Help.That is according to Neesha Hathi, who heads client experience and digital platforms for individual investors at Schwab. Client questions, she said, include: ""Help me understand the markets; Help me understand what the political environment is going to do; Help me understand how to be diversified; Help me understand how this portfolio will help me against my own personal goals.""Those calls for help explain why Schwab, like many traditional financial firms, has embraced digital offerings while still maintaining a large staff of human financial consultants. The robots - at least so far - cannot answer calls from panicked clients about central bank policy, interest rates or geopolitics. At the Reuters Global Wealth Summit in New York this week, executives from several other firms, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), LPL Financial Holdings Inc (LPLA.O) and Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O), offered similar views that the future of financial technology will follow a so-called ""cyborg"" hybrid model of human and machine interaction.The firms spoke at a time when many in the industry are watching the rise of robo-adviser companies like Betterment LLC and Wealthfront Inc, which rely heavily on automated investment tools. Speaking at the summit on Tuesday, Betterment Chief Executive Jon Stein set a goal of hitting $1 trillion in assets under management, from $4.8 billion currently. Meanwhile, the larger companies are spending heavily on new digital platforms and making or considering acquisitions to ensure they are at the cutting edge of wealth management.All are looking to gain millennial customers, keep older clients as they grow more comfortable with mobile devices and reduce costs. Machines can also help them reach customers without enough wealth to justify expensive advice.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, said the firm has found a good reception among clients for a new app that lets advisers show them the pros and cons of investment decisions and allows clients to script out their own scenarios. ""It's nice to be able to see the trade-offs. That's something that the industry hasn't been particularly good at illuminating for clients,"" she said.But with all the advances, it is clear that machines still have their limits. Even the wealthiest technology entrepreneurs often are not ready to trust their investments entirely to a machine, said Don Heberle, head of wealth management for BNY Mellon.Clients of Atherton Lane, an independent adviser it recently bought in Silicon Valley, still want to talk to a live person at times. ""In all cases we still have personal interaction,"" he said. Another issue: machines cannot tend to investor emotions in a crisis, said Mark Casady, chief executive of LPL Financial, (LPLA.O) which struck a deal to use robo-adviser technology from leading asset firm BlackRock Inc (BLK.N).""We all know the truisms that are common sense, but most consumers don’t follow them,"" Casady said.

110,"   By Olivia Oran  Plenty of apps track your activity, food consumption, heart rate and blood sugar, to encourage you to stick to your health goals. That same model is coming to wealth management, with real-time alerts from financial firms that try to curb bad behaviors like overspending.Executives speaking at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in New York this week described mobile alerts as the next step in helping clients improve their finances.For example, GPS technology now used to send offers to shoppers when they are near a retail store can be used in the opposite manner, said LPL Financial Holdings Inc (LPLA.O) Chief Executive Mark Casady. A financial adviser could instead send automated notifications when a client has been inside a favorite store too long, encouraging the person to leave before splurging, he said.""It sounds a little creepy,"" said Casady, but soon that kind of alert ""will be very normal.""Technology has already dramatically changed the way the wealth management industry conducts business.At the summit, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) wealth co-heads described an in-house tool that allows advisers to quickly analyze hundreds of accounts for cost-savings or return benefits. Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Corp's (NTRS.O) wealth business, described an app the bank recently rolled out that changed the way advisers conduct meetings with clients. Robo-advisers like Betterment LLC, whose CEO Jon Stein also attended the summit, have allowed investment advice to be delivered in pure digital form.Few of the technologies discussed go a step further by tracking a client's physical whereabouts to scold him or her for spending too much. Executives acknowledged the ""creep"" factor Casady referred to, but said the benefits may far outweigh the costs.Neesha Hathi, who oversees client experience and digital platforms for individual investors at Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N), drew comparisons to fitness tracker Fitbit Inc (FIT.N), which helps consumers improve their health by tracking activity, exercise and food.""In many ways, fitness or health are similar in that it's a long-term exercise where you don't necessarily see the benefits that day,"" Hathi said. ""Saving and investing are similar in that you can spend a bunch of money today and you won't feel the pain...(until) a year from now or seven years from now."" In fact, there are already some health-fitness apps in the marketplace.Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) launched an app in April called Splurge Alert, which asks users to identify what they are most likely to splurge on, whether it's coffee or shoes. The app then uses geolocation technology to pinpoint specific stores as ""danger zones"" and alert users when they get too close.Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) has rolled out an app called MySpend which links to customers' bank accounts and credit cards to analyze spending. The app has a feature akin to a traffic light that flashes red if users are above their typical monthly spending. While such apps could make some customers uncomfortable at first, executives believe they will eventually be embraced. ""Be careful about the creepy factor,"" said Casady, ""but how great to (have) a reminder that allows you to be part of someone's life even when you're not there.""Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits (Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and David Gregorio)",2016-06-15,SCHW,"Wed Jun 15, 2016 | 4:51pm EDT",Next frontier for financial advisers: your mobile phone,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-wealth-summit-idUSKCN0Z12GE?type=companyNews
