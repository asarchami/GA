0,"  FRANKFURT German engineering group Siemens plans to sell its hospital IT business to Cerner Corp, a U.S. provider of healthcare IT services, for $1.3 billion in cash, the two companies said late on Tuesday.The deal comes as Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser seeks to focus the group, Germany's second-biggest company by market value, on its most promising businesses to close a gap with more profitable competitors such as Switzerland's ABB and U.S.-based General Electric. Siemens said it was selling its hospital information system business, which has about $1.2 billion of annual sales and around 5,000 client facilities in over 40 countries, because it failed to consistently keep up with competitors.""Additionally, an increasing number of country-specific requirements, such as (those) resulting from U.S. healthcare reform, make it increasingly challenging to achieve sufficient scale effects,"" Hermann Requardt, CEO of Siemens's Healthcare division, said in a statement.Instead, Siemens said it would focus its efforts in the healthcare IT area on the development of systems for its laboratory diagnostics as well as imaging and therapy businesses. Siemens, whose products range from gas turbines to high-speed trains and industrial automation software, has sold or spun off a raft of assets over the past couple of years, including its light bulb making business Osram and parts of its water technology business. This month, it agreed to sell its clinical microbiology business to Beckman Coulter, a subsidiary of Danaher Corp. At the same time, it has bought some businesses, such as a turbines business from Rolls-Royce, to bolster its energy and industrials divisions. In June, it lost out in a bidding war for Alstom's energy assets that would have seen it buy the French peer's gas turbines business for 4.3 billion euros in cash. Cerner said a combination of Siemens's hospital IT business with its own operations would create an entity with $4.5 billion of annual revenue and $650 million of annual investments in research and development.Siemens and Cerner also agreed on a strategic alliance to jointly invest in projects integrating health IT with medical technologies, each contributing up to $50 million. Cerner said it expected the purchase of Siemens's assets, which it will finance with cash on hand, to add 15 cents to its adjusted per-share earnings in 2015.JP Morgan advised Siemens on the deal, while Cerner was advised by Greenhill & Co. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. (Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Additional reporting by Rohit T.

4,"  SAN FRANCISCO Cerner Corp and Athenahealth Inc, two leading U.S. electronic health record providers, said on Thursday they are working with Apple Inc to develop applications that leverage Apple's mobile health service HealthKit.Cerner and Athenahealth representatives said they are building integrations with HealthKit and working with Apple. Previously, Apple announced a partnership with rival electronic health record company Epic Systems. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.The goal is to help doctors monitor patients with chronic conditions from home and identify health risks. HealthKit gathers data from various applications and devices, including blood pressure cuffs, accelerometers and glucose measurement systems, and makes it easier for doctors to view it all in one place. Across the United States, hospitals are rolling out pilots using HealthKit to improve preventative care, and potentially cut costs. Cerner, Epic and Athenahealth are central to these plans, as the patient-generated data is ultimately stored in the electronic health record. Both Athenahealth and Cerner have developed mobile applications targeted at patients. HealthKit-compatible versions of these apps will be available on the App Store when Apple fixes a bug that forced health developers to pull their apps on Wednesday. Apple said it was working to address the bug. The HealthKit apps will be available by the end of the month.An Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the company's new HealthKit partners.  Athenahealth vice president Abbe Don said the company will use HealthKit to help patients with chronic conditions like diabetes. Cerner senior director Brian Carter said care teams, including doctors and nurses, will be able to access data from HealthKit with patients' consent.Carter said they will work closely with ""focused smaller organizations"" to prove the value of the service. He said the initial integration will focus on wellness and preventing the onset of chronic conditions.  Athenahealth's Don said the company will test its ""proof of concept"" application with one client, Hudson Headwaters Health Network, a non-profit health center based in New York. Don said medical device makers are also working on HealthKit integrations for use in early trials.""There is an awful lot we can do with HealthKit,"" she said.
