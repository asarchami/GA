Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management is Air Products' biggest shareholder with a 9.71 percent stake.The company has been looking for a new leader since Chief Executive Officer John McGlade said in September that he would retire this year. McGlade plans to stay on as chairman of the board for a limited time as the new CEO settles in.Air Products is one of the world's largest industrial gas companies, breaking down air to form oxygen, nitrogen and other components used in construction, healthcare, oil refining and scores of other industries.McGlade's replacement will have to turn around a corporate culture that has long had a reputation as top-down and bureaucratic. That inefficiency has cost the company market share and dented margins, which badly trail Praxair Inc (PX.N) and other rivals. Air Products also has invested capital in unrelated businesses, including specialty chemicals for electronics makers and liquefied natural gas heat exchangers, that Ackman and others have said diverts the company from its core mission.Since McGlade's announcement, the company's stock price has moved up and down and is now trading only about 2 percent higher at $112.04 then where it was in late September. As an activist investor, Ackman knows firsthand how selecting the right person for the top job can make or break investments.Watching Ron Johnson's vision for remaking J.C.Penney (JCP.N) fall apart cost his hedge fund $500 million, but installing Hunter Harrison at Canadian Pacific (CP.TO) helped him earn more than $2 billion in less than two years.""The risk at Air Products is whether or not they are going to choose the right CEO,"" Ackman said at the 2014 Harbor Investment Conference, which he runs with Mark Axelowitz.

21,"   By Matthias Inverardi | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Germany's Evonik Industries AG will buy the specialty and coating additives operations of U.S. industrial gas producer Air Products and Chemicals Inc for $3.8 billion.Evonik has been trying since 2014 to make a big acquisition to bolster growth and reduce dependence on its volatile animal feed ingredients business.The businesses Evonik is buying, with about $1 billion in sales, are part of a division Air Products had earmarked for a separate listing. Air Products said it would still list the rest of the division - Material Technologies - under a new name, Versum Materials.The Evonik deal values the two units at 15.2 times expected 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Evonik said in presentation slides on Friday. That is far above Evonik's own trading multiple of 6.3 including debt, according to Thomson Reuters. Evonik said once savings and tax benefits were included, it was paying 9.9 times the assets' earnings.Feed ingredients, sulfur-containing amino acids mainly used for poultry, provided an earnings boost last year as prices rose due to an unexpected shortfall in rivals' output, but prices are expected to decline this year. With its acquisitions, Evonik will be adding ingredients for insulation foams, sun lotion and paint as well as additives to harden aircraft and marine coatings.

30,"   By Diane Bartz  Praxair Inc's contemplated merger with Linde AG would cut the number of global industrial gas suppliers to three from four, posing antitrust challenges and drawing scrutiny from regulators wary of more mega deals.Antitrust experts said the companies, which announced they were in early-stage talks on Tuesday, would likely have to agree to divestitures to create the world's largest industrial gas company with a market value of more than $60 billion.""It does strike me as a deal that will prompt serious antitrust scrutiny. Antitrust enforcers will want to look at submarkets,"" said Seth Bloom, formerly of the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and now in private practice.Antitrust authorities have been flexing muscle regarding  transformative mergers. Deals they have challenged include Anthem’s $45 billion purchase of Cigna, Aetna’s $33 billion acquisition of Humana, and U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co's $34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes Inc. Consolidation in industrial gases, including Air Liquide SA's $13 billion acquisition of Airgas in May, has left Air Liquide, Linde, Praxair and Air Products and Chemicals Inc providing most of the oxygen, nitrogen, argon and other gases to industries ranging from oil companies to drugmakers. Air Liquide has 29 percent of the U.S. industrial gas market, Praxair has 21 percent, Linde has 15 percent and Air Products has 14 percent, according to the most recent annual data from industry news provider gasworld Business Intelligence. A merger of Praxair and Linde would create a sector leader with 36 percent of the U.S. market.The story is similar in Europe, where Air Liquide has 32 percent of the market, Linde has 30 percent, Air Products has 13 percent and Praxair has 7 percent, according to gasworld.Such market shares would give regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pause, antitrust experts said. Praxair and Linde will likely have to review their business with regulators market by market, in regions as small as one metropolitan area, experts said. ""There will be a settlement offer, and the question will be whether the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) thinks it's enough,"" said Ethan Glass of the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan LLP, who argued for the U.S. Department of Justice as it sought to stop Electrolux AB from buying General Electric Co's appliance business. Air Liquide's acquisition of Airgas offers some insight into the scrutiny to be expected. When the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reviewed the deal, it required a divestiture of assets to preserve competition for dry ice in the San Francisco Bay area. Adding to the uncertainty are questions over the FTC's composition next year. The final decision on antitrust clearance will likely be made by the next administration, since a new U.S. president will take office in January and a major antitrust review can last a year. The FTC, which normally has five commissioners, currently has three: two Democrats and a Republican.
