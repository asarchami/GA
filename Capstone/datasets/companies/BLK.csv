0,"   By Emily Flitter | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 7 U.S. prosecutors are examining a new set of Credit Suisse Group AG documents, including internal emails, that may show whether a bank committee charged with overseeing the quality of home loans ignored red flags to the detriment of mortgage investors, according to a source familiar with the documents.The internal bank group, called the Watch List Committee, was established in 2005 as Credit Suisse's mortgage securitization business grew. Its job was to make sure that bad loans were not included in securities that the bank sold to investors.The emails, which have not been previously reported and were described to Reuters by the source, could play a key role in any action that prosecutors may decide to bring against Credit Suisse for its mortgage activities before the housing bust.U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Ellen Canale and Credit Suisse spokesman Drew Benson declined to comment on the investigation. The emails show Credit Suisse employees complained that poor quality loans were being allowed to go through because some members of the committee were focusing chiefly on the need to generate a large volume of loans, rather than trying to improve underwriting practices, according to the source.One of the emails that prosecutors are examining is from John Vibert, who served as co-head of non-agency mortgage trading at Credit Suisse in the years leading up to the crisis and was a member of the Watch List committee, the source said. In the internal email, Vibert complained that the committee was ""driven by the sales psychology of Mike Fallacara and Chris Delfs,"" according to the source. Delfs was the head of RMBS sales at the time, while Fallacara headed the bank's loan conduit, charged with securitization and reselling the loans.Committee members also complained in emails that Delfs and Fallacara were dominating the committee's activities, the source said. Delfs and Vibert declined to comment. Reached by phone in late December, Fallacara referred Reuters to his lawyer, who declined to comment on Friday.Prosecutors have not accused any banker of wrongdoing, and it is unclear if there will be any action brought against individual bankers who served on the committee.Fallacara is now a managing director at Fortress Investment Group. Delfs joined Toronto-Dominion Bank in November as a vice president for mortgage capital markets. Vibert is a managing director and a member of the Securitized Assets Investment Team at BlackRock Inc.Credit Suisse is being investigated by the Justice Department's Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, a network of law enforcement agents and prosecutors - both state and federal - jointly investigating the mortgage market meltdown.",2014-01-07,BLK,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 1:00am EST",U.S. probe examines Credit Suisse mortgage standards panel -source,http://www.reuters.com//article/creditsuisse-mortgageprobe-idUSL2N0KD0RQ20140107?type=companyNews
1,"   By Karen Freifeld  BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, agreed to end its analyst survey program worldwide, as part of an agreement reached Wednesday with the New York Attorney General's office.The agreement stems from an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman into the early release of Wall Street analyst sentiment to ""front-run"" the market.BlackRock agreed to pay $400,000 for the cost of the investigation, but no fine or penalty, and to cooperate in Schneiderman's ongoing industry-wide probe.At a press conference on Thursday, Schneiderman said the continuing investigation includes looking at the analysts and brokerage firms that participated in the surveys.He said BlackRock's agreement was a ""major step forward"" in ensuring a level playing field for all investors.""We're going to continue to crackdown,"" Schneiderman said. ""This is a growing area of concern because ... sophisticated market participants can gain early access to market-moving information that provides them an unfair advantage over the rest of us.""The Analyst Survey Program operated by BlackRock was believed to be the largest analyst survey in the world, Schneiderman said.The program asked many of the most prominent analysts at dozens of brokerage firms a series of questions related to the companies they were covering, according to the agreement.Although the survey was supposedly to quantify the analysts' publicly available insights, Schneiderman found evidence that the program's design allowed it to capture ""non-public analyst sentiment that could be used to trade ahead of the market reaction to upcoming analyst reports,"" the agreements said. Participating analysts were rewarded with higher ratings in financial industry magazine rankings, Schneiderman found, which helped analysts' name recognition and careers and may have led to monetary gain for the analysts and their firms.""When analysts would provide answers to questions regarding their views on possible future earnings scenarios, possible M&A activity and other matters, BlackRock was ... trying to learn the sentiment to be expressed in upcoming reports,"" Schneiderman said.Analysts and their firms are prohibited from providing select clients with early disclosure of research reports, which can move markets, he said.The analysts were surveyed on a quarterly or monthly basis, depending on where they were located geographically, and included hundreds of thousands of responses. The U.S. surveys would ask analysts to answer questions on a scale of 1 through 9, and the responses were averaged, aggregated and converted into quantitative return forecasts.The program was developed in 2003 by Barclays Global Investors, which BlackRock acquired in 2009.When it was started, Scientific Active Equities, the quantitative investment group within BGI and now BlackRock, believed it could use the responses to ""forecast"" analysts' ""next estimate revision,"" the agreement said.An internal SAE document also revealed the program's success depended in part on a ""willingness to really give us advance information.""""We're trying to front-run"" recommendations, another internal document said.

10,"   By Ashley Lau  BlackRock Inc, the world's largest money manager, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, benefiting from strong markets and a flow of new money into its exchange-traded funds and retail business.The New York-based asset manager ended the fourth quarter through December 31 with $4.3 trillion in assets, including new money and market gains, surpassing the $4 trillion mark for the first time last year.That asset growth - a 14 percent rise from the end of 2012 - helped drive BlackRock's 24-percent jump in quarterly profit to $841 million, or $4.86 per share, up from $690 million, or $3.93 per share, a year earlier.BlackRock and its peers make money by charging fees as a percentage of assets under management.""They are well positioned to generate solid growth almost regardless of the market environment, given that they have a very broad product offering,"" said Jason Weyeneth, a New York-based analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc, focusing on the asset management sector.BlackRock shares were up 1.7 percent at $317.96 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier jumping as much as 4.2 percent. The stock surged 53 percent in 2013, riding an equity market rally that also boosted its peers.The company said its board had approved a 15 percent increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $1.93 per common share, payable in March.Excluding long-term compensation expenses and other items, earnings were $4.92 a share, above analysts' average forecast of $4.33, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts said part of that profit gain may have been driven by a lower tax rate and better than expected performance fees.Revenue grew 9 percent to $2.8 billion. Revenue generated by fees based on a portfolio's performance rose 2 percent to $268 million from a year earlier. iSHARES, RETAILBlackRock has benefited from increased investor appetite for the less-expensive indexed funds provided by iShares, which the company acquired from Barclays in 2009 and is now the largest U.S. provider of ETFs. iShares makes up 21 percent of the company's assets under management.Of the $40.5 billion that investors poured into long-term funds during the quarter, nearly half - $19.1 billion - went into the company's iShares exchange-traded funds business. Retail investors accounted for $16.6 billion, or 41 percent of total long-term net flows.""You typically observe retail coming in when markets have recovered and look more stable, and they tend to sell when things get choppy,"" said St. Louis-based Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.""Institutions are taking profits at these levels and retail is piling in,"" Shanahan said, noting that the increased activity on the retail side was consistent with the broader industry.BlackRock has been expanding its iShares business within the U.S. and abroad. ""We think Europe is going to be a place of accelerated growth"" for ETFs, Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview on Thursday.BlackRock last year acquired Credit Suisse's ETF business and hired Rachel Lord, previously with Citigroup, to head its iShares business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Fink said he saw the potential for ETF assets to eventually account for 25 percent of the mutual fund industry. ETFs currently represent about 15 percent of the industry.The bulk of investor money during the quarter went into equities, which accounted for $24.7 billion, or roughly 61 percent, of BlackRock's long-term net inflows.Investors also added more money than they withdrew in fixed-income funds, which had net inflows of $1.5 billion, and multi-asset products, which had $17.4 billion.

11,"  By Ashley LauJan 16 BlackRock Inc, the world's largest money manager, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, benefiting from strong markets and a flow of new money into its exchange-traded funds and retail business.The New York-based asset manager ended the fourth quarter through Dec. 31 with $4.3 trillion in assets, including new money and market gains, surpassing the $4 trillion mark for the first time last year.That asset growth - a 14 percent rise from the end of 2012 - helped drive BlackRock's 24-percent jump in quarterly profit to $841 million, or $4.86 per share, up from $690 million, or $3.93 per share, a year earlier.BlackRock and its peers make money by charging fees as a percentage of assets under management.""They are well positioned to generate solid growth almost regardless of the market environment, given that they have a very broad product offering,"" said Jason Weyeneth, a New York-based analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc, focusing on the asset management sector.BlackRock shares were up 1.7 percent at $317.96 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier jumping as much as 4.2 percent. The stock surged 53 percent in 2013, riding an equity market rally that also boosted its peers.The company said its board had approved a 15 percent increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $1.93 per common share, payable in March.Excluding long-term compensation expenses and other items, earnings were $4.92 a share, above analysts' average forecast of $4.33, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts said part of that profit gain may have been driven by a lower tax rate and better than expected performance fees.Revenue grew 9 percent to $2.8 billion. Revenue generated by fees based on a portfolio's performance rose 2 percent to $268 million from a year earlier. iSHARES, RETAILBlackRock has benefited from increased investor appetite for the less-expensive indexed funds provided by iShares, which the company acquired from Barclays in 2009 and is now the largest U.S. provider of ETFs. iShares makes up 21 percent of the company's assets under management.Of the $40.5 billion that investors poured into long-term funds during the quarter, nearly half - $19.1 billion - went into the company's iShares exchange-traded funds business. Retail investors accounted for $16.6 billion, or 41 percent of total long-term net flows.""You typically observe retail coming in when markets have recovered and look more stable, and they tend to sell when things get choppy,"" said St. Louis-based Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.""Institutions are taking profits at these levels and retail is piling in,"" Shanahan said, noting that the increased activity on the retail side was consistent with the broader industry. BlackRock has been expanding its iShares business within the U.S. and abroad.""We think Europe is going to be a place of accelerated growth"" for ETFs, Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview on Thursday.BlackRock last year acquired Credit Suisse's ETF business and hired Rachel Lord, previously with Citigroup, to head its iShares business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Fink said he saw the potential for ETF assets to eventually account for 25 percent of the mutual fund industry. ETFs currently represent about 15 percent of the industry.The bulk of investor money during the quarter went into equities, which accounted for $24.7 billion, or roughly 61 percent, of BlackRock's long-term net inflows. Investors also added more money than they withdrew in fixed-income funds, which had net inflows of $1.5 billion, and multi-asset products, which had $17.4 billion.RETIREMENT BlackRock is increasingly turning its focus to the retirement market, where it sees a ripe opportunity.""We believe the defined contribution area is the greatest growth area,"" Fink said.

21,"  By Ashley LauJan 30 Invesco Ltd said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit jumped 81 percent, boosted by strong markets and the sale of its Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management unit.The Atlanta-based money manager, which oversees the PowerShares line of exchange-traded funds, said net profit rose to $287.4 million, or 64 cents per share, from $158.7 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding the sale of its Atlantic Trust unit, which Invesco sold to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for $210 million, the company earned 58 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Strong markets and demand for alternative and equity products helped drive growth in assets under management at the firm during the quarter.""In risk-on environments, clients shift demand toward equities,"" Chief Executive Officer Martin Flanagan said on a call with analysts on Thursday. ""This is exactly what we experienced.""Invesco shares were up 1.8 percent at $33.64 in midday  trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Invesco shares gained 39.5 percent in 2013, mirroring the rise in the broader stock market.MARKET RALLY BOOSTS ASSETS  Invesco ended the year with $778.7 billion in total assets under management, an increase of $33.2 billion during the three months ended Dec 31, and up 16.7 percent from a year ago.A market rally in 2013 in which the S&P 500 gained 29.6 percent over the year drove those gains at Invesco and boosted funds flowing into the asset management industry.Among other major asset managers, both BlackRock Inc  and T.Rowe Price Group Inc reported a 24 percent increase in profit during the fourth quarter.Net long-term flows at Invesco, not including flows into institutional money market funds, were $1 billion. They were largely lifted by investors pouring money into equity and alternative products, which had net inflows of $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion during the quarter, respectively.""When you look at the big, core publicly traded asset management firms, they're doing the best on flows"" over the past two years, said Luke Montgomery, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. ""This quarter may not be as relatively robust, but it's still pretty good."" Flanagan said Invesco launched more funds during the fourth quarter than it did in any full calendar year over the past five years.""These product launches are designed to further solidify our position as one of the largest managers of alternatives for U.S. institutional investors,"" he said.Invesco's PowerShares QQQ fund added $2.6 billion in net new money. PowerShares is the fourth-largest U.S. provider of ETFs by assets, following BlackRock Inc, Vanguard and State Street Corp.Analysts focus on flow data because asset managers' revenue and profits are closely tied to market indexes not under their control. TOP MANAGER DEPARTING One of Invesco's top fund managers, Neil Woodford, is set to depart in April after 25 years with the firm, which analysts and market participants have said could lead to the defection of clients loyal to Woodford.""I think it's inevitable that there will be outflows,"" Montgomery said, noting that the bulk of the potential client departures would likely come around the time of Woodford's departure.

22,"  Invesco Ltd (IVZ.N), which oversees the PowerShares line of exchange-traded funds, said on Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 81 percent, helped by strong markets and sales of alternative and equity products.The Atlanta-based money manager said net profit rose to $287.4 million, or 64 cents per share, from $158.7 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding certain factors including the sale of its Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management unit, Invesco earned 58 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Invesco ended the year with $778.7 billion in total assets under management, an increase of $33.2 billion during the quarter, and up 16.7 percent from a year ago.Net long-term flows at Invesco, not including flows into institutional money market funds, were $1 billion. They were largely lifted by investors pouring money into equity and alternative products, which had net inflows of $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion during the quarter, respectively. Analysts focus on flow data because asset managers' revenue and profits are closely tied to market indexes not under their control. Invesco's PowerShares QQQ fund (QQQ.O) added $2.6 billion in net new money.

25,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 5 Charles Schwab Corp is taking broader aim at the  retirement market with a new 401(k) platform that will allow participants to invest 100 percent of their plan in low-cost exchange-traded funds.Schwab, which already has 401(k) programs using traditional mutual funds, said the new all-ETF platform is designed to reduce investment expenses for investors. An ETF on the new platform, for example, would cost roughly $7 to $10 for every $10,000 invested, while an index mutual fund might cost $14 to $15 for every $10,000 invested and an actively managed mutual fund might cost $70 for every $10,000 invested.""To ignore ETFs would be a mistake in the 401(k) market,"" Steve Anderson, head of Schwab Retirement Plan Services, said in an interview ahead of the launch.ETFs track a basket of securities such as stocks, commodities or bonds. Schwab's new all-ETF 401(k) platform will include 27 asset classes, compared with 17 asset classes offered on its Schwab Index Advantage mutual fund platform, and offer the ability to tap into a broader set of asset classes such as global real estate, precious metals, and emerging markets bonds. The new all-ETF platform is likely initially to attract smaller retirement plans, which could benefit from a lower-cost alternative, said Mike Alfred, head of San Diego-based research firm BrightScope.""Plans over $1 billion in general are already very efficient"" in achieving lower costs through economies of scale, Alfred said. ""Historically, plans under $10 million have been under served in the sense that providers available to them are significantly more expensive,"" he said. ""That's where this might be an opportunity for them.""The increased use of ETFs in 401(k) plans could also pave the way for more growth in the swelling ETF market, which has amassed $2.4 trillion in global assets but still accounts for less than 1 percent of assets in the retirement market, which has largely been dominated by mutual funds. ""There's never been an all-ETF, intraday trading, record-keeping platform rolled out at any scale,"" Alfred said. That has slowed adoption of ETFs in 401(k) plans in the past.The roughly 80 ETFs offered on the Schwab 401(k) platform come from 11 different providers, including BlackRock Inc's  iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, in addition to Schwab's own proprietary funds.By expanding into the ETF market, San Francisco-based Schwab is also looking to expand its retirement business, which has about $105 billion in assets and 1.3 million participants in the unit run by Anderson.Users of Schwab's all-ETF platform will automatically be enrolled in an advisory service - for an additional $45 for every $10,000 invested - with the option to opt out, the same as its index mutual fund users.",2014-02-05,BLK,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 9:00am EST",Schwab rolls out 401(k) platform using exchange-traded funds,http://www.reuters.com//article/schwab-etfs-idUSL2N0L918E20140205?type=companyNews
26,"   By Claire Milhench | LONDON  LONDON Emerging markets turmoil drove investors away from commodity exchange traded products (ETPs) in January due to concerns about demand growth, but gold outflows slowed as its safe haven status was revived.Some $1.7 billion was withdrawn from commodity ETPs in January global data from BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, showed. ETPs, whose value is linked to moves in their underlying assets, offer an easy route into commodities and allow asset managers to make quick, tactical shifts.Emerging market assets faced intense selling pressure last month following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to wind down its monetary stimulus. This will remove some of the cheap money that has flooded into developing economies over the last five years in search of better returns.Emerging market equity ETPs ended January with $10 billion of outflows, the largest monthly outflows on record, BlackRock said. Investors were particularly concerned about countries with high current account deficits - Brazil, Indonesia, India, Turkey and South Africa.""A number of central banks in developing countries have tried to stem the general flight to quality by raising interest rates, but this has largely served to increase worries over growth and stability for weaker economies,"" BlackRock said.If growth weakens, this could reduce the demand for energy, agriculture and base metals. A softer-than-expected Chinese manufacturing PMI reading of 49.6 contributed to the sell-off, as this confirmed lingering fears of a slowdown in domestic demand, BlackRock added. GOLD BEGINS TO PERFORM Meanwhile gold ETP outflows slowed to $860 million from $3.6 billion in December. ""Investors turned to gold as emerging markets turmoil accelerated,"" said Nick Brooks, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities, an issuer of ETPs. ""We saw that in the price performance. It was one of the few assets to see a positive return in January.""The S&P GSCI Gold index was up 3.1 percent in January, whilst the S&P 500 was down 3.6 percent, its worst monthly decline since May 2012. Gold also outperformed bonds and the dollar. Brooks noted that inflows into gold ETPs on the ETF Securities platform hit their highest level in five months in the week ending January 30, at $44 million. Silver attracted global net inflows in January of $55 million after starting the year at below $19 an ounce. ""It's seen as a good entry point,"" Brooks said.""And with the gold price stabilizing and starting to rise, silver is seen as a higher beta way to play this improving sentiment towards gold."" Silver has a higher volatility than gold so if gold is expected to rise, tactical investors will often move into silver more aggressively, he said.Surprisingly given the emerging markets sell off, industrial metals ended the month with net inflows of $143 million, but Brooks said this masked a change in sentiment mid-month. In early January, there were strong flows into copper and nickel but these tailed off as emerging market problems mounted. The S&P GSCI industrial metals index was down 4.3 percent in January, with aluminum suffering the biggest hit.On the energy side investors pulled money from natural gas ETPs after strong price gains due to weeks of sub-zero temperatures in North America, which ran down stocks. ""We saw some big inflows into natural gas ETPs at the end of 2013 and now they are selling to make a nice return,"" Brooks said.In February investors have continued to put money into gold ETPs, there have been inflows into short natural gas ETPs and some flows into coffee and sugar, according to data from ETF Securities. ""But we need to see some stabilization of the situation in emerging markets before investors are ready to move in more aggressively,"" Brooks said.At the end of January BlackRock's data covered 898 commodity ETPs worldwide, worth some $114.6 billion.(Reporting by Claire Milhench, editing by David Evans)",2014-02-11,BLK,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 8:43am EST",Emerging market turmoil keeps pressure on commodity ETPs: BlackRock,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-etps-commodities-idUSBREA1A0ZS20140211?type=companyNews
27,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 12 BlackRock Inc, the world's largest money manager, is expanding its push into the retirement market with a new set of bond funds tied to indexes that track an individual's expected annual retirement income once he or she reaches age 65.The new funds, which BlackRock is targeting at investors over 55, are linked to a series of retirement benchmark indexes the company launched in July. The index series, called CoRI Indexes, allow pre-retirees to calculate an estimate of how much their current savings would produce in annual income when they turn 65, or conversely, how much they would need to save to reach a certain annual lifetime income level upon retiring.""We designed CoRI to be an investable index,"" said Chip Castille, head of BlackRock's U.S. retirement group, in a press briefing in New York on Wednesday. The five new funds are the first in the series, with maturity dates in 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023. The idea is that upon reaching age 65, investors can choose to liquidate their holdings in the fund and invest in another lifetime income product, such as an annuity, or can stay in the funds for another 10 years, until they turn 75, at which point the funds liquidate and they receive the remaining investment. The new funds are what Castille describes as ""plain vanilla"" bond funds, comprised primarily of U.S. Treasuries and high-quality corporate bonds.Castille said other firms may be able to license the CoRI indexes using their patents, and BlackRock is already talking with other fund companies. BlackRock, which has the fourth-largest franchise in the defined contribution industry in terms of assets in its plans, said it had $30 billion in net inflows into its defined contribution channel last year, increasing its total assets in the unit to $525 billion.Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has said that defined contribution and retirement planning are among top priorities for the New York-based asset manager. BlackRock introduced Castille's U.S. retirement group in January and said it would be focusing on product development and services geared toward individual investors.",2014-02-12,BLK,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 1:49pm EST",BlackRock expands retirement business with new bond funds,http://www.reuters.com//article/blackrock-funds-retirement-idUSL2N0LH12D20140212?type=companyNews
28,"  By Tim McLaughlin and Ross KerberBOSTON Feb 12 Fidelity Investments, the No. 2 U.S. mutual fund company, said on Wednesday that operating profit rose 13 percent to $2.6 billion last year as clients pulled less money from its funds.Despite improved performance for some of Fidelity's products, the results showed the company losing ground to competitors who focus more on index and exchange-traded funds.Boston-based Fidelity said managed products, including mutual funds, institutional offerings and funds packaged within managed accounts, posted net outflows of $1.1 billion for the year, compared with outflows of $5.3 billion in 2012.Operating revenue jumped 8 percent to $13.6 billion on higher asset-based fees and improved brokerage results. Fidelity said results were dampened by persistent pricing pressures and extremely low interest rates.Analysts who follow the company acknowledged the profit increase, but said flows were a concern. Among funds tracked by Morningstar Inc, Vanguard Group Inc received $75 billion in net flows in 2013, more than three times any other firm, and BlackRock Inc took in $11 billion. Fidelity had only $5 billion in net flows, lagging about half of the 35 largest fund families.For Fidelity, ""net outflows in (a) year when Vanguard continued to rake in the dough is more than a bit deflating,"" James Lowell, who edits the Fidelity Investor newsletter, said via email.Lowell noted some bright spots, such as investments in its branch network, that seem to be paying off and the growth of Fidelity's retirement business. Total assets under administration were $4.6 trillion at the end of 2013, up 19 percent from 2012. Also, in 2013 Fidelity had 23.8 million participants in its workplace offerings such as 401(k) retirement accounts and health savings plans, up from 22.9 million participants in 2012.ANOTHER STEP FOR ABIGAIL JOHNSON Because the Johnson family rarely speaks publicly, Fidelity's annual report provides a rare look into the workings of the business. Closely held by the family of Chairman Ned Johnson, 83, Fidelity is known for its stable of mutual funds, including the $100 billion-plus Contrafund.In his annual letter, Johnson expressed ""complete confidence"" in the expanding corporate role of his daughter, Abigail Johnson, who is 52 years old. In 2012, she was promoted to run all of the company's main businesses, signaling that she could be the next leader of the mutual fund powerhouse founded by her grandfather.In Wednesday's report, Fidelity said that Abigail Johnson also had assumed an expanded leadership role in September as president of FMR LLC, Fidelity's parent company. That gave her responsibility for all of the firm's financial services and diversified businesses, as well as its corporate functions, Ned Johnson said in his letter.In a different portion of the report, Abigail Johnson said Fidelity would continue adding products and services such as a better customer contact center.She also said Fidelity will look to engage more with women. ""Across the board, women are unhappy with our industry,"" the report quoted her saying. ""Our research shows many lack confidence in their ability to make financial decisions, particularly younger women.""Yet women often out-earn their spouses and make more decisions involving money, and Fidelity wants their business, she said.BETTER PERFORMANCE Among its mutual funds, Fidelity's report showed the progress it has made in trimming outflows by providing better performance, said John Bonnanzio, who edits the Fidelity Monitor & Insight newsletter for Fidelity investors. By his measures 81 percent of Fidelity's retail funds benchmarked against the S&P 500 beat the index last year, up from just 6 percent in 2011.The outflow reduction, ""suggests to me that smarter investors are finally taking notice that Fidelity is very good at what it does,"" Bonnanzio said. But dealing with indexing, ""remains their number-one challenge.""BlackRock last month reported operating income of $3.9 billion on revenue of $10.2 billion for all of 2013, both figures up 9 percent from 2012.In Wednesday's report, Abigail Johnson mentioned an ETF partnership that Fidelity struck with BlackRock. But she said, ""that's only one component of our strategy,"" noting other Fidelity forays into the area such as a fixed-income active ETF it plans.",2014-02-12,BLK,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 4:31pm EST",UPDATE 3-Fidelity profit jumps 13 pct in 2013 as outflows decline,http://www.reuters.com//article/fidelity-results-idUSL2N0LH15B20140212?type=companyNews

48,"  (Adds more details throughout about the SEC's money market fund plan)By Sarah N. LynchMarch 26 U.S. securities regulators are inching closer to completing new rules for money market funds, though no final decision on how to proceed has been made just yet, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Securities and Exchange Commission staff in charge of the rulewriting has been meeting with the agency's five commissioners, circulating some documents that highlight potential courses of actions and sounding them out to get their thoughts, the person said.The SEC is still actively eyeing a plan that would force prime institutional money market funds to abandon their stable $1 per-share net asset value and float their share price.In response to some complaints from the industry, the SEC is also exploring whether to make some changes from its initial proposal that could effectively expand the number of money market funds that would be exempt from a floating net asset value, the person added.The SEC has been exploring ways to reform the $2.6 trillion money market fund industry as a direct response to the financial crisis.In 2008, exposures to Lehman Brothers caused a large prime institutional fund known as the Reserve Primary Fund to have its net asset value dip below $1, an event known as ""breaking the buck.""Spooked investors rushed to get their money out, and the U.S. government ultimately stepped in to prop up the money market fund industry until the panic subsided. The SEC's proposal, first released last summer, is aimed at preventing similar runs.In addition to proposing a floating NAV for prime funds, the plan also contemplates an alternative which would permit fund boards to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates during times of stress.The SEC could potentially adopt one of the two options alone or in combination.The source added that the proposal for gates and fees are also still on the table as well. Earlier this week, the SEC released four new economic analyses on money market funds that it is using to help inform a final rule and asked the public to submit feedback on the studies.SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar said on Wednesday that he is advocating internally for the SEC to allow funds to choose which option they prefer.""My idea is, rather than us choosing for everybody, why don't we allow for both options to be offered and then investors can choose which one they want?"" Piwowar said on the sidelines of an SEC event.""I call it the investor choice model, or the belts or suspenders model,"" he added. It is unclear if his idea could gain traction. A majority of the five commissioners must agree before a rule can be adopted.RETAIL EXEMPTION EYED As part of the SEC's internal discussions, staff is discussing making changes that would broaden an exemption for retail money market funds from having to float their share price.Retail funds were always supposed to be exempted from the floating NAV plan because they are considered less at risk for runs. But many in the industry have said that how the SEC defined retail is problematic.In October, nine fund management companies including Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard and Wells Fargo  proposed an alternative definition of retail.Under the SEC's plan, a fund would be considered retail if it prohibits a shareholder from redeeming more than $1 million per business day.The nine companies have urged the SEC to instead define a retail fund as one that ""limits beneficial ownership interest to natural persons"" such as individuals who are investing in money funds through individual accounts or retirement accounts.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the SEC's internal deliberations concerning broadening the retail exemption.

52,"   By Nishant Kumar | HONG KONG  HONG KONG BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's biggest money manager, said improving economic indicators in Indonesia and consistent corporate earnings in the Philippines make those two countries prime hunting grounds for Southeast Asian stocks.Indonesia has slashed its current-account deficit and tamed inflation, strengthening its previously ailing currency. In the Philippines, companies have met forecasts more often than the rest of Asia during a period of successive sovereign credit rating upgrades.Immediate beneficiaries of economic growth include consumer, financial and infrastructure shares. These make up more than half of BlackRock's $244 million ASEAN Leaders Fund which features stocks such as Indonesian state-controlled lender Bank Mandiri Persero Tbk PT (BMRI.JK) and conglomerate Astra International Tbk PT (ASII.JK).Southeast Asian markets saw sharp volatility last year when investors pulled out in anticipation of tighter liquidity as the U.S. Federal Reserve winds down economic stimulus. Interest has since returned, with Indonesia's main stock index .JKSE rising 18 percent in dollar terms this year, the highest in Asia.""In an environment where we are sort of pulling back on liquidity with (Fed) tapering, there was an initial shock in these countries and currencies,"" said head of Asian equities Andrew Swan at the Reuters ASEAN Summit in Hong Kong.""But current account deficits are declining and trade surpluses are increasing. And that's been quite pleasing I think for many people to see that it's actually happened reasonably quickly, and that's why money is coming back."" BlackRock's Indonesian investments amounted to less than its benchmark index for most of last year.

53,"  March 27 The board of Formula One parent Delta Topco agreed this week to issue a $332 million dividend for last year, British broadcaster Sky News reported on its website, citing sources.Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, the largest shareholder in Formula One, will be the biggest recipient and take away nearly 80 million pounds ($132.90 million) of the payout, Sky said. (link.reuters.com/xeh97v)It added that the estate of Lehman Brothers would receive about $40 million of the dividend, while Formula One's billionaire Chief Executive Bernie Ecclestone would take about $17 million through his 5.3 percent stake.Other F1 shareholders include the fund managers BlackRock Inc and Waddell & Reed, Norway's Norges Bank and the municipal retirement fund of Texas's teachers. Sky, citing sources, said Delta Topco's board had discussed issuing a substantially higher dividend, but decided against incurring the additional debt such a move would take, hoping to revive a possible flotation.CVC put off plans to float Formula One in Singapore in the middle of last year because of market turmoil. It said in November that IPO plans remained stalled due to Ecclestone's bribery charges. The 83-year-old Briton, whose trial opens next month in Munich, Germany, is accused of bribing a former BayernLB bank executive in 2005 to steer Formula One's sale towards CVC, which wanted to keep Ecclestone on as chief executive. The dividend will be funded through a redemption of shareholder loan notes, Sky said.CVC could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours.($1 = 0.6019 British Pounds)   (Reporting by Richa Naidu in Bangalore; editing by Andrew Roche)",2014-03-27,BLK,"Thu Mar 27, 2014 | 5:31pm EDT",Formula One investors to share a $332 million dividend - Sky,http://www.reuters.com//article/motorracing-dividends-idUSL4N0MO4OL20140327?type=companyNews

In the Philippines, companies have met forecasts more often than the rest of Asia during a period of successive sovereign credit rating upgrades.Immediate beneficiaries of economic growth include consumer, financial and infrastructure shares. These make up more than half of BlackRock's $244 million ASEAN Leaders Fund which features stocks such as Indonesian state-controlled lender Bank Mandiri Persero Tbk PT and conglomerate Astra International Tbk PT. Southeast Asian markets saw sharp volatility last year when investors pulled out in anticipation of tighter liquidity as the U.S. Federal Reserve winds down economic stimulus. Interest has since returned, with Indonesia's main stock index rising 18 percent in dollar terms this year, the highest in Asia.""In an environment where we are sort of pulling back on liquidity with (Fed) tapering, there was an initial shock in these countries and currencies,"" said head of Asian equities Andrew Swan at the Reuters ASEAN Summit in Hong Kong.""But current account deficits are declining and trade surpluses are increasing. And that's been quite pleasing I think for many people to see that it's actually happened reasonably quickly, and that's why money is coming back.""BlackRock's Indonesian investments amounted to less than its benchmark index for most of last year. Last month, however, Swan raised the proportion of Indonesian securities in BlackRock's ASEAN fund to 20.2 percent, 1.5 percentage points higher than the MSCI South East Asia Index, according to the fund factsheet.

72,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc, the world's largest money manager, said on Thursday first-quarter profit rose 20 percent, boosted by strong performance fees and strength in its retail business as investors poured money into long-term funds.The New York-based asset manager, which now manages $4.4 trillion in assets, said it had positive net flows across equity, fixed-income, alternatives and multi-asset funds during the quarter.""Even with all of the turmoil in the markets that we saw a few weeks ago, every day during that turmoil, we had net inflows,"" Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview on Thursday, referring to the company's retail client base. Fink noted most of that turmoil was due to ""fast money"" exits, with hedge funds moving out of their positions rather than any broad-based selling among long-term investors.Revenue at BlackRock grew 9 percent to $2.67 billion, with revenue generated by performance fees paid by investors for outsized earnings in some funds surging 46.3 percent to $158 million from a year earlier.BlackRock's quarterly results exceeded Wall Street estimates, but analysts tempered that beat by noting that some of the upside came from non-operating drivers and larger-than-expected gains on investments.""It was certainly a fine quarter from an earnings standpoint, but these performance fees and expense items are certainly lumpy and some of them are one time in nature,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.Shares of BlackRock were down 0.7 percent at $307.95 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Of the $26.7 billion that investors poured into long-term funds during the quarter, roughly half came from retail investors who accounted for $14 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter. Retail fund assets at the end of March totaled $508.7 billion, representing 12 percent of total assets under management at the end of March.While institutional investors put money into lower-fee institutional index funds, they pulled money out of actively managed funds. Institutional investors had net outflows of $8 billion from actively managed equity funds and $7 billion from actively managed fixed-income during the quarter.That could be a concern going forward, according to Edward Jones' Shanahan. Most of the growth delivered during the quarter was in lower-fee institutional index portfolios rather than actively managed funds and other high-fee products, he said.FLOWS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES  BlackRock has remained largely insulated from the market volatility experienced in early 2014, because its broad menu of investment products, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds span various asset classes and world regions, analysts say.BlackRock's strong performance through the market volatility ""highlights the flexibility of their model and their ability to drive revenue from different sources of their business,"" said Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes.Investors poured $15.6 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income funds and $3.8 billion into equity funds. They added $5 billion to multi-asset portfolios, while adding $2.3 billion to alternative funds.With the bulk of long-term net inflows going into fixed-income during the quarter, Fink noted that much of the investor interest there has shifted toward ""unconstrained"" fixed-income products that are not targeted to any duration. A lot of those flows are driven by money moving into defined contribution plans and the de-risking of pension plans, he said.BlackRock's strength in fixed-income comes as rival bond-market money manager Pimco has been shedding assets.In a research report on Monday titled ""Investors Return to the Bond Market, Just Not to Pimco,"" Morningstar's Michael Rawson said Pimco Total Return Fund saw a net $3.1 billion outflow in March while intermediate-term bond funds had a $7.4 billion inflow for the same time period. Fink, when asked about Pimco, said he doesn't comment on competitors, but said BlackRock is in a ""great position"" with both institutional and retail clients. And analysts see the giant money manager playing a bigger role in fixed-income.""There's an ability (for BlackRock) to take share in fixed-income, given what we've seen on the competitive landscape with some of the bigger firms"" in the industry, Sykes said.INSTITUTIONAL ACTIVE LAGS BlackRock has been working to strengthen its U.S. active equity business, which has lagged in recent quarters.In all, institutional investors pulled $12.6 billion from active funds, with the bulk of those outflows coming from active equity and fixed-income. BlackRock has been working on bulking up its U.S. active equity business, but said ""it will take time to build long-term track records."" The company last month named JPMorgan Chase & Co's Christopher Jones as chief investment officer (CIO) for stocks in the Americas to head BlackRock's Fundamental Active Equity team in the Americas. Jones, formerly CIO for JPMorgan Asset Management's growth and small-cap U.S. equity team, will also be the global co-head of fundamental equity, alongside Nigel Bolton, head of BlackRock's European equity team.Analysts are looking for more growth in the company's actively managed and higher-fee products, rather than lower-fee index funds.""Flows are certainly volatile, but this concentration of flows in institutional index funds is in my mind a negative development and continues this pressure on weighted average fee rates,"" Edward Jones' Shanahan said.BUILDING BLACKROCK'S BENCH BlackRock earlier this month announced a reorganization of its senior management ranks as it works towards an eventual succession plan for Fink, 61. The company said it would be shifting at least 10 senior executives into new or expanded roles in June as it seeks to groom its next generation of potential successors to Fink.But Fink reiterated on Thursday that he has no plans to depart anytime soon.""I'm not going anywhere,"" he said. ""It was just a continuation of our building out our bench.""The idea of the reorganization is to allow senior managers to take on greater responsibility and gain a broader experience within different divisions of the company, he said.BlackRock reported net income of $756 million, or $4.40 per share, up from $632 million, or $3.62 per share, a year earlier.Excluding certain long-term compensation expenses and other one-time items, earnings were $4.43 a share.

76,"  MILAN Asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N) has cut its stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) less than a month after becoming the Italian bank's single biggest shareholder, raising questions over who will buy into the lender's imminent capital increase.A regulatory filing on Wednesday showed that U.S. group BlackRock (BLK.N) cut its stake in Italy's third-biggest bank to 3.23 percent from 5.75 pct on April 15, the day shares in Monte Paschi fell 10 percent on expectations that it would raise the size of its cash call.A statement from the bank that day said it was evaluating its capital needs after a media report said that it may increase the size of its rights issue from a planned 3 billion euros ($4.14 billion).Last Friday the bank's board approved an increase in the cash call to 5 billion euros as it strives to repay state aid and prepares for this year's stress tests on euro zone lenders. It expects to complete the rights issue by mid-July.BlackRock bought Monte dei Paschi shares on March 18 from a banking foundation that was then the lender's top investor. It became the bank's leading shareholder at the end of last month as the foundation cut its holding further to repay debt. The world's largest money manager has become a leading investor in several large Italian banks in recent weeks as cheap Italian banking stocks have attracted investors willing to bet on a tentative economic recovery and widespread reforms by new Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to boost growth.BlackRock's stake sale, however, raises questions over the stability of such investments as a number of Italian lenders prepare to raise about 10 billion euros in cash from investors. Banco Popolare (BAPO.MI) is close to successfully completing a 1.5 billion euro rights issue, while Banca Carige (CRGI.MI) must raise 800 million euros in the coming months and Banca Popolare di Milano (PMII.MI) 500 million euros.Fintech Advisory, a U.S.-based investment fund owned by Mexican businessman David Martinez, is now Monte Paschi's top shareholder with a 4.5 percent holding it bought from the banking foundation.

It expects to complete the rights issue by mid-July.BlackRock bought Monte dei Paschi shares on March 18 from a banking foundation that was then the lender's top investor. It became the bank's leading shareholder at the end of last month as the foundation cut its holding further to repay debt. The world's largest money manager has become a leading investor in several large Italian banks in recent weeks as cheap Italian banking stocks have attracted investors willing to bet on a tentative economic recovery and widespread reforms by new Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to boost growth.BlackRock's stake sale, however, raises questions over the stability of such investments as a number of Italian lenders prepare to raise about 10 billion euros in cash from investors.Banco Popolare is close to successfully completing a 1.5 billion euro rights issue, while Banca Carige  must raise 800 million euros in the coming months and Banca Popolare di Milano 500 million euros. Fintech Advisory, a U.S.-based investment fund owned by Mexican businessman David Martinez, is now Monte Paschi's top shareholder with a 4.5 percent holding it bought from the banking foundation.The not-for-profit foundation has sold about 30 percent of Monte Paschi since the start of the year, leaving it with only a 2.5 percent stake.Shares in Monte dei Paschi rose 3 percent by 1402 GMT after a rating upgrade to ""neutral"" by Goldman Sachs.

""Given regulatory and workflow pressures in the rates and derivatives markets, partnering with Tradeweb to aggregate liquidity and increase efficiencies in trading is a natural extension"" of the platform, the incoming head of BlackRock's Aladdin business, Sudhir Nair, said in a statement. In addition to gaining access to pricing and historical information, Aladdin clients will be able to ""click to trade"" from their dashboard, said BlackRock spokeswoman Lauren Post.

86,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 19 U.S. regulators' concerns about the market relying too heavily on the same risk models provided by a handful of financial firms will be ""debunked,"" a top executive at asset manager BlackRock said on Monday.There is no evidence to support concerns that the market may be overly dependent on the same models because there is a lot of competition, said Vice Chair Barbara Novick of BlackRock , which offers such models. Risk is not concentrated in just a handful of third party providers, added Novick, who spoke at a panel discussion.""There are many of them. The fact there are many of them tells you there is choice, and people can migrate from one to another,"" she said at a conference convened by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to explore whether asset managers and their activities could pose risks.""While it is worth looking at...I think in the long-term it will be debunked,"" Novick said at the conference held by the FSOC,  chaired by U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew tasked with policing the market for emerging threats. Last week, Reuters exclusively reported that FSOC staffers in March proposed the idea of creating score cards for third party risk modeling firms, amid concerns the market may be too dependent on the same products. [ID: nL1N0O001I]Such third party firms provide a range of services, including asset valuation, investment advice and risk measurements to pension funds, asset managers, insurance agencies and banks.BlackRock's unit, known as BlackRock Solutions, is one of the market leaders in the risk modeling business, and FSOC staffers highlighted the various services it provides to investors in a closed-door regulatory meeting on March 25 about third-party service providers. Documents reviewed by Reuters laid out the government's concern that financial firms may rely too heavily on the same outside risk models and valuations, and that any flaws could result in a wide misunderstanding of the true risk of firms' investments and other assets.Flawed risk models played a major role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Financial firms' internal modeling and assessments from credit rating agencies did not anticipate the systemic effect that a significant drop in housing prices could have on global markets. The issue grabbed the spotlight again in 2012 when JPMorgan Chase & Co's risk models failed to capture the dangers of its ""London Whale"" trades that led to a $6.2 billion loss.Using BlackRock Solutions as an example, the staffers created a draft scorecard for the company that focused on risk factors such as user reliance on its investment decision and valuation services, and the amount of assets and liabilities.A Treasury spokeswoman previously told Reuters that the  proposed scorecard approach is consistent with the council's mandate to look at issues across the financial system.She added that no decisions have been made on the approach, that it is not designed for any particular company or industry, and should not be read into.

87,"  (Adds context and details on ETFs)By Ashley LauNEW YORK May 19 BlackRock Inc, the largest U.S. provider of exchange-traded funds, has moved a step further toward launching a new breed of ETFs that would be allowed to keep holdings under wraps for months, instead of the daily disclosure now required.A filing late on Friday from BATS Global Markets, which seeks approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list and trade shares of some funds, is tied to a trust that BlackRock plans to use to launch these so-called ""non-transparent"" active ETFs.The funds in the BATS filing include 13 potential BlackRock iShares non-transparent active ETFs, mainly large and mid-cap equity funds. Such funds, if approved, would be allowed to report their holdings on a quarterly basis, putting them on par with traditional mutual funds.The BATS filing, known as a Form 19b-4, is required in order for such actively managed funds to be listed on an exchange. It follows an earlier proposal submitted in September 2011 by BlackRock asking the SEC to allow them to build such funds. For  BlackRock to be able to launch non-transparent active ETFs, both proposals would need to be approved. BlackRock and BATS declined to comment on the filing.ETFs hold a basket of securities, such as equities, commodities or bonds, and can be traded on exchanges like stocks. Most ""passive"" ETFs seek to mirror the holdings of rules-based indexes, while ""active"" ETFs have holdings that can be actively selected by managers. Currently, all ETFs, both active and passive, are required to disclose their holdings daily. This allows the funds' market makers to make trades that keep the fund's share price in line with the value of its underlying assets. But for actively managed funds, which often gain a reputation based on a manager's winning investment philosophy, daily transparency could allow others to ""front-run"" the active manager.Firms say non-transparent ETFs will allow them to use sophisticated investment strategies without having to reveal the fund manager's secret sauce.The BlackRock proposal, for example, includes a ""blind trust"" through which a market maker or authorized participant could execute orders, so that the manager would not have to  disclose the fund's holdings daily. The model is based on a concept created by Bedminster, New Jersey-based Precidian Investments, which also has a proposal in front of the SEC.""We're very encouraged by the recent filing,"" said Stuart Thomas, a principal at Precidian, noting that the increase in activity in the non-transparent active ETF space ""would seem to mean that people have a lot more confidence today"" about the funds eventually coming to market.Several other large asset managers, including State Street Corp and Eaton Vance Corp, have also asked the SEC to let them market such actively managed ETFs.So far, none of the proposals have won SEC approval.

91,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Companies such as BlackRock Inc and Standard & Poor's are taking a popular stock fund strategy and applying it to bonds.For more than a decade, asset managers have been creating stock funds that track indexes designed to outperform those based on their components' market value.

93,"  (Adds details, quotes)By John Geddie and Marius ZahariaLONDON May 23 BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said on Friday one of its main bond funds had cut its holdings of peripheral euro zone government debt to their lowest since the height of the crisis.Scott Thiel, the firm's head of European and global bonds,    said it was not only the magnitude of the rally in the bloc's lower-rated bonds that had prompted his Fixed Income Global Opportunities fund to book profits, but also his reluctance to bet on the European Central Bank starting to print money.""We do remain positive on the European periphery but are cautious in the current environment and our positions in the region are now at their lowest level in over two years,"" Thiel, who oversees assets worth around $100 billion for BlackRock,  told Reuters by email. He added he was ""not convinced"" the ECB would introduce a money-printing asset purchase programme in the euro zone.Expectations the ECB would take action to nurture the bloc's fragile recovery helped drive Italian, Spanish  and Irish 10-year bond yields to record lows of less than 3 percent last week. Portuguese yields  hit their lowest in over eight years. Yields hit peaks of more than 7 percent at the height of the crisis in 2011 and 2012, before ECB President Mario Draghi said he would do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro.The cut in the FIGO fund's peripheral exposure included trimming a ""long-standing"" position in Portuguese government bonds. Portugal had been one of the fund's ""highest conviction trades,"" Thiel said. BlackRock oversees about $4 trillion and its moves are closely watched by market participants.""It's one voice within the market but they obviously do move a lot of money,"" said Sandra Holdsworth, investment manager at Kames Capital, a group with $63 billion under management.""It is in agreement with a position I'd taken myself, in that the value was less compelling even if the story was still positive.

""They have a structural problem that could blow up the whole industry one day.""Fink spoke during a conversation with Deutsche Bank co-CEO Anshu Jain in a broader discussion about regulating financial companies. ProShares, a leading leveraged ETF firm, disagreed with Fink's remarks.""Leveraged ETFs are well regulated, transparent products and there is no credible evidence that they have any harmful effect on the markets or our industry,"" said Tucker Hewes, a spokesman for ProShares.

Some leveraged ETFs have become more aggressive, ramping up risk and potential returns, as the ETF industry gains popularity with individual and institutional investors.Leveraged ETFs have attracted $1.8 billion in net new assets during the first four months of 2014, Fuhr said.They are showing up more as buy-and-hold investments in the portfolios of retail investors, as financial advisers grow more comfortable recommending them, and first gained a foothold among traders who wanted an investment vehicle to make fast and enhanced bets on big index moves or the direction of gold prices, for example Last year, when the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 32 percent, the $348 million Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3x Shares ETF (SPXL.P) gained 118.9 percent, or nearly quadruple the S&P 500's gains.Last month, Direxion Funds launched two leveraged ETFs with three times exposure to the daily direction of gold prices. Direxion Daily Gold Bull 3X Shares ETF GLDL.P, for example, seeks 300 percent of the daily performance of the Comex Gold Futures benchmark. The industry's largest leveraged ETF is the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (TBT.P), which has about $4 billion in assets.

102,"   By Emily Stephenson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON BlackRock pushed back on Thursday against a U.S. report that raised concerns about asset managers and securities lending, arguing in a paper sent to regulators that its activities do not pose outsized risks.At issue are transactions in which entities lend stocks and bonds in exchange for cash or other collateral. Mutual funds often lend securities to hedge funds to generate extra income, for example. Some banks and asset managers such as BlackRock facilitate transactions for clients. They sometimes agree to compensate clients if a borrower fails to return a security that has become more valuable than the collateral held by the lender.The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a group of regulators that keeps tabs on emerging risks, said in a report this month that these indemnification agreements could be risky for asset managers, which do not face the same capital and liquidity requirements as banks.BlackRock's response, which was seen by Reuters, said its clients must hold more than enough collateral and that the firm has sufficient liquidity to meet indemnification needs. ""Borrower default indemnification is an established practice in securities lending, provided by the majority of lending agents to a variety of their clients,"" BlackRock said.Treasury Department spokeswoman Suzanne Elio declined to comment on the BlackRock paper. The Treasury Department houses the risk council. The risk council can tighten regulations on nonbank financial firms it views as especially risky, and asset managers want to avoid this.The council's annual report, published in May, did not name any firms. It listed securities lending indemnification among trends it said could be problematic, such as banks selling mortgage servicing rights to nonbank firms.Barbara Novick, a BlackRock vice chairman, said in an interview that the report did not discuss asset managers' efforts to ensure clients hold enough collateral. She also said the report overstated the risks because the agreements only kick in when a borrower defaults, and asset managers only pay the difference between the value of the security and the collateral.(Corrects in ninth paragraph to show report was published in May, not April) (Reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by David Gregorio)",2014-05-29,BLK,"Thu May 29, 2014 | 7:40pm EDT",BlackRock rejects U.S. concerns on securities lending agreements,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-financial-regulations-indemnification-idUSKBN0E92CI20140529?type=companyNews

104,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Jennifer Ablan  BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink this week dropped a stink bomb on a small corner of the $2.5 trillion global market for exchange-traded funds.Fink, who runs the world's largest asset manager and ETF provider, said structural problems with leveraged ETFs have the potential to ""blow up the whole industry one day."" Sponsors of leveraged ETFs and related products, which make up only about $60 billion of global industry assets, called his remarks an exaggeration.Leveraged ETFs use derivatives and debt in an attempt to enhance returns - often by two or three times - that an investor would receive from putting money in stocks, bonds or other financial instruments. The only problem: if the underlying securities or indexes drop, the losses can be fast and heavy.Fink, who was speaking at a Deutsche Bank conference in New York, drew parallels between the embedded leverage in some ETFs and two obscure Bear Stearns hedge funds that collapsed in 2007. That ignited an initial wave of panic over Wall Street's exposure to sketchy mortgages - a warning of much worse to come in the 2008 financial crisis. A systemic risk could emerge from packaging inherently hard-to-trade securities, such as leveraged bank loans, into ETFs. The value of the ETF could collapse if the market for the underlying assets freezes up. That could touch off a rout within the ETF industry if skittish investors decide that many other funds are too dangerous for them.  Fink’s pointed remarks on Wednesday also raised questions about whether too many risky financial products are entering the marketplace. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, a growing number of complicated and risky products are being aimed at Main Street investors. Hedge funds are making some of their strategies available to Mom and Pop investors willing to come up with as little as $1,000. Part of the pitch is that they need to look beyond plain vanilla investments if they want to have enough money to retire – the downside is that they could lose their shirts if markets take a sharp turn. FED WARNED Last month, top money managers aired their concerns during a meeting with New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley.  The group, including hedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa Management LP, worried aloud that investors may be stretching too far for returns in a low volatility, low interest rate environment, prompting ""some market participants to take on additional leverage to meet investment targets,"" according to recently released minutes from the April 10 meeting of the Fed’s Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. Fink on Wednesday suggested there's systemic risk lurking in leveraged ETFs, in comments that resonated with some other investors. ""I agree with the notion that the leveraged ETFs have the potential to possibly be very upsetting to the market. It is the leverage that concerns me."" said Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles. Fink said U.S. and European regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, don't pay enough attention to individual financial products hitting the market. The SEC in 2012 stopped giving new applicants permission to launch leveraged ETFs, because it was concerned about such funds. However, two fund sponsors – ProShares and Direxion – are still launching leveraged ETFs, using exemptive relief issued by the securities watchdog earlier. The SEC declined to comment on what Fink said. Fink, whose firm oversees $4.4 trillion in client assets, declined to comment for this story.BlackRock's iShares ETFs owned 39 percent of the global ETF market with $953 billion in assets at the end of April. State Street Corp was a distant No. 2 with $409 billion in assets, followed by No. 3 Vanguard Group's $368 billion.None of those three offer leveraged ETFs. Vanguard and State Street executives said they don't share Fink's view that the products pose a systemic risk.Dave Mazza, head of ETF research for State Street Global Advisors, said, ""This is an extreme example of buyer beware."" He said it is possible a leveraged ETF meltdown could disrupt industry-wide compound annual growth rates that have topped 25 percent in recent years. “These products work as advertised,” said Joel Dickson, Vanguard’s senior ETF strategist.  “Now, whether investors understand how they work is an education issue.”       Meanwhile, top leveraged ETF providers denounced Fink's comments. ""Direxion Investments completely reject his contention that leveraged ETFs pose a systemic risk,"" the company said in a statement. As of this week, the gross assets in 140 leveraged ETFs run by Direxion and rival ProShares totaled $22 billion.The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares fund is one of the hottest leveraged ETFs on the market, attracting $1.07 billion in net flows from investors over the past 12 months, according to Lipper Inc, a unit of Thomson Reuters.A three times leveraged ETF like Direxion's gold miners fund has $2 of leverage for every $1 of capital invested in the product. The ETF is rebalanced daily to maintain the same ratio of capital to exposure each day. This means, as Direxion explained, that leveraged ETFs respond to losses by reducing exposure.""It is hard to understand how Mr. Fink could conclude that a relatively small, highly liquid, completely transparent suite of products, which systematically reduce risk in response to losses, could generate systemic risk,"" Direxion said.But Fink said this week that an inherently illiquid asset doesn't become more liquid because it is wrapped inside a leveraged ETF fund. ""We will not do a bank loan ETF,"" Fink said at the Deutsche Bank conference. ""Why? We believe that the underlying asset is far less liquid than daily liquidity of an ETF. And you know as a banker, sometimes a bank loan market freezes.""

111,"   By Lauren Young | New York  New York The big retirement benefit consultants are facing increasing competition as financial advisers move in on their turf, according to Chip Castille, the head of BlackRock's  U.S. retirement group.For workers with 401(k) accounts the shift could translate into better investment choices, while for firms like Mercer and Aon Hewitt that have been big players in the $21 billion U.S. retirement business it's a threat to their business.In the workplace 401(k) market, Castille said he is seeing more financial advisers with a ""high level of expertise"" focusing on retirement plan design. These advisers tend to manage small business plans that are $1 billion-$2 billion in size. ""You did not see that two years ago,"" Castille said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit. ""It's shocking and extremely disruptive."" Scott David, head of U.S. investment services at T. Rowe Price, also speaking at the Reuters summit in New York, said that now ""some of the most sophisticated benefits consulting comes from advisers at the biggest brokerages.""Both BlackRock and T. Rowe have built up sizable businesses serving the retirement workplace, competing with firms such as Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group. A seismic shift is happening across the wealth management industry, as more financial advisers move from commission-based businesses to ones that rely more heavily on fees. As advisers wade into the retirement world, more of them are taking on the role of fiduciary - which requires advisers to put their clients' interests ahead of the financial firm that employs them. Some of the biggest challenges for the retirement industry include the desire to create products that deliver fixed income to retirees; the push for lower fees; consolidation and increased regulation, Castile and David said.The impact of the baby boomers on the financial markets - as well as the overall retirement industry - is an emerging trend that both are watching carefully.  The notion that boomers will cash out of stocks upon retirement and hurt the overall equity market is false, David said. ""If you are going to retire with a 30-year time horizon, why would you pull money out of the market?"" he said. Another myth: baby boomers will stop working upon retirement. ""Boomers have transformed every phase of life through which they’ve passed,"" noted Castille.A bigger concern for Castille is whether the 401(k) system will live up to its promise of securing retirement for boomers. ""I worry that the 401(k) system is going to come under pressure,"" Castille said. That's because it was built as the baby boomers moved through the workforce. ""It will receive more than its fair share of blame if boomers don't get the outcome they want.""(In last paragraph, corrects quote to read, ""It will receive more than its fair share of blame ...

113,"   By Ashley Lau and Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), already the leader in alternative funds aimed at retail investors, is planning to roll out a new fund that will take big bets on interest rates and currencies, a company executive said on Wednesday.The firm plans to launch a new Global Macro fund aimed at retail investors in the next couple of months, said Frank Porcelli, head of BlackRock's U.S. Wealth Advisory Business, at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in New York.""We've been working on it for a while,"" Porcelli said, noting that his team plans to engineer their fund differently from the competition. ""There are slightly different flavors out there, but I think this is a true Global Macro fund and will be a nice fit for advisers looking for uncorrelated returns and access to those markets.""The firm is targeting returns for the fund that will be cash plus 6 percent. Porcelli said BlackRock plans to leverage its existing relationships with alternative managers to construct their offerings and put them into a '40 Act mutual fund.BlackRock is rolling out the new offering at a time so-called global macro funds that take big directional bets have struggled, with some top fund managers bemoaning that there hasn't been a real trend to sink their teeth into. Global macro hedge funds have inched up only 0.31 percent in the first five months of the year, far less than the average hedge fund's 1.99 percent gain this year, HFR data show.With hedge funds delivering generally more lackluster returns over the last years, investors have begun complaining about their high fees and demanding these types of strategies at lower costs.This helped spark the quick-paced creation of so-called alternative mutual funds or liquid alts at some of the industry's most storied investment managers. It has also become an increasing point of focus for BlackRock, the world's largest money manager that now manages more than $4 trillion in assets.BlackRock executives on Tuesday told investors in New York that one of its top priorities is to ""own"" the retail alternatives space.""Alternatives is an area where we must succeed,"" said Andy Stewart, co-head of BlackRock Alternative Investors. ""The alternatives markets is already large. It continues to grow, and the landscape is evolving in our favor,"" noting that while historically alternatives products were used by a small subset of clients, they are now being used by mainstream investors. Alternatives currently represent about 30 percent of all asset management industry revenue, according to BlackRock, with an opportunity to grow by $23 billion through 2016.BlackRock launched its first retail alternatives funds in 2011: a long/short emerging markets fund, a commodities strategies fund and a long/short credit opportunities fund.According to Morningstar, the alternatives category has grown by 36 percent over the last year with funds taking in $927 million in April, which helped boost the year-to-date total to $11.6 billion.

116,"   By Jed Horowitz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc. BLK.N, the world's biggest money manager, has made a radical shift in the way it pays its retail mutual fund salespeople in the United States, a top executive said.Rather than pay a percentage of the gross sales made through scores of brokerage firms, independent financial advisers, banks and insurance firms, BlackRock is using a ""net"" number that better reflects the profitability of the sale, Frank Porcelli, head of the fund company's U.S. retail business, said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in New York this week.""I think we are ahead of almost every other firm in the industry in doing that,"" said Porcelli, whose troops sold $7.5 billion of BlackRock mutual and exchange-traded funds in this year's first quarter. ""I think the industry has to move in this direction.""The compensation switch, made at the start of this year but previously unreported, addresses a hotly discussed issue among fund company executives. For years they have complained that salespeople were getting paid for fleeting revenue because certain sectors of investors hold funds for only a short period, robbing the companies of long-term asset management fees.For example, advisers at brokerage firms tend to be high-volume traders of funds shortly after clients grant them discretion to manage their portfolios, according to industry statistics. The fund companies also say it has become more expensive to sell through individual brokers and advisers, but they feared being the first to change the pay formula and losing salespeople to competitors.""There has been a lot of talk about whether there was a better way to do it, but gross payout remains the standard,"" said Rick Ledbury, vice president of data services at the Money Management Institute, a trade group for fund companies. ""BlackRock is a huge player in the space. People are obviously going to take notice.""In a poll of members in late March and early April, 96 percent of respondents said they used gross sales as their primary compensation driver. Almost half of those, however, said they used some ""net"" profit element in the calculation. Porcelli said ""a substantial portion"" of BlackRock compensation now takes into account how long funds are held and other elements that contribute to the company's profitability.""To incent someone to get a dollar of business and have the buyer hold it for three weeks is not good business for anybody,"" he said. ""We want them to focus on people who are buy-and-hold investors, people who are using our products the right ways."" BlackRock pays its executives on net metrics, so putting salespeople under a similar formula is ""a good alignment of interest from my perspective,"" Porcelli said, adding that his sales teams have taken the change with relative calm.""We have a lot of credibility with them,"" he said. ""Our goal is to attract and train the best talent in the industry and pay them at those levels.""(For other news from the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit, click here)     (Reporting by Jed Horowitz; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-06-20,BLK,"Fri Jun 20, 2014 | 4:44pm EDT",BlackRock shifts pay formula for U.S. sales force,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-wealth-summit-blackrock-idUSKBN0ET2J220140620?type=companyNews
117,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON BlackRock Inc, one of the world's largest asset managers, disclosed on Friday that it may face civil charges by a U.S. securities regulator over disclosures tied to a former portfolio manager whose personal investments suggested a possible conflict of interest.In a regulatory filing, BlackRock said its BlackRock Advisors LLC unit received a ""Wells Notice"" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.A Wells notice is usually the last step in an SEC investigation before a civil enforcement action is filed, and gives a recipient one last chance to convince regulators not to file a lawsuit.BlackRock said it intends to cooperate with the SEC, and explain why no enforcement action is necessary. The investigation is tied to the personal investments of Daniel Rice, who left BlackRock in June 2012 over concerns about a potential conflict involving his family business and holdings in the firm's energy mutual funds.The potential conflict stemmed from a joint venture with Alpha Natural Resources and a subsidiary of a natural gas drilling company founded by Rice.  In Friday's filing, BlackRock said it had found no evidence of improper trading in Rice's portfolios and that no clients had been harmed. It said the June 17 Wells notice suggests the SEC has concerns with BlackRock's disclosures related to Rice, and with the company's policies and procedures.  BlackRock said any civil enforcement action would likely allege possible violations of anti-fraud laws and rules governing compliance programs.

118,"  (Adds background about the portfolio manager, details on SEC probe, comment from company)By Sarah N. LynchWASHINGTON, June 27 BlackRock Inc, one of the world's largest asset managers, disclosed on Friday that it may face civil charges by a U.S. securities regulator over disclosures tied to a former portfolio manager whose personal investments suggested a possible conflict of interest.In a regulatory filing, BlackRock said its BlackRock Advisors LLC unit received a ""Wells Notice"" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.A Wells notice is usually the last step in an SEC investigation before a civil enforcement action is filed, and gives a recipient one last chance to convince regulators not to file a lawsuit. BlackRock said it intends to cooperate with the SEC, and explain why no enforcement action is necessary.The investigation is tied to the personal investments of Daniel Rice, who left BlackRock in June 2012 over concerns about a potential conflict involving his family business and holdings in the firm's energy mutual funds. The potential conflict stemmed from a joint venture with Alpha Natural Resources and a subsidiary of a natural gas drilling company founded by Rice.In Friday's filing, BlackRock said it had found no evidence of improper trading in Rice's portfolios and that no clients had been harmed. It said the June 17 Wells notice suggests the SEC has concerns with BlackRock's disclosures related to Rice, and with the company's policies and procedures.BlackRock said any civil enforcement action would likely allege possible violations of anti-fraud laws and rules governing compliance programs.""BlackRock put in place a number of additional specific measures in order to manage any potential conflicts of interest given Mr. Rice's situation,"" spokesman Brian Beades said.""BlackRock has further enhanced its compliance policies and procedures as our business and industry evolve and in keeping with best practice.""

121,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Even as BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is set to amass $1 trillion in exchange-traded fund assets in its iShares business, U.S. retail investors increasingly prefer to send their money to low-cost leader Vanguard Group, highlighting a weak spot for the world's biggest money manager.With $998 billion in ETF money, BlackRock has more than the next contenders, Vanguard and State Street Corp (STT.N), combined. But the company has struggled to compete with Vanguard, known for its investor-friendly low-cost investing, for Mom and Pop's nest eggs. Retail investors now account for more than half of the $1.8 trillion in ETF assets under management in the U.S, according to consulting firm PwC.So far this year, Vanguard has pulled in about $30.3 billion in net new ETF money in the U.S., or about 43 percent of the market, while iShares is second with $24.7 billion, or about 35 percent. That reflects a trend that's been going on for years: at the end of 2009, BlackRock had 47.7 percent of total U.S. ETF assets under management, compared with 11.7 percent for Vanguard. By the end of May, BlackRock's share was down to 38.9 percent, compared with 20.6 percent for Vanguard, according to Lipper Inc, a unit of Thomson Reuters.""Our aspiration is to be number one in flows, and we can't get there without being higher in the retail market place,"" said Mark Wiedman, the BlackRock executive who heads the iShares business globally, speaking at the company's annual meeting in New York in June. ""We are starting to change our voice for that audience and I would say historically we frankly haven't done that good a job.""The market share loss comes in spite of BlackRock's two-year effort to win retail investors. BlackRock introduced a line of low-cost ""buy and hold"" investor-aimed ETFs in 2012, and since then has been cutting prices on its ETFs, revamping its sales team, and pushing a new branding campaign. The firm has cut prices on 12 funds since 2012, ranging from its S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF then to its high-dividend ETF in June 2014. BlackRock says its flows have improved since it started its new retail effort. One of the most significant price reductions was in its iShares High Dividend ETF. The cost to investors for that fund dropped to 0.12 percent a year from 0.4 percent, a move that would cost BlackRock $11.2 million annually, based on the $4 billion in the fund. Last quarter, iShares ETFs generated some $765 million in base fees revenue.""Every basis point that you cut a fee impacts revenues, but we don't really look at that – we look at the profitability of our ETF business over the long term,"" BlackRock executive Frank Porcelli, head of U.S. Wealth Advisory Business, said at Reuters' Global Wealth Management Summit in June.Asked about how fee cuts would affect BlackRock's profits, he said it was ""not relevant."" BIGGEST MANAGER With $4.4 trillion in total assets among its various product lines, BlackRock remains the world's largest asset manager and is unlikely to be eclipsed by Vanguard anytime soon.BlackRock has nearly tripled the size of the iShares business since it bought it from Barclay's five years ago, largely by selling to big institutions, such as the Arizona State Retirement System, which plunked down $300 million to seed three iShares funds last year. It has also won institutional and retail investors abroad; BlackRock has a strong presence in Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin America. Total BlackRock ETF assets outside of the U.S. are about $280.5 billion, about 36 percent of the $700 billion total market. Analysts say that iShares' size and scale makes the effect of fee cuts in the near-term fairly minimal on the overall business, but that a prolonged price war could hurt the firm.""It's a tough spot to be in,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan. ""There is some growth potential there, but it is slow to materialize and it has to be powerful enough to offset the addition of a lot of these products with fees less than the current weighted average fee rate.""Vanguard, which unlike BlackRock isn't publicly traded, offers significantly cheaper funds. The average expense ratio of a Vanguard ETF is 0.14 percent, or $14 for every $10,000 invested, compared with the industry average of 0.58 percent. BlackRock's average expense ratio is 0.32 percent.""When talking about large, commoditized ETFs, low cost makes a big difference, and Vanguard is a little bit more competitive,"" said Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes.""Investors recognize Vanguard as the low-cost leader – whether for index funds, for active funds, for bond funds, for money market funds, or for ETFs,"" said Vanguard spokesman David Hoffman. ""We like to say that we've been lowering the cost and complexity of investing for 38 years. We are also increasingly being recognized for our commitment to providing high-quality products that can play an enduring role in a portfolio."" MARKETING TO MOM AND POP The iShares team has been working on building its brand. An ""iShares by BlackRock"" advertisement now shares the same spot on the New York Times home page as a Vanguard ad that bears its trademark ship. The two alternate in the advertising space next to the markets section.""Brand is important, and we recognize that,"" BlackRock executive Raj Seshadri, head of U.S. Wealth Advisory iShares and former global chief marketing officer, said in an interview.To succeed better with retail investors, iShares will have to win over advisers such as Carl Amos Johnson, a fee-only adviser and owner of Grove Street Fiduciary in Peterborough, New Hampshire. He estimates that roughly 90 percent of the ETFs in his clients' portfolios are Vanguard funds.""They (Vanguard) have captured the low-cost retail index mind, and even the most naive investor knows that,"" Johnson said. ""To me the brand is not the key, but in the mind of a client, it is a big difference.""

133,"  * Once-toxic assets fetching high 70 dollar prices* Auction set for Tuesday with two large lots* Timing may be linked to repo-style loanBy Joy WiltermuthNEW YORK, July 18 (IFR) - BlackRock will launch another sale of once-toxic residential mortgage-backed bonds next week, seizing on a dramatic shift in demand for such assets and a rebound in prices since the crisis.The sale, for US$4.4bn, is tipped for Tuesday at 10am New York time, market sources said, and will have a different execution style to this week's auction.Tuesday's US$3.7bn all-or-nothing trade - the biggest of its kind since the crisis, which only considered bids for the entire list was won by Credit Suisse.BlackRock will split the sale of the next block into two distinct all-or-nothing groups.Scott Buchta, head of fixed-income strategy at Brean Capital, said BlackRock was taking advantage of a shortgage in new RMBS supply and pent-up demand from investors chasing yield.""Prices have recovered enough to make the sale more economical from the sellers point of view,"" Buchta said.""The first list went well enough that it encouraged BlackRock to bring the second. They'll strike while the iron is hot."" BACK IN FAVOR The legacy bonds are backed by UBS collateral that was hived off the Swiss bank's balance sheet after the mortgage crash.Such formerly toxic assets - the kind that brought down the likes of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers - are now regaining favor in the eyes of investors.TRACE data indicate Credit Suisse has already placed a majority of the bonds it bought in the first auction. And prices on such assets have rebounded dramatically.According to JP Morgan data, the average price of subprime ABS deals had sunk to between 15 and 20 cents on the dollar in April 2009. That figure is now 70 cents.Credit Suisse paid even more than that, as the bonds fetched a second-best bid 73.16 cents from Goldman Sachs, one of the sources said. Price talk had gone out around 67 cents.Next week's batch will likely attract a broader base of buyers than the first, as it includes floating-rate, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities, including Option-ARMs - adjustable-rate mortgage bonds - according to Adam Murphy, president of trade database company Empirasign Strategies.The first lot comprised of a mixed-bag of prime, subprime, home equity and Alt-A bonds, he said. Alt-A is shorthand for alternative mortgage bond paper considered riskier than A grade collateral that qualified as prime prior to the credit crisis.DUE LOAN? UBS was forced to write down more than CHF50bn in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage meltdown, according to an October 2010 report from the bank, hiving soured assets off its balance sheet into bad banks.One of the sources, a former executive at the Swiss bank involved in the overhaul, said the timing of the BlackRock auctions may also be related to the maturity of a senior loan that financed a sale of some of those assets to BlackRock.UBS also kept an equity stake in the soured securities portfolio, the source said.

160,"  LONDON, Sept 12 Global fund manager BlackRock  said on Friday it had written to investors in one of its money market funds to tell them it planned to trigger a clause aimed at protecting the value of the fund's assets.The move, called a Reverse Distribution Mechanism, will allow the firm to rebalance the net asset value of the fund so that it remains stable even though yields elsewhere may be negative. The clause will affect the ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund and does not imply the yield of the fund will turn negative following the implementation of RDM, BlackRock said.  Returns from money market funds in Europe have been hit by a weakening in trading conditions as the European Central Bank has cut its deposit rate to 0.2 percent, some economic data in the region has worsened and as geopolitical risk has increased.

161,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, has asked regulators to force exchanges to lower their access fees and require greater transparency of broker dealer-run trading venues known as ""dark pools."" The New York-based company outlined a set of proposals aimed at boosting public confidence in the equity markets in a letter on its website to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Sept. 12. It said that while the market is ""not broken or in need of large scale change,"" improving current rules would help promote fairness, order and efficiency.Questions about the safety and fairness of the mostly electronic markets have risen in recent years following a raft of high-profile trading glitches by numerous market participants, causing hundreds of millions of dollars of losses. Those concerns hit the mainstream in late March with author Michael Lewis' book ""Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,"" which claimed the markets were rigged in favor of high-speed traders.     BlackRock, which has $4.6 trillion in assets under management, said conflicts of interest in the markets could be reduced simply by lowering exchange fees charged to brokers that buy shares. Exchanges fees are currently capped at 30 cents per 100 shares taken from the exchange. Many exchanges also give rebates of a similar amount to brokers that sell shares on the exchange.  Reducing the fees to five or 10 cents per 100 shares, which would also lead to lower rebates, would prevent brokers from routing to particular venues based on how much they might get charged or make off of rebates, reinforcing best execution principles, BlackRock said. It added that more orders might end up going to public exchanges instead of private dark pools, which have lower fees and have benefited from cost-cutting brokers. Some people, such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher, have called for an end to the rebate system, but BlackRock said such incentives can have a positive impact by compensating brokers for adding liquidity to the markets. The asset manager also stopped short of calling for a rule that would force more trading on exchanges at the expense of dark pools and other venues that do not have to show pre-trade order information. Nearly 40 percent of stock trading  volume happens away from exchanges, raising concerns about price discovery.But BlackRock said these venues help keep costs low and allow institutional investors to covertly sell big blocks of stock without the market moving against them. It did, however, call for heightened disclosure by broker-dealers on how they route orders and on the quality of the order executions. Further, it said dark pool operators should be required to make the details of how their platforms work public. Other initiatives called for in the letter included a comprehensive review of how exchanges execute orders, and more investment in public data feeds to help them keep up with private feeds.

164,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Nineteen trading firms and one trader will pay $9 million to collectively settle civil charges alleging they participated in a stock offering after shorting the stock during a restricted period, U.S. regulators said Tuesday.The Securities and Exchange Commission said the settlements mark the latest actions in an effort to crack down on hedge funds and private equity funds that violate a securities rule designed to prevent potential manipulation.Among the charged firms settling the case are BlackRock’s BlackRock Institutional Trust Company and New York-based Advent Capital Management.A spokesman for BlackRock said Tuesday that the SEC's case stems from three ""inadvertent"" violations dating to 2010 and 2011. ""There was no allegation that BlackRock intentionally violated the rule,"" the spokesman said. ""Client accounts will not be affected and the company has further enhanced its compliance policies and procedures since 2011.""Advent Capital did not have an immediate comment on the SEC's case.The rule at the heart of the SEC's sweep is called Rule 105 of Regulation M. Rule 105 prohibits a trader from shorting stock prior to a public offering and then subsequently buying that same stock through the offering. The SEC does not need to show a firm or individual intentionally violated the rule in order to bring a case.Last year, the SEC brought similar cases against 23 firms and earlier this year it obtained a record sanction for a Rule 105 violation against a New York proprietary trading shop and its owner. The SEC's decision to focus on this area may reflect the ""broken windows"" enforcement philosophy that SEC Chair Mary Jo White announced last year.That idea, which comes from the approach that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani applied to his crackdown on crime in the city, calls for making sure small violations are addressed in an effort to deter more serious ones.

Brazilian IPOs still rely heavily on foreign investors as resident investors alone are not numerous or big enough to subscribe most of an offering. The last time a Brazilian company listed shares on the São Paulo Stock Exchange was December 2013, when travel agency CVC Brasil Operadora de Turismo SA (CVCB3.SA) raised 540 million reais from investors.

168,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Inc have seen their unconstrained bond funds double in size over the past 12 months as investors continue to search for yield in this low interest rate environment.Unlike traditional bond funds, where managers have to stick to a mandate, unconstrained bond fund managers can invest across the fixed income market. They are often called ""go anywhere"" bond funds.Historically investors have been wary of such funds because they were not sure where they fit in carefully designed portfolios, said Barry Fennell, an analyst with Lipper, a division of Thomson Reuters. However, with interest rates so low, investors have increasingly been willing to ""push the envelope,"" he said.It is no longer just retail investors moving into these funds to avoid interest rate risk, said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income. ""We are seeing pension funds and state funds grow significantly in this space to take advantage of this flexibility,"" Rieder told Reuters in an interview at BlackRock's offices on Wednesday.

According to Lipper the average fees for unconstrained bond funds is 1.29 percent, compared to 0.83 percent for core bond funds.Both BlackRock and Goldman may have benefited from a general outflow at Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), the Newport Beach, California, firm that has seen fallout from a leadership shakeup and mediocre returns.

171,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK, Sept 22  NEW YORK, Sept 22 Goldman Sachs Group Inc  has laid the groundwork to launch actively managed exchange-traded funds, becoming the latest Wall Street bank to set its sights on the fast-growing market.The company late on Friday sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to introduce what could be a series of active ETFs, according to the filing, which names an equity dividend ETF as its initial fund.Goldman separately filed late on Friday for regulatory approval to self-index, which would allow Goldman to launch funds based on their own proprietary indexes created in-house.""They're kind of covering all of their bases,"" giving the firm broad leeway to design and introduce a variety of ETF products, said Ben Johnson, a Chicago-based analyst with Morningstar.Goldman in July shifted a key executive to help grow its ETF product strategy, but otherwise has been largely quiet on its plans to expand into the ETF space. The company five years ago filed for permission to launch passive index-tracking ETFs, but never introduced any funds. Friday's filing was the first to mark its foray into the active ETF space. Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael confirmed the filings, but declined to comment on them more specifically. ""We are excited"" about the July decision to name 19-year industry veteran Michael Crinieri to lead the ETF effort, she said.The initial fund named in the filing, the Goldman Sachs Equity Dividend Fund will primarily invest in dividend-paying U.S.-listed equities, according to the filing. WALL STREET BANKS WADE IN The Goldman filings come as some of Wall Street's biggest banks have begun wading into the exchange-traded funds market. JPMorgan Chase & Co in June launched its first ETF and already plans to bring more funds to market, while Wells Fargo & Co received regulatory permission in August to offer ETFs.The move is seen by some as a defensive play by banks with their own wealth management clients. The banks can use their own ETFs to hold onto assets of customers showing some willingness to abandon traditional mutual funds and move into the $1.9 trillion U.S. ETF market, which has more than doubled in the past five years.""You're increasingly seeing that cannibalization is less of a concern than the outright loss of those assets,"" Johnson said, pointing to one of the concerns of mutual fund providers that has kept some from offering their strategies in ETF form.Unlike the biggest ETF providers - BlackRock Inc, State Street Corp and Vanguard, who together account for about 70 percent of the market - banks are putting more emphasis on their existing active investing capabilities.The asset management businesses of Goldman, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are already among the largest in the country, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.

174,"  (Corrects SEPT 7 story to delete reference to Poundland shares trading below issue price, in paragraph 14)* Firms line up for the next wave of IPOs* But investors weary of ploughing through lots of names* Concerns also mounting that prices to date too high* Bankers predict fund managers will demand better dealsBy Freya BerryLONDON, Sept 7 European stock market listings are kicking off again after a summer break, but many companies hoping to copy successful flotations earlier in the year now have to convince investors weary from a flood of new names and burned by high prices.Enthusiasm for initial public offerings (IPOs) has quadrupled the amount raised in Europe in the first nine months of this year compared to a year earlier to a total of $55.5 billion.But the sheer number of deals is starting to put fund managers off and prompt fears among bankers that some of their IPO clients will get lost in the noise, with investors simply not able to schedule time to listen to them all.Alastair Gunn at Jupiter Asset Management is already suffering from the deluge.""I'm starting to get a regular stream of stuff coming through the mail,"" Gunn, co-manager of Jupiter's distribution and high income funds, told Reuters.""When we invest in anything we want to do the legwork, meet the management, understand the business model. But the kind of sausage factory environment we've been in is not very conducive to doing your homework."" Craig Coben, co-head of Global Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at BoA Merrill Lynch sees the problem too.""With so many IPOs in the pipeline, there is a risk of market indigestion, with the weaker companies and more marginal names finding a less receptive hearing,"" said Coben.""One of the practical challenges will be to carve out the time in investors' diaries and ensure they can devote the necessary time to analyse and model all of these IPOs.""TOP DOLLAR  In particular, companies set up with private equity are keen to capitalise on current strong valuations to return money to their founders.Private equity-backed IPOs have accounted for one-fifth of the total so far this year, the highest proportion since at least 1994, according to Thomson Reuters data, with Carlyle's UK car services firm RAC, BC Partners' Italian retail chain Gruppo Coin's subsidiary OVS and Lone Star's German property business TLG among those being lined up to float in the coming months.But their emphasis on securing high prices at listing is starting to put off the new investors they need to woo.Some investors complain that advisers' strategy of targeting short-term U.S. hedge funds prepared to pay top dollar has in particular forced up the valuation of companies - especially those with a smaller international presence which underperform in the markets once shorter-term funds have moved on. Stocks such as Swedish cable operator Com Hem are now trading below their issue price, making fund managers worry about getting burned by similar patterns in future deals.""When so many deals start going to discount it's a signal to the investment bankers that they got it wrong. And I do think they have got it wrong,"" said Gunn.In an August email to bankers, investment firm BlackRock complained to bankers about newly-floated companies missing their first public results forecasts and the stock plummeting subsequently. The email named firms including online travel agency eDreams and Spanish testing business Applus .""The street should have been more prudent in its forecasts. Some investors have been saying, 'I wish you guys had priced these things a bit better for us,'"" said one equity capital markets banker who declined to be named because of the sensitivity around pricing.SQUEEZED RETURNS Paradoxically the same calm market conditions that are encouraging so many IPOs are also making them difficult to support as fund managers struggle to make returns.Low volatility may boost listing prices, but it also makes it hard for fund managers to justify buying into new companies when it's hard enough to make gains on tried-and-tested ones.Even short-term investors have struggled. Hedge funds betting on rises and falls in the equity capital markets have made returns of just 0.8 percent in 2014 so far, according to the Eurekahedge Europe Long Short Equities Index, against a rise of 6.4 percent in the FTSEurofirst 300 Index.With this in mind, advisers predict that investors will become more selective as they try to improve their returns in what's left of the year - and that they will be looking for more competitive pricing from stock market-bound companies.""A lot of the hedge funds have been working their butts off and they're sitting there with gains of less than 2 percent,"" the banker said.""I think investors are going to be very demanding, because they need to be.""

176,"   By Ross Kerber and Luciana Lopez  NEW YORK/BOSTON - Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc could be prime destinations for hundreds of billions of dollars in assets that may flee Pimco in the wake of the sudden exit of Bill Gross, the celebrated ""Bond King"" of U.S. mutual funds. His new company, Janus Capital Group Inc, may see Gross's cachet attract tens of billions of dollars, investors and analysts said.During the year ended Aug. 31, investors made $64.7 billion in net withdrawals from Pimco funds, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. Those outflows will likely accelerate with Gross's departure.""Lots of Pimco AUM (assets under management) will be up for grabs,"" analysts at Wells Fargo Securities said, noting that they reckoned the total sum Gross managed at Pimco ranged from $500 billion to $700 billion. If half of that amount turns over - typical when a high profile manager leaves a fund - Gross' departure could translate into a $300 billion market opportunity for rivals, Wells Fargo analyst Christopher Harris said Monday in a research note.BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, and Vanguard, the No. 1 U.S. mutual fund company, provide the performance and the size to attract cash flows from investors unnerved by the infighting at Pimco during the past several months and amid a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Smaller fund companies may also benefit from the fallout.Retail investors tend to shift money quicker than big pensions and other investment institutions, which deliberate more slowly about what to do. Janus, the Denver asset manager with a volatile history, could be in for a surprise if it is expecting Pimco money to flow automatically after the star fund manager.    ""Gross is a very capable investment manager. He's not God,"" said Carl Nelson, executive secretary and chief investment officer of the $1.1 billion San Luis Obispo County Pension Trust.      Instead, institutional investors such as Nelson, who can take months to make decisions, will want to see how Gross settles into his new role managing the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, which has about $13 million under management.To be sure, more than a dozen fund representative and consultants told Reuters that they have hesitations about leaving Pimco, which Gross co-founded more than 40 years ago. ""We hired Pimco as an organization, we didn't hire Bill Gross as an individual to manage our money,"" said Stephen Rauh, the chairman of the $4 billion Vermont Pension Investment Committee, which has Pimco on its ""watch list.""Pimco's Total Return Fund, which Gross ran personally for 27 years and has about $222 billion in assets, appears most vulnerable to poaching, said analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group. ""BLK (BlackRock) is likely the biggest beneficiary,"" analyst Doug Sipkin said. BRINGING IN A STAR  Meanwhile, few fund firms have had a harder time than Janus over the past decade as its stock funds fell out of favor. Janus has struggled for years to recapture the status it lost during the dot-com crash. Its assets peaked at more than $300 billion in 2000 and stood at $178 billion at the end of June.Janus CEO Dick Weil hopes Gross will attract money to a stable of bond funds that have just $31.4 billion in assets under management as of June 30. That's up from $9.2 billion four years ago. Janus now could double or triple those bond assets again as money follows Gross, said Dan Sondhelm, partner at SunStar Strategic, a financial services consulting company in Alexandria, Virginia.""No salesman could do that,"" Sondhelm said. Investor cash flows could start to gather steam by the first quarter of next year, he said. For Gross, the shift to Janus means giving up one of the industry's biggest paychecks, a reported $200 million a year, if for no other reason than the fund he will manage is a fraction of Total Return Fund's size. Gross has a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes. ""He didn't come for big money upfront, he came to build a fund"" and other products, said a person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Janus likely has put together a pay plan that would reward Gross for drawing assets into products he oversees, a key measure of success in the fund industry, said Todd Sirras, managing director at pay consulting firm Semler Brossy, which has worked with Janus in the past.Gross, 70, wasn't available to comment. A Janus spokesman said executives including Weil wouldn't comment.""Janus's move to hire Mr. Gross strikes us as precipitous, coming two days after last week's multiple news reports about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of alleged improper valuation and performance reporting in Pimco's $3.6 billion Total Return exchange-traded fund,"" Moody's said.""If the SEC determines that these allegations are true, it would not be clear what liabilities – both legal and reputational – might attach to Mr. Gross.""

""The market is very much taking for granted that quantitative easing through a government bond purchase programme is coming and I think there are many, many obstacles to that still to come,"" Scott Thiel, who oversees assets worth around $100 billion for BlackRock, told Reuters.""If people are buying Spanish and Italian bonds because they think the ECB is going to buy them from them, I think that is a mistake."" Many bank analysts predict a full-blown QE programme in the next six months, while some see it as early as November, as the ECB's efforts to ensure the recovery appear to be falling short.Economists polled by Reuters saw a 40 percent probability of the ECB purchasing sovereign bonds, up from 25 percent at the start of the month. Pimco, the world's biggest bond investor, remains overweight on Italian government debt, its European strategist said on Wednesday, quelling market fears that the departure of Chief Investment Officer Bill Gross could mark a change in direction.At the start of the year, Pimco, which manages $2 trillion (1.58 trillion euros) worth of assets globally, said its position in high-yielding government bonds of the euro zone periphery, such as Italy's and Spain's, was the largest ever.BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said in May that one of its main bond funds - which Thiel oversees - had cut its holdings of peripheral euro zone government debt to their lowest since the height of the crisis.

The sale, announced on Monday, will allow Link Net's biggest investors to cash in on a surge that has seen the network provider's stock price quadruple since a mid-May initial public offering as more and more Indonesian households go online. Link Net expects sales to grow 20 percent in 2014 as it adds up to 250,000 new homes.CVC, First Media and two other minority shareholders are offering 1.22 billion of shares in Link Net in an indicative range of 6,200-6,700 rupiah apiece, according to a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters.The deal received commitments worth $257 million from nine cornerstone investors including fund manager BlackRock Inc. , hedge fund firm Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC  and Goldman Sachs Investment Strategies, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter who couldn't be named because details of the deal aren't public. Malaysian investment firm CMY Capital and U.S. fund managers Neuberger Berman and William Blair & Co. were also among the cornerstone investors, the source added.At the upper end of the range, the sale would be worth 8.15 trillion rupiah ($668 million). The deal would be the biggest in Indonesia since CVC and other shareholders sold a $1.48 billion stake in PT Matahari Department Store Tbk in March 2013. Shares of Link Net were down 0.4 percent in early afternoon trading in Jakarta, giving the company a $1.8 billion market capitalisation. The benchmark Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index was down 0.6 percent.First Media said in a securities filing it will sell 334.69 million shares, equivalent to an 11 percent stake in Link Net.

189,"   By Jessica Toonkel  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest money manager, said on Wednesday that third-quarter earnings rose 26 percent, boosted by an improved performance of its fixed income funds.    Net income increased to $917 million, or $5.37 per share, from $730 million, or $4.21 per share, a year earlier.Excluding a tax benefit, earnings were $5.21 a share, beating the analysts' average estimate of $4.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.BlackRock ended the quarter with $4.5 trillion in assets under management, up 10 percent from a year earlier, while net inflows rose almost 4 percent to $28.7 billion. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters that BlackRock had been winning business throughout the year, particularly in its fixed income funds. ""We have raised $48 billion year to date in fixed income net flows,"" Fink said.Flows into those funds have accelerated over the past few weeks, Fink said, largely due to their improved performance rather than solely from clients leaving rival Pacific Investment Management Co after the Sept. 26 departure of its star manager, Bill Gross. Fink would not say how much money has flowed into BlackRock funds since the announcement that Gross was leaving Pimco for Janus Capital Group Inc (JNS.N).The firm sees an opportunity in the tens of billions of dollars in the fixed income space over the next several quarters, Fink told analysts on a call.BlackRock's taxable fixed income funds have outperformed their benchmarks over the past one-, three- and five-year periods.Their outperformance comes after BlackRock spent the past six years rebuilding its fixed income business, Fink said.  BlackRock's third-quarter inflows were almost evenly split between stock and bond funds, with $10.2 billion going into the equity side and $11.1 billion into fixed income. Multi-asset funds had $7.4 billion in inflows. About $18.2 billion, more than 60 percent of inflows, went into BlackRock's iShares exchange-traded fund business.  Institutional investors added $5.5 billion to BlackRock's funds, and the company's retail funds had $5 billion in inflows. BlackRock's alternative funds had $80 million in outflows in the third quarter. Fink said $7 billion had been committed to them but was not yet invested.  Analysts agree that BlackRock is well-positioned as clients move their money away from Pimco, which Keefe, Bruyette & Woods described in an Oct. 8 report as ""the Bill Gross effect."" Clients may move money to firms like BlackRock for actively managed fixed income funds, but they also may decide that passively managed funds are safer, according to the report.In the first few weeks of October, BlackRock had more than $7 billion of net new flows into fixed income iShares ETFs.BlackRock shares were down 1 percent at $303.78 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

196,"  (Adds comments from lawyer, details on proposals)By Ashley LauNEW YORK Oct 22 U.S. regulators said they plan to deny proposals for a new breed of actively managed exchange-traded funds that want to keep their holdings secret for months at a time.It would be the latest setback for a rule change that many in the industry see as a game changer for the ETF market.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Tuesday issued a notice on two of the proposals, from Precidian Investments and BlackRock Inc, noting for each that it ""preliminarily intends to deny the application."" The proposals seek permission to create actively managed ETFs that would not be required to disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Currently, all active ETFs are required to disclose their holdings on a daily basis. These funds often gain a reputation based on a manager's winning investment philosophy, and daily transparency could allow others to ""front-run"" the active manager. Firms say these so-called ""non-transparent"" ETFs will allow them to use sophisticated investment strategies without revealing the fund manager's moves.At the heart of the SEC's issue with the proposals is a concern over the ability of market makers to be able to effectively arbitrage the proposed non-transparent ETFs with the lack of disclosure provided. That could result in wide bid-ask spreads and cause the funds' intraday market prices to significantly deviate from their net asset values. Such a condition ""may be exacerbated during times of market stress,"" the SEC noted.""Absent a request for a hearing that is granted by the Commission, the Commission intends to issue an order under the Act denying the application,"" the notice said.The Precidian and BlackRock filings are two among a handful of proposals for non-transparent active ETFs currently before the SEC. But the potential denial of the proposals could be a setback for the others still awaiting a decision, said Jane Kanter, a former partner at Dechert LLP, who now runs compliance for New York-based ETF shop Ark Investment Management. ""I think it's going to have a dampening effect on the other proposals,"" she said.Other firms that are also seeking SEC permission include Eaton Vance Corp, State Street Corp, Invesco Ltd's PowerShares and most recently, Fidelity Investments.Still, it is a positive that the SEC did not flat out deny the proposals, but instead published its reasons for wanting to deny the order and give the applicants an opportunity to request a hearing, said John McGuire, a partner at Bingham McCutchen LLP and co-chair of the firm's global investment management practice group.""I think that people will be able to use this information to go back and tweak their own filings to try and address some of the issues,"" McGuire said.

197,"  (Adds analyst comment about SEC notice in 11th paragraph.)By Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK Oct 23 When it comes to expanding in the $1.9 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund market, which some forecasts say will pass the traditional mutual fund industry in size within 10 years, some companies have concluded it's better to buy than to build.ETFs are baskets of securities, like mutual funds, but trade on exchanges, like individual securities. They are cheaper than mutual funds and allow investors to trade throughout the day, with simultaneous pricing, unlike mutual funds, which price at the end of the day.They are also profitable: In the third quarter, BlackRock Inc, the biggest provider of the funds, made $850 million in fees from its iShares ETFs, 30 percent of the $2.8 billion in revenue it reported.Facing shrinking margins from their traditional businesses, asset managers are under pressure to offer ETFs. Last week, Janus Capital Group announced the acquisition of exchange-traded fund provider VelocityShares and Reuters exclusively reported last week that Goldman Sachs in talks to buy IndexIQ, another ETF firm [ID: nL2N0SB2NV]. Now, industry executives wonder who will be next.""If you are chief executive of a traditional asset management firm, you are asking yourself, 'What is my strategy for ETFs?'"" said Michael Spellacy, a partner at New York-based Broadhaven Capital Partners.Given how crowded the U.S. ETF market has become, it's easier to spend a few hundred million dollars to buy an existing firm that already has a management team, relationships with advisers who will sell the funds and regulatory approvals for existing funds than to try to come up with a new and unique product in hopes of gaining assets, executives said.The price Janus paid for VelocityShares hasn't been disclosed. Matt Hougan and Dave Nadig of ETF.com made the estimate that ETFs would surpass the $11.6 trillion U.S. mutual fund industry within 10 years.T. Rowe Price and Capital Research & Management are among a number of fund companies that do not yet have ETFs but have sought approval from regulators to launch so-called non-transparent actively-managed ETFs that don't require daily disclosures of holdings.On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a notice stating that it intends to deny two applications for non-transparent active ETFs but similar proposals for active nontransparent ETFs may still get approval in the next several months, according to some industry observers.That would put competitive pressure on fund companies like American Century Investments and Putnam Investments, which have not made any movement to get into the ETF space, to act quickly by acquiring small ETF funds that already have regulatory approvals to introduce active ETFs. And if the SEC prohibits firms from launching nontransparent active ETFs, it means that asset managers will have one less opportunity to get into this space. ""That in and of itself could lead to more firms buying ETF providers,"" said Matt Hougan, president of ETF.com.Just because firms like T. Rowe have applied for regulatory approval to launch active ETFs, doesn't mean they might not ultimately acquire a smaller ETF firm to come out with something faster, according to Nadig at ETF.com. Janus filed to launch active ETFs a few years ago and is still awaiting approval, he said.American Century and T. Rowe declined to comment. Putnam did not return calls. A Capital Research spokesman said the firm has no plans to acquire an ETF firm.STRATEGIC TOOLKIT One driver of future acquisitions is the growing popularity of actively managed ETFs, experts said. While actively managed ETFs only make up 0.1 percent of the U.S. ETF market, some predict that they will gain traction as investors get used to the idea and certain products have success.""The consensus wisdom today is that active ETFs are actually going to make money in the next three years and they are going to be a central part of the strategic toolkit for money managers,"" said Donald Putnam, managing partner at Grail Partners LLC, a private equity firm that sold its own actively managed ETF business to Ameriprise Financial in 2011.One target on many firms' wish list is New York-based WisdomTree Investments, the fifth largest ETF provider. It has a market cap of $1.4 billion and already has regulatory approval to do active ETFs.ProShares, the eighth largest ETF provider in the U.S. with $26 billion in assets under management, also could be an attractive acquisition because it not only offers active ETFs, but it has alternative investments ETFs, which have been popular with brokers and financial advisers as a way to protect clients from market volatility, experts said. Both VelocityShares and IndexIQ have alternative ETFs, noted Ben Johnson, an ETF analyst at Morningstar.A WisdomTree spokesman declined to comment on speculation and said the firm remains focused on growing its business. ProShares declined to comment. Experts and bankers expect smaller firms like Global X Funds and United States Commodity Funds to get bought in coming years as they have good niche products and both need distribution. New York-based Global X has 38 ETFs, including a number of portfolios that invest internationally. Its most successful product is its $1 billion Global X SuperDividend ETF.  Oakland, California-based U.S. Commodity Funds has a series of ETFs that invest in different commodities, including oil and natural gas.John Hyland, chief investment officer of U.S. Commodity Funds, said the firm was not for sale. Global X declined to comment.OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE INDUSTRY The growth in the ETF industry also means that there are opportunities for acquisitions in businesses beyond pure ETF providers. For example, many private equity firms are looking to acquire companies that manage portfolios of ETFs.Charles Schwab Corp put ETF model portfolios on the map for in 2010 when it acquired Windward Investment Management, now called Windhaven Investments.Chicago-based Good Harbor Financial, a model ETF portfolio provider that private equity firm FTV Capital bought in 2013, would be an attractive acquisition, bankers said. FTV declined to comment.Yet another acquisition strategy being considered as a way to benefit from the increasing amounts of money flowing into ETFs is buying the indexes themselves.The London Stock Exchange in June announced a $2.7 billion takeover of U.S. index compiler and asset management firm Frank Russell. McGraw Hill Financial Inc's S&P Dow Jones Indices and financial information services providers Markit Ltd are finalists in bidding to acquire Barclays Plc's index business.Niche index provider Alerian, which offers a number of indices including the Alerian Master Limited Partnership Index and has $21 billion tracking its indices, could be a potential target in coming months.Alerian is not actively running a sales process but would be open to a sale at the right price and on the right terms, said Kenny Feng, the firm's president and CEO.(Reporting By Jessica Toonkel.

202,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 24 U.S. regulators on Friday rejected a proposal from the NYSE Arca exchange to be able to list and trade actively managed exchange-traded funds that do not have to disclose their holdings on a daily basis.The move follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's announcement earlier this week that it intends to deny proposals from Precidian Investments and BlackRock Inc  to be allowed to create such ETFs.  Because the NYSE filing is linked to the Precidian funds, the rejection of the exchange's proposed rule change was largely expected.Regulators must grant both permission to the fund managers to create such funds, as well as approve the exchange's proposed rule change to list such funds, in order for the new breed of ETFs, often referred to as ""non-transparent"" ETFs, to be able to launch. While those decisions are made by separate divisions within the SEC, with the Division of Trading and Markets ruling on the exchange's filing, and the Division of Investment Management deciding whether to grant permission to fund managers, the two processes are often said to be in tandem.""After careful consideration, the Commission does not find that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,"" the SEC said in the 34-page order posted Friday. NYSE declined to comment on the SEC's decision.Both the NASDAQ Stock Market and BATS Global Markets exchanges also have proposals in front of the SEC to be able to list and trade non-transparent ETFs. Those filings, which are still awaiting a decision, are tied to funds from different firms that are also seeking permission to launch such ETFs. Speaking on a panel on Thursday about ETF trading at the Metropolitan Club in New York, NYSE executive Laura Morrison told the room that the push for non-transparent active ETFs lives on, despite the SEC's decision around the Precidian and BlackRock filings.""That doesn't mean that the initiative stops,"" said Morrison, head of global index and exchange-traded products at NYSE Euronext, while moderating the panel at the Capital Link Dissect ETFs Forum.""The Exchange strongly believes that, while we're disappointed, we're still going to fight the good fight for the innovation in the industry,"" she said.

203,"   By Jessica Toonkel  BlackRock (BLK.N) on Monday became the latest asset manager to lower fees on some of its bond funds in recent weeks. BlackRock's fee cut, which follows similar changes by Lord Abbett and OppenheimerFunds, comes after the high-profile departure of Bill Gross from Pacific Investment Management Co in late September and could help the firm capture some of the outflows that are pouring out of Pimco, analysts said.New York-based BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is lowering the fees on three of its bond funds, including its $4 billion Total Return Fund (MAHQX.O), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. “BlackRock regularly evaluates fund fees and expenses to ensure that they remain competitive as the marketplace evolves,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.The drops in fees by Lord Abbett and OppenheimerFunds earlier this month were also disclosed in regulatory filings.Gross resigned from Pimco on Sept. 26 to join rival Janus Capital Group (JNS.N), and investors pulled $25.5 billion from Pimco's U.S. open end funds in September, according to Morningstar data.Given how low bond yields are today, even small fee cuts can catch the attention of potential clients, said Dan Culloton, an analyst at Morningstar.  The fees on institutional shares of the BlackRock Total Return Fund will drop to 45 basis points, from 52 basis points, putting it in line with Pimco's Total Return fund, which charges 46 basis points for institutional shares. Fees for A-shares of the BlackRock Total Return Fund will drop to 79 basis points from 83 basis points.BlackRock also is lowering fees on institutional shares for the BlackRock Core Bond Fund (BCBAX.O) to 45 basis points, down from 56 basis points.B-shares of the BlackRock Low Duration Bond Fund (BFMSX.O) will now cost 154 basis points down from 162 basis points, according to the filing. Lord Abbett made a similar fee cut to its Lord Abbett Total Return Fund (LTRAX.O) on Oct. 14. Fees on A-shares of that fund are now 68 basis points, down from 85, while fees on institutional shares dropped to 48 basis points, from 65.On Oct. 20, OppenheimerFunds cut the fees of its Core Bond Fund, with fees on A-shares now 85 basis points, down from 91.Spokespeople for each firm said the changes were made as part of an ongoing evaluation of fees. Institutional shares of the BlackRock Total Return Fund have outperformed peers, including the Pimco Total Return Fund, for the past one, three and five years, ranking among the top decile of its category, according to Morningstar. Given how well the $4 billion BlackRock Total Return Fund has performed, it will likely win over many investors, including advisers, 401(k) plans and pension plans, considering moving away from Pimco, said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of research at Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company.

205,"  * Invests $627 mln in India's 3rd-biggest e-commerce firm* Snapdeal 'potential to be India's Alibaba' -Softbank's Son* Funds needed to tackle rivals in India online retail boom* SoftBank also leads investment in Olacabs taxi app   (Adds Snapdeal CEO comment in 10th and 11th paragraphs)By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Indulal PMMUMBAI, Oct 28 Japanese telecom and media group SoftBank Corp has set its sights on Indian e-commerce in its aggressive expansion drive, saying it will invest about $10 billion in the booming sector as it took a strategic stake in one of its rising stars.Masayoshi Son, chief executive of SoftBank, laid out a 10-year investment plan for India on Tuesday, starting with the purchase of a $627 million stake in fast-growing online marketplace Snapdeal. Son's global ambitions flared into public view last year when SoftBank bought No. 3 U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp for $21.6 billion.The Snapdeal purchase comes as international investors hunt deals in online retail in India, which has the world's third-largest Internet user base but where e-commerce is still relatively underdeveloped. For cash-rich SoftBank, owner of a third of newly listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, the move is the latest in a series of deals designed to counter sluggish growth at home.""I have a strong willingness to invest more like $10 billion in the next 10 years,"" Son said in an interview on Indian CNBC after his company announced plans to buy in Snapdeal, which connects small businesses with customers in an online marketplace. ""I strongly believe that Snapdeal has the potential to be like the Alibaba of India.""In a separate deal announced on Tuesday, SoftBank said it will lead a $210 million investment round with existing investors in ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which owns a mobile application for taxi bookings that competes with the likes of Uber. SoftBank didn't disclose how big a stake it will have in Snapdeal, which will use funds to expand operations to compete with bigger, free-spending rivals Flipkart.com and Amazon.com .The company did say it will become the biggest investor in Snapdeal, where sales of everything from clothes to computers have brought in around 25 million registered users and 50,000-plus merchants, attracting international shareholders like e-commerce operator eBay Inc and investment firm BlackRock Inc.One person with knowledge of the deal told Reuters SoftBank will own about 30 percent of New Delhi-based Snapdeal, buying new shares in the firm, valuing all of Snapdeal at around $2 billion. Snapdeal declined to comment on the terms of the deal.""SoftBank is a major investor in the internet space and them putting in a large sum of money validates the growth of Indian e-commerce,"" said Niren Shah, managing director at venture capital firm Norwest Venture Partners. FLIPKART, AMAZON PUSH Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal, said the two sides were quick to negotiate a deal, taking just three weeks. ""Most of the capital investment we're going to make is in technology,"" he said in an interview, signalling about $250 million will be spent next year.Bahl said the company plans to open a Bangalore innovation centre in two weeks, and Snapdeal was planning to hire about 500 engineers.Pressure had been growing on Snapdeal to raise funds to compete as online retail surges in India, with local industry leader Flipkart raising $1 billion in July, and global e-commerce giant Amazon.com pledging to invest a further $2 billion in its India unit.The SoftBank investment is in line with the $600 million-$650 million sources told Reuters Snapdeal had been seeking, and is the biggest investment by a single investor in the e-commerce sector in India. With this round of investment, Snapdeal, co-founded by Bahl and Rohit Bansal four years ago, has raised about $1 billion this calendar year.

Son's global ambitions flared into public view last year when SoftBank bought No. 3 U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp for $21.6 billion.The Snapdeal purchase comes as international investors hunt deals in online retail in India, which has the world's third-largest Internet user base but where e-commerce is still relatively underdeveloped. For cash-rich SoftBank, owner of a third of newly listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, the move is the latest in a series of deals designed to counter sluggish growth at home.""I have a strong willingness to invest more like $10 billion in the next 10 years,"" Son said in an interview on Indian CNBC after his company announced plans to buy in Snapdeal, which connects small businesses with customers in an online marketplace. ""I strongly believe that Snapdeal has the potential to be like the Alibaba of India."" In a separate deal announced on Tuesday, SoftBank said it will lead a $210 million investment round with existing investors in ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which owns a mobile application for taxi bookings that competes with the likes of Uber.SoftBank didn't disclose how big a stake it will have in Snapdeal, which will use funds to expand operations to compete with bigger, free-spending rivals Flipkart.com and Amazon.com .The company did say it will become the biggest investor in Snapdeal, where sales of everything from clothes to computers have brought in around 25 million registered users and 50,000-plus merchants, attracting international shareholders like e-commerce operator eBay Inc and investment firm BlackRock Inc.One person with knowledge of the deal told Reuters SoftBank will own about 30 percent of New Delhi-based Snapdeal, buying new shares in the firm, valuing all of Snapdeal at around $2 billion. Snapdeal declined to comment on the terms of the deal.""SoftBank is a major investor in the internet space and them putting in a large sum of money validates the growth of Indian e-commerce,"" said Niren Shah, managing director at venture capital firm Norwest Venture Partners. FLIPKART, AMAZON PUSH Pressure had been growing on Snapdeal to raise funds to compete as online retail surges in India, with local industry leader Flipkart raising $1 billion in July, and global e-commerce giant Amazon.com pledging to invest a further $2 billion in its India unit.The SoftBank investment is in line with the $600 million-$650 million sources told Reuters Snapdeal had been seeking, and is the biggest investment by a single investor in the e-commerce sector in India. With this round of investment, Snapdeal, founded by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal four years ago, has raised about $1 billion this calendar year. The company said it plans to use the money to ramp up technology and supply chain management systems, and add order fulfilment centres to 30 cities. The company currently has 40 fulfilment centres in 15 cities.Snapdeal will also look at making three or four bolt-on acquisitions in the coming few months specifically in the area of mobile technology and set up an incubation centre to work with start-up businesses in the mobile technology space, the company said.CEO Bahl, who has said he also wants Snapdeal.com to become ""the Alibaba of India"", told Reuters in September that the company was focusing on improving its technology platform so that it could connect more small-scale enterprises with buyers.

207,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 29 A group of funds that threw a monkey wrench in Bank of America Corp's proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities will object to JPMorgan Chase & Co's $4.5 billion offer to settle claims over similar investments, according to the lawyer that represents them.The funds, collateralized debt obligations known as the Triaxx entities, received court permission on Wednesday to intervene in a proceeding seeking judicial approval of the JPMorgan settlement, people close to the case said.JPMorgan last year reached the $4.5 billion agreement with some 20 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the bank took over during the financial crisis.The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market.The Triaxx entities hold certificates with an original balance of some $1.5 billion in 13 of the covered trusts, according to court papers.Their claims are ""potentially worth far more than the small percentage of the $4.5 billion settlement than they would receive,"" John Moon, an attorney for Triaxx, argued in the papers, filed in New York state court in Manhattan, seeking permission to intervene. Moon later told Reuters he planned to object to the deal.Triaxx is the second investor to raise questions about the accord. On Oct. 21, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which has holdings in 37 of the trusts in the proposed settlement, asked for a three-month extension of the Nov. 3 deadline to object.On Wednesday, Justice Marcy Friedman of New York state Supreme Court also allowed the bank to intervene, but did not change the deadline, people close to the case said. Friedman's chambers declined to comment. In August, trustees overseeing the securities accepted the bank's offer for the vast majority of the trusts.Some 20 investors agreed to the deal last year, including BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc, Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Company, and Bayerische Landesbank.Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group, did not immediately return a call for comment. In June 2011, Bank of America reached a similar deal with an investor group in which the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims involving securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in 2008.A New York judge largely approved the Bank of America deal in January, although she refused to accept a portion objected to by Triaxx, involving loan modifications.Triaxx has since dropped its opposition, as did American International Group Inc, which led objectors to the settlement in a three-year legal battle.An appeals court is still weighing the settlement on behalf of other objectors. Oral arguments were held last week.The case is In re: the application of U.S. Bank National Association, et al, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan), No. 652382/2014.

208,"  FRANKFURT Oct 29 German public-sector lender BayernLB has sold a 6.5 billion euro ($8.3 billion) portfolio of asset-backed securities (ABS), it said on Wednesday, drawing a line under a legacy of bad debts that brought it to the brink of failure in 2008.Germany's second-biggest landesbank is benefiting from a surge in ABS prices after the European Central Bank (ECB) said it plans to start buying these assets, or bundled loans, and from a broad rebound in real estate markets.The securities were sold to international investors, including Bank of America, sources familiar with the transaction said.They were the remainder of a 21 billion euro loan portfolio that turned sour in the financial crisis and forced the state of Bavaria to inject 10 billion euros in capital into the lender and provide it with 4.8 billion in guarantees. The bank had been working since 2009 to cut the size of the package of securities, whose value is linked to developments in the U.S. housing market and European commercial real estate.BayernLB also sued several lenders for selling it the securities, while secretly criticising them internally and ultimately profiting from their failure. It has reached settlements in several cases. The Munich-based lender has booked a loss of 1.2 billion euros on the ABS portfolio and has said it will need to draw on some of the state guarantees. However, it expects the fees it is required to pay the state government for the guarantees to ultimately outweigh losses borne by the state. Blackrock Solutions, part of Blackrock Inc, is advising BayernLB on the sale of the ABS portfolio, two sources familiar with the deal said.BayernLB Chief Executive Johannes-Joerg Riegler and Bavaria's Finance Minister Markus Soeder will host a press conference on the deal in Munich on Thursday.Bank of America declined to comment.

212,"  NEW YORK Nov 10 U.S. regulators rejected a proposal from BATS Global Markets that would allow it to list and trade actively managed exchange-traded funds that do not have to disclose their holdings on a daily basis.The action, posted late Friday, was largely expected after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's announcement last month that it intended to deny a proposal from BlackRock Inc  to create such ETFs, which are linked to the BATS exchange filing.To date, of the major exchanges seeking to list and trade so-called non-transparent active ETFs, only the NASDAQ Stock Market has gained approval. The SEC on Friday approved the NASDAQ's request after green lighting a proposal from investment management company  Eaton Vance Corp to be able to create such funds, which are linked to the Nasdaq filing. Those approvals were seen as big step forward for the industry to be able to develop actively managed ETFs that only have to disclose holdings once a quarter, much like mutual funds.Regulators must grant permission to fund managers to create such funds, as well as approve an exchange's proposed rule change to list such funds, for the new breed of ETFs to be able to launch and trade on exchanges. While those decisions are made by separate divisions within the SEC, with the Division of Trading and Markets ruling on the exchange's filing, and the Division of Investment Management deciding whether to grant permission to fund managers, the two processes are often said to occur in tandem if the fund filings and exchange filings are linked. A request from the NYSE Arca exchange to list non-transparent active ETFs was also rejected last month after the SEC said it planned to deny a proposal from Precidian Investments to create such ETFs, which are linked to the NYSE filing.The exchanges declined to comment on the SEC's decisions.

213,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rick Rieder, BlackRock Inc's chief investment officer for fixed income, predicted Monday that the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates in June.And as long as the Fed does raise rates at a slow pace, Rieder believes that U.S. equities will ""go significantly higher.""""I think the equity market will confound people for the next year or so,"" said Rieder, speaking at the 2014 Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. Particularly with the cost of financing so attractive, more cash will come into equities and that increases the upside potential, he said.        Rieder said he believes the Fed should increase rates sooner than June because a 1 percent fed funds rate would help normalize savings conditions and let people retire who are not retiring today.Rieder's big concern about the economy: high levels of student loan debt will curtail young Americans' ability to take out mortgages to buy homes.  The number of U.S. consumers with student loans has jumped 350 percent from 2003 to 2013, and at the same time that of 27-year-old to 30-year-old borrowers with mortgage debt and student loans has dropped from 31 percent to less than 22 percent, Rieder said.""Student loans are the most underestimated dilemma facing the country today,"" Rieder said. ""If you go to college, you can't get a mortgage.""Rieder oversees one of BlackRock's biggest bond funds, the $22.8 billion Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, which attracted record monthly inflows in October of $2.27 billion. The fund's inflows come as investors are moving money away from  bond manager Pacific Investment Management Company following the surprise departure of fund manager Bill Gross in September. Rieder said he is aware that unless performance is strong, investors will not stick around. The fund has ranked among the top 25 percent of its peers for the past one, three and five years, according to Morningstar.In October, Rieder said his group has increased its allocation to high-yield bonds, after cutting exposure to the asset class in July. ""If you can clip a 6 percent ... it's not a bad place to be,"" he said. Rieder also likes Treasuries, saying he believes fair value of the 10-year Treasury note would be closer to a 2.75 percent yield than the current yield of 2.34 percent.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits(For more summit stories, see) (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by James Dalgleish)",2014-11-17,BLK,"Mon Nov 17, 2014 | 3:21pm EST",BlackRock's Rieder predicts Fed raises rates in June,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-investment-yearend-rieder-idUSKCN0J127620141117?type=companyNews

218,"  (Refiles to correct typo in bullet point and paragraph 5)* Investors want transparency around investment decisions* Don't want money ploughed back into business to boost output* Post 2016, average miner debt will cost an extra $100/ounceBy Maytaal Angel and Silvia AntonioliLONDON, Dec 2 U.S. investment firm Blackrock  said gold miners looking to lure back fund flows need to cut production and give more money back to investors rather than ploughing it into the business in a bid to boost production. Early last month, gold prices fell to their lowest in more than 4 years at $1,131.85 a tonne - spurring struggling miners to take drastic measures like scrapping dividends, cutting jobs, halting projects and shutting mines.But according to Blackrock fund manager Evy Hambro, more needs to be done to restore investor confidence, and scrapping dividends is the wrong choice for debt burdened miners who need to raise cash from investors. ""Gold companies need to understand if people are going to give them capital they need to have transparency around investment decisions,"" Hambro said. ""They don't want capital ploughed back into the business chasing production growth rather than value creation.""""The primary thing (investors) want is ... when the gold price goes up, the company makes more money. They need to know with every ounce that's mined there's a margin attached to it,"" he told the annual Mines and Money conferenceGold equities are historically even more volatile than the metal. After outperforming the bullion price for most of this year, gold mining shares have given up all gains to sink much deeper than gold itself. According to some analysts, about three quarters of gold mining companies burn cash at spot prices just below $1,200 on an all-in cost basis.This is a huge problem especially for miners burdened by debt.""Over last decade (gold miners) have raised 150 billion in new capital. That debt is still on the balance sheet. They have to start repaying that debt ... post 2016 (when) it becomes equivalent to an extra $100 an ounce,"" said Blackrock portfolio manager Catherine Raw at the conference.If gold prices fall to average $1,100, companies with heavy debt may be forced to hedge revenue or raise distressed equity. They could see their credit lines withdrawn or reduced.

Foreign investors hold an up to 15 percent stake, Wu Tang-chieh, a deputy minister at the finance ministry, told Reuters, and their vote is likely to be key in determining who will ultimately control the bank.

The finance ministry, the second largest shareholder, wants to regain control of the lender, whose profits have been steadily rising, and has been pressing Taishin to cut its stake or reduce its seats to a minority on Chang Hwa's board. .Taishin's president has warned recently it could face a paper loss of more than T$10 billion in 2014 if it cedes control of Chang Hwa to the government in the voting.

232,"   By Jessica Toonkel  When BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, results are likely to show that a three-year effort to win the hearts and dollars of financial advisers and their retail clients has started to pay off, thanks to record inflows to the firm's bond funds.Since BlackRock first took aim at mom and pop investors in 2011, it has launched a branding campaign and a reorganization of its sales force. Since then, the firm has gotten 500 of its actively managed investment strategies on brokerage platforms, including on the recommended lists of Wells Fargo Advisors, Raymond James, UBS UBSG.VS and other firms. The fund family is a top seller at Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and UBS, according to BlackRock. After adding $37.7 billion through the first three quarters of last year, BlackRock's retail actively managed business stood at $525.5 billion at the end of September. That is a small slice of BlackRock's $4.5 trillion in assets under management, but it is a key bottom-line contributor, because the funds bought by retail investors carry higher fees than those sold to institutional clients. Though they make up just 12 percent of assets, they account for 35 percent of fees.For every $10,000, an investor in a BlackRock retail fund pays around $64 a year, compared with $34 for an exchange traded fund and $10 for institutional clients, according to the firm. ""From a revenue perspective in regard to the fees compared to the institutional business, it is extremely important,"" said Robert Fairbairn, global head of BlackRock's retail and iShares business. ""We believe that we can grow it at a clip that is faster than the industry."" BOND GROWTH, EQUITY OUTFLOWS BlackRock has its bond offerings - along with the abrupt September resignation of Bill Gross from Pacific Investment Management Co - to thank for the growth in 2014 of its retail funds.  Seventy-two percent of the record $18.9 billion inflows into BlackRock's mutual funds went straight into its top-performing, unconstrained bond fund, the $26.2 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX.O), according to Morningstar. The firm's bond funds had record inflows of $22.4 billion in 2014.""The concern is that this is hot money looking for a home outside of Pimco and it might not stick,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. Fairbairn said the Pimco exodus was ""a bit of a dividend for us,"" but said BlackRock bond funds have been outperforming and attracting assets for years before that. Eighty-five percent of BlackRock's stock funds have underperformed their benchmarks over the last five years. In 2014 they posted record net outflows of $5 billion, according to Morningstar. On Tuesday, UBS Wealth Management told its advisers that it had dropped BlackRock's Equity Dividend Fund MRVDX.O from its mutual fund select list due to concerns about the fund's underperformance, increasing size and potential style drift, according to a memo obtained by Reuters. ""I have never looked at their equity funds - I basically didn't even know they had them,"" said Jacob Wolkowitz, director of investment research with Accredited Investors, a Minnesota- based adviser with $1.5 billion in assets under management, who moved money to BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities from the Pimco Total Return Fund last year. Since 2012, BlackRock has replaced five of its nine U.S. equity teams. The firm's push to turn around its U.S. equity performance ""is still early in the process,"" Fairbairn said. NEW SALES APPROACH  In 2013, BlackRock reorganized its 150-person wholesale  force to enable salespeople accustomed to selling iShares ETFs to also sell mutual funds, and that has accounted for at least some of the success with retail investors, said Frank Porcelli, head of the U.S. wealth advisory business at BlackRock.Financial advisers agree. BlackRock's wholesalers are more like ""portfolio liaisons,"" rather than pure sales people, said Daniel Roe, chief investment officer of Budros, Ruhlin, Roe, a Columbus, Ohio-based registered investment adviser with $2.1 billion, which started using BlackRock's Strategic Income Opportunities Fund two years ago. ""They have a high level of knowledge about positioning and strategy,"" he said. ""That's not always the case with other fund companies."" In 2012, BlackRock also launched its first-ever branding campaign targeting retail investors, with ads appearing in publications such as The New York Times, The Economist and The Wall Street Journal as well as online.But the firm has a long way to go in gaining brand awareness when competing with the likes of Fidelity Investments and The Vanguard Group, which have been targeting individual investors for years, Porcelli said.""We are not nearly there in terms of name recognition,"" Porcelli said. ""But we used to be the firm that only financial advisers or the executives at big private banks knew.""

BlackRock's wholesalers are more like ""portfolio liaisons,"" rather than pure sales people, said Daniel Roe, chief investment officer of Budros, Ruhlin, Roe, a Columbus, Ohio-based registered investment adviser with $2.1 billion, which started using BlackRock's Strategic Income Opportunities Fund two years ago.""They have a high level of knowledge about positioning and strategy,"" he said. ""That's not always the case with other fund companies.""In 2012, BlackRock also launched its first-ever branding campaign targeting retail investors, with ads appearing in publications such as The New York Times, The Economist and The Wall Street Journal as well as online.But the firm has a long way to go in gaining brand awareness when competing with the likes of Fidelity Investments and The Vanguard Group, which have been targeting individual investors for years, Porcelli said.""We are not nearly there in terms of name recognition,"" Porcelli said. ""But we used to be the firm that only financial advisers or the executives at big private banks knew.""

237,"   By Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 23 U.S. investors stung by the falling euro who want to stay invested in Europe are turning to exchange-traded funds designed to strip out the impact of the region's currency.The biggest among so-called ""currency hedged"" ETFs, the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity ETF, has already added some $576 million in new money since last Friday, and nearly $1 billion since the start of the year, ETF.com data show.""Currencies have become a huge part of global equity returns,"" said Art Laffer Jr., a Nashville investment manager who uses a currency hedged ETF for his exposure to Germany. A currency hedged ETF strips out the foreign currency return of a given fund by investing in foreign currency forward contracts and rolling them, typically on a monthly basis. This can have a major impact on returns for U.S. investors in a region like Europe, where the euro has dropped dramatically.The WisdomTree hedged Europe ETF, for example, is up some 8.7 percent year-to-date, compared to some of the biggest unhedged Europe ETFs, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF and the iShares Europe ETF, which are both up about 1.1 percent this year. On Friday, the euro dropped to an 11-year low against the dollar, after the European Central Bank announced on Thursday it would inject a trillion euros into the euro zone to revive a sluggish economy. It has fallen nearly 7 percent against the dollar so far in January, on track for its worst monthly performance in more than three years. Among other currency hedged funds that are outperforming their unhedged counterparts, the Currency Hedged MSCI EMU ETF  is up 7.6 percent year-to-date, far more than the 1.1 percent for the unhedged iShares MSCI EMU ETF. The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Germany ETF is up about 8.7 percent year-to-date, outperforming the 2 percent gain for the unhedged iShares MSCI Germany ETF.Major U.S. ETF providers like BlackRock Inc, WisdomTree Investments and Deutsche Bank AG  have all been rolling out new currency hedged funds over the past year to take advantage of the money that has been flowing into the ETFs.WisdomTree's HEDJ, for example, was one of the biggest ETF asset gatherers last year, adding $5 billion in new money and growing its assets nine-fold over the year.

238,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 30 U.S. regulators will review a $3 billion discount claimed by Dish Network Corp and partners including investment management company BlackRock Inc  during a U.S. government wireless spectrum auction that ended this week.In a relatively common process for Federal Communications Commission auctions, Dish and partners invested in separate companies with little to no revenue that can receive a 25 percent discount in auction bidding.The FCC will now scrutinize the details of legal and financial ties of those separate companies to Dish and other corporations, aiming to make sure the airwaves will be used to compete against Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc  and others instead of turning the winnings over to incumbents.""From a Dish perspective, they just created $3.3 billion worth of value,"" said Jonathan Chaplin at New Street Research. ""Now we will see if they get away with it or not.""The companies spent $13.3 billion at the auction but provisionally received a $3.3 billion discount, results showed on Friday. The government gives the discounts with the goal of helping new entrants to the industry better compete with incumbents. The FCC has been leery of handing discounts to potential speculators or unknown entities unlawfully fronted by large corporations.That does not mean that large companies cannot support small entities, but the key is what the winning bidder does with the acquired spectrum, that it improves competition in the industry, said S. Jenell Trigg, telecom lawyer at Lerman Senter PLLC.""The objective to buying spectrum at auction is to provide service to the public,"" she said. Speculation about Dish's sights for its amassing spectrum has ranged from potentially building a wireless network of its own to selling the licenses to Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless company.Dish did not elaborate on its thinking, citing FCC's anti-collusion rules.Analysts suggested that Dish's partner bidding surpassing that of Verizon lowered the chances of an immediate sale to the biggest wireless carrier. Such a sale within the first year would invalidate the discount, experts said. FCC disclosures previously showed Dish and its chairman, Charlie Ergen, had indirect ownership in the partner entities that received the discount, Northstar Wireless LLC and SNR Wireless LicenseCo LLC.Investment management company BlackRock had membership shares in SNR. Northstar's disclosures also showed direct and indirect ownership interest by Doyon Ltd, an Alaska Native corporation with numerous affiliates in various fields including oil and gas land drilling.Financial firm Catalyst Investors has an indirect ownership interest in Northstar, disclosures show.The FCC is also weighing whether to alter the bidding credits eligibility and other rules for its auction of highly coveted low-frequency airwaves planned for 2016.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2015-01-31,BLK,"Fri Jan 30, 2015 | 8:59pm EST",Dish's $3 bln wireless auction discount up for U.S. regulator review,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-spectrum-dish-network-idUSL1N0V928B20150131?type=companyNews

246,"   By Jessica Toonkel  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is planning an array of new investment products that will allow clients to invest in addressing large societal issues, such as global hunger or poverty, an executive at the New York-based firm said.BlackRock was set to announce on Monday a new initiative, called BlackRock Impact, to bring together its existing offerings that help clients invest in products with  environmental and societal goals, as well as introduce new products, Rich Kushel, chief product officer and head of strategic product management group, told Reuters.  BlackRock has tapped Deborah Winshel, the former president and chief operating officer of The Robin Hood Foundation, to oversee the initiative.Winshel, who begins her new role March 2 and will report to Kushel and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, will work with BlackRock's portfolio managers globally to develop portfolios and tools to meet client demand and societal issues. Impact investing is not a new concept to Wall Street. A number of firms, like Goldman Sachs (GS.N), and Bank of America's (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch unit are involved with social impact bonds that address a specific need, like reducing recidivism at a state prison, while bringing returns for investors. BlackRock is looking at ways to make impact investing more scalable to address a range of issues. ""What if you wanted to drive outcomes like poverty elimination or hunger elimination or the development of medicines?"" Kushel said. He declined to elaborate on the products, but said he expects them to be launched ""in the very near future.""BlackRock, with $4.65 trillion in assets under management, already has an array of funds and tools for clients looking to invest in a socially responsible way. For example, the world's largest asset manager manages more than $220 billion in values based mandates, which use screens to exclude securities based on clients' values. Additionally, the firm has a suite of  environmental, social and corporate governance-related products. In December, the firm launched the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Exchange-traded Fund (CRBN.P).Winshel will also lead BlackRock's global philanthropic program.

""Companies are buying back stock and raising dividends and there aren't enough IPOs coming to market to replace that stock.""BlackRock has seen a number of large pension plans across the globe move significant portions of bonds into equities, Kapito said. In his remarks, Kapito was equally bullish on the growth of the exchange-traded fund market, predicting it will hit $6 trillion in assets in the next five years, up from $2.8 trillion at present.Individual investors, registered investment advisers and institutional investors are increasingly using ETFs to gain core exposure at a low cost, he said. But BlackRock also is seeing clients use ETFs in new ways. For example, Kapito said a growing number of investors are using ETFs instead of futures because they are cheaper.One area where Kapito was not bullish was the topic of how much investors are saving for retirement. ""The Baby Boomers, Generation X and the older generation are not saving at all,"" he said.Two-thirds of BlackRock's assets under management are in retirement accounts of some kind, Kapito said.BlackRock next week is launching an advertising campaign, called ""I Retire,"" around the importance of retirement.

""And it's all about liquidity.""The same buyside investors burned by the sell-off in oil are now sifting through which companies they believe will outlast the slump in crude prices. And companies prepared to pay a premium are finding willing buyers.""We do not see oil prices getting back to US$100 in the long-term, so for us the big question is about whether the capital returns work,"" Joe Lind, a portfolio manager at DDJ Capital Management, told IFR.""Are the costs of the company low enough that they can still operate in a world with lower revenues?""US crude prices have recovered from lows of US$43.5 just a couple of weeks back, inching back up to US$53. That has helped drive a 100bp rally in energy bond spreads in the past three weeks. But at 728bp over US government bonds, they still offer an extra 250bp spread to the broader high-yield sector, according to BAML. The new CrownRock bond, for example, came with a coupon of 7.75% and yield of 8% - nearly 200bp better than the current 6.2% yield-to-worst on the Barclays High Yield Index.PICKING THE RIGHT SPOTS In another example, GSO this week joined up with Magnetar Capital to provide US$300m of secured commitments to Texas-based driller Jones Energy to help repay borrowings under its revolver.The debt component, a US$250m eight-year bond, pays a hefty coupon of 9.25% - some 250bp higher than the 6.75% interest payment on a US$500m eight-year bond sold by the company in April 2014. The 2022 bonds have sunk to 91.75% of face value following the rout in energy names.The swoop back into junk-rated energy bonds is expected to be a saving grace for a sector that is facing dwindling access to funds from traditional bank lenders. The twice-yearly reset of revolvers and other loan agreements is always a fraught time for exploration and production companies, but this year will be trickier than most.There are roughly US$250bn of revolvers outstanding for US E&P names, and some analysts expect that to be cut by at least US$25bn to US$37.5bn, or some 10% to 15%.""It might be a bit premature yet, but the reset of revolvers in the spring will likely be a catalyst,"" said Jonathan Insull, a portfolio manager at Crescent Capital.""There will definitely be opportunities.""A head of US credit trading desk, meanwhile, said early signs were that banks were not being very aggressive just yet.""We've not seen many revolvers cut significantly, and in some cases they have even been increased,"" said the trader. ""The opportunities that funds are looking for are more likely to come in the fall, provided oil prices do not bounce back. Oil companies will have cut production more dramatically by then.""The US high-yield bond market remains virtually closed to all but the highest-quality borrowers - which leaves out the lion's share of riskier E&P names.Most refinancings thus are likely to be in the guise of second-lien loans, and investors intend to demand on strict covenants which offer them better protections.INSIDE TRACK Joint ventures may also be on the horizon.GSO will fund the entire costs associated with drilling new wells for Linn Energy in return for 85% of their cashflows, until it reaches a 15% internal rate of return.""We provided dollars that sit outside of the capital structure,"" said GSO's Scott.""It's good for the company as it doesn't increase their leverage, and good for us as we don't have to worry about the credit risk.""Other players are now looking at copycat trades.""It was a great deal,"" said the trader.""It gives GSO a great return on a first lien basis, and also provides them with a link to Linn down the road if they need further financing. A lot of people are looking to replicate that deal.""

BlackRock said on Tuesday that it would now charge 7 pence a year per 100 pounds invested in its ETF that pays out dividend income, down from 40 pence previously, to make it the cheapest such tracker on the market. Both Vanguard and Deutsche Bank charge 9 pence, it said.""It really doesn't leave much more room to fall, but I don't think the price war has ended,"" said Adam Laird, head of ETFs at fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown. ""In the U.S., you can get mainstream ETFs with fees as low as 0.03 percent.""However, he said he expected rival providers to wait and see if clients switched their money before responding. The iShares FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (Dist) fund was the first ETF to launch on the London Stock Exchange in 2000 and currently holds 3.8 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) of assets under management.BlackRock, which has more than $1 trillion of assets under management globally, said it would also cut to the same level the cost of its FTSE 100 ETF which reinvests dividend income.ETFs are equity instruments that allow an investor to trade a range of assets, from a basket of stocks to government debt.

""We believe ETFs have an important role to play post the Retail Distribution Review and want to confirm our commitment to our clients in this market,"" said Fergus Slinger, head of UK sales at iShares.By introducing the review in 2012, the British regulator removed an incentive for the country's many independent financial advisors to funnel retail investor cash to commission-paying active funds rather than the cheaper ETFs.Demand for ETFs has grown since, also fuelled by the government's decision last year to increase the amount of money investors can save tax-free, and could get another fillip when new pension investment freedoms go live in April.""In big markets like the UK FTSE 100, prices have fallen dramatically,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown's Laird.""Where I think we're likely to see the next round of moves, though, is in some of the niche markets, such as emerging markets, where fees tend to be higher, at around 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent.""

262,"  * Regulator says not yet decided if intervention needed* Industry warns about impact of EU rules on liquidity   (Adds industry letter to regulators)By Huw JonesLONDON, March 10 Britain's financial regulator said on Tuesday that a low liquidity in corporate bond markets, which could create volatility in times of stress, needed careful monitoring.But trying to improve liquidity by relaxing strict new capital requirements imposed on banks since the financial crisis  was not an option, the regulator said.Investors have poured money into corporate bonds since the crisis to boost returns but this has prompted concerns that some markets do not have enough liquidity to cope with a rush for the exits when interest rates start to rise.Commentators have warned this could result in fire-sale prices and extreme volatility in markets.The liquidity issue has also arisen at a time when the European Union is looking to build a ""capital markets union"" to plug gaps in corporate funding left by banks that have reined in lending. Edwin Schooling-Latter, head of market infrastructure at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told a FIX Trading conference that the state of the secondary corporate bond market, where bonds are traded after they have been sold to investors, was on the regulatory agenda.""There is enough evidence that low liquidity relative to previous years does warrant careful regulatory monitoring of market developments and careful consideration of what could be done to improve levels of liquidity,"" he said.""We don't see a single silver bullet.""Morgan Stanley has said that the average number of dealers per trade in the bond market has dropped to 3.2 in January this year from nearly 9 in 2009. This reflects the new capital requirements banks have to meet which banks say has made bond trading more costly.Schooling-Latter said that before regulators themselves intervened they must ask if there is a market failure. ""We would certainly be interested in views from market participants if that is the case.""""The focus of policy makers' attention is not on reversing new prudential requirements,"" Schooling-Latter said. Enhancing price transparency was one option under consideration as a way to make investors more willing to trade, he said.Other ideas included improving trading platforms, more retail participation, greater standardisation of bond issuance and making the allocation of initial issuance more transparent, Schooling-Latter said.Bond issuers also have a key role to play such as encouraging platform trading in their bonds at the outset to reach a wider range of investors, he added.He said it was timely to review primary market regulation such as easing EU rules on prospectuses for issuers, a step Brussels is already looking at to boost market-based financing.Separately, industry bodies like the French and Dutch asset management associations, Britain's The Investment Association, as well as investment groups such as BlackRock and Aviva, have proposed changes to planned EU bond market transparency rules known as MiFID II.They said it was ""highly challenging"" to apply the MiFID II rules to less widely traded bonds without crimping market efficiency.""To deliver sustainable economic growth in the EU, the starting point for MiFID II ... needs to be the interests of Europe's saving and investing citizens and companies,"" they said  in a letter, seen by Reuters, to the EU securities watchdog ESMA.

264,"   By Claire Milhench | LONDON  LONDON Interest in oil and other energy-related exchange traded products (ETPs) continued for a fifth consecutive month in February with almost $2 billion of inflows, according to the latest global data from BlackRock, pushing assets under management (AUM) to over $13 billion.This was almost as much as the $13.8 billion of assets under management in broad-basket commodity ETPs, but BlackRock's Ursula Marchioni, head of ETP research at iShares EMEA, said it fell short of a record.""At year-end 2009 global energy ETPs had a total AUM of $14 billion as the underlying energy prices were higher at that time,"" she said. Energy was the best performing sector in the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity index in February, with Brent oil up 14.9 percent.Marchioni said that if this price trend continued in the coming months, energy ETPs could reach historical highs in total assets under management.Investors piled into oil ETPs after Brent sold off in 2014, in the hope of taking advantage of an eventual rebound in prices. ""For Brent, there's a lot of reliance on OPEC pulling back production at some point,"" Nitesh Shah, associate director at ETF Securities, said.But there has also been an increase in flows into the company's short WTI crude ETPs in the last week, Shah added, suggesting some investors are taking a contrarian view. ""That's largely related to the inventory builds at Cushing – investors see an opportunity to take a tactical short,"" he said.U.S. crude stocks at the key delivery point of Cushing, Oklahoma, hit fresh record highs in February as shale oil production continued unabated.

265,"   By Claire Milhench | LONDON  LONDON Interest in oil and other energy-related exchange traded products (ETPs) continued for a fifth consecutive month in February with almost $2 billion of inflows, according to the latest global data from BlackRock, pushing assets under management (AUM) to over $13 billion.This was almost as much as the $13.8 billion of assets under management in broad-basket commodity ETPs, but BlackRock's Ursula Marchioni, head of ETP research at iShares EMEA, said it fell short of a record.""At year-end 2009 global energy ETPs had a total AUM of $14 billion as the underlying energy prices were higher at that time,"" she said. Energy was the best performing sector in the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity index in February, with Brent oil up 14.9 percent.Marchioni said that if this price trend continued in the coming months, energy ETPs could reach historical highs in total assets under management. Investors piled into oil ETPs after Brent sold off in 2014, in the hope of taking advantage of an eventual rebound in prices. ""For Brent, there's a lot of reliance on OPEC pulling back production at some point,"" Nitesh Shah, associate director at ETF Securities, said.But there has also been an increase in flows into the company's short WTI crude ETPs in the last week, Shah added, suggesting some investors are taking a contrarian view. ""That's largely related to the inventory builds at Cushing – investors see an opportunity to take a tactical short,"" he said.U.S. crude stocks at the key delivery point of Cushing, Oklahoma, hit fresh record highs in February as shale oil production continued unabated.  Broad-basket commodity ETPs attracted some $329 million in net inflows in February, a reversal from January's $300 million of net outflows, which Marchioni said had been driven by one U.S.-listed product.""As long as the crude price stabilizes in the next few months we expect to see some renewed interest in broad-market commodity ETPs given the significant weight energy has within these broad market indices,"" she said.

266,"  (Corrects date)By John GeddieLONDON, March 12 European-listed junk bond exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded their biggest monthly inflows in February, data from BlackRock showed, while cash was pulled out of German government and money market ETPs.Fixed income ETPs represent a fraction of the 105 trillion dollar global bond market, but the data, which covers only funds listed in Europe, provides evidence of an investor hunt for yield against a backdrop of ultra-loose monetary policy and record low interest rates.ETPs encompass any portfolio of securities that trade intra-day on an exchange, and include exchange traded funds (ETFs), exchange traded notes (ETNs), exchange traded commodities (ETCs) and exchange traded instruments (ETIs). Junk bond ETPs gained 1.3 billion euros in February, adding nearly 20 percent to their total assets under management. It was the biggest jump since BlackRock began tracking the ETP industry in 2008.Other higher-yielding funds also saw strong inflows. Emerging market ETPs gained 800 million euros, the most in nine months, while 1.3 billion euros came into investment grade corporate funds.Ahead of the European Central Bank's sovereign bond-buying programme which started this month, there were modest inflows of 477 million euros into ETPs covering euro zone government debt. But on a country-by-country basis, money came out of top-rated German funds and flowed into the indebted Italy and Spain.Approximately 207 million euros came out of German government ETPs in February, while 122 million euros went into Italy and 95 million euros into Spain. All German bonds out to seven years maturity now yield below zero, meaning investors are effectively paying to lend to governments. Italian five-year government bonds yield around 0.4 percent.Money market ETPs, which have seen significant annual outflows in recent years, lost another 306 million euros.While ETPs are well established in equity markets, they are relatively in fixed income new product and make up only around 0.4 percent of global outstanding bonds.At the end of February, BlackRock tracked 5,462 exchange-traded products globally.

270,"  (Adds context on BlackRock, Pemex statement)MEXICO CITY, March 26 Asset manager BlackRock Inc and U.S. private equity firm First Reserve have taken a joint stake worth around $900 million in the second phase of Mexico pipeline project Los Ramones, state-controlled oil company Pemex said on Twitter on Thursday.In a separate statement, Pemex said the joint stake was equivalent to 45 percent of the costs involved in the construction of the project. It represents BlackRock's first ever infrastructure investment in Mexico, Pemex added. ""The company has the intention of establishing a greater presence in Mexico,"" Pemex said in the statement. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, was looking to invest in infrastructure projects in Mexico. The move also comes as Mexico's government, which has seen the peso fall to record lows off the back of an oil price slump that has dented the appeal of its energy sector opening, sets about courting private investment.Pemex said in September it would spend $2.5 billion on the second phase of the Los Ramones pipeline, which will eventually run from the U.S.-Mexico border to central Mexico to help satisfy growing demand for gas by boosting cheap imports from the United States.

274,"  (Adds comments from chief executive, background)By Claudia CristoferiMILAN, March 27 Italian broadcast tower operator EI Towers, controlled by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset group, won backing from shareholders on Friday for its bid to acquire state-owned rival Rai Way.It still faces government opposition, however.Chief Executive Guido Barbieri appeared to soften the group's earlier demand for a share of at least two thirds in Rai Way, controlled by the government through state broadcaster Rai, saying 51 percent would be a ""logical"" limit and even leaving the door open to a lower stake.""We would certainly not accept 49 percent without guarantees on governance,"" he said after a shareholders meeting to approve a cash call to fund the 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) bid. As well as Mediaset, EI Towers shareholders include major investment funds like Amber Capital, BlackRock, Octavia Advisors and Threadneedle Asset Management.EI Towers announced a 1.2 billion euro ($1.30 billion) bid for Rai Way last month but ran into the government's insistence that at least 51 percent of Rai Way would have to remain in public ownership.The bid is being closely watched in Rome for its possible impact on relations between Berlusconi and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who is pushing to complete wide-ranging reform of electoral laws that will require broad support in parliament. However the government has shown no sign of relaxing its requirement that a majority of Rai Way remains in public hands and Industry Minister Federica Guidi said it would not change ownership rules to allow a bid.Bourse regulator Consob has also asked for further clarification on the bid from the company. Barbieri denied that Mediaset, which owns 40 percent of EI Towers, had anything to do with the proposed acquisition and he said he had never been in touch with Berlusconi over the deal.But it remains highly sensitive politically at a time when Renzi is trying to hammer out a far-reaching reform of the electoral law that he will struggle to pass without the cooperation of Berlusconi's centre-right Forza Italia party.He said the group, which has so far not been in direct touch with either Rai Way or Rai, would take the initiative to open communications.""We'll do it soon, we'll assess whether we do it with both,"" he said.One of the original conditions for the bid to go through is that EI Towers wins at least 66.67 percent of the capital of Rai Way but Barbieri's comments on Friday appeared to indicate the group was softening its demands.

A former top executive at Fidelity Investments, O'Hanley replaces SSgA CEO Scott Powers, 56, who will help with the transition after overseeing several years of robust growth in the division. At SSgA, most of its assets, about $1.5 trillion, are invested in equity-related products such as the $185 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY.P). O'Hanley said last week in a telephone interview that he will look at expanding SSgA's base of fixed income assets, which total about $320 billion.""Clearly I need to spend time on this,"" O'Hanley said. Collaborating with well-known active fund managers is one place to build on. O'Hanley cited State Street's recent collaboration with Jeff Gundlach, the star bond fund manager at DoubleLine. In late February, State Street and Gundlach launched the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF (TOTL.P), which Morningstar said could pose a challenge to the $2.6 billion PIMCO Total Return ETF (BOND.P).""The relationship with DoubleLine is pretty attractive,"" O'Hanley said. ""Clearly it something we have to look at more."" But as fund research firm Morningstar Inc pointed out recently in a report, ""Vanguard is doing great. PIMCO is really struggling. Everybody else is doing all right.""Net deposits in Vanguard Group's passively run funds such as index funds and ETFs totaled $225.3 billion for the 12 months that ended Feb. 28, according to Morningstar. Net deposits for BlackRock (BLK.N) were $97 billion and SSgA had $30 billion, Morningstar said.O'Hanley is well aware of Vanguard, a fund flows juggernaut that for years has sapped the strength of Fidelity, where he worked from 2010 to 2014. Before Fidelity, O'Hanley ran the investment management division of Bank of New York Mellon. But Fidelity had no ETF business to speak of when he arrived on the scene. State Street, along with Vanguard and BlackRock, are the ETF industry's three dominant players. ""What's attractive for State Street is that it has the building blocks for investors who more and more desire a customized investment solution,"" O'Hanley said.

""It is critical ... to understand that corporate leaders' duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies' shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long term owners,"" Fink wrote in the letter, dated March 31.

The companies targeted included Apple Inc, General Motors Co, DuPont and Qualcomm Inc. Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co, which has $8.2 billion in assets under management, disagrees with Fink and believes most activists now are more long-term than the corporate raiders of the 1980s. ""I think the majority of activist investors today are really investors and are not going into this to slash and burn,"" Smith told Reuters in an interview Tuesday afternoon. For example, Smith applauded Nelson Peltz' Trian Fund Management LP for taking a long-term approach with its campaign against the management of chemicals and agricultural company DuPont. Trian is pushing the company's board to be more accountable and argues it should be split in two. The fund is pushing for four seats on DuPont’s board.""I think Trian represents a positive influence,"" he said.Smith also disagrees with Fink that dividends are a sign  companies are thinking short-term.

285,"  (Adds quotes, background)By Alice GledhillLONDON, April 14 (IFR) - BlackRock is planning to sell a debut bond issue in the single currency which will test investor appetite for this type of credit and so-called reverse Yankee issuance.The world's largest money manager has mandated Barclays, Citigroup and JP Morgan to arrange a two-day European roadshow from April 20. A benchmark deal is expected to follow. Issuance from US credits in euros was one of the dominant trends of the first quarter with over 27bn raised by investment-grade companies.However, the pace has slowed dramatically in recent weeks  and BlackRock will provide a test of how much investor appetite there currently is for this type of supply. ""It's an interesting mandate,"" said one debt banker. ""They probably need euros directly - this would make sense, as they have activities across the globe.""But he warned that it could divide opinion among investors, despite the strength of the brand name. ""Some people won't buy it because they won't want to fund a competitor, and would rather hold equity instead.""Blackrock is a more familiar presence in the US funding market. It has over USD4.6bn of bonds outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.It is rated A1/AA- by Moody's/S&P, both ratings with a stable outlook.

The SEC said that Rice, who departed BlackRock in 2012, was involved in managing energy funds for his employer at the same time he founded Rice Energy, a family-owned oil and natural gas company.The SEC said Rice personally invested $50 million in Rice Energy, which later formed a joint venture with a publicly-traded coal company that rose to become the largest holding in the $1.7 billion BlackRock Energy and Resources portfolio. The regulator said BlackRock knew and approved of Rice's activities, but failed to disclose the conflict to the boards of the BlackRock funds and to clients.Julie Riewe, the co-head of the SEC's asset management enforcement unit, said Monday this case marks the first time the SEC has charged a firm over failing to report a ""material compliance matter"" to a fund board.""BlackRock and Battista caused the funds' failure to report Rice's violations of BlackRock's private investment policy and denied the funds' boards critical compliance information,"" she added.Earlier this year, Riewe gave a speech saying her unit has unearthed numerous examples of hidden conflicts at asset managers and is planning to file a series of cases.",2015-04-20,BLK,"Mon Apr 20, 2015 | 2:33pm EDT",BlackRock to pay $12 mln in SEC conflict of interest case,http://www.reuters.com//article/blackrock-sec-blackrock-idUSL1N0XH1OC20150420?type=companyNews

Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years.BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, was Eaton's fourth-largest shareholder as of Dec. 31, according to Thomson Reuters data.""He is articulating what we hear from many investors,"" Cutler said in an interview after the diversified U.S. manufacturer of electrical and power products reported first-quarter results. ""They invest in these companies for the long term, not simply for the next three months.""He added that Fink represented a ""healthy voice."" Eaton expects by midyear to convey to shareholders his company's highly anticipated plans for using its cash, now that it has digested and paid down debt tied to a $11.8 billion acquisition of Cooper Industries.After continuing to increase Eaton's dividend ""we’re still going to have a lot of available cash in years going forward, and we want to provide investors with some insight,"" Cutler said. This included the extent it might spend on share buybacks or acquisitions. Eaton lowered its 2015 profit forecast on Wednesday, but the projected range still included analysts' average estimate for the year. Its shares closed up 1.4 percent.Eaton's results came as the U.S. Commerce Department reported that first-quarter economic growth expanded at only a 0.2 percent annual rate, a big step down from the fourth quarter's 2.2 percent pace and the weakest reading in a year. ""We’re continuing to see the economy sort of slog along at somewhat disappointing growth levels for this late in a recovery,"" Cutler said. The inability for the economy to reach 3 percent growth is one reason employment has not expanded more significantly, Cutler said.While Eaton does not provide employment forecasts, Cutler said: ""I don’t anticipate that unless the economy grows faster, that net employment is going to be a substantial plus.""

She had headed the firm's mining fund with BlackRock veteran Evy Hambro since 2011. Barrick said Raw's experience at one of the top investors in the mining sector gives her an intimate knowledge of the global mining investment universe. She will seek greater rigor in financial analysis, planning and performance management across the company.The Toronto-based gold mining group has been reshaping its structure and shaking up management under Executive Chairman John Thornton, as he attempts to decentralize its structure and give more control to its mine managers. At the annual meeting this week, shareholders revolted against its executive compensation plan, especially a $12.9 million pay package for Thornton. Nearly three-quarters of the shares voted at the meeting were against the company's advisory say-on-pay vote, and shareholders also expressed their displeasure by withholding a large number of votes from members of the board's compensation committee.Thornton vowed to fix the executive compensation plan, especially his own package.

310,"  (Repeats story from Wednesday with no changes to text)By Sarah N. LynchWASHINGTON May 13 BlackRock Inc on Wednesday pushed back against arguments by the New York Federal Reserve and other regulators that asset managers' securities lending operations may pose major risks to the market and may need greater oversight.In a seven-page white paper seen by Reuters, the world's largest money manager says financial regulators misunderstand securities lending and are overstating its risks with regard to  the industry as a whole, and BlackRock in particular.The defense comes as regulators, including the Federal Reserve, raise concerns about potential dangers lurking in the asset management industry, citing its rapid growth, massive scale, and liquidity risks in the event of a financial panic.The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a body of U.S. regulators chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, has been particularly focused on how the sector operates.It has the power to label large non-banks as ""systemic"" - a  designation that compels greater oversight which has already been extended to insurers like American International Group  and Metlife.The asset management industry worries it could be next in line and has lobbied fiercely against the so-called Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) designation.Regulators including the FSOC, the Federal Reserve and others have all raised concerns about the practice in which pensions, mutual funds and other institutional investors lend out their securities to banks and hedge funds in exchange for collateral. Asset managers like BlackRock typically act as the lending agent on their clients' behalf.In a confidential presentation seen by Reuters, New York Federal Reserve Assistant Vice President Nicola Cetorelli told a group of international regulators in April 2014 that asset managers involved in securities lending behave like banks in many ways. ""If it looks like a bank, (it) quacks like a bank,"" he wrote in one slide.'ALL THE FACTS' He added that certain practices by asset managers, such as how they may reinvest cash collateral, is ""banking in its most basic form (but no equity, no bank regulation, and no backstops!).""Cetorelli has since gone on to publish an academic paper in December 2014 which contains many of the same perspectives. In its white paper, BlackRock cited Cetorelli's December 2014 paper as one example where regulators may not fully understand how securities lending works.""Unfortunately, these concerns have formed the foundation of recent policy discussions,"" BlackRock wrote in the paper. ""We believe it is imperative for policy makers to have all the facts.""A New York Federal Reserve spokeswoman declined to comment.In both the confidential power point and in his public December 2014 paper, Cetorelli explicitly referred to BlackRock's securities lending practices as an example of how asset managers may behave like banks such as JP Morgan Chase  and Citigroup. Asset managers staunchly oppose such comparisons because of their different business models. Unlike banks, they act as agents managing other peoples' money.BlackRock and other asset managers like Fidelity and Vanguard have come under the regulatory microscope in the years since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, as regulators have grappled with ways to prevent future meltdowns.CASH COLLATERAL CONCERN The industry has also faced pressure from the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Group of 20 economies' regulatory task force, which is drawing up a list of large funds that it believes should come under stricter supervision.BlackRock's white paper due to be released on Wednesday, the latest in a series of efforts to weigh in on regulatory issues, lays out responses to concerns raised about such arcane topics as cash collateral and indemnification. [ID: nL1N0OF21I]Rules implemented in 2010, for instance, BlackRock says, deal with any risks involving how cash collateral is reinvested by imposing shorter maturities and high credit quality requirements.""Cash collateral is conservatively invested in funds with guidelines"" that are consistent with these rules, BlackRock wrote.(Reporting by Sarah N.

311,"  (Adds investor comment, details from meeting)By Lisa Baertlein and Ross KerberLOS ANGELES/BOSTON May 21 McDonald's Corp  shareholders defied executives at its annual meeting on Thursday, approving a proposal to make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain and taking its new CEO to task over wages, advertising and its food.McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, is fighting on numerous fronts as he works to turn around the company, which saw profit and revenue fall in 2014 after service times slowed and nimbler rivals picked off  customers with menus that appeal to growing appetites for fresher, less-processed food.Despite opposition from McDonald's, 61 percent of voting shareholders said yes to a proposal that would make it easier for long-term investors to list director candidates on company proxy materials.The UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust brought the proxy access proposal before investors because ""McDonald's board needs to be more accountable for these performance lapses,"" the Trust's Corporate Governance Director Cambria Allen said at the meeting, which was closed to media but accessible via webcast.Thousands of protesters swarmed McDonald's headquarters for two days of rallies that are part of a multi-year, union-supported campaign for better wages and working conditions at the world's biggest restaurant chain.The day before the meeting, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to large public pension funds challenged McDonald's and other companies, saying they might be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via the buybacks. Earlier this month, Easterbrook said McDonald's turnaround plan would include returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases.Stringer called proxy access at McDonald's ""the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.""During Thursday's meeting, activists asked the company to make its actions match its public message. Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey called on McDonald's to ""stop pretending to support values for the public good while simultaneously undermining those policies with its political contributions.""The union introduced a shareholder proposal requesting an annual ""congruency analysis"" of company values and political contributions. It did not pass.While Easterbrook recently announced plans to raise pay for some 90,000 workers in company-run restaurants, Sharkey said the company ""simultaneously undermines efforts to raise the minimum wage across the country with large support through the National Restaurant Association (NRA),"" a deep-pocketed industry group that lobbies against such increases as well as food policy changes.""McDonald's is exposing its share owners and business to significant reputational risks by continuing to say one thing and do another,"" Sharkey said. Easterbrook told meeting attendees he was proud of the move the company made regarding crew wages in the restaurants it operates. He said the pay of some 660,000 other McDonald's restaurant workers was up to the franchisees who employ them. He did not address the NRA contributions.Others shareholders, including three nuns, appealed to Easterbrook to take concrete steps toward serving healthier food, moving to sustainable palm oil and cutting important human antibiotics from the production of all of the meats it serves.Casey Hinds of Seattle criticized McDonald's prior CEO Don Thompson for saying at last year's annual meeting that McDonald's was not marketing to schools - despite company fundraising programs such as ""McTeacher's Night."" She warned that continuing the disconnect was hurting the company's reputation with key customers.""It's the kind of disrespect that results in a loss of brand trust and why moms and Millennials are leaving the corporation behind,"" said Hinds, a former Air Force pilot who is part of Corporate Accountability International's Moms Not Lovin' It network.""In every market where we do business, we are a responsible advertiser,"" said Easterbrook, who added that McDonald's and its franchisees are committed to giving back to the communities where they do business.Easterbrook, who has vowed to transform the iconic chain into a ""modern, progressive burger company,"" also dismissed calls to retire company mascot Ronald McDonald. ""Ronald is here to stay,"" he said.

McDonald's opposes the proposal, which was filed by the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust.""We believe that making McDonald's leadership at the board level more accountable to shareholders ensures that the board is the strongest it can be to usher in a new chapter of prosperity for the benefit of the company, its employees, and shareholders,"" said Meredith Miller, chief corporate governance officer, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust.

That would give longer-term shareholders with limited resources more power to hold directors accountable, Miller said. McDonald's encouraged shareholders to reject the proposal, which it said is ""unnecessary and potentially harmful to the company at this time.""McDonald's said it has robust corporate governance practices that provide shareholders with the ability to effectively voice their views with the board and vote on critical matters.The vote on the proposal comes shortly after activist hedge fund investors such as Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP disclosed new stakes in McDonald's.Among other things, experts said activists are unlikely to benefit from the proposal because they tend to be short-term investors.

314,"  (Adds details from CEO Fink's conference remarks)By Ashley LauMay 27 Lowering interest rates around the world to boost the global economy has reached a point where it is now ""quite harmful"" to clients, including pension funds and insurers, BlackRock Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said on Wednesday.The ""low rate environment is having a profound impact on how they're going to operate,"" Fink said at the Annual Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Wednesday. He said that clients such as pension funds and insurance companies are ""having more structural problems than ever before"" in meeting their growing liability burdens without sufficiently yielding assets. New York-based BlackRock is the world's largest money manager, with $4.8 trillion in total assets under management at the end of March. The company's clients include a range of retail and institutional investors around the globe. Fink's remarks echoed comments he made last month in his Chairman's letter, in which he addressed concerns about yield-starved investors turning to lower-rated credits and longer-duration assets to attempt to meet future liabilities.""Not only is this driving prices ever higher in certain asset categories, but it is also contributing to greater portfolio concentration in more volatile areas of the market than historical norms,"" he wrote. During his morning remarks at the Bernstein conference, Fink addressed a range of issues impacting the investment community and industry, from the growing need to address capital market liquidity to how technology is changing the way asset managers interact with clients.""I think the industry is going through some dramatic changes,"" Fink said. ""I see huge upside for our industry too, but it's not going to be how we're accustomed to it.""

317,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, has no intention of buying a retail brokerage firm, Larry Fink, the chief executive officer, told shareholders Thursday morning. When asked by an investor at BlackRock's annual shareholder meeting if it would ever consider buying a retail brokerage given the profitability of the business, Fink said ""No, that's not part of our business model.""Similarly, Fink quickly dismissed a shareholder question about whether he would serve on a board of another company anytime in the next two to three years, answering with a quick ""no."" He does not serve on any other company boards. The shareholder meeting, which lasted around 45 minutes, took place Thursday morning at the Palace Hotel in New York. While shareholders overwhelmingly approved the company's proposals, including employee and executive compensation plans, they voted down the two shareholder proposals.One proposal, introduced by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Pension Plan and The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, requested that BlackRock publish an annual report disclosing its lobbying procedures, payments to lobbyists and trade associations. It received only 17 percent shareholder support. Another proposal, introduced by Investors against Genocide, requested that BlackRock implement an investment policy prohibiting investment in companies that engage in genocide.Specifically, the proposal, which only received three percent of the shareholder vote, noted that BlackRock is one of the largest holders of PetroChina and Sinopec, which are both large oil producers in Syria and Sudan. As such, the group claims they help fund government-sponsored genocide in both countries. BlackRock, with $4.8 trillion in assets under management, largely invests in the companies through its index funds, and is limited in what it can do, Fink told shareholders.

325,"  (Adds quotes from conference, background)By Michael Flaherty and Douwe MiedemaNEW YORK, June 4 Financial regulators are paying close attention to liquidity concerns surfacing across the U.S. bond market, a top Federal Reserve official said on Thursday.Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, the U.S. central bank's top financial regulation official, said that while bond liquidity is a concern, the behavior of the market is not yet showing significant fluctuations in pricing.Tarullo was among several speakers at an Institute for International Finance summit who addressed the issue of a plunge in broker-dealer bond inventories and the impact this could have in times of financial stress.Prior to Tarullo, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, voiced similar worries but held a more sanguine view. ""We do have a big reduction of liquidity in the bond market,"" Fink said during an earlier panel at the summit, adding that such a drop should not be a surprise.Fink, who runs the world's largest money manager, said that if the financial industry fails to move more capital market activity to transparent exchanges, the next crisis will  ""probably be oriented to lack of liquidity."" ""You could have the potential for frozen markets, because of no buffers,"" Fink said. ""I don't think it will happen but these are the issues I worry about.""Tarullo and Fink have been joined lately by other financial regulators and industry professionals discussing bond market liquidity. Fed officials have pointed to the potential trouble set up by a surge of fixed income assets and corporate debt issuance, coupled with lower bond inventories held by banks, which could result in greater volatility, wider prices and a liquidity crunch, in the face of stress in the market. SLOWER QUARTER Turning from bonds to bank regulation, Tarullo said not to expect many changes to an upcoming global plan and set of rules to make financial institutions more resilient in withstanding a financial crisis.Tarullo, as the Fed's top bank regulator, rarely speaks about monetary policy but he addressed the uncertain economic outlook on Thursday.Economic data so far in the second quarter fail to show the kind of U.S. recovery that was evident in the data last year in the same period, he said, echoing a view shared by his fellow board members. Tarullo said transitory factors contributed to the negative first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth reading, but that it remains to be seen if that weakness fades or persists.

328,"  NEW YORK Debt-burdened Puerto Rico has the potential to upset the municipal bond market if there is a broad restructuring of the U.S. commonwealth, causing uncertainty among retail investors, the head of asset manager BlackRock's Municipal Bonds Group said on Thursday.Puerto Rico finance officials have said the island could run out of money by the end of September without financing. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla in May signed into law a tax bill expected to provide about $1.2 billion in revenue for the next fiscal year, allowing Puerto Rico to pursue negotiations with creditors over a much-delayed bond deal of up to $2.95 billion.BlackRock's Peter Hayes said at a press briefing that the delay in the bond deal, originally expected late 2014, ""should be concerning to investors because lack of access to the capital markets and higher borrowing costs is always an indication of greater problems."" Puerto Rico bonds are fairly widely held by a variety of investors, he said, and a default or restructuring has the ""bigger potential to upset the market.""  ""It has the potential to create some uncertainty among retail and the potential for some outflows, if you get a larger broader restructuring of commonwealth in general,"" Hayes said. BlackRock does not own any bonds of power utility PREPA, which is struggling with $9 billion of debt and is currently working on a turnaround plan. But he said he could see a buying opportunity if the price fell from around 50 cents on the dollar to around 30 cents on the dollar. PREPA's bonds maturing 2043 are trading around 53.50 cents on the dollar.  BlackRock also cited concerns about some states, particularly Illinois and Alaska, wrangling with budgets before their fiscal 2016 begins in July.

330,"   By Christine Murray | MEXICO CITY  MEXICO CITY BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, has agreed to buy a Mexican infrastructure investment fund that financed projects for a contractor at the center of a scandal which embroiled President Enrique Pena Nieto.BlackRock announced its deal to buy Infraestructura Institucional, also known as I Cuadrada, on Friday, but gave no details.It will pay around 1.1 billion pesos ($71 million) and keep some of the fund's key senior management, said a person familiar with the deal, who declined to be named as the terms were not public.    Two of the six projects listed in Infraestructura Institucional's most recent quarterly filing were built by companies owned by contractor Juan Armando Hinojosa.Mexico's federal auditor is investigating contracts held by Hinojosa after news of real estate deals he made with political figures sparked national outrage last year. Local media reported that he sold a luxury home in Mexico City to the first lady, and the Wall Street Journal reported that he sold a house to Finance Minister Luis Videgaray at a below-market interest rate.His companies have won millions of dollars worth of public contracts during Pena Nieto's 2005-2011 governorship of the State of Mexico and his presidency. One of the companies was part of a Chinese-led consortium awarded a multibillion-dollar high-speed train contract last year. That contract was later nixed, days before news of the real estate deal with the first lady. The two Infraestructura Institucional projects with Hinojosa represent around 16 percent of total assets held in the fund's two investment vehicles, including long-term accounts receivable and investments in joint ventures. When including all committed capital to the fund, it represents 9 percent of the total.BlackRock's purchase of the fund would make it a partner with Hinojosa in one of the projects, a hospital in the State of Mexico, according to a source.""BlackRock has had a long-standing presence in Mexico; whether doing business here or anywhere else in the world, we always seek to put the appropriate controls in place,"" BlackRock Latin America head Armando Senra said on Friday. He declined to answer specific questions about Grupo Higa. Executives from Infraestructura Institucional did not respond to requests for comment. Grupo Higa, contacted by Reuters, said there was no one available to comment until Monday.Founded in 2010, Infraestructura Institucional has committed 585 million pesos of convertible debt to the Zumpango Regional Hospital, a first-quarter stock exchange filing shows. It has converted 185 million pesos-worth into shares.The hospital in the State of Mexico was built by a consortium led by Constructora Teya, part of Hinojosa's Grupo Higa, under a contract won in 2009. Hinojosa still holds a stake in the hospital, one source said.     Infraestructura Institucional also has a 600 million peso credit line with Autopistas de Vanguardia SA de CV, a Grupo Higa subsidiary, which in 2007 won a 30-year concession to build a toll road between Toluca and Naucalpan, also in the State of Mexico.Infraestructura Institucional runs two ""CKDs"", special listed investment securities created in 2009 to allow Mexico's pension funds to increase returns and diversify by investing in infrastructure.The first fund has around 3 billion pesos in committed capital.

But Brent crude futures prices slipped just over 2 percent in May, and some investors decided to take profits ahead of a potentially much bigger downward correction.""The gains were getting a bit ahead of themselves given the elevated inventory levels,"" said Martin Arnold, global commodity and FX strategist at ETF Securities, an issuer of ETPs.He noted that OPEC had not cut production, with Saudi Arabia raising output to a record high of around 10.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in May.  Meanwhile, demand has failed to pick up enough to work through the millions of barrels of oil in storage on land and at sea. ""We think there is some near-term weakness to come in oil prices - there is a greater risk of downside at the moment, so the profit-taking is pretty pragmatic,"" said Arnold.The data also showed investors beginning to tilt back toward industrial metals and broad basket commodity ETPs, which attracted net inflows of $163 million and $430 million respectively in May. Arnold said that ETF Securities had seen strong inflows into its aluminum and broad basket industrial metals ETPs, but copper products had experienced outflows. In terms of price performance, industrial metals was the worst-performing sector in the S&P GSCI in May, dropping 7.9 percent, and aluminum was the worst-performing commodity, sliding 11 percent.

Arnold said softs such as coffee and sugar had seen some decent inflows. He linked this to a number of weather-related factors, such as the potential for frost damage sparking fears of a lower coffee harvest in Brazil.

335,"  (Corrects throughout to show company is Blackstone, a private equity group, not BlackRock, an asset manager)MADRID, June 24 Fidere Patrimonio, a real estate investment trust owned by private equity group Blackstone  that groups units of rent-controlled housing in Madrid and Barcelona, will list its shares on Spain's alternative stock market MAB next week, the bourse said on Wednesday.City and regional governments sold thousands of rent-controlled flats - subsidized to make them affordable to lower- income families - to private investors during Spain's economic crisis, causing huge controversy. Thousands of Spain's poor now depend for their homes on the generosity of private equity.The announcement of the listing by Blackstone comes only days after Madrid city council changed hands. Under leftist Mayoress Manuela Carmena, it has vowed to reverse the tide of housing evictions during the economic crisis. Carmena, a former judge, also said she would review whether the sale of property was lawful. She plans to set up an office to act as intermediary between banks and families threatened with eviction.Fidere, which owns 2,688 properties in Madrid and Barcelona with a value of 212 million euros, said the listing seeks to provide potential liquidity and transparency. But documents filed by Fidere to the bourse spoke of a reputational risk as rent-controlled housing changes to private from public management. The documents also said tenants will be required to show they are solvent by presenting their most recent wage statements and providing proof that rents are no higher than 40 percent of their income, as well as not being on any creditor blacklist.Amnesty International released a report earlier this week which said that almost 600,000 eviction proceedings had begun in Spain since 2008.Just 1 percent of housing on offer is subsidized as part of housing programmes, Amnesty said, compared with 32 percent in the Netherlands, 23 percent in Austria and 18 percent in the United Kingdom.

337,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK, June 25 With the annual rebalance of the Russell stock indexes just a day away, brokerage firms are shaving the discounts they typically offer to big index funds on what is usually one of the biggest trading days of the year.On Friday, Russell will announce the names of some 128 companies that it is adding to its widely-followed Russell 2000 index of small companies. And that's when the big index fund providers - including Vanguard Group, Dimensional Fund Advisors and BlackRock Inc - must adjust their portfolios by buying the new stocks and selling the old.As recently as three years ago, big brokerages such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs would vie for those orders, confident that they could hand the big fund companies discounts of around .05 percent off of market-priced trades and still make money, mainly by stockpiling the right stocks in advance of the big trade.But in recent years, that has become harder to do. With FTSE Russell disclosing probable additions and deletions in advance, as well as increased competition from other institutional and retail investors, brokers have not found reconstitution day delivering the easy money it once did.Now, most brokers are offering the index funds closer to .01 percent to .02 percent, current and former executives at brokerage firms and index fund providers told Reuters. All of the executives wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media.""The brokers are finding it is not as lucrative as it once was,"" said one index fund manager.There is big money involved. Roughly $835 billion is invested in index funds that track the Russell indices, Russell said. More than $50 billion is expected to change hands in the final moments of Friday, according to New York-based Investment Technology Group.For example, at BlackRock alone, $41.9 billion in funds track the Russell 2000 index. With about 10.7 percent of those indexes expected to turn over, brokers would pay between $450,000 and $900,000 for the privilege of doing those rebalancing trades - and more to trade for the BlackRock institutional portfolios that also track those indexes. In the era of 0.05 percent discounts, brokers might have paid $2.2 million or more to BlackRock to handle the same volume Brokerage firms typically start buying shares of the companies that will be added to the Russell indices earlier in the year in anticipation of being able to sell them at a profit on the rebalance day. That was a more lucrative strategy when it was harder to figure out which companies would be added.Trading off the rebalance months ahead of time is so popular that Charles Schwab Corp has even promoted the strategy to its retail investors.""If you're a short-term trader, you might want to take advantage of the Russell reconstitution by buying some of the possible additions around the end of March and selling them near the end of June,"" Schwab wrote in a March 2014 paper promoting its equity rating service.A Schwab spokeswoman declined to comment.As a result, these shares are popping months before the reconstitution and then losing ground on the big day. For example, Reuters analyzed the price performance of the 10 companies that saw the biggest volume boost on the day of the 2014 rebalance. Those shares rose 8.3 percent in the three months leading up to the rebalance, while the Russell 2000 Index rose 2.2 percent.On the day of the rebalance, they fell 3.9 percent, while the Russell 2000 rose 0.7 percent. They slipped another 10.3 percent in the subsequent three months, while the broader index lost 5.9 percent.FTSE Russell has made several changes to its methodology over the past several years and made the process more transparent to reduce the volatility in these stocks on the day of the rebalance, said Rolf Agather, managing director, research and innovation indexes at FTSE Russell.Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Vanguard and Dimensional Fund Advisors declined to comment. Calls to Bank of America were not returned. A CROWDED TRADE Another reason brokers connected to big banks are less likely to offer the aggressive price improvements they once did is the new post-financial crisis regulations requiring banks to keep more capital on hand, executives said.""A lot of firms are reluctant to put their balance sheet out these days,"" said one of the brokerage executives, explaining that by buying up the positions in anticipation of the rebalance, they are essentially increasing the amount of risk on their books.For brokerages, the desire to win the index fund business while managing risk puts them in a difficult spot. On one hand, they want to offer competitive pricing, but on the other, they need to manage their own risk.""Firms understand this business is a loss leader but the hope is the relationship grows and the broker does other business with those managers,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.For example, large index funds can pass on brokerages business from their institutional clients, which is highly lucrative, said one of the executives who works at a large Wall Street bank.That makes it difficult for firms to stop offering these discounts altogether.""The index funds have a lot of power right now,"" said one former brokerage executive.(Reporting by Jessica Toonkel.; Additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, David Gaffen and Rodrigo Campos; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",2015-06-25,BLK,"Thu Jun 25, 2015 | 7:00am EDT",RPT - INSIGHT-Banks slash payments to index funds for Russell rebalance,http://www.reuters.com//article/russell-rebalance-brokerage-idUSL1N0ZA2JN20150625?type=companyNews

Trading off the rebalance months ahead of time is so popular that Charles Schwab Corp has even promoted the strategy to its retail investors.""If you're a short-term trader, you might want to take advantage of the Russell reconstitution by buying some of the possible additions around the end of March and selling them near the end of June,"" Schwab wrote in a March 2014 paper promoting its equity rating service.A Schwab spokeswoman declined to comment.As a result, these shares are popping months before the reconstitution and then losing ground on the big day.For example, Reuters analyzed the price performance of the 10 companies that saw the biggest volume boost on the day of the 2014 rebalance. Those shares rose 8.3 percent in the three months leading up to the rebalance, while the Russell 2000 Index rose 2.2 percent. On the day of the rebalance, they fell 3.9 percent, while the Russell 2000 rose 0.7 percent. They slipped another 10.3 percent in the subsequent three months, while the broader index lost 5.9 percent.FTSE Russell has made several changes to its methodology over the past several years and made the process more transparent to reduce the volatility in these stocks on the day of the rebalance, said Rolf Agather, managing director, research and innovation indexes at FTSE Russell.Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Vanguard and Dimensional Fund Advisors declined to comment. Calls to Bank of America were not returned. A CROWDED TRADE Another reason brokers connected to big banks are less likely to offer the aggressive price improvements they once did is the new post-financial crisis regulations requiring banks to keep more capital on hand, executives said.""A lot of firms are reluctant to put their balance sheet out these days,"" said one of the brokerage executives, explaining that by buying up the positions in anticipation of the rebalance, they are essentially increasing the amount of risk on their books.For brokerages, the desire to win the index fund business while managing risk puts them in a difficult spot. On one hand, they want to offer competitive pricing, but on the other, they need to manage their own risk.""Firms understand this business is a loss leader but the hope is the relationship grows and the broker does other business with those managers,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.For example, large index funds can pass on brokerages business from their institutional clients, which is highly lucrative, said one of the executives who works at a large Wall Street bank.That makes it difficult for firms to stop offering these discounts altogether.""The index funds have a lot of power right now,"" said one former brokerage executive.(Reporting by Jessica Toonkel.; Additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, David Gaffen and Rodrigo Campos; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",2015-06-25,BLK,"Thu Jun 25, 2015 | 1:00am EDT",INSIGHT-Banks slash payments to index funds for Russell rebalance,http://www.reuters.com//article/russell-rebalance-brokerage-idUSL1N0Z116E20150625?type=companyNews

342,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Greek voters will likely approve a bailout offer from creditors in a referendum set for Sunday, said a top strategist for BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager.In a telephone interview on Thursday, Russ Koesterich, BlackRock global chief investment strategist, said he expected ""some type of knee-jerk relief rally"" as a result of the referendum even though markets have already priced in anticipation by most investors of a ""yes"" vote on the bailout.Based on polling, Koesterich said: ""The vast majority of Greeks still want to be in the euro. Clearly a 'no' vote puts that membership in peril.""Greek voters are being asked to decide on Sunday whether to accept bailout terms from creditors, provoking a tumultuous domestic debate. Koesterich's expectations are in line with those of other U.S. investors, though recent polling makes the result hard to forecast.Koesterich warned that the political environment was still fluid and that the odds could still change before Sunday. A ""no"" vote on the ballot question, he said, could lead to the sale of risky assets, similar to what occurred on Monday, when U.S. stocks fell around 2 percent and some European indexes were down more.Still, Koesterich said he believed the market impact of Greece's exit from the euro, if it happens, would be limited. ""I think it would be a temporary event,"" he said.BlackRock has advised Greek officials in the past. A BlackRock spokeswoman said the company would not comment on advisory relationships. New York-based BlackRock has $4.8 trillion under management but data from the Lipper unit of Thomson Reuters show a scant $200 million or so of BlackRock stock and bond holdings in Greece.Asked about U.S. equities, Koesterich called U.S. stock valuations ""somewhere between fairly valued and a bit stretched."" A correction of as much as 5 or 10 percent could occur once the U.S. Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates, he said, and longer-term equities gains should be more modest than in recent years. “Valuations are elevated, relative to history. But you have a benign environment of low rates, low inflation and a decent credit market. Given those conditions, equities can go higher,” he said. A correction could be a chance to buy technology and financial companies that would benefit from a stronger economy, he said.

344,"   By Jessica Toonkel  BlackRock Inc is calling for a series of reforms that both regulators and asset managers should consider to address concerns about liquidity in the fixed income market. In a paper released on Friday, the world's largest asset manager discussed how new trading protocols for fixed income securities, revised reporting of large block trades and best practices among asset managers among other things could address concerns about higher costs and lower trading volume in different fixed income sectors.Tougher regulation in the wake of the financial crisis has reduced the willingness of bond dealers to take on large blocks of bonds from customers. As a result, government bonds around the world have become harder to buy and sell, according to a Barclays report released on Wednesday.The release of BlackRock's paper comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to tighten its supervision of what procedures asset managers have in place to deal with a race to the exits in the fixed income markets. Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Oversight Board, which has been looking into whether asset managers such as BlackRock pose systemic risk, shifted gears last year in its review of the industry, focusing more on asset management activities and products, instead of the big firms themselves. In its paper, BlackRock proposes creating a new trading protocol for fixed income securities that would be closer to how equities trade with buy and sell orders being matched up. Such a protocol is currently being used through a joint venture between BlackRock and MarketAxess Holdings and has seen growing adoption, said Richie Prager, head of trading and liquidity strategies at BlackRock, in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Also, delaying the disclosure of large block trades of fixed income securities to the end of day or lowering the minimum threshold when they need to be disclosed could prevent market reaction to these trades, BlackRock said in the paper. All block trades above $5 million currently are disclosed immediately.""Folks are currently afraid to take risk because everyone will know it happened,"" Prager said.  BlackRock also suggested best practices that asset managers can adopt, including allowing temporary borrowing for short-term purposes and implementing mechanisms where redeeming shareholders would pay the price for liquidity during times of stress.In a separate paper, BlackRock addressed concerns about liquidity of bond exchange-traded funds, noting that a classification system that differentiated between traditional ETFs from exchange-traded notes and ETFs that invest in commodities could help investors better understand the risks.

Meanwhile, unconstrained bond funds overall saw $1.9 billion in outflows over the same period, according to Morningstar.Unconstrained bond funds have become popular over the last year because they have the flexibility to invest in all types of bond securities globally and often choose credit rather than interest-rate sensitive assets.BlackRock's Strategic Income Opportunities Fund's three- and five-year returns rank the fund among the top quartile of its peers, but this year, the performance has leveled. So far this year, the fund has returned 0.69 percent, which is slightly below its category average, according to Morningstar.

353,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Neha Dimri  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, posted a small rise in second-quarter profit as the company saw net outflows for the first time in nearly three years.Net outflows totaled $36.6 billion, with investors pulling out $7.3 billion from BlackRock's long-term funds. It is the first time that the New York-based firm has posted outflows since the third quarter of 2012.The bulk of those outflows were from large international institutional investors pulling funds from low-fee index-based products. CEO Larry Fink told Reuters in an interview that those investors put the money into cash or reallocated into active BlackRock strategies.Ten of BlackRock's largest institutional clients have pulled $40 billion from BlackRock over the past two quarters, he said.""It's raining in some parts of the world and some of these countries have built large rainy day funds,"" Fink said. But many of these same investors reallocated into BlackRock's more profitable active strategies, according to the firm. BlackRock saw $2.5 billion in net inflows into its institutional active strategies.Overall, investors poured $10.85 billion into BlackRock's exchange-traded funds, with the lion's share going into equity funds.  Retail flows totaled $10.8 billion, the bulk into fixed income funds.The inflows into active strategies and ETFs are key to BlackRock because they garner higher fees than institutional index strategies. For every $10,000, an investor in a BlackRock retail fund pays around $64 a year, compared with $34 for an exchange-traded fund and $10 for institutional clients, according to the firm.""If you think about what our ambitions were three years ago, we wanted to be known as much as an active manager as an index manager,"" Fink told Reuters Wednesday morning. ""We have certainly proven that in fixed income, we have proven it in multi-asset, and we are proving it in our model-based active funds."" However, BlackRock still has a ways to go in gaining market share among registered investment advisers (RIAs), Fink said on an analyst call Wednesday. ""We are still way behind other firms with regard to the RIAs,"" he said. BlackRock is looking at how it can bring some if its risk management tools, like its Aladdin platform, to this audience, Fink said.And despite BlackRock's sweet spot in fixed income, Fink said he is not worried that investors will rush out of bonds if the Federal Reserve raises rates later this year. ""Seventy percent of BlackRock's bond holders are insurance companies and pension funds,"" Fink said, noting that these institutions have long time horizons. ""People don't leave fixed income... it's one of those myths.""BlackRock reported that third quarter profit rose to $819 million, or $4.84 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, up from $808 million, or $4.72 per share, a year earlier.

354,"  (Adds additional details on outflows, Fink quotes)By Jessica Toonkel and Neha DimriJuly 15 BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, posted a small rise in second-quarter profit as the company saw net outflows for the first time in nearly three years.Net outflows totaled $36.6 billion, with investors pulling out $7.3 billion from BlackRock's long-term funds.  It is the first time that the New York-based firm has posted outflows since the third quarter of 2012.The bulk of those outflows were from large international institutional investors pulling funds from low-fee index-based products. CEO Larry Fink told Reuters in an interview that those investors put the money into cash or reallocated into active BlackRock strategies.Ten of BlackRock's largest institutional clients have pulled $40 billion from BlackRock over the past two quarters, he said.""It's raining in some parts of the world and some of these countries have built large rainy day funds,"" Fink said.But many of these same investors reallocated into BlackRock's more profitable active strategies, according to the firm. BlackRock saw $2.5 billion in net inflows into its institutional active strategies. Overall, investors poured $10.85 billion into BlackRock's exchange-traded funds, with the lion's share going into equity funds.Retail flows totaled $10.8 billion, the bulk into fixed income funds.The inflows into active strategies and ETFs are key to BlackRock because they garner higher fees than institutional index strategies. For every $10,000, an investor in a BlackRock retail fund pays around $64 a year, compared with $34 for an exchange-traded fund and $10 for institutional clients, according to the firm.""If you think about what our ambitions were three years ago, we wanted to be known as much as an active manager as an index manager,"" Fink told Reuters Wednesday morning. ""We have certainly proven that in fixed income, we have proven it in multi-asset, and we are proving it in our model-based active funds.""However, BlackRock still has a ways to go in gaining market share among registered investment advisers (RIAs), Fink said on an analyst call Wednesday. ""We are still way behind other firms with regard to the RIAs,"" he said.BlackRock is looking at how it can bring some if its risk management tools, like its Aladdin platform, to this audience, Fink said. And despite BlackRock's sweet spot in fixed income, Fink said he is not worried that investors will rush out of bonds if the Federal Reserve raises rates later this year.""Seventy percent of BlackRock's bond holders are insurance companies and pension funds,"" Fink said, noting that these institutions have long time horizons. ""People don't leave fixed income... it's one of those myths.""BlackRock reported that third quarter profit rose to $819 million, or $4.84 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, up from $808 million, or $4.72 per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, BlackRock earned $4.96 per share, handily beating analysts' average estimate of $4.80, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.BlackRock ended the quarter with $4.7 trillion in assets under management, up from $4.6 trillion a year earlier.BlackRock's shares were trading around $344 per share in morning trading, flat for the day.

357,"   By David Randall and Ross Kerber | NEW YORK, July 20  NEW YORK, July 20 Fund companies and brokerage firms should be able to weather a proposal by Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that would increase capital gains taxes for some investors, but some fund holders could see higher costs, managers and analysts said.Though details of Clinton's plan have yet to be finalized, the candidate's proposal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, would increase the holding period required to qualify for lower long-term rates. Currently, gains on investments held for less than a year are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, while those held for longer than a year are taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8 percent for the highest earners.Brokerage firms that rely on customer trading as a revenue source might see a ""modest"" impact to their bottom lines should Clinton's proposal become law, said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill who covers the brokerage industry.The plan may ""slightly"" reduce the number of trades by customers at brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab Corp , TD Ameritrade Holding Corp and E*Trade Financial Corp, he said. But about 75 percent of the daily volume comes from active traders who are already subject to higher taxes because of their frequent trading, and therefore would be unaffected by the higher rates, he noted. Portfolio managers would have a harder job trying to avoid triggering capital gains taxes that would be passed on to investors, fund analysts said.The average large-cap blend fund has an annual turnover of 70 percent, likely incurring a mix of short-term and long-term capital gains taxes for its shareholders each year, according to Lipper data. Most actively managed funds also tend to charge a redemption fee on shares held for less than a year in order to limit short-term trading by their customers. The change would mean Clinton's plan could hit fund investors with more frequent capital gains taxes, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P CapitalIQ. Actively managed funds spread their own capital gains across all investors in the fund.""This will impact mutual fund investors even if they have a long-term investment horizon because capital gains will now have to hit a different threshold. You could find yourself paying taxes at a higher rate even if you didn't do anything during that year,"" Rosenbluth said. However, Brad Friedlander, managing partner of Angel Oak Capital Advisors in Atlanta, said higher rates would likely have a minimal impact on firms such as T. Rowe Price Group Inc  and BlackRock Inc because most portfolio managers and shareholders tend to hold their stakes for several years.Financial planners may see a windfall from any changes that complicate the tax structure, said Phil Orlando, a portfolio manager with Federated Investors in New York.""It becomes a cat-and-mouse game as individuals sit down and try to figure out which vehicles they have at their disposal that are not subject to taxes,"" such as IRA accounts or 529 college savings accounts, he said.

358,"   By Simon Webb and Michelle Price | BANGKOK/HONG KONG  BANGKOK/HONG KONG U.S. fund giant BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) has won a special new licence that will allow it to raise funds in China directly for the first time, a senior executive told Reuters, paving the way for the world's largest money manager to expand in the mainland. Speaking in an interview in Bangkok this week, BlackRock vice chairman Philipp Hildebrand, said his company was granted a so-called Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP) license ""reasonably recently"". He said BlackRock, with about $4.5 trillion in assets, is committed to China and will ""do whatever that entails"" to provide asset management services there.At a time when China's stock markets are gingerly recovering from their worst ever sell-off, the new licence allows BlackRock, which already has some operations in the country, greater freedom to raise funds onshore from domestic high net worth Chinese investors through a wholly owned fund management company.BlackRock now joins a handful of other global funds with QDLP licenses including, Man Group Plc (EMG.L) and Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZM.N). Amid Beijing's extraordinary measures to halt its markets slide, some questioned the second-largest economy in the world's commitment to opening up capital markets.Although the Chinese authorities do not publish information on QDLP licenses, BlackRock is among the first traditional asset managers to receive such a license, according to people familiar with the matter. Hildebrand declined to discuss targets for BlackRock's business in China. ""We also recognize that it's a long-term proposition and we're ready to stay for the duration,"" said Hildebrand. ""I think we've shown to the authorities and to the market that we're there.""Beijing controls access to its market tightly. Foreign asset managers that wish to distribute investment products generally have to operate on the ground through minority-owned joint ventures with domestic firms, although regulators are gradually loosening the reins.Hildebrand, who was in the Thai capital to address a Bank of Thailand policy forum, said he was not concerned by short-term volatility, but by whether China remains committed to its reform agenda. ""It will have repercussions, it will mean lower growth rates but I think the Chinese government knows that and accepts that as the natural consequence of this desirable reform effort,” he added, referring to China's reform efforts.BlackRock was awarded two Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) licenses last year, which allows the company to purchase stocks and bonds in China. It also has a stake in a joint venture with Bank of China Investment Management. Unveiled in 2012, the QDLP licence is designed to allow foreign alternative asset managers, namely hedge funds, to raise funds onshore to invest offshore. The first round of licenses was granted in 2013. ""This is a very significant development for BlackRock from a branding and marketing perspective, as it allows them to raise funds in China in their own name directly for the first time,"" said Stephen Baron, executive director at Shanghai-based investment consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. ""It also very important for the scheme itself, as it signals that the authorities are broadening out QDLP.""

359,"   By Jessica Toonkel  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is on the prowl for energy and infrastructure projects in the United States, Mexico and Asia that its institutional clients can invest in, Mark McCombe, head of BlackRock's institutional business, said in an interview last week.The asset manager, the world's largest, is trying to build a name for itself in private financing deals to attract and please yield-hungry clients such as U.S. pension funds, McCombe said. He sees particular opportunity now because banks that had funded those types of projects are constrained from doing so by post-crisis regulations.Historically, BlackRock has invested in such deals through its fund of funds business, but direct deals give the company  more flexibility in the kinds of projects it can invest in, rather than having to stick to the mandate of a fund, McCombe said. BlackRock is interested in bringing private equity ownership deals and private lending deals to clients. ""We are doing more direct deals so it means our name is going to be more prominent and hopefully people will see the name and approach us with more deals,"" said McCombe, 49, who is rumored by insiders to be one of a handful of contenders to lead the BlackRock when Chief Executive Larry Fink, 62, retires.Last week, Halliburton (HAL.N) said it had tapped BlackRock for $500 million to help fund drilling in existing shale wells.  Earlier this year, BlackRock and private equity firm First Reserve took a joint equity stake in a $900 million pipeline project run by state-controlled Mexican oil company Pemex.BlackRock also is looking for more deals in asset management technology, such as its investment in Symphony Communications Services Holding LLC, a Wall Street-backed digital marketplace for research and data..Over the past two and half years, BlackRock said, it has raised $15.2 billion in commitments for such deals either directly or through its fund of funds business. The company  declined to break out how much is in funds or invested directly.  These deals are a small part of BlackRock's alternatives business, which accounted for just 3 percent of the firm’s assets under management, while generating 6.4 percent of the company's total revenue.""We love energy and we love anything that has the characteristics of becoming too expensive for the banks to warehouse,"" McCombe said.

""Their country exposure is going to be different, and that exposure difference helps explain why they perform differently. So far, the discrepancy has helped the Vanguard fund, Rosenbluth said, although both funds have taken a hit since the end of June, when the Shanghai Composite Index started falling.Since then, the Vanguard fund has lost 11.65 percent, while the iShares fund has fallen 12.45 percent. Year to date, the Vanguard fund is down 6.97 percent, and the iShares fund is down 8.89 percent.Chinese shares have been falling on fears that the nation's economy may slow well beyond the 7 percent growth rate that analysts had earlier suggested would be a bottom for that market. China has moved to weaken its currency to bolster its economy and share prices. The difference between the two funds is expected to widen because the two different indexes they follow will be treating Chinese stocks differently. FTSE Russell plans to begin adding onshore Chinese equities, known as A-shares, to new transitional emerging markets indexes, which it expects Vanguard to start following.The existing Vanguard benchmark, the FTSE Emerging Index, now has approximately 26 percent exposure to China, according to the mutual fund company. In June, Vanguard said it would begin shifting to the new FTSE index later this year. The new index will have a 29 percent exposure to China, including a 5.6 percent exposure to A-shares.MSCI Inc, however, said in June that it was not ready to include the A-shares in its two emerging market indexes.""The Vanguard fund's performance will be driven by how well the Chinese stocks do,"" said Rosenbluth.A-shares are traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and are typically only available to local investors and select qualified foreign investors.Most foreign investors trade H-shares. These shares of companies incorporated in mainland China are listed on the Hong Kong exchange.

367,"   By Jessica Toonkel  BlackRock Inc's (BLK.N) chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income, Rick Rieder, believes the window for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is closing, he said in an interview on Monday.While Rieder hopes the Fed will still begin raising rates in September, the current market volatility is making it difficult, he said.""I think they should go and I think the markets would be in better shape if they do, but that being said I think the confluence of opinion around if they will go has waned,"" Rieder said. If the Fed does not raise rates in September, Rieder thinks it unlikely it will do so later in the year. Rieder, who manages BlackRock's unconstrained bond fund, the $31 billion Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX.O), has predicted the Fed would start raising rates in September.It now appears that a September rate increase is less likely but not completely out of the question, he said. ""A lot can happen between now and middle of September,"" he said. In the meantime, Rieder is finding opportunities in these markets. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $4.7 trillion in assets under management, has been buying investment grade credit in industrials, Rieder said. ""We are dipping a toe in."" He declined to elaborate. BlackRock has also been buying 10-year Treasuries over the past couple of weeks on the theory that the current market volatility will push back the Fed from raising rates, Rieder said. ""In that situation, the back end of the curve can still rally,"" he said.

368,"   By Jason Lange and Jonathan Spicer | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Aug 24 Turmoil in world financial markets and growing fears of a China-led global economic slowdown threaten to derail the Federal Reserve's plans to start raising rates from near zero, making the chances of a September lift-off look increasingly remote.A near 9-percent dive in Chinese shares on Monday triggered sharp sell-offs in Asia and Europe, wild swings and losses on Wall Street, and knocked crude prices to new multi-year lows.The rout, which follows weeks of jitters over the extent of China's economic troubles and their impact on the rest of the world, convinced investors that the Fed would hold off with action until some semblance of calm returns.""You would be insane to raise interest rates when markets are in such turmoil,"" said Martin Barnes, chief economist at BCA Research in Montreal.Compared to last week, investors now see a much lower chance the Fed will hike at its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Prices for swaps on Wall Street implied traders saw a 24 percent probability for a September move, down from 46 percent a week earlier, according to Tullett Prebon data.Barclays, for example, now expects the Fed will not raise rates until March. Previously, the British bank expected the hike to come in September.BlackRock Inc's chief investment officer for fixed income, Rick Rieder, told Reuters that even though he hoped the Fed would move next month, market volatility was making it difficult.As part of Monday's sell-off, investors also scaled back their own bets on long-term U.S. inflation. The market gauge of those expectations - the yield spread between 10-year Treasuries and 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities - hit a seven-month low, suggesting investors see inflation of around 1.5 percent over the next decade, well below the Fed's 2 percent target. Until quite recently, the Fed has expressed limited concern over China's market turbulence, with policy debate focusing on evidence of improving labor markets and solid economic activity and whether it should raise rates next month or in December and at what pace it should proceed afterwards.NEED FOR CAUTION With market jitters hitting home, however, the Fed has a number of reasons to be cautions even about taking that first step. One is that financial markets, with investors shying away from risk and pushing U.S. Treasury yields lower, are more prone to a nervous reaction if the Fed were to move next month.Secondly, the Fed has to consider that market gloom might be a sign that the global economy is in worse shape than it has  assumed, and the drag on the U.S. economy could be bigger than previously factored in by the central bank.Fed policymakers have also said they wanted to be confident that inflation will start climbing towards its target before embarking on a tightening cycle and that goal now looks even more elusive.As a result of global demand worries oil prices tumbled by another 5 percent to new 6-1/2 lows. China's weakness and softer global demand for anything from raw materials to electronic components and heavy machinery is also bad news for U.S. factories.Even though China accounts for only a small share of U.S. exports, several Fed policymakers noted last month that ""a material slowdown in Chinese economic activity could pose risks to the U.S. economic outlook,"" according to the minutes of their July 28-29 policy meeting.""The export effect is certainly significant,"" said Charles Collyns, an economist at the Institute for International Finance who also sees the U.S. central bank staying pat in September. ""The Fed is going to play it very cool.""Troubles abroad, such as euro zone's debt crisis, have repeatedly stunted the United States' recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, but policymakers of late have been more confident the U.S. economy can cope with headwinds from abroad.The Fed has carefully crafted a message this year that the time was approaching for it to raise interest rates.A September hike is not entirely off the table. The U.S. stock market rout that began Friday could still reverse itself, and a key employment report for August might show further improvement in the labor market.""It's only August, and markets move quickly,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase. But he added: ""The moves we've seen in markets, if they are sustained, don't help the case for September.""

369,"   By Jessica Toonkel  BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager is acquiring a San Francisco-based robo-adviser, FutureAdvisor, the firm announced Wednesday morning.Unlike competitors in this space, BlackRock does not plan to target individual investors with the robo-adviser, which offers portfolio management online.  Instead the firm hopes to use FutureAdvisor to enable banks, brokerage firms, insurers and 401(k) plans to use the company's digital platform to serve mass affluent investors and millennials, Frank Porcelli, head of BlackRock's U.S. wealth advisory unit, said in an interview.Many banks and brokerage firms over the years have shifted their focus to serve higher net worth investors, leaving an opportunity for firms to target the ""mass affluent"" investors, or those with less than $1 million in investable assets, Porcelli said.Younger investors are increasingly interested in online advice, as opposed to hiring an adviser, he said. By using FutureAdvisor, financial institutions can either offer these clients a digital advice offering or they can use the offering to complement a broker.Also, the FutureAdvisor platform enables clients to aggregate all of their accounts, which is often a challenge for financial advisers, said Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer and global head of BlackRock Solutions.""You have a 401(k), then a bank account, and then maybe one or two brokerage accounts and figuring all of that out as well as the tax components is something that FutureAdvisor is strong at,"" Goldstein said. Through the acquisition, FutureAdvisor will keep its brand and be part of BlackRock Solutions, the firm's risk management and technology platform.BlackRock, which has $4.7 trillion in assets under management, has been increasingly focused on technology. The firm has been hiring to grow its ""big data"" team and recently hired a data scientist from Google. Speaking at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York in May, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he believed robo-advisers were going to become an element that every major firm would need to offer.""Everyone talks about how robo-advisers can't connect with clients,"" Fink said.

370,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Aug 26 Investors in Discovery Communications Inc, including Manning & Napier Inc  and BlackRock Inc, withheld support for a member of the company's compensation committee, recent securities filings show, after the cable network operator gave its CEO the richest pay package in the S&P 500.The filings also show how some large fund firms backed opposite sides in a major proxy fight at DuPont this spring, with BlackRock funds backing management and Fidelity funds like Magellan supporting dissident director candidates.Because fund firms rarely discuss their proxy voting in detail, the disclosures provide a rare look at the influential votes they cast. Spokespeople for BlackRock, Fidelity and Discovery declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Manning & Napier did not return messages.Compensation for Discovery CEO David Zaslav became a flashpoint this spring after he received $156 million for 2014,  most of it tied to performance goals meant to align his interests with those of shareholders. Discovery did not hold an advisory vote on Zaslav's pay this year, leaving the votes on two directors, Robert Beck and J. David Wargo, as the main way for investors to express displeasure on the pay, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.Beck, an independent consultant who sits on Discovery's compensation committee, received support of just 56 percent of votes cast at the company's annual meeting on May 20. Wargo, was supported by 69 percent of votes cast. A number of BlackRock Funds that opposed Beck supported Wargo, filings showed, including BlackRock Long-Horizon Equity Fund. Manning & Napier funds like Pro-Blend Maximum Term  opposed both directors. S&P 500 directors on average received 97 percent support, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy.In the case of DuPont, the company in May repelled a challenge by activist investor Nelson Peltz, with shareholders backing all 12 directors nominated by the U.S. chemical conglomerate's management. Peltz's Trian Fund Management had sought four seats on the board, including one for himself, and had pushed the company to split its business. A source close to the matter had previously said DuPont had won backing from large fund firms including BlackRock, but the funds had not previously disclosed their voting.In a recent corporate governance report, BlackRock described its talks with an unnamed company, likely Dupont, and said that while a dissident shareholder ""raised reasonable questions,"" board changes were unnecessary.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Alan Crosby)",2015-08-26,BLK,"Wed Aug 26, 2015 | 6:26pm EDT",Funds snub Discovery director after rich CEO pay package,http://www.reuters.com//article/discovery-ceopay-funds-idUSL1N1111HQ20150826?type=companyNews

""For a period in time we didn't do a lot in China, because the pricing didn't seem conducive for us to make returns, whilst underwriting reasonable levels of growth. Now that picture has changed and China has become our key market for sure. It has been softening for the past 18 to 24 months,"" Saunders added. Yields in Chinese retail real estate investment markets have compressed to around 6 percent in the first half of this year due to expensive land cost and excess supply, according to property consultancy Colliers. They were about 9 percent a decade ago. But yields are holding up relatively well for them even as capital values have weakened, Saunders said. BlackRock said it owns a shopping mall in the southwestern city of Chengdu. Saunders, who joined from Singapore-based property investment firm MGPA when it was acquired by BlackRock in 2013, also saw opportunities in distressed residential projects in the mainland.    China, the world's second largest economy, is forecast to grow at its slowest pace in 25 years hurt by soft demand, over-capacity and falling investment. It has been further buffeted by a recent stock market slide and surprise yuan devaluation.Currency depreciation, in fact, can make real estate investment favorable, if a firm hedges its currency exposure early, he said. ""When a currency depreciates, hard assets tend to appreciate, because people take flight from paper currency deprecation into hard asset.""Other than China, Saunders said he is also upbeat on Japan, and Australia in the near term, adding that Hong Kong appeared ""pricey"".

383,"   By Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The Federal Reserve will likely raise U.S. interest rates at its December policy meeting, Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock said on Friday, adding that even a year-end hike was not a sure thing.""I think October is off the table,"" Rieder told Reuters at BlackRock's New York office Friday morning, after it decided to stick to its near-zero rate policy on Thursday.He noted that there will not be enough data released by the Fed's October 27-28 meeting to warrant a change.As a result of the ongoing uncertainty and volatility caused by the Fed announcement, BlackRock sees opportunities in short-term Treasuries and investment grade credit.""I had thought that investment grade credit had very limited value for the past few years, but some of these spread levels are very attractive right now,"" Rieder said. BlackRock, the world's largest money manager with $4.7 trillion in assets, is adding investment grade corporate credit, particularly in the industrial sector, where it is seeing increased supply, Rieder said. Rieder believes that even a December rate hike may be questionable because of year-end factors like the holiday season, when consumption is higher, Rieder said.The futures market implied traders see only a 14 percent chance of a Fed rate hike in October and 42 percent chance in December, according to CME's FedWatch program.Going into Thursday, Rieder thought there was a 50-50 chance that the Fed would raise rates. ""My head told me yes, but my gut told me 'no,"" he said.While he was not surprised by the Fed announcement, Rieder said he was surprised that the Fed did not leave more room for  rate increase in October.""Chairwoman Yellen did say October is live but I think they didn't give a lot of reason why October could really happen and that part was surprising,"" Rieder said. While Rieder applauded the Fed's transparency overall, he said it would be helpful to the markets if the agency would be more specific about what series of metrics it looks at, whether it be the jobless rate or apartment rental vacancies rate.""If they laid out a series of indicators, that were not definitive, but gave you a sense... that this is the algorithm that is part of the thought process, it would be helpful,"" he said.

385,"  (Adds context)Sept 22 The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board said on Tuesday it has voted to strip Bank of America Corp  Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan of his chairman's title, the biggest shareholder so far to declare its intentions in a closely watched corporate governance contest.The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is holding a special shareholder meeting Tuesday morning on bylaw changes it made last year to allow CEO Moynihan to take on the additional role of chairman, sparking protests from other public pension funds who say the roles should remain separated to provide more oversight. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board controls 103 million shares of the bank, or about 1 percent of the bank's shares, making it the tenth largest investor overall, according to Thomson Reuters data.Representatives for the bank's top three investors - Vanguard Group, State Street Corp and BlackRock Inc - have so far declined to comment on how they will  vote. In an e-mailed message on Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the Canada fund cited a voting record posted on its website. The spokeswoman did not immediately return a message seeking further comment. Technically the fund and other bank investors are voting on bylaw changes made to allow Moynihan to take on the additional role, and the bank has said it will honor the voting results.The changes undid a vote by shareholders in 2009 to strip the previous CEO, Ken Lewis, of the chairman's title, at the height of the financial crisis.

394,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 7 U.S. stock exchange rules designed to protect investors from market routs backfired on Aug. 24, exacerbating a selloff in exchange traded funds, BlackRock Inc said in a report published Wednesday.BlackRock blamed both automated selling by investors and exchange-required trading halts for a dislocation in ETF pricing that morning, when a broad selloff initially sliced 1,000 points off of the Dow Jones industrial average shortly after the market opened.That day, a group of ETFs sank an average of 30 percent from their prior-day close, often far below the value of their underlying stocks. Trading in 327 such funds was halted that day.Prices largely returned to normal later that morning. BlackRock, which has $1 trillion in assets under management in its iShares ETF business, saw some of its funds frozen. ""The events of August 24 left many investors dissatisfied with the prices at which trades were executed and raised concerns about the functioning of markets and [exchange-traded products],"" the report said.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been looking into possible revisions of its rules on ETF trading. Fund companies promised to investigate the pricing issues. BlackRock and others have said that day's dislocations were temporary and did not have an effect on the average ETF investor. BlackRock said complex issues led to the halts and caused ETFs to trade below the value of their underlying securities. But among them, they said, are rules that made it difficult for traders to operate.The New York Stock Exchange invoked a rule allowing traders not to disseminate pricing information when the market opened. While designed to help, BlackRock said the rule ""inadvertently impeded"" the information available to traders. When ETFs trade at discounts to the value of their underlying stocks, traders will snap them up and profit on the difference until they return to fair value. On Aug. 24, these traders could not guarantee that they would be able to execute that arbitrage trade because of the lack of information, widespread halts and the delayed opening of several stocks, BlackRock said.Retail investors may have had so-called stop loss orders in place that automatically sold funds as they dropped below pre-set price targets. Some may have sold at the bottom.The firm's report included seven recommendations, including asking retail brokerages to better educate ETF traders who may be better served by using so-called limit orders that only sell at a certain price instead of stop orders that will trigger sales when a security plunges through a target price.The report also suggested that on extremely volatile days, market-wide circuit breakers be used instead of halts on individual securities.

395,"   By Jamie McGeever | LONDON  LONDON The most challenging global market environment in years will see annual investment returns slashed to just 4-5 percent over the next five years, strategists at investment firm Blackrock said on Wednesday.The high degree of uncertainty surrounding global growth and policymaking also means investors should diversify as much as possible and be nimble enough to reduce their exposure to risky assets when needed, it said.Sara Morgan, managing director of diversified strategies at Blackrock, said the S&P 500 index's average annual real return of 14 percent over the last five years will not be repeated over the next five. Instead, investors should expect 4-5 percent. ""The last few years were all about 'how do I capture the upside', but now it's 'how do I protect the downside',"" Morgan told a press briefing at Blackrock headquarters in London's financial district. ""You're going to have to make your assets work so much harder."" Blackrock is the world's largest asset manager, with over $4 trillion of assets under its wing.Morgan and her colleagues have reduced their equity exposure and bought 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds in recent weeks as the tremors from China, emerging economies and commodity markets have rippled across all markets.They have also dipped into the derivatives market to protect themselves against sharp swings in equity markets, and expect volatility to remain high. If market and economic conditions deteriorate further, they will extend this strategy further.  But they are optimistic on the outlook for the global economy, and therefore confident that markets can ride out the volatility. Global recession, as forecast by economists at U.S. bank Citi, is not Blackrock's central scenario.""We're at a very uncertain juncture ... but things aren't as bad as people think,"" said Pierre Sarrau, deputy chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at Blackrock.  He and his team are buying European equities, favoring Italian stocks in particular through buying call options.Call options are a bet on an asset rising in price, giving the holder the option, but not the obligation, to buy at an agreed price in the future.

398,"   By David Randall and Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 13 The era of making a broad bet on mutual fund companies as a way to play America's self-funded retirement boom appears to have ended.After outpacing the market during both the 1990s and early 2000s bull runs, the stocks of standalone mutual fund companies such as T. Rowe Price Group Inc, Eaton Vance Corp  and Franklin Resources Inc have fallen behind, gaining just half the amount of the broad S&P 500 over the last five years.Analysts say there is little reason to expect a broad snapback in shares anytime soon, largely because the firms, big in the retirement space that mushroomed once 401ks and IRAs began to replace traditional pensions in the early 1980s, are now facing the flip side of those savings plans: withdrawals.Last year marked the first time that more money came out of 401(k) plans than was added, with $377 billion in withdrawals outpacing $338 billion in deposits, according to Cerulli Associates. Those declines are expected to accelerate as the baby boom generation ages.At the same time, standalone fund firms are losing assets to lower-cost and less-profitable passively managed mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Private firm Vanguard, best known for its index funds, is the world's second-largest asset manager, behind only BlackRock Inc, whose iShares line makes it the world's largest ETF provider, according to IPE Research.Even fund companies that establish their own ETFs may find themselves retaining assets by cannibalizing their own more fee-intensive funds. Adding insult to injury, fund company margins have been hurt in recent years by near-zero short-term interest rates that have prompted companies to waive fees on some funds.After selling off since peaking late in 2014, many fund companies have become cheap when compared with their historical standard and the broader S&P 500 index. T. Rowe Price's price-to-earnings ratio hit a 20-year low of 14.3 on Oct. 7 and has edged up slightly to 14.5. Franklin Resources'  forward PE stood at 12.1, up slightly from a 3-year low. As of Oct. 12, BlackRock Inc's forward PE was at a 1-year low of 15.1, even with the S&P's. In the past, these companies have had PEs in the high 20s. Thomson Reuters Starmine holds an intrinsic value of  $49.80 for Franklin Resources stock, $407.90 for BlackRock and $90.15 for T. Rowe Price, all well above their recent trading levels.TAILORED BETS Mutual fund companies still have a lot of money in their coffers. Actively managed funds oversee a total of approximately $8.1 trillion in assets, compared with $1.6 trillion invested in ETFs, according to Lipper data. But analysts and fund managers say they have to be much more selective to make money by buying shares of fund companies. Even with their depressed share prices, not every one is a bargain.Investors say it requires specific attributes - a fund lineup with a history of beating peers or a sizable money market business - to help a company expand while the broad industry slows.""Not everyone is going to be comfortable going with a completely passive approach, especially if the market continues to be volatile,"" said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research.Judson Brooks, an analyst who works on the $17.5 billion Oakmark Fund, said his fund owns shares of T. Rowe Price - down 14 percent year to date - largely because its track record of beating its peers should continue to attract assets. The company announced in July that 76 percent of its funds outperformed their Lipper averages over the last three years, and 86 outperformed their peers over the last 10 years.""The essential element of the company is that they have been able to maintain their outperformance, and we think they have a culture where that is going to continue,"" Brooks said.Higher interest rates, meanwhile, should help the companies expand their margins. A 0.25 percent increase in interest rates would allow mutual fund companies to recoup 65 percent of fee waivers, while a 1.0 percent increase in rates would allow firms to eliminate fee waivers entirely, analysts say.T. Rowe Price waived $12.5 million in fees last quarter to maintain positive yields for investors in money market accounts, an amount roughly equal to what it spent on advertising and marketing. Once interest rates rise high enough, ending fee waivers should boost its revenues by about 1.3 percent, analysts say.Higher rates would especially help Federated Investors, which has approximately 69 percent of its $354 billion in assets under management in money market funds, said Argus' Biggar. Shares of the company are down 9.8 percent for the year to date and trade at a forward price to earnings ratio of 16.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Reporting by David Randall with additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Linda Stern and Dan Grebler)",2015-10-13,BLK,"Tue Oct 13, 2015 | 11:48am EDT",End of an era: Mutual fund companies no longer a market bright spot,http://www.reuters.com//article/fund-stocks-idUSL1N12C0MX20151013?type=companyNews

407,"  (Adds BlackRock comment)By Huw JonesLONDON Oct 22 The Bank of England and international authorities are examining whether promises by funds to give investors their money back at any time could end up damaging liquidity in markets, a top BoE official said on Thursday.Sharp moves - ""taper tantrums"" - in U.S. government bond prices have raised concern among central banks, with asset managers worried they face heavy new rules.""A particular concern occupying both the (BoE's) Financial Policy Committee and authorities internationally is that simultaneous redemptions from open-ended funds offering short-term redemptions could test the resilience of market liquidity,"" BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said.Asset managers and investment funds were not a source of instability in the 2007-09 financial crisis, but the past is not always a guide to the future, Cunliffe told a British Bankers' Association conference.Banks have blamed shrinking liquidity in secondary government and corporate bond markets on higher capital requirements, making their trading activities uneconomic.Hans Peter Lorenzen, managing director of corporate securities strategy at Citi bank, said a plethora of new regulation is a big part of why ""air pockets"" have emerged in bond markets. ""It has just become much harder to make markets,"" Lorenzen told the conference.Regulatory changes need to become more coherent, Cunliffe said, after so many new rules were introduced since the crisis to make under-capitalised banks more resilient.""It is quite conceivable that given the range and speed of regulatory reforms, there are parts of the framework that might not work in the way we intended,"" Cunliffe said.But there was no going ""back to the future"" of tolerating more risk to financial stability as memories of the 2007-09 crisis fade, he said. Changes in the structure of markets and the ability of technology to connect buyers and sellers could also increase liquidity, he added.""It remains for me, however, an open question whether such liquidity would be resilient in times of stress. Automated markets may have driven down costs, but are possibly less resilient,"" Cunliffe said.Funds already have ways to manage liquidity risks, but Cunliffe said investors may not fully appreciate how their ability to redeem, at or close to, current market prices could be compromised by large simultaneous withdrawals.

417,"   By Michael Flaherty and Ross Kerber  NEW YORK/BOSTON Nov 6 Three top U.S. asset managers shied away from supporting dissident directors in recent proxy contests, according to voting data, showing how corporate management teams can still depend on key players in the fund industry for backing in the face of an activist fight.The data, dating back to 2013 and compiled by financial services group Houlihan Lokey, showed that since 2013, funds sponsored by BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group Inc and State Street Corp all voted for just a minority of the 229 board seats sought by directors aligned with dissident shareholders.That was a low count considering that dissident efforts - often led by activist hedge funds - won 126 of the seats, or more than half of the contests. Funds sponsored by BlackRock supported 83 of the nominees, followed by funds sponsored by  State Street, which supported 62 of them, and Vanguard, which backed just 29 directors.The findings of the Houlihan Lokey report from these funds run counter to the hopes of activist investors that the fund industry will come around to supporting their attempts to remake corporate boardrooms.[reut.rs/1kbyTkm ] Despite the growing acceptance of activism among institutional investors, voting against the management teams of large companies where money managers hold big positions remains a difficult choice, potentially because it could risk the fund firms' contracts to manage company 401(k) money.""They've demonstrated that they're somewhat more conservative than the broader investment community,"" said Geoffrey Sorbello, senior vice president at Houlihan Lokey. ""They have large positions, they're very influential, and yet their voting record is often inconsistent with the eventual outcome of these situations."" The voting tallies exclude cases where mutual funds withheld support from management director candidates, which could in practice support dissident efforts.Also looming over the Houlihan Lokey data is the trend of faster settlements between companies and activists. In many cases, activist advisors say, the two sides settle because large institutional investors indicate to management that they are inclined to side with the activists. Vanguard Fund Treasurer Glenn Booraem, who oversees proxy voting, made a similar point. ""Increasingly, activists and companies alike are engaging with large institutional investors to gain support for their views and listen to their perspectives,"" Booraem said.Representatives for BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors declined to comment.The companies run huge passive funds required to own shares, and say they consider their proxy votes as long-term shareholders.

426,"  * Sees long-end U.S. Treasuries vulnerable* Markets too complacent about long-term U.S. bond yield outlook* Expects higher volatility in markets after Fed rate hikeBy Tomo UetakeTOKYO, Nov 19 BlackRock's flagship retail fund sold long-dated Treasuries earlier this month, its lead portfolio manager said, on the view financial markets may be too complacent about  potentially higher yields as U.S. interest rates are set to rise.Michael Fredericks, who leads a team of more than 20 fund managers managing a total of $45 billion, including the Multi-Asset Income Fund, also told Reuters that financial markets should expect higher volatility after a few years of relative calm.Like many market players, Fredericks expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December but his team has a different view on how that would affect the U.S. bond market. ""Markets expect to see a lot of flattening in the yield curve. Markets believe that the 10- and 30-year yields are going to go up very slowly but the front-end, one-year, two-year part of the market will move up very quickly,"" Fredericks said during his visit to Tokyo earlier this week.""We think markets are too complacent, too comfortable with the idea that the 10-year and 30-year part of the yield curve will not go up much. We think that's vulnerable,"" he said.Even with a December hike priced in, rises in long-dated U.S. bond yields have been limited. The 10-year yield stood at 2.26 percent on Thursday, below its one-year peak of 2.50 percent hit in June, and well down from last year's high of 3.04 percent.""Right now there is a lot of negative reaction to slowdown in global manufacturing...I think people are extrapolating excessively what they are seeing in global markets,"" Fredericks said.Based on such a view, the fund increased hedging of its exposure to 10- and 30-year yields this month. The fund had no such hedging position at the end of October. Fredericks feels markets are pricing in excessive rises on the short end of the yield curve.""I think the Fed will be very careful in the language they use because they don't want to cause a big appreciation of the dollar. The dollar's excessive strength could undermine growth.""The Fed's rate hike was likely to mean an end to the relatively stable performance of asset markets, he said.""We've gone through a period of time where global stocks have done pretty well over the last few years, with actually very low volatilities by historical standards,"" he said, noting that risk-adjusted returns over the last three years were the best since the 1940s.""It doesn't necessarily feel that good but returns were very high compared to very low volatilities. But because rates are likely to start to rise and all these liquidity measures are coming closer to an end, you are likely to see volatilities go up,"" he said.BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, managing $4.5 trillion globally at the end of September.

434,"  (Changes source, adds shares)Dec 11 Shareholders of financial services provider Towers Watson & Co and insurance broker Willis Group Holdings voted to approve their merger, the companies said in a joint statement.The support by Towers shareholders comes after an $18 billion merger agreement between the companies was amended to increase the one-time cash dividend to be paid to Towers stockholders to $10 per share from $4.87.""We are pleased with the outcome of today's vote and thank all of our shareholders for their support,"" said John Haley, chief executive officer of Towers Watson. At the first vote to approve the merger that took place in November, top Towers shareholders, including BlackRock Inc , refused to support the deal which proved to be a critical blow, and forced the company to adjourn the meeting until Friday. A key goal of the merger is to have Willis, the world's third-largest insurance broker, combine with Towers Watson to add consulting operations and help take on bigger rivals.The raised dividend proved enough to swing top Towers shareholders to switch their vote in favor of the deal, leading to the approval at Friday's meeting.

435,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON The blow-up of Third Avenue Management's junk bond fund this week, the biggest mutual fund failure since the financial crisis, show the dangers of loading up on risky assets that are hard to trade even in good times.    At least one-fifth of Third Avenue's Focused Credit Fund, with less than $1 billion under management, was composed of illiquid assets, meaning they trade so infrequently that they don't have a market price, according to a Reuters analysis. That's one of the highest percentages of exposure in the junk bond sector.    Meanwhile, some of the most popular U.S. junk bond funds also have made large bets on assets considered the hardest to trade and value in the industry, and their portfolios may not reflect the full extent of the current downturn in the junk bond market, said junk-bond analyst Marty Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC.    ""Precisely because these (assets) are hard to price, they won't necessarily show the full extent of the market decline,"" Fridson said. ""That can make a fund with lots of illiquid security look better than a fund with big, liquid names where the price declines are very transparent.""AllianceBernstein's AB High Income Fund has the biggest holdings on a percentage basis this year among the largest junk bond funds. At the end of July, the fund reported $1.08 billion in illiquid assets, or 15 percent of the securities in a $7.3 billion portfolio, according to a Reuters analysis of the 10 largest U.S. junk bond funds. The Third Avenue fund isn't in the top ten.    AllianceBernstein did not respond to questions seeking comment.     With the $236 billion junk bond mutual fund sector on course for its worst performance in seven years due to a rout in commodity prices and expectations of higher interest rates, some big junk bond funds already are scaling back exposure to their riskiest assets.     The $17 billion American Funds High-Income Trust Fund, which this year realized nearly $200 million in losses on its most illiquid assets, told Reuters it plans to reduce its current exposure of 1.6 percent of securities that are hard to price and trade.   An American Funds spokesperson said the positions are carefully researched.       High yield, also known as junk, debt issuance has skyrocketed from $147 billion in 2009 to more than $300 billion in each of the last three years. Record-low interest rates have encouraged investors to take on more risk, including the debt of less creditworthy issuers, to get a higher return.    Tom Lapointe, portfolio manager of the Third Avenue fund, said in an October 2014 interview with Reuters that ""any company with a pulse has been able to refinance.""    In addition to AllianceBernstein and American Funds, other investment funds such as BlackRock Inc and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc have junk bond funds - staple holdings for pension funds, retirement plans and mom-and-pop investors - that hold the largest amount of assets that are so illiquid and so hard to price that their valuations are sometimes pegged to assumptions made by the investment managers themselves, their fund disclosures show.        REAL CARNAGE?      The illiquid debt favored by junk bond funds ranges from subprime loans bundled into mortgage-backed bonds by Wall Street banks on the eve of the credit crisis to bank loans to distressed companies in the energy and chemical industries.    Fund managers favor illiquid assets because they may pay 50 cents on the dollar to buy them, for example, and they get a yield premium for carrying the extra risk, said Sumit Desai, an analyst at fund research firm Morningstar Inc.     Most junk bond funds don't hold any so-called Level 3 assets, which are generally considered risky and illiquid, or the amounts are less than 1 percent of their portfolios, according to a Reuters analysis of fund disclosures.    Junk bond portfolio managers already are navigating a treacherous market featuring a meltdown in the energy sector. Managers say junk-bond pricing volatility is reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis. And investors have made $5.7 billion in net withdrawals from junk bond mutual funds this year, according to data from Lipper Inc, a unit of Thomson Reuters.      DoubleLine Capital bond star Jeffrey Gundlach this week predicted ""real carnage"" in the junk bond market as the Federal Reserve leans toward raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.    The sector is losing 3.01 percent this year, compared with 2008 when junk funds lost 25.5 percent, according to Lipper Inc data.            Fund assets are typically categorized as Level 3, according to U.S. accounting rules, when pricing is unavailable and their value is set by internal estimates or quotes from outside vendors. By contrast, U.S. government bonds or blue-chip stocks are categorized as more liquid Level 1 assets because their value is easily discovered in the market and they trade frequently.     Some funds with the highest percentage of Level 3 assets also are among the worst performers, according to Lipper.    Waddell & Reed's $6.7 billion Ivy High Income Fund ranked fifth worst with a one-month total return of negative 3.33 percent. The fund's Level 3 assets were almost $260 million at the end of September, or 4 percent of the portfolio. The company did not return messages seeking comment.    BlackRock declined to comment about its holdings.    ""For stuff that's illiquid even under ordinary conditions, anyone who sells under present conditions will take a bath,"" Fridson said.

436,"  (Corrects DuPont CEO's surname to Breen from Breene in paragraph 3)By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike StoneNEW YORK Dec 14 The tax-free treatment of the spin-offs Dow Chemical Co and DuPont plan to carry out after they merge their businesses is a prime driver of the deal, potentially saving tens of billions of dollars, industry experts said.The $120 billion merger, announced last week, comes less than a month after drug maker Pfizer Inc said it would use its $160 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc as a way to cut its taxes. It underscores the growing use of mergers and acquisitions as a way to slash corporate America's tax bill.""The whole structure of this is very, very tax efficient and one of the reasons we are doing it this way, so very beneficial from that standpoint to the shareholders,"" DuPont CEO Ed Breen told analysts on Friday. ""When I looked at every other strategic option to DuPont, there was nothing that came close to this."" Unlike the Pfizer-Allergan deal, where the savings are the result of Pfizer redomiciling to Ireland where Allergan is based in a so-called inversion, the Dow-DuPont tax savings hinge on their transaction being structured as a merger of equals, a rare event that requires companies of the same size and scope willing to negotiate it, according to tax experts. Both companies are now valued at about $60 billion each.""It is fairly rare,"" said Robert Willens, a corporate tax and accounting consultant. It's unusual for two companies of roughly equal size in the same industry to negotiate such a deal, he said.Typically, companies that have been through a change of control are liable to pay capital gains taxes on subsequent spin-offs, under section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. If both companies, however, do not formally undergo a change of control, the spin-offs can be tax-free. After their merger, Dow and DuPont plan to create three publicly-traded businesses, focusing on agriculture, materials and specialty products. They plan to argue that no change of control will have occurred by structuring their initial deal as a merger of equals. Bolstering their view that a change of control has not occurred is that the two companies have many shareholders in common.Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Global Advisors, Capital World Investors and BlackRock Inc are, in that order, the top holders of both companies' stock. The companies haven't disclosed estimates for tax savings. People familiar with the deal said the savings will far exceed the $3 billion in annual cost synergies that the companies expect.Tax experts say there is some, albeit limited precedent to this. The most famous case where this deal structure was used was the 2007 merger of drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp  and Kindred Healthcare Inc, which the companies used to then spin off their institutional pharmacy businesses.William Curry, Dow's chief tax officer, played a key role in structuring the tax aspects of the deal with DuPont, according to the sources. Earlier this year, he orchestrated the separation of a portion of Dow's century-old chlorine business and sale to Olin Corp in a tax-efficient deal worth $5 billion.Dow and DuPont declined to comment on the tax aspects of their deal.

Low oil prices have also been putting pressure on some funds and companies.The investment management firms will voluntarily clear CDS transactions connected to single companies and countries, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the Managed Funds Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said. (For list of firms, see: bit.ly/1Yint04) CDSs are contracts that let investors buy protection to hedge against the risk that corporate or sovereign debt issuers will not meet their payment obligations. Clearing involves sending the trade through a third party that guarantees its completion, backing the transaction using margin it collects, and recording the details. There was $8.2 trillion in debt guaranteed against default, not including offsetting positions, through single-name CDSs as of June 30, down from a peak of $33.4 trillion in June 2008, according to the Bank for International Settlements.""CDS liquidity has deteriorated sharply in recent years,"" Scott O'Malia, chief executive officer of ISDA, said in a statement.

443,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Dec 22 As the U.S. dollar strengthened throughout 2015, managers of currency-hedging exchange-traded funds had a banner year - they collected one of every four dollars invested in U.S. ETFs and rewarded their investors well.Now, they are doubling down with plans for as many as 41 new currency-hedging funds on file with regulators. But many of those funds may come to market after the easy money in currency hedging has been made.That could be reflected in some of the new fund proposals from BlackRock Inc's iShares unit and WisdomTree Investments Inc. Both plan to launch funds that continually adjust their currency exposure based on the perceived value of the particular currencies at any time, a trade more nuanced than simply shorting currencies like the yen and euro while buying stocks in Japan or euro zone countries.In 2015, while the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan eased monetary policy, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Foreign currencies have sagged against the dollar, while the stocks of foreign exporters have been boosted because their products and services got cheaper in dollar terms. Investors flung $47 billion at U.S.-listed currency-hedged ETFs in the first 11 months of the year. There are now $68.3 billion in these assets, compared with only about $418 million in 2011, when the products were fledgling, according to FactSet.But even some ardent proponents of these investments, such as RiverFront Investment Group LLC, a firm which helped hedged-ETF leader WisdomTree design its first currency-hedged products, are starting to take money off the table.""You may have seen the end of the easy trade of being short the euro,"" said Michael Jones, chief investment officer of RiverFront, which pared back its exposure to such hedges for European stocks last month. Shortly thereafter, on Dec. 3, an announcement of additional stimulus by the ECB was found wanting by the markets, pushing the euro up unexpectedly. Investors who used currency-hedged funds for the most part did well in 2015. WisdomTree's Europe Hedged Equity Fund , delivered a 4.8 percent gain this year, as the MSCI Europe index slid 4.7 percent, according to Morningstar Inc data through Monday.And investors in broad emerging-market funds would have lost only 9.7 percent year-to-date rather than 16 percent by using the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  instead of the far more widely traded iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, the data showed. But other hedged trades failed to pan out, even as the dollar appreciated 9 percent against a basket of the euro, yen and four other currencies.Despite hopes that a sinking yen would lift currency-hedged Japanese ETFs, the Deutsche X-trackers MSCI Japan Hedged Equity ETF's 8.6 percent gain through Monday is roughly even with the 8.5 percent gain of the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, according to Morningstar data.The new funds proposed by WisdomTree and iShares would adjust their exposure to currencies based on market conditions in order to favor recently rallying currencies, those with higher purchasing power and those in countries with higher interest rates, among other factors, according to the filings.Both WisdomTree and BlackRock decline to comment about funds that have not launched, but some of the filings said the goal of the funds is to limit investors' losses when foreign currencies depreciate while also allowing investors to profit when currencies appreciate.

467,"  * Asset manager ditches Single Bs* Arbitrage in European CLOs increasingly strained* Outlook for primary market bleakBy Mariana IonovaLONDON, Feb 11 (IFR) - BlackRock had to widen spreads and jettison a tranche to finally clear its debut European CLO on Tuesday, the most obvious sign yet that the underlying economics of the asset class are close to breaking point.Market players worry that the eye-watering levels on the US asset manager's CLO will choke off the primary market entirely, shutting out a number of managers that are preparing deals.""None of those deals have any chance of getting close to being done,"" one CLO investor said. ""There's no point. There is no market.""There are six to seven European CLOs said to be pre-marketing at the moment, with BlueMountain and 3i both looking to price their deals in the coming weeks. CVC is also preparing a CLO, one source said.BlackRock had been looking to price its European CLO I for several months, but held off from pulling the trigger until recently due to thinning arbitrage and a heavy calendar of competing supply.But while Triple A spreads in the primary market appear to have found a ceiling, appetite for the riskier junior and mezzanine tranches has collapsed entirely, as a sharp sell-off in high beta credit has crimped demand for riskier assets.This forced BlackRock to ditch a planned 9.5m Single B tranche, which was originally whispered at an 850-870bp discount margin, according to market sources.""You can still place the Triple A and equity, its the mezz that has become the real challenge to find buyers for,"" said an investor in leveraged loans. OPAQUE DISCLOSURE Arranger Credit Suisse sent out BlackRock European CLO I's final terms on Tuesday, but did not disclose each tranche's discount margin or cash price, only the coupons.This drew criticism from several market sources, with some reading it as a ploy to deflect from the deal's poor outcome.""I don't think I've ever seen a deal with pricing details out and no details on DM,"" one European CLO trader said. The 410.2m deal saw the 215m Class A-1s placed with a 150bp over Euribor coupon. Sources said it was placed at par, meaning the Triple As priced in line with the last three European deals.But the sources added that tranches lower down the capital structure were placed at deep discounts to par.They said the Triple Bs came at a discount margin in the low 500s, compared to the disclosed 450bp coupon. The Double Bs meanwhile are said to have priced in the low 800s with a 650bp coupon.This was in line with spreads in the secondary market, with traders seeing Triple B paper around 490bp and Double Bs at 800bp.Single B paper is now seen at over 1,000bp, revealing how ambitious the deal's 850-870bp whisper for the dropped tranche was. It also shows how much the riskiest parts of the CLO market have widened in a short space of time, as Oaktree Capital Management's Arbour CLO III placed Single B paper at a discount margin of 856bp less than a month ago.One source noted that given the further widening in this space it ""doesn't make sense to print Single Bs at the moment."" UNFORTUNATE TIMING BlackRock began pre-marketing last year, with one manager noting pricing was originally targeted for the end of the third quarter. The asset manager held off as spread widening squeezed the arbitrage in European CLOs, which aim to capitalise on spread differentials between loans and collateralised debt.But with no sign of recovering demand, the group began officially marketing in January.""You've got to feel sorry for BlackRock because they've just been very unfortunate in their timing,"" the CLO investor said. ""I'm surprised they didn't pull it, to be honest.""Some said BlackRock should have waited out the volatility. But others noted warehousing terms and mounting pressure to place the debut deal likely pushed the manager to print.""Keeping it lingering and lingering is not helpful,"" said one CLO arranger. ""But they got a deal done - that's the important thing.""It is yet to be seen whether the strained economics of euro CLOs will knock demand for European leveraged loans, which have so far this year weathered the storms that have hit other areas of riskier credit.But the leveraged loan investor was relatively sanguine.""The way the market usually works, the equilibrium comes back very quickly,"" he said, citing loans' 25% to 30% annual repayment rate as a stabilising factor.

474,"   By Olivia Oran and Trevor Hunnicutt  Wall Street banks are ramping up businesses that trade exchange-traded funds full of bonds, a bright spot of growth at an otherwise bleak time for trading but one that may carry unappreciated risk.Barclays PLC (BARC.L), Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) have all created special teams to make markets in bond ETFs. The teams include staff across stock and bond markets, since the ETFs trade like stocks on stock exchanges, but their underlying securities are bonds.All told, 12 to 15 banks now have a presence in the business, whereas a few years ago almost none did, said Anthony Perrotta, global head of research and consulting at TABB Group.    ""There are a lot of institutions that, even though they might be retrenching in fixed-income trading, are looking at ETFs as a way to galvanize their business,"" said Martin Small, who oversees U.S. operations for BlackRock Inc's (BLK.N) iShares unit, which is the largest ETF issuer.Although these businesses are sprouting up across Wall Street, they are unlikely to make up for huge profits banks earned during the glory days of bond trading, at least not anytime soon.Investors pay banks 0.01 percent to 0.03 percent to trade a bond ETF, according to TABB Group, compared with 1.03 percent for an individual bond. Traders say they are hoping to make up for piddling margins by selling more of the product, since the ETF business is a bulk-volume one that is rapidly growing.The sales push comes after years of pressure from leading ETF creators like BlackRock and State Street Corp (STT.N) to make markets for the bond ETFs.  Those firms rake in billions of dollars' worth of revenue from ETFs each year, and view bond ETFs as a way to grow their own businesses.Firms that create ETFs need banks to act as intermediaries for sales, and also to ensure that prices are in sync with underlying securities. Before banks entered the market, trades were handled by market-makers like KCG Holdings Inc (KCG.N), Cantor Fitzgerald and Susquehanna Capital Group, who have been in the business for years. As Wall Street has warmed to bond ETFs, the market has quickly grown. Assets under management in the U.S. rose 44 percent to $372 billion at the end of January from $258 billion a year earlier, according to fund research service Lipper. That represents about 19 percent of the broader $2 trillion U.S. ETF market.While the bond-ETF boom may be good for Wall Street, it is not without risk.It comes at a time when liquidity in the corporate bond market has shriveled due to new rules that require banks to hold a lot of capital against those securities. As a result, banks avoid buying bonds from investors unless they can resell them quickly, and do not maintain much inventory for interested buyers.Despite their holdings, bond ETFs trade more like stocks, on stock exchanges, so they are not facing the same type of liquidity issue. But it is unclear how they will perform if investors rush for the exit all at once, or if markets come under serious stress. During the Aug. 24 ""flash crash,"" for instance, some ETFs failed to trade properly. ""I think ETFs can be great products,"" said Gershon Distenfeld, director of high yield at AllianceBernstein. ""They just don't work where there's an illiquid market.""COLLABORATIVE EFFORT Despite those concerns, bankers seem happy to be building up a business that is in high demand. Barclays' foray into bond ETFs began several years ago, but the bank has recently increased its marketing of the products to clients who are unfamiliar with them. The bank's head of ETF trading, BJ Prager, said the business relies on staff who have expertise across stock and bond markets. Credit Suisse launched a similar effort about a year ago. The bank's credit team finds bonds for money managers to include in the products, and its equity desk provides technology to trade and value them. Credit Suisse sells bond ETFs through both channels, and includes them on Nitro, its ETF trading platform, so that clients can trade more easily.""It's a serious initiative at the firm,"" said Rob Bernstone, a managing director in equity trading at Credit Suisse.Goldman Sachs has spent the last six months building up its bond ETF business. Brian Levine, a co-head of equity trading who is leading the effort, said it involves ""close collaboration"" between stock and bond traders.Banks have also forged close ties with firms creating bond ETFs.BlackRock and other ETF issuers allow banks to sweep bonds that might have otherwise hogged space on their balance sheets into ETFs. And, each week, representatives from Blackrock's iShares business speak to bond traders at all the major banks about the business.

475,"  LONDON Feb 19 The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, has gone overweight emerging local currency bonds within its emerging market debt strategies for the first time in three years, predicting double-digit returns this year from the sector.""This is the first time we are positive on EM local currency debt in three years,"" Sergio Trigo Paz, BlackRock's head of emerging debt told Reuters on Friday.""We are expecting double-digit total returns in dollar terms in a year where most assets might deliver negative ones.""Trigo Paz had favoured hard currency debt since 2013, the year the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled it would cut back on bond-buying, setting the dollar on an appreciation path against almost every other currency. The Fed raised interest rates last December.EM local debt lost 11 percent in dollars last year, but has outperformed most asset classes in 2016, with gains of over 3 percent on the GBI-EM index. But Trigo Paz predicted at least a partial retracement of the dollar's 25 percent appreciation in the past three years.Among central banks, while Europe and Japan are easing policy, the Fed is no longer expected to raise rates sharply. ""So at least there is some stabilisation or a pause in the monetary policy divergence and this is the first headwind that has been neutralised,"" he said.As for the second headwind, weak oil prices, he said oil exporters - members of the OPEC producers' group as well as non-OPEC Russia - had demonstrated their keenness to prevent further price slides. Producers agreed this week to freeze output. ""If you talk of a one-third (dollar) retracement, we talk of 7 percent. So in EM local debt you get to clip your coupon of 7 percent, plus another 7 pct on EM currencies if you get a dollar depreciation of 7 percent across the board,"" Trigo Paz said.Asset selection can provide extra returns on top, he added.He favours the debt of countries rebalancing their current accounts such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil and Chile, as well as those able to cut interest rates. Most of the latter group are in Asia.

""Gold is mispriced by two or three hundred euros if we're going to go down the road of growing the balance sheet"" of the central bank, he said. ""Money is going to go into gold.""Rieder also expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike the benchmark interest rate it controls one or two times this year, he said on CNBC, including once in June. And he said the bank's use of an aggressive stimulus policy called quantitative easing, or Q.E., is not out of the question. ""I hear people speak about the Fed may ultimately do Q.E. again; I don't think that's a crazy concept,"" said Rieder, whose recent remarks on the U.S. economy had been more optimistic. ""The world is slowing. I think the U.S. economy is going to slow.""That growth is slowing in part because of a rising U.S. dollar, which hurts emerging markets that had borrowed in that currency, Rieder said.

487,"   By Michelle Price and Elzio Barreto | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Following a rare public campaign, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) voted against a deal planned by a Hong Kong firm that the world's biggest asset manager partly owns, revving up investor activism in Asia after it roared ahead in 2015. In a ballot on Tuesday, BlackRock rejected G-Resources Group Ltd's (1051.HK) plan to sell its main asset, an Indonesian gold mine, saying it didn't have confidence G-Resources would use the proceeds in investors' best interests. Owning 8 percent of G-Resources, BlackRock urged other shareholders to follow suit. G-Resources, which has said it would use the proceeds to shift its focus to financial services, reported after market hours that the sale was approved by a 59 percent majority.BlackRock's campaign, albeit unsuccessful, highlights how investors are becoming more active in seeking out better returns in Asia amid ultra-low interest rates and sluggish global growth. The trend has been given added weight by reforms in places like Hong Kong and Japan designed to enhance corporate governance and promote minority shareholder rights, giving investors ammunition to push back against company management.""You have seen the success of activist funds in the United States improving businesses and increasing shareholder returns,"" said Seth Fischer, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based activist hedge fund Oasis Management. ""They are looking for further opportunities, bringing their critical know-how to Asia and saying, 'Let's produce the same things out here'.""According to data from research firm Activist Insight, the number of companies in Asia subject to one or more public shareholder demands more than doubled over the past two years to reach 31 in 2015, with nearly half successful, up from 30 percent a year earlier.  More than 65 percent of cases were instigated by overseas investors, according to Activist Insight, with U.S. fund Elliot Associates' ultimately unsuccessful move to challenge restructuring at South Korea's Samsung Group and Oasis Management's action tackling Japanese technology firm Kyocera Corp (6971.T) and videogame maker Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T) among recent high-profile campaigns.BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  Typically, much investor activism takes place behind closed doors, especially in Asia where there is a cultural aversion to public confrontation. As Asian companies are often closely held, it is much tougher to successfully push for change in some markets in the region.

G-Resources, which has said it would use the proceeds to shift its focus to financial services, reported after market hours that the sale was approved by a 59 percent majority.BlackRock's campaign, albeit unsuccessful, highlights how investors are becoming more active in seeking out better returns in Asia amid ultra-low interest rates and sluggish global growth.

But the company's own calculations of Fink's pay show his compensation flat for 2015. The calculations vary because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year, according to the filing.BlackRock's filing also shows the company will face an unusual test of its oversight of CEO pay at other companies, where its funds are often large investors and routinely vote in favor of their executive compensation.Fink's pay included a $900,000 salary, a bonus of $8.7 million, nearly $16 million in stock awards and $193,000 in ""other"" compensation, according to that calculation. BlackRock President Rob Kapito was paid $20 million, the filing said. Fink, 63, and Kapito, 59, were among BlackRock's founders in 1988.Last year was difficult for money management firms, which were whipsawed by volatile capital markets. The BlackRock board committee that analyzes compensation concluded among other factors that the company's share of key markets increased and that the company showed ""strong and consistent financial results despite a challenging"" environment, according to the filing.BlackRock's stock traded nearly 5 percent lower at the end of 2015 than at the end of 2014, while a grouping of such companies measured by the Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index .DJUSAG fell by 12 percent.

Separately, a proxy resolution on which BlackRock's investors will vote this year calls on the company to report on its own proxy-voting practices, citing among other things that BlackRock supports CEO pay more often than other investment managers.In Friday's filing BlackRock's directors urged investors to vote against the proposal, calling it unnecessary since the company already discloses much about how its Stewardship Team determines votes and that such a proposal could ""threaten the independence"" of that team.

507,"   By Faith Hung | TAIPEI  TAIPEI A battle among brothers for control of one of Taiwan's biggest conglomerates boiled over into the public domain last week when EVA Airways ejected its chairman. Now investors in a rising star among Asian airlines fear they, too, may get burned.Chang Kuo-Wei, also a pilot for a carrier he had led since 2013, had just flown an EVA jet to Singapore when he was ousted at a March 11 board meeting called by his three older brothers, according to an EVA spokesman and Chang's lawyer. No reason for the move was given when EVA announced it later that day. At stake for the Chang family is control of shipping and transport giant Evergreen Group, whose founder and patriarch Chang Yung-fa died in January. For institutions invested in EVA, like the Vanguard Group and BlackRock, the question is simpler: will the $2 billion airline stick to long-haul expansion plans and record new jet orders mapped out by its former boss?""Investing in a company is investing in its leader,"" said a fund manager at one of EVA's top 30 investors who declined to be identified by name. ""You buy Hon Hai Precision shares because of (Foxconn founder) Terry Gou. You buy EVA stocks because of Chang Kuo-wei."" Widely referred to as 'KW', Chang Kuo-Wei wasn't available for comment. His lawyer, Daniel Song, said the 46-year-old who steered the carrier's recent strategy - including intensifying a livery and design tie-up with the 'Hello Kitty' cartoon character - is now ""taking a rest"" at an undisclosed location. Chang has no plans to seek reinstatement at the carrier, in which he has a personal stake of about 12 percent, the lawyer said, but is taking legal action over broader issues surrounding the Chang family fortune. EVA accounts for the bulk of Evergreen's profit amid a downturn in the shipping industry. Officials at EVA and Evergreen said the other Chang brothers could not be reached, and would not want to comment on family business. After shedding as much as 5 percent after the departure, shares in the firm, in which Chang and his brothers own 44.5 percent in total, are now just 2 percent below their March 11 close as EVA pledges continuity. ""EVA has been around for 25 years,"" said EVA spokesman Golden Kou. ""What it has accomplished and its employees have delivered will not be affected."" 'HELLO KITTY' BOOST  Still, some investors said new chairman Steve Lin, a company veteran, and the Chang family will need to reassure the market.""Foreign investors are worried,"" said the fund manager at a top-30 EVA investor. ""They are concerned that EVA without Chang (Kuo-Wei) would not be able to go further than it has achieved."" Institutional investors hold just over 10 percent of EVA stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. BlackRock declined to comment while Vanguard could not be reached for comment. Since Chang Yung-fa's death, his four sons have been at loggerheads. The three eldest brothers, sons of the patriarch's first wife, dispute a will that Chang Kuo-Wei - son of his father's second wife - said last month gives him Chang Yung-fa's entire fortune, including cash, properties and shares.   Beyond EVA, the group includes Asia's largest container fleet through Evergreen Marine, catering businesses, air cargo operations and a hotel chain. Domestic media estimate Evergreen's assets at more than T$400 billion ($12 billion) in total. With Chang Kuo-Wei at the helm, EVA has risen to become a major player in the growing trans-Pacific market in recent years, using Taipei as a hub for passengers traveling from Southeast Asia and China to destinations like Los Angeles and Houston. The tieup with Japan's Sanrio Corp's 'Hello Kitty' character helped spread its brand internationally.It joined the Star Alliance group of carriers in 2013 and placed an $8 billion order, its biggest ever, for 26 Boeing widebody jets in 2015. One of the incoming chairman's first tasks in public is likely to be presenting the airline's fourth-quarter 2015 results, due within the next few weeks. Beyond the numbers, EVA can expect questions from shareholders on the leadership shake-up and plans in the post-'KW' era.""Their new management has not told us what they are going to do,"" said an official at one of the company's top 20 investors, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said he would be watching closely for any potential threat to EVA's ""impressive performance"".

514,"  * BlackRock, Pimco among fund firms suing central bank* Follows writing off of Novo debt worth nearly 2 bln euros* BlackRock says mutual fund savers discriminated againstBy Simon Jessop and Andrei KhalipLONDON/LISBON, April 5 A group of 14 asset managers have started legal action against the Portuguese Central Bank over heavy losses on nearly 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of bonds in Novo Banco, the bank created from the remains of Banco Espirito Santo, court documents showed.The group, which includes BlackRock and Pimco, said the central bank acted improperly when it moved five bonds from Novo Banco to Banco Espirito Santo in late 2015, which resulted in the value of the bonds being written down. After trading at par prior to the central bank decision, the bonds then sold off to around 15 cents on the euro by mid-January, for a combined worth of just 300 million euros.The decision to move the bonds from 'good bank' Novo Banco to the remaining 'bad bank' of Banco Espirito Santo, following the latter's collapse as a listed firm in 2014, was taken after European regulators flagged up a capital shortfall in Novo Banco.The central bank chose to move the five high-denomination bond issues to BES on the basis that their face value meant they were bought by savvy institutional investors rather than ordinary retail investors. The bondholder group, however, say this discriminates against their mutual fund clients, many of whom were retail investors or pension plans, whose ultimate beneficiaries are individuals.""As a fiduciary, BlackRock has chosen to participate in this suit because it is in the best interests of our clients that own these bonds,"" a spokesman for the company said in emailed comments. ""The Bank of Portugal's actions have resulted in money being unfairly taken out of the pockets of individual pensioners and savers, to benefit Novo Banco.""The bondholder group filed an administrative challenge in the Circle Administrative Court of Lisbon on March 29, court documents showed, without giving details.Nearly 30 separate cases have so far been filed by investors seeking redress for losses suffered as a result of the bond transfer, court documents showed.The Bank of Portugal declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.The creation of the institutional bondholder group was reported in January by IFR.

516,"   By Tariro Mzezewa | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A new U.S. rule protecting retirement funds from commission-paid brokers could be good for roboadvisers, a fast-growing sector that manages money with algorithms who may collect new clients fired by other firms because their accounts are too small.While it is not clear how much money is at risk of leaving bigger firms because of the new rule, industry trade groups say the costs of compliance will be high.Individuals with meager retirement savings or small businesses who offer 401(k) plans could get the boot from big brokerage firms because the revenue they generate is not worth the expense.The fiduciary rule, aimed at ensuring that brokers put clients' best interests ahead of their own profits when advising on retirement funds, was released last week and requires all retirement plan advisors to be completely compliant by the end of 2017.Roboadvisers like Wealthfront, Betterment and Aspiration said they are in a position to scoop up business that has been tossed aside by larger brokerage firms.""To the extent that this rule starts undermining the business models for incumbents, it absolutely opens the door for innovators,"" said Andrei Cherny, chief executive of Aspiration.At Betterment there is no minimum balance required, while Aspiration clients determine their own fees based on what they think is fair. Wealthfront's minimum balance is $500.Roboadvisers have lower costs and offer smaller fees than traditional firms partly because they do not have to pay an army of brokers to sell their products.The Labor Department predicts the broader wealth management industry will face up to $31.5 billion in additional compliance costs due to the fiduciary rule over the next decade. A Department of Labor official said roboadvisers must comply with the rule just as human advisers do. But these firms already adhere to a fiduciary standard set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which means costs and fees may not go up in the same way.Arjun Saxena, a consultant who deals with wealth and asset management firms at PricewaterhouseCoopers, called the fiduciary rule ""a big win for digital and online advice.""    ""Many of the larger firms do have a great deal of smaller clients,"" said Saxena.Some traditional firms may end up partnering with roboadvisers to offer low-cost services instead of pushing clients out the door, he added. Mike Sha, chief executive officer and co-founder of roboadviser SigFig Wealth Management LLC, said roboadvisers are keen on those kind of partnerships as well.""One way to drive up scale is to partner with traditional financial institutions that already have a trusted name and brand,"" he said.FIDUCIARY SHIFT     When the Labor Department first started crafting its fiduciary rule in 2010, roboadvisers were barely a gleam in the industry's eye. Although the idea has been around for more than a decade, it has only gained traction the past few years. The industry now oversees $100 billion in assets, or about 3 percent of the wealth management industry, according to Deloitte Consulting. By 2025, Deloitte predicts the industry will manage between $5 trillion and $7 trillion, representing 10 to 15 percent of U.S. retail assets under management.Betterment and Wealthfront are the most prominent roboadvisers, and came on the scene in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Since then, competitors like Aspiration and Vanguard's Personal Advisor Service platform have also sprung up. Firms including Charles Schwab, Bank of America Corp, BlackRock Inc, and Goldman Sachs Group have either acquired stakes in or developed their own in-house robocompetitors as well.The wealth management industry has broadly gravitated toward a fiduciary standard in recent years, driven by client preferences and fee pressure as much as expectations that rules would get stiffer.The biggest wealth management firms inside Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co and UBS AG have been shifting client assets from ""transactional"" brokerage accounts, which generate fees by trading frequently, to fiduciary accounts that charge a flat fee regardless of how often they trade.Firms hit hardest by the Labor Department rule are smaller ones that still have a healthy number of transactional accounts, like LPL Financial Holdings Inc, analysts said. Insurers may also face pressure when it comes to selling certain annuities that face restrictions.A spokesman for LPL Financial said the firm will not be one of the hardest hit and about 40 percent of overall assets are fee-based, and roughly two-thirds of new assets are fee-based.

519,"   By Andy Home | LONDON  LONDON (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) Do you remember JPMorgan's Physical Copper Trust? Registered in October 2010 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was probably one of the most controversial commodity investment vehicles ever conceived.Although structured as a publicly-traded stock offering, it was to be backed by physical copper, 61,800 tonnes of it. Within days BlackRock had filed for an identical product almost twice the size with an implied holding of 121,000 tonnes.Copper manufacturers were outraged at the concept of nebulous ""investors"" stepping into the physical supply chain and several of them fought a two-year rearguard action in the courts to block it. That action was ultimately unsuccessful. But by the time the SEC approved both products in late 2012, the investment tide had already turned. The initial boom in commodities investment had turned to bust, leaving a long trail of fund casualties in its wake. A new boom is currently building momentum but it's a boom of a completely different kind, a reminder that investment trends in metals such as copper follow their own cycle, one which can interact in price in unexpected ways. Link to my presentation at the Thomson Reuters GFMS seminar at CESCO Week in Santiago, Chile: tmsnrt.rs/1Q49nEYBOOM (PART 1) With hindsight JPMorgan and BlackRock's physical copper funds represented the high-water mark of the first boom in commodities investment. Money was pouring into the sector, $71 billion of it in 2009 and $91 billion in 2010, according to estimates from Barclays Capital. Heavy-weight pension funds such as The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) had been experimenting with the commodities sector since 2006, Commodities, the idea went, behaved differently from stocks and bonds and therefore acted both as stabilizers in a broader portfolio and as a built-in inflationary hedge. The trickle of initial investment, however, turned into a deluge in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. Central banks changed the rules of the previous investment game, offering both stick and carrot for fund managers to invest in commodities. In the developed world zero interest rates and quantitative easing wreaked havoc on returns on cash and bonds, both bedrock components of most big funds' portfolios. China, meanwhile, was so alarmed at the contraction in exports that it unleashed a massive infrastructure stimulus, stimulating prices across the commodities spectrum. Nuanced academic arguments on portfolio diversification were swamped in the general stampede to move money out of non-performing assets into rising commodities.  Those two physical copper funds were conceived as a way of tapping into that surge in interest, aimed as they were at the most conservative of U.S. pension funds, those prohibited from investing in anything other than U.S. listed stocks. BUST However, by the time that the SEC gave its formal seal of approval to JPMorgan's physical copper trust in December 2012, the rationale for investing in commodities was already unraveling. The copper price peaked at $10,190 per ton in February 2011. By December 2012 it had fallen below $8,000 per ton, undermining the appeal of what was in essence a bull-market product. It wasn't just copper. As the tail winds of Chinese stimulus faded, the entire industrial commodities sector was topping out, bringing an end to what had been a one-way bet since the start of 2009. At a deeper level early experimenters such as CalPERS were finding that commodities were not behaving as expected. The years 2009-2011 were characterized by the risk-on-risk-off trade with every part of the risk universe moving in lock-step. And by the time that changed, it was to the detriment of commodities, which started falling even while stock indices were still rising. Assets under management in the commodities space peaked at $451 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Barclays. Under the double impact of collapsing prices and disinvestment the figure had fallen to just $160 billion at the end of last year, the lowest level since 2007.  Did the mass exit by fund managers exacerbate the collapse in prices? It depends on whether you believe the original investment boom was a driver of rising prices in 2009-2010. Disentangling cause and correlation is nigh impossible and the whole topic is still a subject of heated debate. But it is worth considering that the outflow of money from the base metals complex may have translated into the loss of over 600,000 tonnes of continuously rolling long positioning by funds invested in a commodity index such as Goldman Sachs' GSCI. BOOM (PART II) Just as investment interest in commodities was dwindling in the developed world, it was about to flourish in a completely different form in a completely different place. The London Metal Exchange copper price plunged over 11 percent over the course of just two days in January 2015. It did so because of a wave of selling emanating from the Shanghai Futures Exchange, where market open interest hit an all-time high and volumes were the second highest on record. Overnight the rest of the market woke up to the existence of  little-known Chinese hedge funds such as the exotically named Shanghai Chaos.  Unlike their Western counterparts, who had been drawn into commodities on the long side via broad-based commodity indices, these new players showed they could aggressively play markets from the short side.And they returned to attack the copper market in both July and November of last year. Indeed, by November, it wasn't just copper that was being hit. Both Shanghai aluminum and zinc contracts saw mass bear raids with volumes and open interest spiking to previously unseen levels. Aluminum was particularly interesting since the Shanghai contract had historically been relatively low in liquidity relative to copper.

THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN There's still considerable uncertainty to what exactly is taking place on China's commodity exchanges. But the argument that retail players are getting involved was strengthened this year when trading volumes in Shanghai steel contracts and the Dalian iron ore contract went supernova. The price of iron ore surged by 20 percent in a single-day, on March 8, and it did so amid an explosion of trading volume on the Dalian exchange.One of the most physically-rooted commodities, it seems, was dragged sharply higher by speculative trading flows. It's a new phenomenon for commodity markets, where investment has in the past been largely confined to professional fund managers. High entry thresholds, particularly on the LME itself, have locked out all but the very wealthiest man in the street. And it's happening just as Western fund managers are starting to dip their toes in the commodity waters again. Barclays estimates that more than $20 billion flowed into commodities in January and February this year, the strongest start to any year since 2011.Most of that investment went into precious metals and the energy sector, but if it is the start of a larger (re-)investment trend, it will only be a matter of time before the trickle-down effect washes into the base metals sector. And who knows? Maybe the dust will be blown off those filings for physical copper funds at some stage in the future. After all, a long-only physically-backed copper investment to ultra-conservative pension fund managers may be a much easier sell now than it was back in December 2012.

520,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Andy HomeLONDON, April 12 Do you remember JPMorgan's Physical Copper Trust?Registered in October 2010 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was probably one of the most controversial commodity investment vehicles ever conceived.Although structured as a publicly-traded stock offering, it was to be backed by physical copper, 61,800 tonnes of it. Within days BlackRock had filed for an identical product almost twice the size with an implied holding of 121,000 tonnes.Copper manufacturers were outraged at the concept of nebulous ""investors"" stepping into the physical supply chain and several of them fought a two-year rearguard action in the courts to block it.That action was ultimately unsuccessful. But by the time the SEC approved both products in late 2012, the investment tide had already turned.The initial boom in commodities investment had turned to bust, leaving a long trail of fund casualties in its wake.A new boom is currently building momentum but it's a boom of a completely different kind, a reminder that investment trends in metals such as copper follow their own cycle, one which can interact in price in unexpected ways.Link to my presentation at the Thomson Reuters GFMS seminar at CESCO Week in Santiago, Chile: tmsnrt.rs/1Q49nEYBOOM (PART 1) With hindsight JPMorgan and BlackRock's physical copper funds represented the high-water mark of the first boom in commodities investment.Money was pouring into the sector, $71 billion of it in 2009 and $91 billion in 2010, according to estimates from Barclays Capital.Heavy-weight pension funds such as The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) had been experimenting with the commodities sector since 2006, Commodities, the idea went, behaved differently from stocks and bonds and therefore acted both as stabilizers in a broader portfolio and as a built-in inflationary hedge.The trickle of initial investment, however, turned into a deluge in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.Central banks changed the rules of the previous investment game, offering both stick and carrot for fund managers to invest in commodities.In the developed world zero interest rates and quantitative easing wreaked havoc on returns on cash and bonds, both bedrock components of most big funds' portfolios.China, meanwhile, was so alarmed at the contraction in exports that it unleashed a massive infrastructure stimulus, stimulating prices across the commodities spectrum. Nuanced academic arguments on portfolio diversification were swamped in the general stampede to move money out of non-performing assets into rising commodities.Those two physical copper funds were conceived as a way of tapping into that surge in interest, aimed as they were at the most conservative of U.S. pension funds, those prohibited from investing in anything other than U.S. listed stocks.BUST However, by the time that the SEC gave its formal seal of approval to JPMorgan's physical copper trust in December 2012, the rationale for investing in commodities was already unraveling.The copper price peaked at $10,190 per tonne in February 2011. By December 2012 it had fallen below $8,000 per tonne, undermining the appeal of what was in essence a bull-market product.It wasn't just copper. As the tail winds of Chinese stimulus faded, the entire industrial commodities sector was topping out, bringing an end to what had been a one-way bet since the start of 2009.At a deeper level early experimenters such as CalPERS were finding that commodities were not behaving as expected. The years 2009-2011 were characterised by the risk-on-risk-off trade with every part of the risk universe moving in lock-step.And by the time that changed, it was to the detriment of commodities, which started falling even while stock indices were still rising.Assets under management in the commodities space peaked at $451 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Barclays. Under the double impact of collapsing prices and disinvestment the figure had fallen to just $160 billion at the end of last year, the lowest level since 2007.Did the mass exit by fund managers exacerbate the collapse in prices? It depends on whether you believe the original investment boom was a driver of rising prices in 2009-2010.Disentangling cause and correlation is nigh impossible and the whole topic is still a subject of heated debate.But it is worth considering that the outflow of money from the base metals complex may have translated into the loss of over 600,000 tonnes of continuously rolling long positioning by funds invested in a commodity index such as Goldman Sachs' GSCI.BOOM (PART II) Just as investment interest in commodities was dwindling in the developed world, it was about to flourish in a completely different form in a completely different place.The London Metal Exchange copper price plunged over 11 percent over the course of just two days in January 2015.It did so because of a wave of selling emanating from the Shanghai Futures Exchange, where market open interest hit an all-time high and volumes were the second highest on record. Overnight the rest of the market woke up to the existence of  little-known Chinese hedge funds such as the exotically named Shanghai Chaos.Unlike their Western counterparts, who had been drawn into commodities on the long side via broad-based commodity indices, these new players showed they could aggressively play markets from the short side.And they returned to attack the copper market in both July and November of last year.Indeed, by November, it wasn't just copper that was being hit. Both Shanghai aluminium and zinc contracts saw mass bear raids with volumes and open interest spiking to previously unseen levels. Aluminium was particularly interesting since the Shanghai contract had historically been relatively low in liquidity relative to copper.In both cases the bear attacks lasted only a few days, suggesting a retail crowd surge that may have been looking for new ways to express a negative view on the Chinese growth story after Beijing clamped down on ""malicious short-selling"" on Chinese stock markets in July last year.Five years after JPMorgan and BlackRock dreamt of bringing metals to the masses via their pension fund managers, the masses in China appear to have found their own path to commodity markets.THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN There's still considerable uncertainty to what exactly is taking place on China's commodity exchanges.But the argument that retail players are getting involved was strengthened this year when trading volumes in Shanghai steel contracts and the Dalian iron ore contract went supernova.The price of iron ore surged by 20 percent in a single-day, on March 8, and it did so amid an explosion of trading volume on the Dalian exchange.One of the most physically-rooted commodities, it seems, was dragged sharply higher by speculative trading flows.It's a new phenomenon for commodity markets, where investment has in the past been largely confined to professional fund managers.

531,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Oi SA (OIBR3.SA) on Monday formally started talks to restructure $14.3 billion of bonds, pitting some of the world's biggest investors against each other as Brazil's most-indebted phone carrier fights for its survival.In a securities filing, Oi said a group of bondholders that have Moelis & Co as their advisor signed a non-disclosure agreement to join talks. Reuters, citing sources, said the group of over 25 investment firms including BlackRock Inc, Citadel LLC and Pacific Investment Management Co, could sign the accord as early as Monday.The decision to begin talks with the Moelis-advised group leaves unclear how, or whether, Oi will negotiate with other creditors such as hedge funds that have bought credit default swaps linked to Oi's bonds. The carrier wants to negotiate with bondholders who ""care about the company's future,"" one of those sources told Reuters.At stake is the fate of Oi, the byproduct of a state-sponsored merger eight years ago and the only Brazilian carrier controlled by domestic capital. Shareholders see a restructuring facilitating a potential takeover of Oi, which they say could help narrow the gap with rivals controlled by Spain's Telefónica SA and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's América Móvil SAB.Oi ""intends to conclude the ongoing restructuring process promptly, as it believes that conducting negotiations with a sole steering committee representing the company's bondholders will make the process more agile,"" the filing said.Shares posted their biggest intraday jump in 23 years on Monday, on hopes the tack could speed Oi's turnaround. Nonvoting shares (OIBR4.SA) rallied 28 percent to 1.18 reais, helping pare the stock's 53 percent slump this year.  Still, a disparate base of creditors, the multiple currencies of issuance and a complex debt structure in which liabilities from several units are consolidated at the holding company level, could make a quick resolution hard, said Francisco Velasco, a fixed-income analyst with Exotix Partners.Oi's restructuring would be Latin America's second-biggest ever, behind a $15 billion debt overhaul by Mexican cement maker Cemex SAB in 2009, data compiled by Thomson Reuters showed. It would also dwarf the $5.2 billion restructuring of former billionaire Eike Batista's OGX Petróleo e Gás SA two years ago, heretofore the largest such deal in the country.""Different investors could embrace different strategies, making this situation like a four-player chess game in which you won't understand anybody's strategy until the very last minute,"" said Paolo Gorgó, an Italy-based investor who analyzes distressed debt and turnaround cases for several newsletters.Both Oi and New York-based PJT Partners Inc, which was hired in February to oversee the restructuring, declined to comment. According to the filing, law firms Barbosa Müssnich & Aragão and White & Case LLP were brought in as Oi's legal consultants. UNSUSTAINABLE At 54.9 billion reais ($15.4 billion), Oi's gross debt looks unsustainable at this point, with almost half of it maturing by the end of 2017. Debt-servicing also poses a challenge for Oi, whose debt is 75 percent denominated in currencies other than the Brazilian real, which fell 16 percent against the U.S. dollar over the past two years.Oi has almost 200 different bondholders spanning from Brazil and the United States to Switzerland and Chile. About ten bond firms who did not join the Moelis-advised group have hired Houlihan Lokey Inc to form their own, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.Negotiations ""will not be easy as there is the potential for high inter-creditor conflict, with different types of creditors looking to make the most for themselves, for which the process could be extended in time,"" Exotix's Velasco said. With the widespread notion that Oi's equity is worthless, creditors may also seek to thwart any deal aiming to protect shareholders. The price on the May 2020 issued by Oi's Portugal Telecom Intl Finance BV subsidiary XS092758184=1M accelerated losses on the news. The security shed 0.07 cent on the dollar to 27 cents on Monday.The cost of insuring the Oi subsidiary's bonds for one year through credit default swaps BRTO1YUSAC=MP were unchanged on Monday at $620,000 per every $1 million of principal protected.CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS  Creditors whose positions in credit swaps surpass their bondholdings by a large margin have an incentive to disrupt talks or trigger events that could force Oi into a default, Gorgó and other analysts said.According to the sources, the amount of net notional positions on Oi's CDS is around $1 billion. Some creditors identified billionaire Paul Singer's Elliot Management Corp, the fund that recently won a $4.7 billion, 13-year defaulted debt battle with Argentina, as one buyer of Oi's CDS. A spokesman for New York-based Elliot declined to comment.Bloomberg News reported last week that Oi feared that some bondholders who bought CDS were trying to push it into default. Lawyers for Oi were looking for ways to offset plans by those investors, the report said.Other elements could also turn negotiations even more protracted, bondholders and analysts said. Brazil's harshest recession in a century, and a political crisis that has delayed a long-sought overhaul in industry rules that would eventually favor Oi, may discourage bondholders from giving the company further breathing room. The revamped laws could significantly reduce Oi's mandatory capital spending in fixed-line telephony, where the company loses money on a regular basis.

537,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc is accelerating its push in Latin America, making plans for its first launch of a private equity infrastructure fund targeting that market, a company document showed.The launch is anticipated this year, according to the document, an infrastructure investing plan seen by Reuters on Monday.Such funds typically target large investors who can lock up their initial investments for a decade or more. The size of the fund was not disclosed, and BlackRock declined to comment. Since its acquisition of Mexican investment company Infraestructura Institucional last year, BlackRock has said it has $1 billion committed by investors and plans to invest broadly across the energy, utility, transportation and communication infrastructure sectors in the region, especially in Mexico. BlackRock started its infrastructure unit in 2011, and more recently has focused on growth in Latin America. The unit oversees physical property as well as relationships, from construction sub-contractors to government officials.To date, the unit has been known for specializing in renewable-energy projects and being rooted in developed markets in Europe, the United States and Asia. The company has about $9 billion in infrastructure assets under management overall.The firm has expanded, hiring foreign executives, including Manuel Sanchez, the former chief executive of Spanish renewable energy company Abengoa. BlackRock now has 26 people currently assigned in the Latin America infrastructure effort. In its expansion south, BlackRock expects more government policy reforms of the sort that ended Mexico's decades-old state energy monopoly across the Americas. Mexico's economy grew more quickly than expected in the first quarter this year, preliminary data showed last month, after uneven U.S. demand and sinking oil prices shook the economy in 2015.Company executives have said they expect large investors, including pension funds, to boost their stakes in investments such as railroads, pipelines and wind farms in the hope that they will return a stream of cash for pensioners and other investors. In addition to expanding its Mexico City-based team, BlackRock last year took a joint stake worth around $900 million in a Mexican natural-gas pipeline project with U.S. private equity company First Reserve that is expected to start operating this year.It is also looking at expanding to other countries, such as Colombia, Peru and Chile, company officials have said. New York-based BlackRock managed $4.7 trillion overall as of March 31.

553,"  OSLO A Norwegian group of climate scientists will form an alliance on Thursday with investors including BlackRock Inc and the World Bank to try to assess the financial risks of rising global temperatures.The Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo (CICERO) said it wanted to help investors judge risks from global warming such as more heatwaves, floods, downpours, the extinction of animals and plants and rising seas.The head of CICERO, Kristin Halvorsen, said the aim was to help investors and researchers to ""understand each other more easily so that the financial sector can define climate risks"".""We speak very different languages. Research and investment are two different worlds,"" Halvorsen, a former Norwegian finance minister, told Reuters on Wednesday, noting that the financial sector's main concern was the return on its investments.Representatives of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, World Bank Treasury, Swedish pension fund AP2, Nordic bank SEB and Norwegian bank DNB would be among those on an advisory board for the CICERO Climate Finance project, to be launched on Thursday. The first meeting would work to define common projects. Some investors, for instance, are pulling out of companies that mine or generate power from coal, reckoning that reserves of coal will steadily lose value from a shift to cleaner energies.And extreme events such as wildfires, heatwaves or floods can disrupt investments in infrastructure, ranging from road bridges to oil pipelines. But it is hard to assess risks for individual places. ""If extreme events become more frequent, what does that mean for infrastructure?"" said Christa Clapp of CICERO, an expert in assessing the environmental quality of green bonds.Ulrika Danielson, spokeswoman for AP2 which has about 300 billion Swedish crowns ($36.19 billion) under management, welcomed the plan to do more to unite research and investment. ""We look at climate change as a risk in our portfolio,"" she said.Halvorsen said interest from investors to learn about climate change had risen after 195 nations agreed a global deal in Paris last December to combat climate change, shifting the global economy from fossil fuels.

554,"   By Matt Scuffham and Trevor Hunnicutt | TORONTO/NEW YORK  TORONTO/NEW YORK BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, has recruited the head of Canada's biggest public pension fund to become the top executive overseeing its stock-picking operations.Wiseman, 45, who has transformed the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) into one of the world's most active dealmakers over the past four years, will step down next month and become head of BlackRock's global active equity business in September. Wiseman will be replaced by Mark Machin, the head of CPPIB's international operations.Wiseman will become a member of BlackRock's Global Executive Committee, an exclusive club of fewer than two-dozen senior deputies to BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito.He will be one of a much smaller subset of those people with oversight over investing teams, taking over a group within the executive committee focused on investments, according to a statement.He will also oversee some 350 portfolio managers and other staff responsible for $275 billion in investments. New York-based BlackRock managed $4.7 trillion on March 31.Fink has been working with Wiseman on a group called Focusing Capital on the Long Term, which has advocated that institutions invest more of their money with companies whose executives show a dedication to long-term success, rather than appeasing markets every quarter.Wiseman joins the company during an unsettled period for active money managers. Markets and a trend toward low-cost passive investing have conspired to make the business of managing and selling actively managed stock funds a zero-sum game. BlackRock's relative investment performance slipped last quarter, according to its own metrics.In a bid to boost its performance, BlackRock has scoured the industry for top managers and invested in technology, as well as what it calls a ""scientific"" active equity business that mines reams of data for insight on which stocks to pick. During a reshuffling announced in January, Fink and Kapito combined the previously separate scientific and ""fundamental"" teams under four managers after the departures of their two prior leaders. A sign of how much of a priority the unit is for the company, the unit's leaders since then - Chris Jones, Nigel Bolton, Raffaele Savi and Jeff Shen - reported directly to Kapito. Bolton, Savi and Shen will become co-chief investment officers of the unit, while Jones is leaving BlackRock, a spokesman said.While BlackRock benefits from the low-cost trend through its index funds and a booming iShares exchange-traded funds franchise, those strategies can be less profitable.Wiseman will also become chairman of BlackRock Alternative Investors, a smaller, but highly-lucrative group of BlackRock investments, including its hedge funds and infrastructure business.Under Wiseman's leadership, CPPIB has increased its exposure to those kinds of assets to counter volatile markets and low-yielding government bonds. BlackRock's alternatives business will still be run day-to-day by Mark McCombe, another senior managing director, and his colleague Matt Botein, but BlackRock said in a statement that Wiseman will help develop new investment strategies and clients. Wiseman will join a list of potential long-term successors to Fink, 63, but said that had not been a factor in his decision to leave CPPIB. He added that his decision to leave CPPIB had been ""incredibly difficult"".CPPIB STRATEGY UNCHANGED Wiseman has raised the global profile of CPPIB, turning it into one of the first ports of call for investment bankers selling assets. He has overseen a broad range of investments abroad, including the $12 billion acquisition of GE Capital's private equity lending portfolio.

555,"   By Matt Scuffham and Trevor Hunnicutt | TORONTO/NEW YORK  TORONTO/NEW YORK BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, has recruited the head of Canada's biggest public pension fund to become the top executive overseeing its stock-picking operations.Wiseman, 45, who has transformed the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) into one of the world's most active dealmakers over the past four years, will step down next month and become head of BlackRock's global active equity business in September. Wiseman will be replaced by Mark Machin, the head of CPPIB's international operations.Wiseman will become a member of BlackRock's Global Executive Committee, an exclusive club of fewer than two-dozen senior deputies to BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito.He will be one of a much smaller subset of those people with oversight over investing teams, taking over a group within the executive committee focused on investments, according to a statement.He will also oversee some 350 portfolio managers and other staff responsible for $275 billion in investments. New York-based BlackRock managed $4.7 trillion on March 31.Fink has been working with Wiseman on a group called Focusing Capital on the Long Term, which has advocated that institutions invest more of their money with companies whose executives show a dedication to long-term success, rather than appeasing markets every quarter.Wiseman joins the company during an unsettled period for active money managers. Markets and a trend toward low-cost passive investing have conspired to make the business of managing and selling actively managed stock funds a zero-sum game. BlackRock's relative investment performance slipped last quarter, according to its own metrics.In a bid to boost its performance, BlackRock has scoured the industry for top managers and invested in technology, as well as what it calls a ""scientific"" active equity business that mines reams of data for insight on which stocks to pick. During a reshuffling announced in January, Fink and Kapito combined the previously separate scientific and ""fundamental"" teams under four managers after the departures of their two prior leaders. A sign of how much of a priority the unit is for the company, the unit's leaders since then - Chris Jones, Nigel Bolton, Raffaele Savi and Jeff Shen - reported directly to Kapito. Bolton, Savi and Shen will become co-chief investment officers of the unit, while Jones is leaving BlackRock, a spokesman said.While BlackRock benefits from the low-cost trend through its index funds and a booming iShares exchange-traded funds franchise, those strategies can be less profitable.Wiseman will also become chairman of BlackRock Alternative Investors, a smaller, but highly-lucrative group of BlackRock investments, including its hedge funds and infrastructure business.Under Wiseman's leadership, CPPIB has increased its exposure to those kinds of assets to counter volatile markets and low-yielding government bonds. BlackRock's alternatives business will still be run day-to-day by Mark McCombe, another senior managing director, and his colleague Matt Botein, but BlackRock said in a statement that Wiseman will help develop new investment strategies and clients. Wiseman will join a list of potential long-term successors to Fink, 63, but said that had not been a factor in his decision to leave CPPIB. He added that his decision to leave CPPIB had been ""incredibly difficult"".CPPIB STRATEGY UNCHANGED Wiseman has raised the global profile of CPPIB, turning it into one of the first ports of call for investment bankers selling assets. He has overseen a broad range of investments abroad, including the $12 billion acquisition of GE Capital's private equity lending portfolio. He is also a passionate advocate of long-term investment strategies. Machin, Wiseman's replacement, joined CPPIB in 2012 after spending two decades at Goldman Sachs, spear-heading their operations in Asia before departing the investment bank.Machin said his appointment will not result in any change in strategy for the institution.""I was one of the senior team who developed the strategy.

Active equity is the BlackRock business with portfolio managers who pick stocks.The move comes days after the world's largest asset manager announced that it recruited Mark Wiseman, the head of Canada's biggest public pension fund. Wiseman will oversee the stock-picking team's operations when he joins in September as head of BlackRock's Global Active Equity business.The team includes some 350 portfolio managers and other staff responsible for $275 billion in investments.

Gamba is credited with expanding demand for ETFs among BlackRock's rival asset managers, pensions and other large groups.Two institutional sales deputies, Hilary Corman and Ravi Goutam, will take over as interim co-leaders of the iShares institutional business, the memo said.

It is also the largest single-tower real estate deal in Asia-Pacific, according to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.The selling price of S$2,700 ($1,980) per square foot for Asia Square Tower 1 in the city-state's financial district, has only been outdone by deals in London and Hong Kong, according to property consultant JLL, which was one of BlackRock's advisers on the transaction.The U.S. firm said the deal could mark a turning point for Singapore real estate and that gloomy views about the market were likely overdone.""Singapore as a home for capital is always very well regarded in the region,"" said John Saunders, head of Asia Pacific for BlackRock Real Estate.""So for those folks who have dry powder and are looking to invest, frankly ourselves included, I think a lot of people are looking at Singapore and saying this could be an interesting environment,"" he added.

574,"  (Adds details about Seventy Seven's retirement plan exposure to Chesapeake Energy shares, paragraphs 3-4)By Tom HalsJune 7 Oilfield services company Seventy Seven Energy Inc filed for a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday to carry out a plan to convert $1.1 billion of its debt into equity in a reorganized company.Seventy Seven offers drilling and hydraulic fracturing services and was spun out of Chesapeake Energy Corp in 2014.Several months after the spinoff, about 5,200 participants in Seventy Seven's retirement plan had $54.5 million, or about one-third of their investments, in Chesapeake shares, according to the 2014 annual report for the plan. Since the end of 2014, Chesapeake shares have dropped 76 percent, trading on Tuesday afternoon at $4.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. The slide in oil prices this year, which have plumbed their lowest levels in over a decade, has wiped out several billion dollars of retirement wealth in the energy sector in the past year. The losses may prove temporary for companies that successfully navigate the crisis, but tens of thousands of employees of struggling firms may see much of their nest eggs gone for good.Meanwhile, Seventy Seven said its creditors have already voted overwhelmingly in favor its plan, a process known as a prepackaged bankruptcy.""The successful completion of the solicitation process and today's filing represent the next step forward in our financial restructuring,"" Chief Executive Officer Jerry Winchester said. The bankruptcy comes as two years of depressed energy prices have forced scores of oil-and-gas producers into bankruptcy. Oil industry service companies have also suffered and on Monday contract drilling company Hercules Offshore Inc filed its second bankruptcy in a year.Oklahoma City-based Seventy Seven said its suppliers would be paid in full and operational contracts will remain in place. The company listed assets of $1.7 billion and debts of $1.8 billion, as of April 30, in documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.The company will seek to borrow up to $100 million to help finance operations during the bankruptcy, according to court documents.The two largest shareholders of Seventy Seven are Icahn Capital LP and BlackRock Inc, with stakes of 8.1 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, according to court filings.The company's plan would cancel its existing stock, which was up slightly at 7 cents in midday trade over the counter.

578,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Top BlackRock Inc investor Rick Rieder said on Tuesday he has been building up a stake in U.S. government debt even with the potential of an interest rate hike as early as July.Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at the world's largest asset management company, told Reuters he has been adding exposure to 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities over the last month.Yields on U.S. Treasuries are still higher than on many non-U.S. bonds, he said in an interview. ""Half the market is at negative interest rates. In a world of negative yield, U.S. 10 years look like a steal.""Rieder said markets have possibly underestimated the potential for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates in July, a move that would trim bonds' value. But Rieder puts the odds of such a hike at 20 to 25 percent. ""I think she's going to keep July on the table,"" Rieder said of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, noting that such a move would require strong employment numbers and no major disruptions from the June 23 British referendum on its European Union membership.But the Fed will struggle to engineer even one or two rate hikes this year, he said, in part because momentum in the labor market has slowed. U.S. economic data on Tuesday showed strong retail sales growth in May while a separate report showed a build-up of inflation pressures as import prices recorded their largest increase in just over four years.The data could influence Fed officials, who are gathering for two-day meeting which began on Tuesday, to tighten credit faster. New York-based BlackRock oversaw $1.5 trillion in fixed-income assets as of March 31. In addition to his role as chief investment officer for fixed income, Rieder manages assets that include the $29 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund .

584,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is using its access and leverage as a major shareholder in public companies to strike more client-winning deals with private companies, a top executive for the world's largest asset manager said on Friday.Because of its $1.1 trillion iShares exchange-traded funds business, where portfolios are designed to track market indexes, BlackRock holds a large position in most major U.S.-listed companies.Such a pervasive presence means that private companies, particularly those that harbor ambitions to go public and would like BlackRock as an investor, listen when the money manager pitches them a deal for a loan or an equity stake on behalf of its clients.""There is no CEO that doesn't return our call because typically we're up high on the shareholder register,"" Mark McCombe, global head of BlackRock's institutional client business, told Reuters reporters and editors attending the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit on Friday.""We are everybody's largest shareholder."" Over the last year, McCombe's team has been ramping up efforts to use that access to land more high-octane private credit and equity deals for clients that in the past might have used banks and boutique ""alternative"" investment managers.McCombe said BlackRock's push into the alternatives space, which includes investments in real estate and infrastructure, is ""indirectly related"" to banks pulling back from this type of business. Regulations introduced since the financial crisis, such as the Volcker Rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, have put restrictions on the ability of banks to make big bets with their own money investing in these sort of assets. Many banks have since backed away, paving the way for new entrants.McCombe offered as an example of this approach the joint $900 million stake his company and U.S. private equity company First Reserve took in a Mexican natural-gas pipeline project.The deal would not have been possible without BlackRock's relationship with Pemex, the state-controlled oil company, McCombe said at the Summit, held at the Reuters office in New York. The BlackRock ""alternatives"" unit - for which McCombe serves as a co-head - includes ventures ranging from hedge funds to private equity and infrastructure projects. It is a small unit for the company - accounting for just 3 percent of BlackRock's $4.4 trillion in ""long-term"" assets, excluding cash accounts. But alternatives punch above their weight, drawing 8 percent of BlackRock's fees, according to its latest quarterly earnings release.The New York-based BlackRock faces stiff competition in these alternative markets from private-equity funds, banks and other asset managers with longer-standing presences in those assets and international markets.

""My own view ... is that actually there is a lot of pent-up frustration with Europe, within some of the key countries, and that actually we’ve seen it with Austria, and Germany and France and so forth, and the rise of these parties, I think it will only strengthen their resolve.”Indeed, emboldened by a surge in voter support and Britain's looming EU referendum, Europe's leading far-right parties pledged on Friday to work towards a ""Patriotic Spring"" that would roll back EU powers and halt an influx of Middle East refugees. McCombe, who is British, said it was impossible to predict the result but that if it was a tight vote to remain in the EU, UK Prime Minister David Cameron could lose his job.""If it is 'remain' by 50.1 percent, I don't know if Cameron survives,"" he said, adding that the prime minister's decision to hold a referendum had been a ""massive own-goal"". Investors are bracing for volatile trading conditions, and particularly the prospect of sharp one-off moves in sterling GBP=D4, after the vote.McCombe said European equities would also come under pressure if Britons chose Brexit.""Which analyst in their right mind will say, 'oh this (a Brexit) is good news for Volkswagen'?

591,"  NEW YORK A top bond manager at BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said on Friday the Federal Reserve would likely leave U.S. interest rates alone for the rest of 2016 despite a surprisingly strong rebound in domestic hiring in June.Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, said the bigger-than-expected 287,000 gain in payrolls in June, the biggest in eight months, was not enough to alter his outlook that U.S. jobs growth would cool as the earlier strong pace of gains is unsustainable and corporate profits will likely weaken.Global risks including the fallout from Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the likelihood of more monetary stimulus from overseas central banks will also likely keep the Fed from raising rates this year, he said.

598,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. mutual-fund investors bought international stocks and riskier bonds during the latest week, reversing course after pulling the most cash this year from funds following the Brexit vote, Investment Company Institute data showed on Wednesday. ICI said investors added $2 billion to U.S.-based funds invested in developed-market stocks outside the country during the week ended July 6, after pulling $2.7 billion from the funds the week before in the funds' worst rout since 2011. The funds, invested in the United Kingdom, Germany and other advanced economies, have not pulled in that much money since the week that ended Feb. 24.U.S.-based junk-bond funds stanched withdrawals, taking in $82 million one week after investors wiped $3.4 billion from the funds' ledgers in their biggest weekly outflows this year, according to ICI.The week before, investors took the most money overall out of U.S.-based stock and bond mutual funds this year following the British vote to leave the European Union, launching a process called ""Brexit."" ""Equity investors are facing tough tradeoffs and decided to buy where there were temporary discounts caused by Brexit,"" said Matt Cody, co-chair of the investment committee at Wetherby Asset Management in New York.He said investors have the choice of investing in stocks after the S&P 500 hit a record high for the third consecutive day on Wednesday or buying bonds when the 10-year Treasury's yield is near record lows. Overall, U.S.-based equity funds recorded withdrawals of $3.1 billion during the week, while bond funds attracted $1.3 billion, according to ICI, a fund trade group. Domestic stock funds more than doubled their outflows from the week prior, to $4.5 billion, adding to a brutal year for mutual-fund managers who specialize in picking U.S. stocks. Even as investors from BlackRock Inc to DoubleLine Capital's Jeffrey Gundlach said they favored some buying in emerging markets, funds specializing in those stocks posted $610 million in outflows during the week. Global-bond funds posted $142 million in outflows, ICI data showed. ""We are completely out of global debt; we don't believe paying governments to lend them money is a good investment plan for our clients,"" said Cody. ""You can still get positive yield in emerging debt, but energy-price weakness and increasing sovereign-debt loads lead to risks outweighing the benefits.""

[nL4N1A03PB]Dividends and buybacks have helped the company sustain its venerated status on Wall Street and its stock price has risen 4.5 percent this year, compared to a Dow Jones peer-group benchmark .DJUSAG that has fallen 5.5 percent.""What we like most about it - it's very consistent. When the market goes through cycles, especially tough times, you'll see a lot of asset managers cut back,"" said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders. ""Larry and the management team is pretty consistent on delivering returns to investors."" BlackRock bought $275 million of its stock in the latest three-month period, roughly on par with its purchases for the last six quarters. BlackRock also paid $2.29 per share in dividends, up 5.0 percent from the year before.""Our whole focus is in investing in our future,"" Fink said. ""The stock repurchase component of that is a remainder. As we've gotten larger as an organization we have increased our stock repurchases.""Fink said the company continues to examine where to invest in addition to buying shares. Even as the company cut expenses and headcount earlier this year, Fink said the company will continue to hire and spend on areas of prospective growth, including on its technology service, Aladdin.

605,"   By Karolin Schaps and Dmitry Zhdannikov | LONDON  LONDON Distressed debt funds will become big shareholders in troubled oil firm Gulf Keystone (GKP.L) after bondholders agreed to swap $500 million of debt for equity, wiping out some of the world's top funds as shareholders.Gulf Keystone operates the giant Shaikan oil field in Iraqi Kurdistan and produces about 40,000 barrels per day (bpd).The firm has been fighting to avoid insolvency after low oil prices and overdue oil export payments from the Kurdistan regional government crippled its balance sheet.But the deal will also set the stage for a battle for control if its new shareholders decide to offload their stakes to a new strategic investor, which Gulf Keystone has been seeking.Shares in London-listed Gulf Keystone plunged more than 30 percent on the news.The company said current shareholders, which include Capital Group, Prudential (PRU.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and BlackRock (BLK.N) would see their ownership diluted to 5 percent.Sothic Capital, a London-based fund led by former distressed specialists from JP Morgan, is among the bondholders that will end up with a significant stake, according to sources close to the company and bondholders.Other such bondholders are GLG Partners, part of hedge fund Man Group, and investment fund Taconic Capital. Sothic did not respond to telephone calls. GLG and Taconic were not available for immediate comment.""This is obviously negative in share price terms given the significant dilution, although it's an expected and necessary step to allow the company to continue trading on a far steadier footing,"" said analysts at Cenkos Natural Resources. LARGE RESERVES Gulf Keystone said it had received as many as 18 M&A deal proposals, ranging from farm-ins to full sales, but that political problems in Iraq and uncertainty about oil prices had blocked progress.U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) several years ago showed interest in making an offer, Gulf Keystone's former chairman told Reuters last year.After the bond swap is completed, Gulf Keystone's debt will fall to $100 million from the current $600 million of guaranteed and convertible bonds maturing in 2017, making it a much more attractive acquisition target. The company will use some of the extra cash it hopes to raise via a $20-$25 million new equity issue to increase production to 55,000 bpd from around 40,000 currently.The Shaikan oil field has proven and probable reserves of 639 million barrels.'MIXED BAG' For some of the new shareholders, the debt swap could be a real coup. Gulf Keystone's $250 million guaranteed notes XS1056559088 traded below 50 cents to the dollar between January and April, Thomson Reuters data showed.This means investors could have bought the debt for less than $125 million. The holders of the $250 million guaranteed bond will retain $100 million of reinstated notes and receive 65.5 percent of Gulf Keystone's equity.Sources close to the company said, however, they had not registered a major change in bondholders over the past year.""The new owners are really a mixed bag of investors. They are distressed specialists but also long-only funds,"" said one source, who asked not to be identified.As a result of the proposed restructuring, the owners of $325 million in convertible bonds will receive 20 percent ownership of Gulf Keystone. Gulf Keystone said Capital Group, one of the world's biggest funds, was supporting the restructuring. It could end up with 10-15 percent of the firm by retaining its shares and subscribing to the new issue.With a market value of $3 billion in its heyday four years ago, Gulf Keystone is currently worth around $60 million. If the debt swap deal breaks down, the company would likely become insolvent, the firm said in a statement.

616,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON When Adam Kanzer wanted to stop the board of 3M Co (MMM.N) from including the lucrative impact of share buybacks in their chief executive's pay, he quoted Laurence Fink.Sitting atop the world's largest investment fund manager, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Fink is a vocal critic of companies’ excessive use of share buybacks. The practice is happening at a rapid clip among S&P 500 companies and according to critics is helping boost shareholder returns – and bosses’ pay – to the detriment of long-term growth.Kanzer, who is managing director of Domini Social Investments, channeled Fink at the top of his firm's resolution to the 3M (MMM.N) board, quoting his warning that large buybacks send ""a discouraging message about a company’s ability to use its resources wisely.""It didn't help. The resolution failed with 94 percent of shares cast voting against it. Shares held by BlackRock, 3M's third-largest investor with a 5.7 percent stake in the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape, according to its proxy,  apparently were not supportive. Despite their CEO's strong views, funds run by BlackRock side with company management on questions tied to stock buybacks most of the time, according to filings analyzed by research firm Proxy Insight for Reuters.BlackRock is not alone. Large asset managers like Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp (STT.N) have a similar voting record on the matter, according to the analysis.But Fink's exhortations and BlackRock's size make its voting record stand out.In the last three years, Fink has made his concerns about buybacks a top theme of an annual letter to other CEOs stressing the importance of companies investing for the long term. His views have been carried widely in the financial press and echoed by U.S. presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.BlackRock's nearly $5 trillion in managed assets mean that it is often a top investor in many of the companies buying back their shares, giving it an outsize voice on whether that strategy is the right one.""Larry Fink’s letters demonstrate that leadership. We hope it's not all posturing,"" said Brandon Rees deputy director of the office of investment for the AFL-CIO, of Fink's efforts.The AFL-CIO is the largest federation of U.S. labor unions and sponsored a resolution at Illinois Tool Works (ITW.N) that, like Domini’s 3M resolution, called on the company to exclude the impact of share repurchases from executive pay calculations.The resolution failed, with 95 percent of votes cast against it. It is unclear if BlackRock, a top five investor in the equipment maker, voted for it. The company does not comment on how it votes or its engagement with individual companies, and public filings showing its votes are not yet available. Rees said while he admires Fink's sentiments, BlackRock does not release enough detail to fully evaluate whether BlackRock's  engagement with particular companies has much impact. Fink, who was not made available to comment on this story, does not think all buybacks are bad. Some may be a prudent use of excess capital, and BlackRock itself has been buying roughly $275 million of its own shares every quarter, he has said.Spokesman Ed Sweeney said when BlackRock has concerns about a company's direction or corporate governance, it meets with directors and executives privately to ""catalyze positive changes,"" and votes against management when talks fail. He added that capital allocation matters like buybacks are just one of many areas it considers in its proxy voting process.In one case, BlackRock withheld support from two directors at ""a large oil and gas corporation"" this spring after the company -- which it declined to name -- did not make board members available to explain their strategy and capital allocation decisions, according to its website. It also did not support a member of Discovery Communications Inc's (DISCA.O) compensation committee last year after the company awarded its CEO the largest pay package in the S&P 500, according to securities filings.To guide those decisions, BlackRock turns to a team of 22 people who determine how to vote on thousands of ballot items each year at U.S. companies' annual meetings. Sweeney said that this division, headed by Michelle Edkins, is independent and votes in accordance with, ""our fiduciary duty to our clients."" BlackRock did not make Edkins available to comment.Matthew Weatherley-White, managing director of investment adviser Caprock Group, said BlackRock cannot vote too aggressively because many clients would not share Fink's views. For instance, choosing to buy back shares can boost shareholder returns in the short-term because it raises earnings per share. ""Fink is sincere, but structurally they have a hard time following through,"" Weatherley-White said.THE POWER OF THE VOTE S&P 500 firms are purchasing $445 billion in stock over the last 12 months of earnings reports, matching the previous year's peak. Add in dividends, and the total of $838 billion spent surpasses total capital expenditures of $707 billion in that time, according to a Reuters analysisMuch of BlackRock's nearly $5 trillion in managed assets is in passive investment products that buy and hold stocks only because they are in a particular index. That means that proxy votes are one of the few ways of expressing displeasure with a company. Actively managed funds can sell a company's stock anytime they become dissatisfied.""As an index fund owner, you have to own some really crummy companies"" that happen to be in an index, Fink said at an investor conference two years ago. The ""only power you have is your vote,"" he said.But BlackRock rarely exercised that power. In last year's proxy season, BlackRock funds opposed five percent of resolutions to approve share buybacks or repurchases, according to Proxy Insight's analysis for Reuters. To be sure, that was a stronger record than some rivals like Vanguard Group or T. Rowe Price (TROW.O), which opposed the resolutions one percent of the time and 2.7 percent of the time, respectively. Both T. Rowe Price and Vanguard declined to comment.BlackRock's Global Opportunities Fund MDLOX.N, for instance, opposed management on just two of 85 resolutions in that period, including at construction firm Bouygues SA (BOUY.PA) and distiller Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA). BlackRock's Sweeney declined to discuss the votes, but proxy adviser Glass, Lewis had recommended against both measures on concerns they could be used to thwart takeover attempts.Filings analyzed by Proxy Insight for Reuters also show that of the 30 S&P 500 companies that bought back the highest proportion of their stock in 2014, funds run by BlackRock supported those companies' directors about 97 percent of the time the following year, the most recent period available. That is roughly as often as they supported S&P 500 directors overall.Public filings showing BlackRock's votes on specific directors and shareholder proposals this year are not yet available, including Kanzer's 3M resolution on buybacks.Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services did not support the change at 3M or at Illinois Tool, which is a blow since backing from ISS can add an extra 30 percentage points or so to the support level for a typical shareholder proposal, according to pay consulting firm Semler Brossy. But Kanzer was counting on Fink's BlackRock to back him up.""Considering the helpful things Larry Fink has been saying about excessive share buybacks, we had hoped to see BlackRock underscore that message through its proxy voting,"" said Kanzer of Domini Social Investments, an investment adviser that specializes in socially responsible investing and sponsored the 3M resolution.Kanzer noted that his resolution at least prompted 3M to offer more disclosure around its rationale for the buybacks, and said he had a ""productive conversation"" with 3M management. Will Domini re-submit similar resolutions at 3M and elsewhere next year?""Still thinking about it,"" he said.

623,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Monday it is upgrading its view on emerging market stocks, adding that the equities will continue thriving as central banks keep interest rates low.Rates globally remaining ""lower for longer"" keeps the risk of the U.S. dollar rising slim, while increasing the likelihood of more rate cuts by emerging market central banks, Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist for the world's largest asset manager, said in a note.That combination makes assets in emerging markets relatively attractive, he said.Meanwhile, investors have been pumping billions into funds tracking that market. Emerging-market stock funds in the United States took in $2.7 billion in the weekly period through Aug. 17, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data, their seventh straight week reeling in cash. ""We see room for further inflows,"" said Turnill.BlackRock had been reluctant to raise its forecast on stocks in countries such as China and India, keeping its view ""neutral"" on the market for the better part of this year even as it said pressures were easing on developing countries. But Monday's note upgraded emerging market stocks to ""overweight."" That shows that BlackRock expects the equities to do well, in U.S. dollar terms, over the next three months.Turnill said BlackRock prefers investments in ""countries showing economic improvements or having clear reform catalysts,"" citing India and the ""ASEAN"" grouping of countries in Southeast Asia.

624,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Monday it is upgrading its view on emerging market stocks, adding that the equities will continue thriving as central banks keep interest rates low.Rates globally remaining ""lower for longer"" keeps the risk of the U.S. dollar rising slim, while increasing the likelihood of more rate cuts by emerging market central banks, Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist for the world's largest asset manager, said in a note.That combination makes assets in emerging markets relatively attractive, he said.Meanwhile, investors have been pumping billions into funds tracking that market. Emerging-market stock funds in the United States took in $2.7 billion in the weekly period through Aug. 17, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data, their seventh straight week reeling in cash. ""We see room for further inflows,"" said Turnill.BlackRock had been reluctant to raise its forecast on stocks in countries such as China and India, keeping its view ""neutral"" on the market for the better part of this year even as it said pressures were easing on developing countries. But Monday's note upgraded emerging market stocks to ""overweight."" That shows that BlackRock expects the equities to do well, in U.S. dollar terms, over the next three months.Turnill said BlackRock prefers investments in ""countries showing economic improvements or having clear reform catalysts,"" citing India and the ""ASEAN"" grouping of countries in Southeast Asia.

629,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON BlackRock Inc withheld support from two high-profile directors at Exxon Mobil Corp, securities filings show, a rare spat apparently driven by a board communications policy at the world's largest energy company.Because top fund managers like BlackRock rarely discuss their votes in detail, filings in late August to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provide a rare window into the influential ballots they cast at springtime shareholder meetings like the one held by Exxon on May 25, one of this year's more contentious.BlackRock, which manages nearly $5 trillion, has been criticized for largely supporting company managers on matters like executive pay or electing directors. BlackRock funds have backed corporate directors around 97 percent of the time since 2013, according to research firm Proxy Insight, and mostly backed Exxon at this year's meeting such as opposing shareholder proposals addressing climate change.BlackRock executives say they prefer to press companies behind the scenes, and vote against management only when such engagement fails. But in a rare break, filings on Friday showed funds including the $45 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund withheld support from Exxon directors Jay Fishman and Kenneth Frazier this year.  Fishman, who recently passed away, had been CEO of insurer Travelers. Frazier is CEO of drugmaker Merck & Co.While spokesman for BlackRock and Exxon declined to comment, BlackRock's reasoning for the votes appears to be spelled out in a recent governance report on its website. The report describes how BlackRock executives tried to discuss strategy and capital allocation with independent directors of an unnamed ""large oil and gas corporation,"" but were rebuffed because of a policy against such talks.As a result, BlackRock said it withheld support from the company's lead independent director and the chair of the committee that set the policy. Fishman had been Exxon's ""presiding director,"" meant to provide independent board leadership according to Exxon's proxy statement, while Frazier  led its board affairs committee. The two were re-elected with 88 and 90 percent of votes cast, respectively, down from 95 and 98 percent in 2015. BlackRock is Exxon's second-largest shareholder with about 6 percent of its stock, according to the proxy. Exxon's other directors got no less than 95 percent support this year.How much contact independent directors should have with outsiders has become a loaded issue because of the rise of activist investors pushing disruptive agendas. Asked about BlackRock's concern, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers cited a webpage outlining board communications procedures, which do not directly address the matter. But Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, said Exxon executives have described at meetings the sort of policy criticized by BlackRock.Filings also showed BlackRock funds did not back resolutions at 3M Co, Illinois Tool Works Inc or Xerox Corp calling on the companies to exclude the impact of share buybacks when calculating executive pay, even though the resolutions cited the concerns about buybacks raised by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

632,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt and Simon Jessop | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, said all investors should factor climate change into their decision-making and doing so would not mean having to accept lower returns.        Global moves to coordinate a response to climate change took a big step forward on Saturday when both China and the United States ratified a 2015 plan to curb climate-warming emissions, raising chances it will enter into law this year.    BlackRock said it is strengthening its data and analytical processes to reflect changes to the environment - and political responses to them. In a 16-page report released after the G20 meeting in China, BlackRock, which manages more than $4.9 trillion in assets, said risks and opportunities would come through the physical effects of climate change, technological change, as well as the regulatory and social response.    ""Climate risk is an enduring challenge,"" Ewen Cameron Watt, senior director for BlackRock's Investment Institute, told Reuters. ""This is a source of portfolio risk and a source of social risk, which needs addressing.""    In the report, BlackRock suggested higher carbon prices could limit the cost of reducing emissions and push companies to create solutions to the problem.In the meantime, BlackRock said it was enhancing its data mining efforts to reduce the risk to its investments. For instance, they calculate emissions as a percentage of a company's sales, estimate firms' exposure to income shocks from rising temperatures and calculate the sales a company generates with little physical waste.    Firms that cut their carbon footprint have performed better than their peers who did not make such changes, BlackRock said.    Cameron Watt said insurers have made vast strides in recent decades to model ""climate risk"" in detail and adjusted their premiums accordingly.     ""I think we can do the same,"" he said, applying data to its own investment process. ""We're just scratching the surface.""    For instance, with more detailed number-crunching, BlackRock could learn how a single corporation's factories and supply lines could be affected by catastrophic weather. The risks are considerable, BlackRock said. After an extreme weather event hits a state, economic growth is 10 to 15 percent lower than usual that month and slower for many more months, its analysis showed. BlackRock has expanded its ability to store, sort and analyze data and uses more of the data to inform its investment decisions, for instance in deciding when to bet against a stock.

For instance, it managed troubled assets accumulated by the investment bank Bear Stearns and the insurer American International Group.In the years since, BlackRock has worked to define FMA as its own business segment and as a showcase for the asset manager's risk controls and technology. ""FMA has not only become a thriving business, it has contributed to BlackRock's reputation in a way that truly sets us apart from other asset managers,"" said the memo, which was signed by BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and two of his senior deputies, Rob Kapito and Rob Goldstein.Phillips could not immediately be reached for comment. Among other responsibilities, Phillips headed the Client Solutions team and was a member of the BlackRock Operating Committee, a senior executive group.Charles Hatami - the co-head of the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment of BlackRock's FMA business - will take over Phillips' role, the memo said.(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt)",2016-09-07,BLK,"Wed Sep 7, 2016 | 1:30pm EDT",MOVES-Head of BlackRock quasi-consulting arm to leave company -memo,http://www.reuters.com//article/blackrock-moves-idUSL1N1BJ0YJ?type=companyNews
636,"   By Alan Baldwin | LONDON  LONDON Formula One faces its biggest shake-up in decades with the announcement on Wednesday that U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone's Liberty Media has agreed to take control of the cash-generating glamor sport.The deal, which has an enterprise value of $8 billion according to a company statement, heralds a new era for Formula One, a European-dominated sport that has long sought to break into the U.S. market and win fresh audiences.It could also accelerate the exit of 85-year-old Bernie Ecclestone, the Briton who has run the sport for nearly 40 years and built up a business with annual turnover of around $1.9 billion.Liberty Media said in a statement, which ended a long-running saga surrounding the sport's ownership and potential flotation, that it was acquiring an initial 18.7 percent stake from controlling shareholder CVC Capital Partners. The company hopes to complete a deal for the remainder by the first quarter of 2017. The statement added that Chase Carey, the executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and a director of Sky News owner Sky Plc, will take over as chairman of the board of Formula One's parent company with Ecclestone remaining as CEO.""I greatly admire Formula One as a unique global sports entertainment franchise attracting hundreds of millions of fans each season from all around the world,"" Carey said.  ""I see great opportunity to help Formula One continue to develop and prosper for the benefit of the sport, fans, teams and investors alike.""Ecclestone added that he welcomed the company into the sport and looked forward to working with them.   The deal will be subject to the approval of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), the governing body for Formula One and other global motorsport series, and European anti-trust regulators.CVC acquired majority control of Formula One in March 2006 and has since recouped its money many times over with billions of dollars in revenues.DEAL-MAKER Ecclestone has been the deal-maker, securing lucrative television contracts and hosting fees with countries such as Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan that are eager to feature on what is now a calendar with a record 21 races.

641,"  (Repeats to additional subscribers, text unchanged)By Alan BaldwinLONDON, Sept 7 Formula One faces its biggest shake-up in decades with the announcement on Wednesday that U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone's Liberty Media has agreed to take control of the cash-generating glamour sport.The deal, which has an enterprise value of $8 billion according to a company statement, heralds a new era for Formula One, a European-dominated sport that has long sought to break into the U.S. market and win fresh audiences.It could also accelerate the exit of 85-year-old Bernie Ecclestone, the Briton who has run the sport for nearly 40 years and built up a business with annual turnover of around $1.9 billion.Liberty Media said in a statement, which ended a long-running saga surrounding the sport's ownership and potential flotation, that it was acquiring an initial 18.7 percent stake from controlling shareholder CVC Capital Partners.The company hopes to complete a deal for the remainder by the first quarter of 2017.The statement added that Chase Carey, the executive vice-chairman of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and a director of Sky News owner Sky Plc, will take over as chairman of the board of Formula One's parent company with Ecclestone remaining as CEO.""I greatly admire Formula One as a unique global sports entertainment franchise attracting hundreds of millions of fans each season from all around the world,"" Carey said.""I see great opportunity to help Formula One continue to develop and prosper for the benefit of the sport, fans, teams and investors alike."" Ecclestone added that he welcomed the company into the sport and looked forward to working with them.The deal will be subject to the approval of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), the governing body for Formula One and other global motorsport series, and European anti-trust regulators.CVC acquired majority control of Formula One in March 2006 and has since recouped its money many times over with billions of dollars in revenues. DEAL-MAKER Ecclestone has been the deal-maker, securing lucrative television contracts and hosting fees with countries such as Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan that are eager to feature on what is now a calendar with a record 21 races.A controversial figure, who has become as much a celebrity as any of the drivers, 'Bernie' has been a part of Formula One ever since the 1950s.A former team owner, he secured the television rights in the late 1970s and transformed the sport into one of the world's richest.Reluctant to delegate, he has not groomed a successor and critics have accused him of holding back the sport through a failure to embrace fully new media or the digital marketplace, something Liberty is expected to make a priority. ""Maybe it is good news that an American media company buys F1,"" Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff said at the weekend's Italian Grand Prix.""There are things we can learn from the American way, particularly in the digital areas...they will have a close look and then analyse what they think needs to be changed and what needs to remain.""Team bosses and other paddock insiders expect Ecclestone to be eased out only gradually, given his intimate knowledge of the business.CVC has twice tried to float Formula One but the plans stalled and the fund instead sold stakes to U.S. investment groups BlackRock and Waddell & Reed, along with Norway's Norges Bank.It sold down its holding from 63 percent in 2012 in deals that at the time gave the business an enterprise value, which includes debt and equity, of $9.1 billion.That left CVC with a 35.5 percent stake in Delta Topco, Formula One's parent company, with Waddell & Reed having 20.9 percent. Among other investors, Ecclestone holds 5.3 percent and his family's Bambino Trust another 8.5 percent.Malone's Liberty Global is the world's largest international TV and broadband company, operating in more than 30 countries in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean through a series of different brand names.Liberty Media has interests in the Atlanta Braves baseball team, satellite radio service Sirius XM, entertainment group Live Nation LYV.N, and minority interests in Time Warner TWX.N and Viacom VIAB.O.

RNAi has long interested drug developers, but has frequently met with clinical failure.

The RNAi drug is designed to reduce elevated levels of a form of cholesterol called Lp(a) that raises the risk of heart disease caused by plaque build-up.

657,"   By Anshuman Daga and Shihar Aneez | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE Oct 5 Private equity firm TPG and fund company BlackRock Inc are among half a dozen firms which have shown preliminary interest in a 49 percent stake in loss-making SriLankan Airlines Ltd, people familiar with the matter said.They said Sri Lanka is looking to sell the stake along with management control in the restructuring national carrier as part of its efforts to reduce support for state-owned firms and cut government debt.In July, a unit of state-run National Savings Bank, the lead manager overseeing SriLankan Airlines' revamp, invited offers from strategic investors who would assume responsibility for turning around the airline and its budget subsidiary Mihin Lanka.A senior Sri Lankan finance ministry official said TPG and BlackRock were the two top international firms among the bidders. He declined to be identified as the bids are still being evaluated. BlackRock and TPG declined to comment. It was not immediately clear who were the other bidders. Sources also said it was too early in the process to estimate a potential deal value.SriLankan Airlines was a profitable 10-year joint venture with Emirates Airline until the pair split in 2008. Mismanagement in the years since has left it with debt of around $3.25 billion, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said. ""The government is looking at someone to solve the airline's struggles,"" said one person familiar with the matter. The person, who was not authorised to speak to the media, declined to be identified.SriLankan Airlines is due to give details of its  restructuring plan at a media event later on Wednesday. The people said government is expected to shortlist parties and pick a final bidder in the next couple of months, adding that the government has indicated it would take on a substantial portion of the debt owed by the airline.The companies are expected to start due diligence after the shortlist has been finalised.SriLankan Airlines has attractive routes to India and analysts have said potential investors could be drawn to the prospect of turning around the carrier, which has about 21 leased Airbus planes.Srilankan Airlines reported a net loss of 16.33 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($112 million) for the year to March 31, narrower than its 31.4 billion rupees a loss year earlier on lower oil prices. It last made a profit in 2009, a year after Emirates sold its stake.

A favorable tax rate and income from non-core investments helped the company beat analyst forecasts.BlackRock has managed to stand above the fray because it owns iShares, the leading exchange-traded fund brand. Still, its transition from being primarily an active asset manager to a more passive one has not been without pain.""Even in these hostile headwinds that we see as an industry, I think we will benefit over the long run,"" Fink said in an interview.Most recognizable ETFs charge low fees and aim to track the market rather than beat it.BlackRock sliced fees on some ETFs further during the latest quarter to draw in new business. Investors are expected to leave funds that pay brokers sales commissions due to an upcoming U.S. Labor Department rule, and BlackRock has said its ETFs can benefit.Overall, the company's net income rose 3.8 percent to $875 million, or $5.26 per share, in the third quarter from $843 million, or $5.00 per share, a year earlier.After adjustments to strip out some compensation, distribution and tax costs, BlackRock said it earned $5.14 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.00, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.At Sept. 30, the bond and index fund manager had $5.1 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock's iShares ETF business took in $51 billion in new money - more than double its inflows a year ago. It accounted for 93 percent of the cash the company took into its long-term funds, a grouping that excludes short-term cash accounts.FUND MANAGERS HURTING So far this year, investors have pulled $110 billion from U.S.-based stock funds, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.""Active"" funds, whose managers bet on specific stocks and bonds, have lost $119 billion to cash withdrawals this year in the United States, according to Morningstar Inc (MORN.O).

Another $1.8 billion went into alternative investments, while its stock and bond-picking franchise took in $4 billion.Yet BlackRock's performance fees - which are usually earned when a fund beats its target return - fell by 72 percent in the quarter.Institutional clients withdrew money from one of its key stockpicking groups, known as ""scientific"" active equity, as performance has lagged over the past year. Just 31 percent of assets managed by that unit are beating their benchmark over the period, BlackRock said.

685,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Lower leasing costs, more efficient office space and the hope of projecting an image more appealing to millennials are leading hedge funds and large corporations to leave Manhattan's most-coveted business district for a rejuvenated Downtown and the trendy far West Side.The construction of gigantic new office buildings that allow tenants to use 20 percent less space is pressuring prices and driving firms like consultants BCG and law firm WilmerHale out of the tony Plaza District in Midtown Manhattan. In the latest potential blow to the area surrounding the elegant Plaza Hotel - the city's most coveted business address for decades - asset manager BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is poised to lease 850,000 square feet at a planned 58-story tower at the new Hudson Yards development on the far West Side.Also spurring the slow exodus is the notion that the area just southeast of Central Park, which includes the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, is showing its age and fails to satisfy the city's burgeoning millennial workforce.Buildings along Park Avenue in the half-square-mile Plaza section of Midtown on average were built in 1960. The area roughly runs from 50th to 59th streets and is bounded by Lexington and Sixth Avenues.""For large, dynamic companies, these older buildings don't work as well, they just don't,"" said Bill Montana, senior managing director at New York-based Savills Studley, a unit of global real estate firm Savills Plc (SVS.L).The new buildings are significantly more efficient and large companies use the space to compete for top talent, Montana said.Four towers with an average height of 69 stories that are under construction by Related Cos, Brookfield Properties and the Moinian Group at Hudson Yards already are pressuring prices. Five other behemoths have been proposed for the far West Side.Average leasing rates for 62 ""trophy"" buildings in Midtown have slid a touch more than 1 percent in October from a post-recession peak last year of $99.43 a square foot, which capped a 33 percent increase since 2009, real estate specialist Jones Lang LaSalle said.Asking rents for the Plaza District averaged $95.47 a square foot for Class A buildings in the third quarter, compared to $66.05 a square foot for space in the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, real estate firm Colliers International (CIGI.TO) said. BlackRock would like to add a cafeteria and auditorium, amenities that are missing at its two offices across the street from each other on 52nd Street, said a source with knowledge of the real estate search.The move, which would involve about 2,800 staff, but has not been finalized, is as good or better financially than to stay, the source said. Projected rents for anchor tenants in the Plaza District when BlackRock's leases are up in 2023 are much higher.A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.There is no new, large-scale construction underway in the Plaza District, though landlords have ordered major renovations such as a $325 million makeover at the old Time-Life Building on Sixth Avenue that has been rebranded 1271 Avenue of the Americas. LEASING RATES FOR 'TROPHY' BUILDINGS SLIP     To be sure, no one is writing the area off. The Plaza still has cachet for many.""Midtown will always prosper,"" said Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director at JLL in New York. ""Those landlords have to react a little differently to how they're going to fill the hole left behind.""Earlier this year JLL said almost half the world's 428 hedge funds with at least $1 billion in assets had New York offices.Of those 208 sites, 94 percent were in Midtown Manhattan, with almost two-thirds located in the Plaza District, JLL said. One marquee hedge fund, Citadel LLC, in February agreed to pay a record $300 a square foot for part of the penthouse at 425 Park Avenue, according to media reports. Citadel's average rent will be $175 a square foot on average after its other floors are included. Citadel declined to comment.Still, high-profile names have left or will soon, such as private equity firm KKR's planned move from the Solow Building on West 57th Street, often called the city's most prestigious building, to Hudson Yards. The move is seen as highly symbolic.The Plaza District has been losing ground for a while. It has been the third-lowest recipient of corporate cross-market relocations in Manhattan since 2011, when leases of more than 50,000 square feet are examined, according to Colliers.But the Plaza, the city's biggest sub-market, has seen the largest departure of companies that have moved from Midtown, Midtown South or the downtown business centers in the almost six-year period up to mid-September, a Colliers report said.During that time Midtown lost 30 tenants, a dozen of those from the Plaza, including five that moved to new construction, Colliers said in its ""Manhattan Without Borders"" report.A drop-off in leasing demand is particularly apparent in the Plaza District, where the increase in available space surged by almost 4 percentage points in the third quarter to 12.9 percent from a year-ago, according to a recent Savills Studley report.""There is a very strong base of people who still want to be in the Plaza District, myself included,"" Montana said. ""For a lot of younger people, that's not what they aspire to. So the demand is less for the Plaza District because of building stock and because of change in taste.""
