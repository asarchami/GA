It had said in March that it believed insurance would cover any potential accord.Shareholders led by the Structural Ironworkers Local Union #1 Pension Fund in Forest Park, Illinois, claimed that the record results posted in 2007 by the maker of Monster Energy and Allied drinks, then known as Hansen Natural Corp, were inflated.According to the complaint, the results reflected ""channel stuffing,"" in which Monster would provide Anheuser distributors with too many drinks to sell, at times up to a year's worth of inventory, even though Anheuser had ""practically abandoned"" distribution of the Allied product line. The complaint also said Monster improperly deferred the reporting of promotional expenses, while executives took advantage of an inflated share price by selling $72 million of company stock.After the company's true financial condition became known on November 8, 2007, Monster's stock fell more than 23 percent in a single day, the complaint said.The proposed settlement class includes investors who held the stock between November 9, 2006, and that date.

(KO.N) said Thursday it is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) as the company seeks to expand into faster-growing categories like energy drinks. Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on Monster's board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business including NOS, Full Throttle and Burn, to Monster. Monster will issue Coke shares of common stock, and transfer its non-energy business, which includes Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, while Monster will become Coke's exclusive energy drinks partner. For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to increase its footprint in a faster growing category than soda. Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North America its biggest market was flat, partly driven by a decline in diet coke sales. In turn, Monster will gain access to Coke's extensive global distribution system. The companies will amend their current distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada by expanding into additional territories.  Coca-Cola shares rose 1.2 percent in after-hours trading, while Monster surged 22 percent. On a conference call with reporters, Coke's Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent.  The transaction is expected to close late in 2014 or early in 2015. “Our equity investment in Monster is a capital-efficient way to bolster our participation in the fast-growing and attractive global energy drinks category,"" Kent said.

The three major U.S. stock indexes had opened higher on hopes of easing tensions between the two countries, but came under pressure when Ukraine, contradicting a report from Russia's Defense Ministry, said it had shelled a Russian armored column.""What we saw was just a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to the headlines,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in New York.""I think the fact that the market sold off relatively hard on the Ukraine report but came back in the last hour or so is a reflection of us not getting any additional confirmation on the Russian column being attacked."" The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's fear barometer, shot up as much as 20.3 percent to a session high at 14.94. At the close, though, the VIX was up 5.9 percent at 13.15. Investors rushed to buy safe-haven bonds and the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield at one point dropped to 2.30 percent, its lowest level since June 2013.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.67 points, or 0.30 percent, to close at 16,662.91. The S&P 500  dipped 0.12 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to end at 1,955.06. The Nasdaq Composite added 11.93 points, or 0.27 percent, to end at 4,464.93.At one point during the selloff, the Dow briefly turned negative for the year when it touched a session low at 16,575.42. The S&P 500 fell as low as 1,941.50 while the Nasdaq touched an intraday low at 4,427.13. For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.2 percent.The stock of Gilead Sciences Inc rose 3.3 percent to $99.49. Gilead contributed the most to the Nasdaq's gain, in terms of index points. The biotech company said on Friday that an arbitration panel ruled in its favor and rejected a patent infringement claim brought by Roche Holding AG.Applied Materials Inc, up 6.3 percent at $22.48, also gave the Nasdaq a major boost a day after the chip equipment maker reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations.Shares of Monster Beverage Corp jumped 30.5 percent to $93.49 a day after Coca-Cola Co said it was buying a 16.7 percent stake in the company for $2.15 billion.  The rally in Monster's stock helped both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. Coca-Cola, a Dow component, gained 1.7 percent to close at $40.88.In the latest snapshot of the economy, U.S. manufacturing output rose broadly in July and automobile production recorded its largest increase in five years.

13,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 15 Coca-Cola Co's $2.15 billion wager on a stake in Monster Beverage Corp  highlights the growth-starved soft drink company's embrace of deals that fall short of a full-blown merger and acquisition but allow it to test-drive potentially risky targets.The world's largest soda maker said Thursday that it was  buying a 16.7 percent stake in Monster. Coke will get two directors on Monster's board as well as Monster's non-energy brands, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea. Monster will get Coke's energy brands, which include NOS and Full Throttle, as well as access to Coke's extensive distribution system.Taking a minority stake instead of acquiring Monster outright gives Coke the opportunity to get the perks of being in  a $27 billion global energy drinks market without taking on the financial and public relations risks that come with the controversial category, analysts said. If the deal closes as expected, Coke will distribute energy drinks but will not actually own them anymore.One advantage for Coke is that deal involves less cash upfront than a full-on acquisition, which would have been at least $12 billion at Thursday's closing stock price. That is roughly equivalent to the amount of cash Coke had in hand at the end of July. ""A couple of billion is something that Coke could handle without much difficulty,"" said Linda Montag, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service. Also, the gradualist approach allows Coke to sample at a distance a market in which it has a small presence and thus limited experience, with both the risks and rewards. The category enjoyed double-digit global growth in the mid-2000s, but as of late that has slowed. According to Euromonitor International, energy drink sales increased 7 percent in 2013 from the previous year.There are other hazards with which Coke may want to get more familiar before doing a full deal. Energy drinks have been wrought with controversy in both the United States and international markets. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in 2012 that it was probing five deaths possibly linked to Monster Energy. The agency says it is still studying energy drinks but has not taken any action so far. Earlier this year, Lithuania banned the sale of high-caffeine drinks to minors, raising the question of whether other countries could follow its lead. A Coke spokesman said Friday that the company has done its due diligence in evaluating Monster's legal proceedings. The deal notably keeps Coke at an arm's length from any future public relations battles facing the energy drinks industry.""This is a category that faces ongoing scrutiny, fair or not,"" said Stephen Powers, an analyst at UBS. ""Coke has always been wary of that because they face a lot of scrutiny themselves."" A deal between Coke and Monster has been speculated about for years. Coke shares were up 2 percent at $40.93 in Friday's trading while Monster's surged 30 percent to $93.07.Indeed, a cautious approach does not necessarily mean the company is shutting the door on owning Monster some day. The company made investments in both Honest Tea and Zico Beverages, the maker of coconut water, before eventually buying them.It could be pursuing a similar strategy with Keurig Green Mountain Inc : Coke bought a 10 percent stake in the single-service coffee brewing company earlier this year and raised it to 16 percent in May, making it Keurig's largest shareholder.""This seems to be an evolving and accepted method for Coke to diversify and do it in baby steps before they go all in,"" Powers said.

The market continued to take its cue from news overseas. Ukrainian border guards crossed the frontier to inspect a huge Russian aid convoy, which some had speculated could be a cover for a military invasion. The inspection comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a softer tone in comments regarding Ukraine.In Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for a new coalition that world and regional powers hope will be able to quash a Sunni Islamist insurgency that threatens Baghdad.""While no one is discounting the possibility that these issues could get worse next week, there hasn't been anything untoward yet with the inspections or in Iraq, and that's a positive,"" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York. In the latest economic data, the New York Federal Reserve's report on manufacturers showed business conditions improved in August, though at a slower rate than expected.  Separately, U.S. consumer sentiment fell in August to its lowest since last November, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.""These are disappointing, but there's a growing feeling that the U.S. is going to be the best market to be in for the rest of the year,"" Colas said. ""U.S. equities look like a better value than U.S. Treasuries, or certainly European equities.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.05 points or 0.31 percent, to 16,764.63, the S&P 500 gained 7.92 points or 0.41 percent, to 1,963.1 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 28.24 points or 0.63 percent, to 4,481.24.

18,"  (Updates with CEO quotes)By Anjali AthavaleyNEW YORK Aug 14 Coca-Cola Co said Thursday it is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp as the world's largest soda maker seeks to expand into faster-growing categories such as energy drinks.Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on Monster's board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business including brands like Full Throttle and Burn, to Monster. Monster will transfer its non-energy business, which includes Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, while Monster brands will be the only energy drinks distributed by Coke.For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to increase its footprint in energy drinks, a $27 billion market globally, according to Euromonitor International. It comes at a time when people are drinking less soda in developed markets. Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North America, its biggest market, was flat, partly driven by a decline in diet Coke sales.In turn, Monster will gain access to Coke's extensive global distribution system. The companies have a distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada and will amend it to expand into additional territories. On a conference call with media, Rodney Sacks, chief executive officer of Monster, said that the company would also convert distribution agreements it has with Anheuser-Busch InBev in the U.S. to Coke. ""We believe it will be a win-win strategy"" Sacks said.A person familiar with the transaction said that the deal enables Monster to enter markets where it doesn't have a presence, like China and Russia, and increase its footprint in places where the company thinks it can gain share, like Brazil. Coca-Cola shares rose 1.2 percent in after-hours trading, while Monster surged 22 percent.Coke's Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent and cannot exceed that amount in the next four years. Coke is under no obligation to make additional investments.The transaction is expected to close late in 2014 or early in 2015. The deal comes two years after Coke took the unusual step of shooting down a report by the Wall Street Journal that said it was in talks to buy Monster. Coke and Monster had discussed a possible deal as recently as 2011, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.On the call, both companies downplayed the risk that energy drinks will be more strictly regulated. Monster is facing lawsuits over its advertising practices and injuries allegedly caused by its flagship energy drink.Barclays served as financial adviser and Jones Day served as legal adviser to Monster.

19,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK, Sept 24  NEW YORK, Sept 24 Two Universal Music Group units sued Monster Beverage Corp on Wednesday for using music co-owned by the Beastie Boys in a promotional video, accusing the energy drink maker of copyright infringement.The lawsuit, filed in New York federal court, comes three months after the Beastie Boys obtained a $1.7 million verdict against Monster over copyrights for the same music.The latest lawsuit, filed by Capitol Records and Universal-Polygram International Publishing, seeks at least $1.2 million for the infringement of five Beastie Boys recordings and compositions. Both lawsuits centered on an online video promoting an annual snowboarding competition that Monster organizes and sponsors in Canada called ""Ruckus in the Rockies.""The video, which Monster had uploaded to YouTube, featured the competition and an after-party attended by DJs, including Z-Trip. It included a remix by Z-Trip of Beastie Boys songs. It also concluded with a sentence saying ""RIP MCA."" Adam Yauch, a Beastie Boys member who went by ""MCA,"" died a day before the May 2012 snowboarding event, after a battle with cancer.A federal jury in June awarded the Beastie Boys $1.7 million for copyright infringement and false endorsement. Monster has said it would appeal, and is seeking a new trial. Songs at issue in both cases include Beastie Boys tunes such as ""Sabotage,"" ""So Watcha Want"" and ""Make Some Noise.""Representatives for Monster and the Beastie Boys had no immediate comment. A spokesman for Universal Music, a subsidiary of Vivendi SA, declined comment.The case is Capitol Records LLC v.

""It's American racing; we're an American brand that's a global company, and NASCAR is, too.""It was the perfect fit for us. ... NASCAR is just a hard-hitting, close-racing, fun property to be associated with."" Monster Energy replaces U.S. wireless carrier Sprint (S.N), who announced in 2014 that it was leaving the sport after the 2016 season during which it spent a reported $75 million annually on NASCAR sponsorship.Sprint became NASCAR's Cup series sponsor starting with the 2008 season after it purchased Nextel, which took the naming rights in 2004. NASCAR, which is struggling with sagging ticket revenues and television ratings, will open its 2017 season in February with the Daytona 500.""Monster Energy is the perfect series sponsor for NASCAR at the perfect time,"" said Texas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage.
