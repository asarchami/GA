0,"  Patrick Reed made up for some wayward driving with a sizzling putting display in dazzling sunshine to charge into a one-shot lead in Thursday's opening round of the $5.7 million Humana Challenge at La Quinta, California.The 23-year-old American took advantage of ideal scoring conditions in the California desert as he fired a flawless nine-under-par 63 on the Arnold Palmer Private course at PGA West, one of three venues hosting the pro-am event.Reed piled up nine birdies and totaled only 27 putts to finish a picture-perfect day with barely a breath of wind one stroke in front of fellow Americans Ryan Palmer, Justin Hicks, Daniel Summerhays and 2007 champion Charley Hoffman.""Even though I didn't hit many fairways, I kept it in play and that's the main thing around this golf course,"" Texan Reed told Golf Channel after taking control of the PGA Tour event.""And then whenever I was on the green, it was one of those days when everything I read was the right line, I hit the line every time and I got hot with the putter. ""When any guy out here gets hot with the putter, they're going to be able to shoot a low number,"" said Reed, who won his maiden PGA Tour title at last year's Wyndham Championship where he beat rookie sensation Jordan Spieth in a playoff.Reed's wife Justine is expecting the couple's first child, a baby girl, in May and has handed over her usual caddying duties for her husband to her brother, Kessler Karain.Palmer also started out on the Palmer layout on Thursday, Hicks and Daniel Summerhays played on the Nicklaus Private at PGA West and Hoffman launched his title bid at La Quinta Country Club. ""It was a little interesting,"" said three-time PGA Tour winner Palmer, who recorded two bogeys in his first six holes before stunningly ending his round with six successive birdies.""I guess you could say I slept walked the first six holes. I hit some good shots, just couldn't get a putt to go in. ""After bogeying six, I hit a great nine-iron on seven to about three feet which kind of jump-started my round. And then on 14, I just exploded. I hit it close pretty much every hole. That was a fun start.""American world number six Zach Johnson, who clinched his 11th PGA Tour victory at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii 10 days ago, and Scotland's Russell Knox were among seven players who opened with 65s.Brandt Snedeker, the 2012 FedExCup champion, carded a 72 in his first PGA Tour start of the year while fellow American Brian Gay, who won last year's Humana Challenge in a three-way playoff, launched his title defense with a 69 at La Quinta.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue)",2014-01-17,HUM,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 7:43pm EST",American Reed sizzles in California desert,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSBREA0G01K20140117?type=companyNews
1,"  American Patrick Reed once again flourished in near-perfect scoring conditions as he stretched his lead to two shots in Friday's second round of the $5.7 million Humana Challenge at La Quinta, California.One stroke ahead overnight after opening with a nine-under-par 63 on the Arnold Palmer Private course at PGA West, the red-hot Reed followed up with another sizzling 63, this time at La Quinta Country Club.The 23-year-old piled up eight birdies, an eagle at the par-five fifth and a lone bogey in dazzling desert sunshine with barely a hint of wind to post an 18-under total of 126 in the pro-am event being played at three venues.American journeyman Brendon Todd birdied his final hole for a flawless 63 on the Palmer Private layout, ending the day a stroke in front of compatriot Ryan Palmer, who carded a 65 at La Quinta.Fellow American Charley Hoffman, the 2007 champion, was a further shot back at 14 under after returning a 66 on the Nicklaus Private course.Reed, who made up for some wayward driving in Thursday's opening round with a sizzling putting display, tightened his hold on the tournament after producing much better form off the tee on Friday.""To start off the day hitting a perfect drive on the first and second holes ... gave me a little bit of extra confidence in that club,"" the Texan told reporters. ""So I was able to attack and be more aggressive off the tees. ""Whenever you start with hitting a soft sand wedge to four feet on the first and tap in for birdie ... you just carry that momentum straight through.""PLAYOFF BREAKTHROUGH Reed is bidding for his second PGA Tour title, having clinched his first at last year's Wyndham Championship where he beat rookie sensation Jordan Spieth in a playoff. ""What I'm doing so far is working - 63, 63 - so we're just going to stick to that game plan, stick to our notes and hopefully close it out,"" said Reed.""My putter is really working. I hit a lot of good putts today, missed a couple, but at the same time I made some. As long as I keep doing that, come Sunday, we'll see.""Todd, still seeking his maiden PGA Tour title after playing his rookie season on the U.S. circuit in 2009, said Reed's sizzling scoring had spurred him on to stay in touch with the lead. ""It just kind of kept me motivated coming in to make as many birdies as I could, distance myself from the pack and get near Patrick,"" Todd told Golf Channel""I just have to keep doing what I am doing. I've got a good team around me. Just keep working on the same things and gain some more experience out here.""Keegan Bradley aced the par-three third on the Nicklaus Private course with a seven-iron from 177 yards, his ball pitching on the front portion of the green before curling from right to left and then disappearing into the cup.Bradley, who clinched his maiden major title at the 2011 PGA Championship, ended up shooting a 66 to sit a distant nine strokes off the pace heading into Saturday's third round.American world number six Zach Johnson, who won the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii 11 days ago, carded a 68 on the Nicklaus Private course to finish at 11 under.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Gene Cherry)",2014-01-18,HUM,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 7:29pm EST",Red-hot Reed moves two ahead at La Quinta,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSBREA0H00E20140118?type=companyNews
2,"  American Patrick Reed survived a few anxious moments and poor swings midway through the final round to seal his second PGA Tour victory by two shots at the $5.7 million Humana Challenge on Sunday in La Quinta, California.A commanding seven strokes ahead overnight, Reed mixed four bogeys with three birdies in a roller-coaster stretch of eight holes from the fifth but held steady after that to close with a one-under-par 71 on the Palmer Private course at PGA West.""I wasn't pleased with the round today but I got it done,"" the burly 23-year-old told Golf Channel after completing a wire-to-wire victory with a 28-under total of 260, finishing two ahead of fellow American Ryan Palmer (63).""The first three days were kind of grind and go, play as low as you can,"" said Reed, who became the first player on the PGA Tour to post scores no worse than 63 in each of the first three rounds.""But Sundays are always a little harder, as everyone knows, and also the flags are a little tougher. I just tried to stick to the game plan, tried to post a decent number.""World number six Zach Johnson, who clinched his 11th PGA Tour title at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii earlier this month, sensationally birdied the last five holes for a best-of-the-week 10-under 62.Johnson's flawless round left him in a tie for third at 25-under with fellow American Justin Leonard (65), and he will now take a four-week break before returning to the PGA Tour for the February 19-23 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona.Little-known American Brendon Todd applied early pressure on playing partner Reed with four birdies in the first six holes but then lost momentum as he closed with a 69 to share sixth place at 23 under with 2010 champion Bill Haas (67). Most eyes on Sunday, however, were focused firmly on Reed in his bid to become only the second wire-to-wire winner at the pro-am event, compatriot Rik Massengale having achieved the feat in 1977 when the tournament was played over 90 holes.COMMANDING LEAD His commanding overnight lead at an event known for its low scoring in the California desert was cut to six after James Driscoll birdied the first two holes, before Reed recorded a two-putt birdie at the par-five second to get to 28 under. Todd then piled on pressure with birdies at the second, third and fourth - the last of them a perfectly judged 14-foot putt - to trim Reed's advantage to five.Though Todd faltered with a bogey at the par-three fifth where his tee shot ended up in water, Reed also dropped a stroke there after chipping to nine feet and missing the par putt.Both Todd and Reed birdied the par-five sixth after reaching the green in two before Reed's lead was cut to four when he bogeyed the seventh, after finding rough off the tee.If Reed felt any pressure, he was a picture of ice-cool calm playing the par-four eighth where he struck a superb approach to four feet and sank the birdie putt, then parred the ninth to reach the turn five ahead of the chasing pack. However, he bogeyed the 10th after finding a fairway bunker off the tee and soon after was just three strokes in front when Leonard knocked in a four-foot birdie putt at the par-five 11th.Reed rebounded with a birdie of his own at the 11th after reaching the green in two and two-putting before apparently succumbing to nerves with an ugly bogey at the par-three 12th, where he chunked his second shot from a greenside bunker.Johnson's sizzling five-birdie finish briefly trimmed Reed's lead to just two but the burly American immediately rebounded with a birdie at the par-three 15th, pumping his right fist in delight after draining an 18-foot putt.Reed surprisingly missed a birdie attempt from only six feet at the par-three 17th but rock-solid pars on the last three holes earned him his second PGA Tour victory, having claimed his maiden title at last year's Wyndham Championship.He also became the event's second youngest winner after Jack Nicklaus, who triumphed in 1963 aged 23 years and 13 days.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Gene Cherry/Peter Rutherford)",2014-01-20,HUM,"Sun Jan 19, 2014 | 9:22pm EST",Reed triumphs by two shots at La Quinta,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSBREA0J02620140120?type=companyNews
3,"  Patrick Reed has long strived to prove he belongs among the game's elite and he took a big step in that direction after ending a record-breaking week with a two-shot victory at the Humana Challenge in La Quinta, California.Not only did the burly American become the first player ever on the PGA Tour to post scores no worse than 63 in each of the first three rounds but he earned a seal of approval from former U.S. president Bill Clinton after securing the win.Midway through Reed's post-victory news conference, he took a phone call from Clinton, a keen amateur golfer whose own charitable foundation officially linked up with the Humana Challenge in 2012.""He was congratulating me, not only on a great win, but also told me to get myself back in that zone more often,"" a smiling Reed told reporters when asked what the former U.S. president had said to him.""He said it was a lot of fun to watch and ... how cool and calm and collected I was all week. And that's key out here. You have to be. To hear that not only from others, but also hear it from the president, that's special.""Reed, who clinched his maiden PGA Tour victory at last year's Wyndham Championship where he beat rookie sensation Jordan Spieth in a playoff, felt had proved himself among his peers with the high quality of his golf at La Quinta. ""I always play to try to prove to everybody that I belong out here, not only out here on the PGA Tour, but also with the best players in the world,"" Reed said after following his three opening nine-under-par 63s with a closing 71.""What I did this week with rattling off 63 three days in a row, and then being able to coast in with a victory, definitely shows that ... 63 three days in a row has never been done before.""WIGGLE ROOM  Though Reed had his commanding overnight lead of seven shots trimmed to just two during Sunday's final round, he always felt he had enough wiggle room to hold on for victory.""I started towards the end playing for par, just because I knew pars weren't going to hurt me,"" he said after mixing five birdies with four bogeys to post a 28-under total of 260.""I had a five-shot lead or four-shot lead going into the back nine, so I knew someone was going to have to do something spectacular to catch me. ""To come out and not have my full game and to have that much of a cushion to be able to just coast in, that's a good feeling. So I just coasted in, tried to make some pars.""Reed safely parred the last three holes, surprisingly missing a birdie attempt from six feet at the par-three 17th, before he was embraced by his wife Justine on the edge of the 18th green.Justine is expecting the couple's first child, a baby girl, in May and has handed over her usual caddying duties for her husband to her brother, Kessler Karain, for the past two PGA Tour events.""I can't wait to be a dad and have a little girl running around at the golf course and whenever I come home have her run up, hanging out with dad,"" said a beaming Reed, who earned $1.026 million for his second PGA Tour victory.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Gene Cherry)",2014-01-20,HUM,"Sun Jan 19, 2014 | 9:22pm EST",Triumphant Reed earns seal of approval from Clinton,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-reed-idUSBREA0J04220140120?type=companyNews
4,"   By Caroline Humer  Humana Inc said on Wednesday that it received 202,000 applications for Obamacare health insurance plans, many of them from young people, but still gave a wide forecast for 2014 profit as it waits to see the demographics of future customers.The U.S. health insurer made the disclosure as it reported a fourth-quarter loss due to a $243 million charge to set aside financial reserves for a group of long-term care policies that it no longer sells.President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare, set up state-based insurance exchanges to let individuals buy policies with income-based subsidies.Enrollment in exchange products has been hampered by technology problems both with HealthCare.gov, the online marketplace for 36 states, and in some of the other 14 states that run their own sites.In November, Obama asked insurers to allow old policies to be extended under political pressure to keep a promise he had made that people who liked their plan, could keep their plan. On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimate for total exchange enrollment to 6 million, citing these extensions. The government has said about 3 million people have signed up so far.Humana, which previously cut its outlook for sign-ups by at least half because of the technology failures, said it saw that more customers than usual were extending their old health plans.Because of the light enrollment, Humana said it expects that it will not get the proportion of healthy and sick customers that it had expected.Still, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said that its first look at enrollees so far shows that they are ""scaling a bit more to the younger side.""Young people, typically defined as adults under age 35, have fewer medical problems and are less expensive to insure, making them an important element to ensure the long-term viability of the exchanges.""This could potentially mitigate some of the adverse impact associated with the risk pool deterioration from our higher membership in non-ACA compliant plans,"" Broussard said, in reference to plans that do not meet the criteria of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Humana also said that costs of these patients interacting with its customer service centers have been higher than it anticipated.WAITING ON PRIVATE MEDICARE RATES Broussard also painted an uncertain outlook for its private Medicare Advantage business, which accounts for two-thirds of its revenue. The government is expected to announce 2015 reimbursement rates for private Medicare on February 21 that he said could cut funding by 6 percent to 7 percent.Humana shares fell 1.3 percent to $96.25 while shares of competitors Aetna Inc, UnitedHealth Group Inc, WellPoint Inc and Cigna gained. Aetna and Cigna also report this week.""It all falls back to Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates and what is going to end up being the ultimate enrollment demographics for the exchanges. It looks pretty reasonable to me for the most part, but there is still a lot of uncertainty,"" said Vishnu Lekraj, an analyst at Morningstar. Humana's number of exchange applications - 202,000 by January 31 - compares with the 400,000 people that competitor WellPoint Inc said it had signed up on the exchanges when it announced results last month. Both are in 14 states.For 2014, Humana said it expected its total individual membership, which includes plans sold to people outside the exchanges, to be flat to up 100,000.Besides health plans, Humana also provides dental, vision and other supplemental health and financial products. Most of its revenue comes from the sale of private Medicare plans.Humana said that it still expected to spend 50 cents to 90 cents per share on investment and startup expenses for new state-based Medicaid contracts and the state-based insurance exchanges this year, affirming details it gave in January.The company also backed its 2014 earnings outlook, also presented in January, of $7.25 to $7.75 per share, compared with $7.73 in 2013. LOSS REFLECTS POLICYHOLDER COSTS Humana reported a fourth-quarter loss of $30 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with year-earlier earnings of $192 million, or $1.19 per share.Excluding the 99-cent-per-share expense, the company would have posted a profit of 80 cents per share. On that basis, analysts were expecting earnings of 94 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $10.19 billion from $9.56 billion as the company's individual and Medicare businesses signed up more people.The company spent 85.8 percent of its policy premiums on benefits, up from 83.7 percent a year earlier, due primarily to the $243 million set aside to strengthen reserves in that closed block of long-term care policies that it took on in 2007 with the acquisition of KMG America.Humana said it had adjusted the reserves to reflect policyholder longevity, increased in-home healthcare use and lower interest rates.Humana said it is considering strategic alternatives for that business.During the quarter, Humana said costs increased in its retail segment because of spending on the exchanges and Medicaid contracts as well as some higher marketing expenses for new Medicare products.(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Jan Paschal)",2014-02-05,HUM,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 1:37pm EST",Humana says young people signing up for Obamacare,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-humana-results-idUSBREA140MJ20140205?type=companyNews

8,"  NEW YORK Feb 19 A flurry of bearish bets placed Wednesday in the options for some health insurers caught the eye of several analysts, who said it appears that someone is banking on a sizeable drop in their stocks by the end of the week, which is also when 2015 Medicare payment rates are expected from the government.The most aggressive activity occurred in options on UnitedHealth Group Inc's shares, with a spate of purchases of puts that would benefit from a drop in the stock.According to options analytics firm TradeAlert, a trader bought 2,053 contracts of February puts at a strike price of $71, which is about 3.5 percent lower than the stock's current price of $73.55. These contracts will expire on Friday, and it has been more than two months since the stock has seen that large a move lower over a two-day period.The February $72 puts also saw heavy activity, according to TradeAlert. Volume was brisker than normal.""Given that other trades are usually 200-300 contracts (in the stock), this purchase, which was made so close to expiration, definitely seems to be some sort of speculative move if there is news coming out,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. Options activity in Humana Inc also perked up, with one of the most active contracts being some weekly February $94 puts that expire Feb. 28, as well as some monthly Feb $92.35 puts that expire on Friday. Both strike prices are substantially below the stock's $101.98 closing price on Wednesday.The activity comes ahead of a key government announcement due as early as this week about next year's expected Medicare reimbursement rates, a key revenue source for both UnitedHealth and Humana. It has jolted these stocks before. Just about one year ago, the stocks took a pounding when Medicare Advantage plan payment rates were forecast to be cut under a preliminary proposal from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Humana's shares plunged 6.4 percent in one day, while UnitedHealth's stock shed 3.7 percent over two days.The stocks rebounded sharply just over a month later when the final payment rates did not reflect as large a cut as originally proposed. Meanwhile, readings of implied volatility, a key component of options prices, have been rising for both stocks ahead of the expected announcement.The 30-day at-the-money implied call and put volatilities for United National Health were at around 23 on Wednesday, the highest level since before the company's third-quarter earnings announcement in October, according to Thomson Reuters data. The level was also higher than ahead of last year's Medicare rate announcement.In Humana, the 30-day implied volatility  options as well, up to nearly 40 percent from a day ago and at the highest level in nearly a year.As implied volatility rises, options premiums, or prices, typically follow suit, reflecting the elevated risk to the seller in the event of an outsized move in the stock.",2014-02-20,HUM,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 7:20pm EST",Bearish bets seen on U.S. insurers ahead of Medicare rate announcement,http://www.reuters.com//article/medicare-insurers-options-idUSL2N0LO24F20140220?type=companyNews

18,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, March 11  NEW YORK, March 11 U.S. health insurers are struggling to set prices for their Obamacare plans in 2015 and decide which regions to return to before the deadlines for submitting those plans to regulators.Some insurers already expect to lose money this year following the rocky launch of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, which aims to provide coverage to millions of uninsured Americans with the help of government subsidies. The rollout was marred by technical errors that held up early enrollment, last-minute regulatory changes and steady political opposition from Republicans.For 2015, insurers must describe their health plans and proposed rates to state and federal regulators starting in April and May. But before they do, some of the most important factors that go into those decisions may not be known, from the size of the doctor and hospital networks that the federal government will approve to final 2014 enrollment figures and the relative health of their new plan holders.Without that data, said Jon Urbanek, senior vice president of commercial markets at Florida's market-leading Blue Cross Blue Shield, ""I can't tell you exactly yet that we've decided about counties and products and all those pieces, but we feel like participating in the marketplaces is very consistent with our mission.""Cigna Corp Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said the nation's fifth-largest insurer was still undecided on which if any new markets it might enter, although ""that decision needs to be made in short order,"" he said in an interview.The result, industry executives and experts say, is that some of the larger insurers may pull out of individual markets where they already know they can't make money. Otherwise they will try to hold steady until 2016, when the number of people on Obamacare plans is expected to surge as high as 22 million.Some smaller insurers offering health plans in 2014 may back out altogether if they can't afford to ride out the program's early troubles.""There will be some sort of a shakeout,"" said Tim Jost, a health law expert and professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia. Small health plans and cooperatives that priced their health coverage too high and got few customers are among the most vulnerable, he said. ""On the other hand, (the national insurers) have been watching the markets, and if 2014 turns out to look better than expected, they may jump in,"" Jost said.John Morrison, who founded The National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs, a trade group, was more optimistic about the small insurers. He said the coops have low overhead and are required to keep enough capital on hand to last them into at least the second or third year of the exchanges. They will all be open, he believes, and enrolling new customers in 2015.PRICE, POLICY SURPRISES  A handful of large insurers have won most of the customers so far among more than 100 active on the Obamacare marketplaces in the 50 states. By their own estimates, WellPoint, Aetna Inc, Humana Inc, and Health Net  together pulled in about 970,000 enrollment applications by the end of January out of about 3 million nationwide at that time.But large insurers including Cigna and Aetna said they do not expect to make money this year on the new Obamacare exchanges.In January, Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini suggested that the company's participation in 2015 could depend on whether the administration would allow it to raise rates enough to cover expenses.""Are (rate increases) going to be double-digit, and are we going to get beat up because of the double digit, or are we going to just have to pull out of the program? Those questions can't be answered until we see the population we have today,"" he said in an interview with cable news channel CNBC.

As of early February it had signed up 168,000 people in California and Arizona.""I feel like we're all in and we are happy we are,"" Health Net Inc CEO Jay Gellert told investors in January.Insurers are also bracing for more late policy changes that could disrupt the Obamacare business model. Just last week the administration said it would allow insurers to extend by two more years health policies that were supposed to end in 2014 because they don't comply with the healthcare law.""We expect consumers will continue to have a robust number of plan choices available to them for the 2015 open enrollment season as insurance companies compete for the business of millions of Americans seeking coverage with the assistance of tax credits,"" said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Obamacare marketplaces.Actuaries, who help insurers calculate what rates to charge, note that the government's most recent guidance to the industry, in the form of a 300-page report released last week, raised new questions on how to predict the Obamacare market in 2015.For instance, the government said it is still considering what percentage of health insurance premiums paid to insurers must be used to cover medical expenses rather than administrative costs, a decision that could directly impact industry profits.""Even when something is a final rule it has not meant that it is not subject to further change,"" said Hans Leida, an actuary at Milliman, referring to the government's regulation of Obamacare.

Many of them were previously uninsured.Humana is seeking to raise Obamacare premium rates by single to double-digit percentages for 2015, in part to offset declining risk payments next year. Humana is ""just beginning"" to work with state and federal regulators on how the individual exchange business will transition off these payments, which mostly end after 2016.Obama's healthcare reform law, which is vehemently opposed by Republicans, is being scrutinized to determine if its costs will be sustainable.

Humana said it has received 700,000 applications for individual healthcare plans for 2014, putting it on track to be one of the largest players on the exchanges. Humana said it has studied the pharmacy claims of its early enrollees and that their health appears in line with previous expectations.

28,"   By Susan Kelly | June 2  June 2 Managed care company Humana Inc  has filed a lawsuit against Medtronic Inc accusing the medical device maker of falsely representing its Infuse bone growth-stimulation product as safe and effective in spinal fusion surgeries.The suit, filed on Friday in federal court in Tennessee, alleges that Medtronic paid for academic literature that fraudulently portrayed the product as safe and effective for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Humana said it paid for the use of Infuse, a bioengineered bone protein, when less expensive and more medically sound alternative procedures were available.It said Medtronic engaged in a ""sophisticated and deeply deceptive marketing strategy"" to expand the market for Infuse, paying and encouraging spine surgeons to use the product by overstating its benefits while minimizing serious risks. Medtronic, in a separate statement, said the product's label has reflected its risks from the time of FDA approval in 2002.""Medtronic strongly believes that the safety profile reported to the FDA and detailed in product labeling support the continued safe use of Infuse Bone Graft for approved indications,"" the company said.Medtronic also said it ""vigorously disagrees with any suggestion that the company improperly influenced peer-reviewed published manuscripts."" Physicians are compensated for intellectual property rights and for legitimate and documented consulting services provided to the company, Medtronic said.Independent reviews of the product initiated by Medtronic last year determined that Infuse works as well as traditional bone grafts taken from patients, but may not be as safe. The reviews were prompted by questions raised by spine experts and U.S. lawmakers about the safety of the product, which contains a genetically engineered protein known recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 to promote bone growth.Infuse was once hailed as a major advance in spinal fusion surgery, offering an alternative to painful bone harvesting from other parts of the body to perform a bone graft.But in 2011, Infuse became the subject of investigations by the U.S. Senate and Department of Justice over off-label use of the product and omissions of safety problems from its clinical trial data.The product also drew intense public scrutiny after the influential Spine Journal ran an entire issue criticizing it in June 2011, charging that surgeons who were paid tens of millions of dollars by Medtronic failed to report serious complications such as male sterility, increased risk of cancer, infections, pain and bone dissolution.

29,"  U.S. health insurer Humana Inc reported a lower profit owing to higher costs on Wednesday, as mounting concerns about increased medical spending drove health insurance industry shares lower for a second straight day.Humana said its higher costs were related to medical spending by new enrollees in the exchanges created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, investments for those exchanges and costly new hepatitis C drug treatments.Humana shares fell 6.5 percent to $119.26, while WellPoint Inc, which also announced earnings on Wednesday, declined 1.9 percent to $110.45. Aetna Inc, which reported higher medical costs on Tuesday, fell 3.8 percent, UnitedHealth Group Inc declined 2.7 percent and Cigna, which reports on Thursday, fell 1.9 percent.Investor concerns about rising costs coincide with a rise in the rate of people with health insurance. The Obamacare exchanges signed up 8 million people for their first year in 2014, while enrollment in the government's Medicaid program for the poor has swelled by 7 million. Hospitals including HCA Holdings Inc have reported increased use of their services. ""Moving forward, the economy should increase utilization of services and plan costs should go up accordingly. That's just natural when the economy starts to pick up and people use healthcare benefits a little bit more liberally,"" Morningstar Research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said. U.S. economic growth rebounded in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.  Humana's second-quarter net income fell to $344 million, or $2.19 per share, from $420 million, or $2.63 a share, a year earlier. That was in line with analysts' estimates.Most of Humana's revenue is from Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, the privately run medical and drug plans under the government health program for older people and the disabled. But revenue from Obamacare and other individual plans became a larger portion of its business, rising to $852 million from $241 million a year earlier.    Total revenue rose 18 percent to $12.2 billion. Both Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D added new customers. The company's individual customer base increased 122 percent to more than 1.1 million members. Humana's medical benefit expense ratio, or the percentage of premiums spent on medical services, fell to 83.1 percent from 83.4 percent. Those ratios were higher in its retail and employer group, partly due to the cost of a new drug for hepatitis C from Gilead Sciences Inc, Humana said. Humana said it is losing money on its new Obamacare exchange customers but expects to break even in that market during 2015. Higher use of medical services by these consumers should taper off as it has in other businesses, Humana said.Humana predicted 2014 earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.75, lower than a Wall Street consensus of $7.84.

34,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB' ratings assigned  to Humana Inc.'s (HUM) senior unsecured notes and the 'A' Insurer Financial  Strength (IFS) ratings assigned to various Humana insurance company  subsidiaries. The Rating Outlooks are Stable.  HUM's 'A' IFS ratings reflect financial metrics and performance that in recent  years have generally been supportive of 'AA' category IFS ratings and the impact  of the companies' concentrations in the Medicare market in the U.S., the  characteristics of which Fitch views as supportive of IFS ratings in the 'A' to  'BBB' rating categories.         KEY RATING DRIVERS Industry Profile and Operating Environment: Fitch believes that the U.S.  Government's ability to set reimbursement rates and influence conditions in the  Medicare Advantage market makes it difficult for health insurers with Medicare  Advantage membership concentrations, such as HUM to generate sustained  EBITDA-based margins and capital stability required to support IFS ratings  higher than 'A'. Fitch views on-going federal government fiscal pressures and  heightened demands on Medicare tied to the aging U.S. population, as factors  that effectively limit the ratings levels of health insurers with membership  concentrations in Medicare Advantage. Favorably from a ratings perspective,  Fitch believes that these same fiscal and demographic pressures contribute to  consistent demand for Medicare Advantage products.  Market Position and Size/Scale: Fitch views HUM as maintaining 'medium' sized  market position and size/scale characteristics. Under Fitch's health insurance  rating guidelines, such characteristics are consistent with 'A' category IFS  ratings. HUM maintains a leading market share in the Medicare Advantage market  and the company's membership is well diversified throughout the country.  Additionally, HUM has built integrated delivery capabilities, primarily through  acquisitions, in geographic regions where the company maintains significant  membership. Fitch believes that HUM maintains large membership and revenue bases  that the help the company generate significant amounts of EBITDA and capital and  benefit from economies of scale.  Financial Performance and Earnings: Fitch believes that HUM's financial  performance and earnings over the next 12-24 months will remain supportive of  the company's ratings. Fitch's view is that HUM's market position, size and  scale characteristics and benefits derived from aspects of the company's  integrated care delivery capabilities will help offset margin pressure from  consistent reductions in Medicare funding rates, the Affordable Care Act's (ACA)  imposition of an 85% minimum benefit ratio on Medicare Advantage products, and  various ACA-related fees.  In recent years HUM's financial performance has been strong relative to Fitch's  'A' category guidelines. In the first half of 2014 HUM generated $24 billion of  revenues and $1.6 billion of EBITDA. The company's 1H'14 ratios of  EBITDA-to-revenues and annualized net return on average capital were 6.7X and  11.8% respectively and from 2011-2013 these ratios averaged 6.4% and 12.9%.  Capitalization and Financial Leverage: Fitch views HUM's targeted capitalization  and financial leverage metrics to be consistent with those expected at the 'A'  IFS rating category, while the company's reported metrics for the past several  years have been more consistent with those expected at the 'AA' rating category.  At June 30, 2014 HUM's ratio of debt-to-annualized EBITDA was 0.8X and its  financial leverage ratio was 21%. From 2011-2013 these ratios averaged 0.9x and  21% respectively. The company targets a debt-to-capital ratio of 25%-30% and  Fitch believes that debt-funded acquisitions and share repurchases are potential  ways in which HUM may manage its debt-to-capital ratio toward its target.    Debt Service Capabilities and Financial Flexibility: HUM's debt service  capabilities and financial flexibility have historically been consistent with  Fitch's 'AA' rating category guidelines.   The company's operating EBITDA-based  interest coverage ratio through 1H'14 was 23.0X and from 2011- 2013 averaged  21.2x. HUM has access to an untapped $1 billion credit facility that expires in  2018. At June 30, 2014, the company maintained $11.1 billion of cash and  high-quality and liquid investment securities that exceeded the value of its  medical benefit and future policy benefit reserves by $4 billion.    RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade of HUM's ratings are:  --Over the longer term, an improved outlook for Medicare Advantage funding;  --Reduced near-term uncertainty surrounding the impact on HUM's margins of the  Affordable Care Act's (ACA) minimum medical benefit ratio and industry-wide fees  designed to fund portions of the ACA;        --A reduction in HUM's targeted debt-to-capital ratio to 20% and increase in the  company's organization-wide NAIC RBC to 350%;  --Financial metrics, especially interest coverage and EBITDA/revenue margin  ratios that approximate current levels.    Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings are:  --Over the longer-term, a deterioration in the outlook for Medicare Advantage  funding;  --EBITDA-based interest coverage and EBITDA/revenue ratios below 7x and 5%,  respectively; --Debt-to-annualized (prior four quarters) EBITDA ratios above 1.5x;  --HUM increasing its targeted or reported financial leverage ratio above 30% or  reducing its organization-wide NAIC RBC ratio target below 200%; --Acquisitions that Fitch views as aggressively financed or containing an  excessive amount of integration risk.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Humana, Inc.  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook; --$500 million of 6.45% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2016 at 'BBB'; --$500 million of 7.2% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2018 at 'BBB';  --$300 million of 6.3% senior unsecured notes due Aug. 1, 2018 at 'BBB';  --$600 million of 3.15% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 1, 2022 at 'BBB'; --$250 million of 8.15% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2038 affirmed at  'BBB'; --$400 million of 4.625% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 1, 2042 at 'BBB'.

35,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB(EXP)' rating to  Humana Inc.'s (HUM) planned issuance of senior notes of various maturities. The  ratings are equivalent to Fitch's ratings on HUM's currently outstanding senior  notes.  Fitch anticipates HUM using proceeds from the planned issue to redeem $500  million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016 or for general corporate  purposes, which Fitch believes may include share repurchases. On Sept. 16, HUM  announced that its board had approved a new $2 billion share repurchase plan.  Prior to today, Fitch's most recent rating action on HUM was on Aug. 14, 2014  when it affirmed the 'BBB' ratings on the company's senior notes and the 'A'  Insurer Financial Strength ratings on certain HUM subsidiaries.    KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects the planned issuance and planned use of proceeds, to increase  HUM's financial leverage ratio to 25-30% from 21% at June 30, 2014. Under this  scenario HUM's ratio of debt-to-annualized EBITDA is likely to be 1.3x-1.5x  compared with 0.8x at June 30, 2014. Fitch considers these post-planned issue  financial leverage metrics consistent with those expected at HUM's current  ratings levels.       Fitch projects HUM's operating-EBITDA-based interest coverage ratio at  approximately 15x a decline from 2013's 17.6x but strongly supportive of HUM's  ratings. In recent years HUM's financial performance has been strong relative to  Fitch's 'A' category guidelines. In the first half of 2014 HUM generated $24  billion of revenues and $1.6 billion of EBITDA. The company's 1H'14 ratios of  EBITDA-to-revenues and annualized net return on average capital were 6.7X and  11.8% respectively and from 2011-2013 these ratios averaged 6.4% and 12.9%.  In addition to the financial metrics cited above, other key factors impacting  HUM's ratings are Fitch's views on the credit-quality of the Medicare market and  HUM's position within the Medicare market. Fitch believes that it will be  difficult for HUM to generate sustained EBITDA-based margins and capital  stability required to support IFS ratings higher than 'A' and senior debt  ratings higher than 'BBB' due to the U.S. Government's ability to set  reimbursement rates and influence conditions in the Medicare market. Fitch views HUM as maintaining 'medium' sized market position and size/scale  characteristics. Under Fitch's health insurance rating guidelines, these are  consistent with 'A' category IFS ratings. HUM maintains a leading market share  in the Medicare Advantage market. Additionally, HUM has built integrated  delivery capabilities in geographic regions where the company maintains  significant membership. Fitch believes that HUM maintains large membership and  revenue bases that the help the company generate significant amounts of EBITDA  and capital and benefit from economies of scale.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade of HUM's ratings are:  --Over the longer term, an improved outlook for Medicare Advantage funding;  --Reduced near-term uncertainty surrounding the impact on HUM's margins of the  Affordable Care Act's (ACA) minimum medical benefit ratio and industry-wide fees  designed to fund portions of the ACA;        --A reduction in HUM's targeted debt-to-capital ratio to 20% and increase in the  company's organization-wide NAIC RBC to 350%;  --Financial metrics, especially interest coverage and EBITDA/revenue margin  ratios that approximate current levels.   Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings are:  --Over the longer-term, a deterioration in the outlook for Medicare Advantage  funding;  --EBITDA-based interest coverage and EBITDA/revenue ratios below 7x and 5%,  respectively; --Debt-to-annualized (prior four quarters) EBITDA ratios above 1.5x;  --HUM increasing its targeted or reported financial leverage ratio above 30% or  reducing its organization-wide NAIC RBC ratio target below 200%; --Acquisitions that Fitch views as aggressively financed or containing an  excessive amount of integration risk.

36,"   By Caroline Humer | BOSTON  BOSTON New competition between health insurers offering so-called Obamacare plans in 2015 is having an impact on the pricing of such coverage, based on a first look at proposed insurance premiums, the head of Humana Inc said on Wednesday.The state insurance exchanges offering coverage under the Affordable Care Act. President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law will begin enrolling customers for 2015 benefits in mid-November. Now in its second year, Obamacare is attracting health insurers to offer plans in more states after over 8 million people enrolled for coverage in 2014.The country's largest insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc, sold Obamacare plans in only a few states in 2014. But for 2015, it will sell plans in about two dozen states. Aetna Inc, Cigna Corp, WellPoint Inc and Humana have said they would stick to most of their markets.""United is coming in. There is more competition coming into the marketplace. It's going to make us all a little bit more competitive,"" Humana Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said in an interview.He said that larger insurers are pricing their premiums within a narrower range of about 10 percent in many markets. That strategy contrasts with 2014, when Obamacare plan pricing showed much greater variation. Humana will sell plans in 15 states for 2015 and has asked for premium rate increases of 3 percent to the 20 percent range, depending on the market. Last year, large insurers were hesitant to enter the new marketplace, concerned by conservatives' political opposition as well as federal regulations that required that the plans be available to any individual regardless of age or health status.When the exchanges first launched in October 2013, technology failures crippled the federal enrollment website, Healthcare.gov, and many websites run by individual states. But as the government fixed those problems, enrollment came in ahead of forecast. Now many insurers expect their Obamacare business to have profit margins of 2 percent to 3 percent within a few years, based on government forecasts for the market to grow to 13 million people in 2015 and 25 million by 2017.Broussard said insurers may grapple with customer churn as consumers seek better prices as well as more technology problems as existing customers try to re-enroll either in the same plan or in a new plan for 2015. Humana, which has about 700,000 members enrolled in Obamacare plans, has a large business providing medical benefits and prescription drug plans under the Medicare program for the elderly, and sees a risk posed by pricey new drugs expected to reach the U.S. market in the next few years.Insurers are already calling for a change in how new drugs are priced after paying more than they expected for Gilead Sciences Inc's new $84,000 Hepatitis C treatment. New personalized treatments for cancer and an experimental class of cholesterol fighting drugs are seen inflating those costs further.""We've had a great trend over the last couple of years in healthcare cost staying flat or decreasing,"" Broussard said. ""If these drugs come out at the price they are, I think you are going to see a reversal of that.""

37,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published a new report detailing  key credit metrics of nine-publicly-traded U.S. health insurance and managed  care companies that are either rated or followed by Fitch: Aetna, Inc., Centene  Corp., Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc., Humana, Inc., Molina Health Care Inc.  UnitedHealth Group, Incorporated, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. and WellPoint,  Inc.  The report is meant to be used as a desktop guide, providing financial data and  rankings, key credit strengths and concerns, and current ratings levels and  rating sensitivities. Fitch views the key credit metrics of these nine publicly traded health insurers  as improving in the first half of 2014 compared to the prior year period. Strong  revenue growth driven by the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchanges and Medicaid  expansion, continuing popularity of Medicare Advantage products and  acquisition-related growth generated increases in EBITDA that more than offset  declining margins. Interest coverage ratios improved, and leverage ratios  declined modestly. The first section of the report includes company rankings based on revenue  growth, EBITDA margin and returns on capital as well as capitalization measures  such as debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage. The second section of the report  provides a more detailed discussion of the nine individual companies including  credit strengths and concerns, ratings and rating triggers (where applicable),  and detailed information about each company's capital structure.

38,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'B/RR1' rating to  the new $350 million secured FILO term loan and a 'CCC+/RR3' to the $1,025  million secured B-4 term loan that is being launched at Toys 'R' Us - Delaware,  Inc.(Toys-Delaware) this week.  The new term loans will be used to repay the  $646 million B-1 term loan and $350 million of the 7.375% senior secured term  loans, both due Sept. 1, 2016.  The company will also refinance up to $380  million of the $580 million of B-2 and B-3 term loans. Toys-Delaware will seek  amendments to the term loan and asset-backed loan (ABL) credit agreements to  complete these transactions.    Effective this refinancing, Fitch has downgraded the remaining $200 million B-2  and B-3 term loans to 'CCC/RR4' from 'CCC+/RR3'. Fitch has also downgraded the  $450 million 10.375% senior unsecured notes due August 2017 and $400 million  7.375% senior unsecured notes due October 2018 at Toys 'R' Us, Inc. (Toys,  HoldCo) to 'CC/RR6' from 'CCC-/RR5', given the structural enhancements provided  to the new loans discussed under the 'Recovery Analysis and Considerations'  section. The transaction will address all of Toys-Delaware's 2016 maturities and a  portion of 2018 maturities. This will push Toy's next maturities to 2017 when  $1.175 billion of debt comes due. Fitch has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) on Toys and its various  domestic subsidiaries at 'CCC'. A full list of rating actions follows at the end  of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings on Toys reflects the company's weak top-line and EBITDA trends  and weakening liquidity position given Fitch's expectation of negative free cash  flow (FCF). Toys' adjusted EBITDA declined materially to $521 million in 2013  from the average $1 billion range posted in the last few years. Fitch expects  EBITDA to remain depressed at $475 million to $550 million over the next three  years, relative to approximately $800 million required annually to cover cash  interest expense, capex and modest taxes.  While Toys reported positive comparable store sales (comps) growth in the first  half of 2014, Fitch expects Toys' comps will remain flat to modestly negative  over the intermediate term given the weakness in its major categories such as  juvenile (approximately 30% of Toys' total sales) and sustained weakness in the  entertainment category (11% of total sales) due to low birth rates and ongoing  secular pressure on the category.  The company faces intensified pricing competition from both discount and online  retailers. Despite Toys' multichannel strategy and series of product and service  initiatives, Fitch believes it will be expensive and difficult for Toys to  compete on pricing and retain its market share without sacrificing margins.  Fitch estimates that Toys would need to grow sales by 1.5% to 2% and have flat  to modestly improved gross margin to generate annual EBITDA in the $725 million  range to cover annual cash interest expense of $415 million to $420 million  post-refinancing, capex of $250 million and modest cash taxes. However,  achieving this level is likely challenging without significantly lowering its  cost structure and controlling inventory levels.  Fitch expects 2014 EBITDA to be in the $475 million-$500 million range, assuming  flat comps and flat-to-modest lower gross margin for the second half of the  year. Assuming similar trends for 2015/2016, Fitch expects EBITDA to remain at  these levels or modestly better with some modest SG&A reduction given that Toys  will need to make further investments in sharpening its prices, growing its  online business and improving store presentation and service. Fitch expects leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) to be mid-9x and FCF to be  negative $300 million, excluding significant working capital swings in 2014 and  2015. Availability under the ABL revolver during peak working capital season is  expected to be around $700 million in 2014 and $400 million to $450 million in  2015. This indicates adequate liquidity over the next 24 months but concerns  remain around declining liquidity and significant debt maturities in 2017  ($1.175 billion) and 2018 ($600 million).  RECOVERY ANALYSIS AND CONSIDERATIONS For issuers with IDRs at 'B+' and below, Fitch performs a recovery analysis for  each class of obligations of the issuer. Issue ratings are derived from the IDR  and the relevant Recovery Rating and notching based on the expected recoveries  in a distressed scenario of each of the company's debt issues and loans. Toys'  debt is at three types of entities: operating companies (OpCo); property  companies (PropCo); and HoldCo, with a summary structure highlighted below: Toys 'R' Us, Inc. (HoldCo) (I) Toys 'R' Us-Delaware, Inc. (Toys-Delaware) is a subsidiary of HoldCo. (a) Toys 'R' Us Canada (Toys-Canada) is a subsidiary of Toys-Delaware. (b) Toys 'R' Us Property Co. II, LLC (PropCo II) is a subsidiary of  Toys-Delaware. (II) Toys 'R' Us Property Co. I, LLC (PropCo I) is a subsidiary of HoldCo. OpCo Debt Fitch takes the higher of liquidation value or enterprise value (based on  5.0x-5.5x multiple applied to the stressed EBITDA) at the OpCo levels -  Toys-Delaware and Toys-Canada.  The 5.0x-5.5x is consistent with the low end of  the 10-year valuation for the public retail space and Fitch's average distressed  multiple across the retail portfolio. The stressed liquidation or enterprise  value (EV) is adjusted for 10% administrative claims.  Toys-Canada Toys has a $1.85 billion ABL revolver with Toys Delaware as the lead borrower,  and this contains a $200 million sub-facility in favor of Canadian borrowers.  Any assets of the Canadian borrower and its subsidiaries secure only the  Canadian liabilities under the ABL facility. The $200 million sub-facility is  more than adequately covered by the EV calculated based on stressed EBITDA at  the Canadian subsidiary. Therefore, the fully recovered sub-facility is  reflected in the recovery of the consolidated $1.85 billion revolver discussed  below.  The residual value of approximately $200 million is applied toward certain debt  at Toys-Delaware.  Toys-Delaware At the Delaware level, the recovery on the various debt tranches is based on  the: (1)liquidation value of the domestic assets at the Toys-Delaware level  estimated at $1.75 billion; (2) estimated value for Toys' trademarks and IP  assets (which are held at Geoffrey, LLC (IPCo) as a wholly owned subsidiary of  Toys-Delaware; (3) equity residual from Toys-Canada; and (4) the benefit to the  new B-4 term loan from an unsecured guarantee from the indirect parent of PropCo  I.  The $1.85 billion revolver is secured by a first lien on inventory and  receivables of Toys-Delaware. In allocating an appropriate recovery, Fitch has  considered the liquidation value of domestic inventory and receivables assumed  at seasonal peak (at the end of the third quarter), and has applied advance  rates of 75% and 80%, respectively. Fitch assumes $1.3 billion or approximately  70% of the facility commitment is drawn under the revolver. The facility is  fully recovered and is therefore rated 'B/RR1'.  The new financing at Toys-Delaware will consist of a new $350 million FILO term  loan and $1,025 million B-4 term loan. The new term loans will be used to repay  the $646 million B-1 term loan and $350 million of the 7.375% senior secured  term loans, both due Sept. 1, 2016.  The company will also refinance up to $380  million of the $580 million of B-2 and B-3 term loans. The FILO term loan will be secured by the same collateral as the existing $1.85  billion ABL facility and will rank second in repayment priority relative to the  ABL.  The proposed FILO Tranche will be governed by the residual borrowing base  within the ABL facility and will benefit from a lien against 50% of the  estimated value of real estate at Toys-Canada.  Fitch has assigned a 'B/RR1'  rating to the FILO term loan based on outstanding recovery prospects (91%-100%)  as it benefits from the excess liquidation value of domestic inventory and A/R  and the recovery on the Canadian real estate.  The new B-4 term loan will benefit from the same credit support as the existing  B-2 and B-3 term loans which includes a first lien on all present and future IP,  trademarks, copyrights, patents, websites and other intangible assets and a  second lien on the ABL collateral.  It will also benefit from an unsecured  guaranty by the indirect parent of PropCo I and will be secured by a first  priority pledge on two-thirds of the Canadian subsidiary stock.  After pro-rating the ascribed value of the IP assets (estimated at $400  million), the residual equity in Toys-Canada (of which half was applied to the  FILO term loan) and applying the benefit from the guaranty by the indirect  parent of PropCo I, the new loans are expected to have good recovery prospects  (51% to 70%), and are therefore assigned a rating of 'CCC+/RR3'. The $200 million in remaining B-2 and B-3 term loans have been downgraded to  'CCC/RR4' as they are expected to have average recovery prospects (31% to 50%)  mainly from their prorated claim against the IP assets.  The $22 million 8.75% debentures due Sept. 1, 2021, have poor recovery prospects  (0% to 10%) and are therefore rated 'CC/RR6'.  PropCo Debt At the PropCo levels - Toys 'R' Us Property Co. I, LLC; Toys 'R' Us Property Co.  II, LLC; and other international PropCos - LTM net operating income (NOI) is  stressed at 20%.  PropCo I and PropCo II are set up as bankruptcy-remote entities with a 20-year  master lease through 2029 covering all the properties, which requires  Toys-Delaware to pay all costs and expenses related to leasing these properties  from these two entities. The ratings on the PropCo debt reflect a distressed  capitalization rate of 12% applied to the stressed NOI of the properties to  determine a going-concern valuation. The stressed rates reflect downtime and  capital costs that would need to be incurred to re-tenant the space. Applying these assumptions to the $725 million 8.50% senior secured notes at  PropCo II and the $985 million senior unsecured term loan at PropCo I results in  recovery in excess of 90%. Therefore, these facilities are rated 'B/RR1'. The PropCo II notes are secured by 125 properties. The PropCo I unsecured term  loan facility benefits from a negative pledge on all PropCo I real estate assets  (343 properties). Fitch typically limits the Recovery Rating on unsecured debt  at 'RR2' or two notches above the IDR level (under its criteria 'Recovery  Ratings and Notching Criteria for Non-financial Corporate Issuers' dated Nov.  20, 2013). However, in the few instances where the recovery waterfall suggests  an 'RR1' rating and such a Recovery Rating is supported by the structural and  legal characteristics of the debt, unsecured debt may qualify for an 'RR1'  rating. In addition, the rating also benefits from the structural consideration  that Toys 'R' Us has limited capacity to secure debt using real estate given  that there is a limitation on principal property of domestic subsidiaries at 10%  of consolidated net tangible assets under the $400 million of 7.375% notes due  2018 issued by HoldCo. As described above, the residual value of $300 million after fully recovering  the $985 million term loan at PropCo I is applied towards the Delaware B-4 term  loan via an unsecured guaranty by the indirect parent of PropCo I.   Toys 'R' Us, Inc. - HoldCo Debt The $450 million 10.375% unsecured notes due Aug. 15, 2017, and the $400 million  7.375% unsecured notes due Oct. 15, 2018 will no longer benefit from the  residual value at PropCo I, as there is no residual value ascribed from  Toys-Delaware or other operating subsidiaries. Therefore the HoldCo debt and the  $577 million senior notes due to Toys-Delaware that are considered pari passu  with the publicly traded HoldCo notes have poor recovery prospects (0% to 10%)  and have been downgraded to 'CC/RR6' from 'CCC-/RR5'.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A negative rating action could result if comps trends in the U.S. and  international businesses revert to mid-single-digit declines and/or gross  margins decline by similar rates to 2013 without any offset from cost  reductions. This would indicate more severe market share losses and lead to  tighter liquidity than Fitch's current expectation over the next 18-24 months. A positive rating action could result if there is sustainable improvement in  Toys' store and online traffic, indicating improved market share positioning,  and meaningful cost restructuring. Toys would need to drive EBITDA improvement  to a level where it can meet its obligations of interest expense, capex and  taxes and fund any working capital swings, and manage refinancing of upcoming  debt maturities on a timely basis.  Fitch has taken the following rating action on Toys and its various  subsidiaries:  Toys 'R' Us, Inc.  --IDR affirmed at 'CCC'; --Senior unsecured notes downgraded to 'CC/RR6' from 'CCC-/RR5'. Toys 'R' Us - Delaware, Inc.  --IDR affirmed at 'CCC'; --Secured revolver affirmed at 'B/RR1'; --Secured FILO term loan assigned 'B/RR1'; --Secured B-4 term loan assigned 'CCC+/RR3'; --Secured B-2 and B-3 term loans downgraded to 'CCC/RR4' from 'CCC+/RR3'; --Senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'CC/RR6'. Toys 'R' Us Property Co. II, LLC  --IDR affirmed at 'CCC'; --Senior secured notes affirmed at 'B/RR1'. Toys 'R' Us Property Co.

The medical benefit ratio in the company's retail unit, its largest, increased to 83.3 percent in the fourth quarter from 82.7 percent a year earlier.The ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums.

54,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, March 30  NEW YORK, March 30 UnitedHealth Group Inc's  planned takeover of No. 4 U.S. pharmacy benefits provider Catamaran Corp will give the companies added heft in price talks with drug companies, serving as a catalyst for deals allowing other insurers to bulk up.The $12.8 billion deal comes at a time when Wall Street has been parsing the possibilities that top insurers like Aetna Inc  with Cigna Corp could pair up. Smaller companies like Health Net Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc or WellCare Health Plans Inc are also increasingly seen as takeover targets.""There has been chatter about large-scale M&A coming out of some recent investor conferences,"" Mizuho Securities senior healthcare analyst Sheryl Skolnick said. ""I don't know if $12.8 billion qualifies as large scale M&A in the space, but now you have the answer. Yes, there will be transactions.""Express Scripts Holdings Corp, the largest pharmacy benefit manager and the only stand-alone PBM, may be pressed to do a deal with a distribution company or pharmacy if margins become too tight, analysts said on Monday.The link-up could force a tie-up between Express Scripts and Walgreens Boots Alliance, for instance, which has pharmacy and drug distribution operations but no pharmacy management business, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Cherny said in a research report.That could put it at a disadvantage to CVS Health, the No. 2 pharmacy benefit manager which also owns one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains. Meanwhile, Envision RX, a small pharmacy benefit manager, recently announced plans to be bought by national drug store chain Rite Aid. Healthcare companies are able to use scale to negotiate better prices. Late last year, for instance, Express Scripts was able to negotiate a steep discount for an important hepatitis C drug from AbbVie Inc, and has said it will use its size to extract discounts for cancer drugs and cholesterol drugs in the future.A spokesman for Express Scripts, whose shares were up 3.7 percent to $85.39 in mid-afternoon trading, declined to comment on the Catamaran deal but said its business model was differentiated and in demand.IMPACTING INSURERS The shifting competitive landscape could mean more changes for Humana Inc, which manages pharmacy benefits for Medicare, Skolnick said. Humana had been reviewing the possible sale of that business, but ultimately decided to keep it. The purchase will make Humana the fourth largest pharmacy benefit manager, and it could make sense for Humana to invest in that business, grow the commercial pharmacy business and add more covered customers, she said.Other insurers will be reviewing where they stand now against UnitedHealth. Anthem, Aetna and Cigna have inked deals in recent years where they turned to Express Scripts, CVS and Catamaran respectively to manage their pharmacy benefits and get better prices, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte explained.""In some ways the deal could catalyze more consolidation,"" Gupte said, adding that insurers would face pressure to bulk up.

It had previously planned a 0.95 percent cut.

That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production. The economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011.""The data is telling us that the economy is improving but it is not super strong,"" said Kim Forrest, a senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The pace of the recovery will add to investor's concerns about the timing of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.""Today's market action says the rate increase is going to happen in September,"" Forrest added. Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, however, ruled out the threat of an imminent interest rate increase, which should be supportive of stocks.""There is no need for the Fed to raise rates now. The economy simply is not strong enough and that's what today's data tells us,"" Sarhan said.The GDP report also showed that corporate profits declined 8.7 percent in the first quarter, the largest drop in a year.Conflicting reports on Greece's ability to strike a deal with its euro zone partners also weighed on global markets. At 13:44 p.m. ET (1744 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 64.96 points, or 0.36 percent, at 18,061.16, the S&P 500 was down 5.09 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,115.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 5.80 points, or 0.11 percent, at 5,092.17.Eight of the 10 S&P 500 sectors were down. The biggest drop was the industrial sector's 0.71 percent, with United Rental's 6.5 percent fall to $88.85 leading the losers after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock.Humana jumped as much as 18 percent to hit a record of $210.65 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the health insurer had received takeover interest. Other health insurers also rose.Intel was up 1.4 percent to $34.49 after the New York Post reported that it was close to buying Altera  for about $15 billion. Altera rose as much as 6.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $50.10.ITT Educational Services more than doubled to $4.85 after the for-profit education provider reported higher-than-expected annual results.Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,924 to 1,033, for a 1.86-to-1 ratio on the downside.

Besides the 1.5 billion euros that could be raised, most of the remaining debt would be refinanced in deals with international financial institutions, according to a government document. Hajdas Doncic did not provide a time frame for completing the IPO. The Social Democrat-led government faces a parliamentary election due in late 2015 or January 2016.In March the government abandoned a tender to lease the operation of its motorways to foreign companies in the face of strong opposition from local trade unions and civic groups. They protested that the lease plan amounted to selling off the family silver and called for a referendum on the issue. Before cancelling the tender, the government had received several non-binding bids for running the motorways. It did not name the bidders but local media said the three most likely bidders were a Goldman Sachs-led consortium including local pension funds, Austria's Strabag and Australia's Macquarie.Croatia, which depends heavily on tourism income, took out loans over the previous 15 years to complete a motorway network of more than 1,000 km (620 miles) to improve access to its Adriatic coast.But the motorway management has not been able to raise enough from tolls to repay the debt, while Croatia's public debt is already nearing 90 percent of gross domestic product.

The talks come as both Cigna and rival Aetna Inc  consider the possible acquisition of smaller player Humana Inc , people familiar with the matter have said previously.The source on the Cigna-Anthem talks asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. Cigna and Anthem declined to comment. CNBC first reported on the latest talks between the two companies.A combined Cigna and Anthem would have 53 million customers in commercial, government, consumer and other kinds of health insurance plans. Big U.S. health insurers are seeking acquisitions to boost membership in government-paid healthcare plans and employer-based insurance. The bigger the insurer, the more power it has negotiating prices and improving its doctor networks. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. health insurer Centene Corp  said it would buy smaller rival Health Net Inc  for $6.3 billion, underscoring the healthcare industry's rush to bulk up to negotiate more advantageous prices with suppliers and hospitals, and attract new customers.In rejecting Anthem's offer, Cigna previously cited Anthem's ""lack of growth strategies,"" complications related to its membership of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and a ""massive"" data breach it suffered in February. Cigna's board is also concerned by Anthem's ""insistence"" that one person - Joseph Swedish, Anthem's president and chief executive officer - assume four roles of the combined company: chairman, CEO, president and head of integration.Anthem has said it believes investors support its refusal to guarantee that the CEO role of the combined company would go to Cigna CEO David Cordani.

Competition regulators include the Department of Justice and various state-level agencies.The deal follows weeks of intense discussions about potential combinations among the five biggest U.S. health insurers: Aetna, Humana, Cigna Corp, Anthem Inc  and UnitedHealth Group.Insurers want more leverage in a healthcare system that has seen major consolidation among hospitals and doctor practices, as well as mergers between medical device makers and other suppliers.

78,"   By Luciana Lopez | NEW YORK, July 3  NEW YORK, July 3 Aetna Inc's $37 billion deal to buy smaller health insurer Humana Inc will face rigorous scrutiny from U.S. regulators, which antitrust experts said could also make other large-scale mergers in the sector more difficult.The Aetna-Humana tie-up would be the largest such deal among health insurers. Friday's announcement starts the clock on an examination by regulators of whether consumers will be hurt by diminished competition.The deal follows weeks of intense discussions about potential combinations among the five biggest U.S. health insurers: Aetna, Humana, Cigna Corp, Anthem Inc  and UnitedHealth Group.Insurers want more leverage in a healthcare system that has seen major consolidation among hospitals and doctor practices, as well as mergers between medical device makers and other suppliers. The cost of new drugs has soared, and President Barack Obama's healthcare law has made it harder for insurers to pass on higher costs to customers.Last month, Anthem offered to buy Cigna for $47 billion. The combined company would have surpassed UnitedHealth to become the single largest U.S. health insurer.Cigna, which had also considered purchasing Humana, has so far rejected the buyout approach. Some industry watchers expect a potential buyout of Cigna to be revived after Aetna's deal.Industry sources said Cigna and Anthem may have just a few months to sign a deal if they want it to be considered by antitrust authorities along with the Aetna-Humana deal.Cigna did not respond to a request for comment about the Aetna-Humana deal. Anthem said it had nothing to say about other potential mergers. Regulators ""should be exceedingly skeptical of this deal"" between Aetna and Humana, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antritrust Institute. ""Depending on who merges and the change to the market structure, that affects the concerns about the competition.""Aetna said it is ready to address regulatory concerns.""Obviously this is something that we expect will get a thorough and careful review,"" Shawn Guertin, Aetna's chief financial officer, said in an interview. ""We've spent a lot of time looking at this at a fairly detailed level, and we certainly think that's a manageable situation.""Guertin conceded that a combined company could have some overlap, but declined to name possible divestitures that regulators might seek. ""We're in the same business at the highest level, and so there certainly is an overlap in that regard,"" he said.""It's really about local markets,"" Guertin said.RECENT DEALS SCUTTLED  Antitrust experts said a regulatory review of Aetna and Humana could also factor in whether there is another major deal in the industry.Regulators are expected to scrutinize how competition in local markets will be affected for each line of insurance: Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, individual insurance, commercial insurance for small and large business and the large employer business.Regulators have recently scuttled deals in other industries that would have created mega players.

79,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) on Friday said it would buy smaller rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) for about $37 billion in cash and stock, in the largest ever deal in the insurance industry.The combination will push Aetna close to Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) No.2 insurer spot by membership, and would nearly triple Aetna's Medicare Advantage business.The deal will face antitrust scrutiny but if it goes through it would dwarf the previous largest insurance deal announced just this week, where Swiss property and casualty giant ACE Ltd (ACE.N) announced it was buying Chubb Corp (CB.N) for $28 billion. It would also dwarf Anthem Inc's purchase of WellPoint in 2004 for $16.6 billion.Analysts have said that M&A activity in the healthcare sector had been waiting for last week's Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare, which upheld key subsidies that underpin the reform and thus gave more certainty to healthcare insurers.The bigger the insurer, the more power it has negotiating prices and improving its doctor networks.Anthem has offered to buy Cigna Corp (CI.N) to create the largest insurer in the country, toppling UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N).Media reports have also said UnitedHealth could be eyeing Cigna and Aetna. On Thursday, Centene Corp (CNC.N) said it would buy smaller rival Health Net Inc HNT.N for $6.3 billion.ANTITRUST ISSUES Antitrust authorities, who were aggressive in their review of the failed deal between Comcast (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable TWC.N, are expected to scrutinize how the combination of insurers will affect competition for each line of insurance: Medicare, Medicaid for the poor, individual insurance, commercial insurance for small and large businesses and the large employer business. Aetna and Humana are in nine of the same states in Medicare Advantage. Combined, they would have market share of 88 percent in Kansas, 80 percent in West Virginia, 58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri.    Wall Street analysts and some antitrust experts have said  they expect the combination will be approved, although regulators may ask for some divestitures. Others have said it is unclear that this group of regulators will stick to the usual review playbook for such a large deal and may add other restrictions. The Justice Department, which reviews insurance mergers, will scrutinize deals city-by-city to see if the combination would have a monopoly in any metropolitan area, said Andre Barlow, a veteran of the department who is now at Washington law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.Aetna said the combined company is projected to have over 33 million medical members, based on memberships as of March 31. Operating revenue is expected to be about $115 billion this year, with approximately 56 percent from government-sponsored programs including Medicare and Medicaid.Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld subsidies for individuals under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, keeping a large chunk of patients intact under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.Insurers have said subsidies are key to bringing in new customers and the ruling has removed uncertainty for insurers looking for acquisitions. It could also spur more deal making in the health insurance sector, which has already seen a blitz of merger activity this year. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, praised Humana's presence in his home state but also noted the role of the healthcare law in the merger.""This morning's announcement, as I predicted during the debate five years ago, is the inevitable result of Obamacare’s push toward consolidation as doctors, hospitals, and insurers merge in response to an ever-growing government,"" the Republican said in a statement.The deal includes a $1 billion break-up fee payable by Aetna to Humana, should the deal fail because of antitrust concerns, an Aetna spokeswoman confirmed. The fee was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. CASH AND SHARES Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna said it would pay Humana shareholders $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each share held. The offer of about $230 per share is a 23 percent premium to Humana's closing price on Thursday.Following the deal, Aetna shareholders would own about 74 percent of the combined company with Humana shareholders owning the rest. Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini will serve as chairman and CEO of the combined company. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016 and add to operating earnings per share from 2017.Humana's sale has been anticipated since May when it was first reported that Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Aetna were interested, and multiple sources confirmed to Reuters that the company was entertaining offers. Humana, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has been under pressure for more than a year from investors, which include activist fund Glenview Capital Management, to produce higher returns.   Last year Humana hired a CFO from investment bank Goldman Sachs and went through a strategic review that included asset sales. But it missed several quarters of earnings targets and struggled with profits in its individual business, disappointing Wall Street.Aetna said it has received commitments from Citi and UBS Investment Bank to finance the deal.Citi and Lazard are financial advisers for Aetna and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is its legal adviser.

87,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Humana Inc, fresh from announcing an agreement to be purchased by larger rival Aetna Inc, prompted new investor concerns about the $33 billion deal on Monday by lowering its 2015 financial forecasts.The transaction announced on Friday is already expected to face a tough review by U.S. antitrust regulators, particularly if another major deal among health insurers emerges.Humana, which has posted disappointing results for several quarters in a row, said on Monday that members of its Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly were using hospital services at a higher rate than the company expected.That increase could cut into already tight profit margins, if Humana ends up paying more for medical claims than they anticipated when setting monthly insurance rates. Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on a conference call with investors that inpatient hospital admissions have not performed in line with what the company had forecast. That contributed to its decision to slash expected 2015 operating profits by more than 8 percent. The company said it had taken the higher Medicare Advantage hospital use into account when it priced premiums for 2016.""If you take the 8 percent downgrade of their earnings and roll that through, that makes what Aetna paid pretty expensive,"" said Joel Emery, a portfolio manager at Tareo Capital Management in New York. The degree to which Humana will boost Aetna's earnings in 2017 and 2018 is less than what some investors had hoped for, he said.Aetna's offer of $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each Humana share valued Humana at $230 per share.

88,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Humana Inc, fresh from announcing an agreement to be purchased by larger rival Aetna Inc, prompted new investor concerns about the $33 billion deal on Monday by lowering its 2015 financial forecasts. The transaction announced on Friday is already expected to face a tough review by U.S. antitrust regulators, particularly if another major deal among health insurers emerges. Humana, which has posted disappointing results for several quarters in a row, said on Monday that members of its Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly were using hospital services at a higher rate than the company expected. That increase could cut into already tight profit margins, if Humana ends up paying more for medical claims than they anticipated when setting monthly insurance rates.Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on a conference call with investors that inpatient hospital admissions have not performed in line with what the company had forecast. That contributed to its decision to slash expected 2015 operating profits by more than 8 percent. The company said it had taken the higher Medicare Advantage hospital use into account when it priced premiums for 2016. ""If you take the 8 percent downgrade of their earnings and roll that through, that makes what Aetna paid pretty expensive,"" said Joel Emery, a portfolio manager at Tareo Capital Management in New York. The degree to which Humana will boost Aetna's earnings in 2017 and 2018 is less than what some investors had hoped for, he said.Aetna's offer of $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each Humana share valued Humana at $230 per share. On Monday, Aetna fell 6 percent to $117, bringing down the offer price to $223 per share.Reflecting growing doubts about the deal, Humana shares traded well below the proposed offer price, closing at $188.96.

It was unclear how much it would differ from other proposals rejected in the past.Equity futures tumbled at the open late on Sunday after Greeks voted 'No' to the terms imposed by its creditors. However the S&P 500 didn't fall more than 1 percent throughout the Monday session and even turned positive in morning trading.Though Greece is causing a lot of uncertainty, a deal should get done to keep them in the Euro Zone, according to Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. ""Greece can't pay their bills, there's no middle ground there and other countries are going to have to foot the bill and they are angry,"" she said.But more than billions in debt are in play as ""Greece is the southern gateway to Europe. The strategic value is not being quantified.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.53 points, or 0.26 percent, to 17,683.58, the S&P 500 lost 8.02 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,068.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 17.27 points, or 0.34 percent, to 4,991.94.Weighing further on investor sentiment, Chinese brokerages and fund managers vowed to buy massive amounts of stocks as Beijing unleashed an unprecedented series of support measures to stem a decline of nearly 30 percent in the main Shanghai index over the past three weeks. ""People see 'emergency measures' and they think 'that can't be good',"" said Voya's Cavanaugh.The Shanghai index rose 2.4 percent overnight but a measure of Chinese stocks traded in the United States  fell the most in 19 months, pointing to caution from investors outside of China about the effectiveness of the government's measures.Energy stocks led the decline on Wall Street after U.S. crude futures prices settled almost 8 percent lower on concern over growth in China and the Greek uncertainty.The S&P 500 energy index fell 1.3 percent, marking its fourth decline of more than 1 percent in the past seven sessions. Health insurer Aetna fell 6.4 percent to $117.43 after it said it would buy smaller rival Humana for about $37 billion. Humana closed up 0.8 percent to $188.96.The deal is seen facing antitrust scrutiny, which could make other large-scale mergers in the sector more difficult. Anthem , Cigna, Centene and Health Net, which are all in takeover talks, ended lower.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,946 to 1,132, for a 1.72-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,600 issues fell and 1,181 advanced for a 1.35-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 5 new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 130 new lows.About 6.6 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the average of 7.6 billion in the past five sessions.(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Andrew Hay)",2015-07-06,HUM,"Mon Jul 6, 2015 | 4:27pm EDT","US STOCKS-Energy leads Wall St lower with eyes on Greece, China",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-usa-idUSL1N0ZM24620150706?type=companyNews

96,"   By Leela Parker Deo and Karen Schwartz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) is lining up a $16.2 billion bridge loan to fund its acquisition of smaller rival Humana Inc (HUM.N), which is the first multibillion M&A loan of the second half of 2015 and the second-largest acquisition bridge loan so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.Aetna said on July 3 that it would buy Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock in the insurance industry’s largest-ever acquisition.The deal will boost third quarter investment grade loan issuance and support expectations that a surplus of corporate cash is contributing to a growing pipeline of M&A transactions.Investment grade M&A-related lending totaled $63 billion in the first half of the year. 2015 totals could reach $200 billion based on the pipeline of financings building in the second half of the year, according to a lender survey by Thomson Reuters LPC.The merger is the latest transaction amid ongoing consolidation in the health insurance sector and was announced just before global markets were roiled by the decisive July 5 referendum in Greece which rejected additional harsh austerity measures and China’s attempts to stabilize its ailing stock market.These macroeconomic developments and slumping oil and iron ore prices have the potential to disrupt the syndicated loan market, but dislocation is more likely to be felt by non-investment grade companies rather than high-grade issuers, one analyst said.Highly rated companies are in a relatively strong position to attract financing because of their credit profiles, he noted, and tend to benefit from any flight to quality in a risk-off environment. “I won’t say it’s not going to be somewhat choppy. The marketplace always tends to be somewhat choppier when you have these big geopolitical issues popping up. It’s just one of several things they’re going to need to navigate over the next six months,” the analyst said.HEALTHY BRIDGE Citigroup and UBS are providing the 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility, according to regulatory filings.

97,"   By Leela Parker Deo and Karen Schwartz | NEW YORK, July 9  NEW YORK, July 9 U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc  is lining up a $16.2 billion bridge loan to fund its acquisition of smaller rival Humana Inc, which is the first multibillion M&A loan of the second half of 2015 and the second-largest acquisition bridge loan so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.Aetna said on July 3 that it would buy Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock in the insurance industry's largest-ever acquisition.The deal will boost third quarter investment grade loan issuance and support expectations that a surplus of corporate cash is contributing to a growing pipeline of M&A transactions.Investment grade M&A-related lending totaled $63 billion in the first half of the year. 2015 totals could reach $200 billion based on the pipeline of financings building in the second half of the year, according to a lender survey by Thomson Reuters LPC.The merger is the latest transaction amid ongoing consolidation in the health insurance sector and was announced just before global markets were roiled by the decisive July 5 referendum in Greece which rejected additional harsh austerity measures and China's attempts to stabilize its ailing stock market.These macroeconomic developments and slumping oil and iron ore prices have the potential to disrupt the syndicated loan market, but dislocation is more likely to be felt by non-investment grade companies rather than high-grade issuers, one analyst said. Highly rated companies are in a relatively strong position to attract financing because of their credit profiles, he noted, and tend to benefit from any flight to quality in a risk-off environment.""I won't say it's not going to be somewhat choppy. The marketplace always tends to be somewhat choppier when you have these big geopolitical issues popping up. It's just one of several things they're going to need to navigate over the next six months,"" the analyst said.HEALTHY BRIDGE  Citigroup and UBS are providing the 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility, according to regulatory filings.

Local politicians and medical industry groups such as the American Medical Association have also voiced concerns about the biggest deal ever in the U.S. health insurance industry.The Department of Justice is taking the lead on the transaction and may ask for asset sales or challenge a deal in court.

Republicans say the new law has driven insurance costs higher and hurt consumers, while Democrats say it is insuring more people. Aetna and Humana have said that because the health insurance market is now more focused on consumers, being bigger will let them offer more competitive products.When the nation's largest insurer, UnitedHealth Group , bought Nevada's Sierra Health Services in 2008, the Nevada Attorney General and the DOJ both filed antitrust complaints and signed off on a settlement requiring UnitedHealth to divest administration and sales of Medicare Advantage plans for seniors and the disabled in two counties.In 2004, California's state regulator first rejected the acquisition of WellPoint Health Networks by Anthem. The companies challenged the move in court and eventually agreed to concessions, including putting $265 million towards California health projects that would benefit consumers. The Humana purchase would create a company with more than 33 million customers in two-thirds of the United States.

In commercial insured plans, the new company would have more than a third of individual customers in Florida, Illinois and Kansas and 68 percent of Georgia, according to SG Cowen and SNL Financial.Healthcare investors already have concerns over the Humana deal passing muster at the federal level, particularly after antitrust objections scuttled several other major transactions this year, including Sysco Corp's proposed purchase of US Foods and Comcast Corp's planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. They are also weighing the risk of another major health insurance merger being forged, possibly between Anthem Inc  and Cigna Corp. In that case, antitrust authorities would have to account for the market effect of both deals when raising any objections.

100,"  * Combined company would be No. 1 insurer, cover 53 mln members* Antitrust review would include proposed Aetna buy of Humana* U.S. lawmakers, medical group express concern for consumers   (Adds details on antitrust review, concerns from lawmakers, Breakingviews link)By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell PiersonJuly 24 Anthem Inc said on Friday it would buy Cigna Corp for about $54.2 billion, creating the largest U.S. health insurer by membership and accelerating the industry's consolidation from five national players to three.The proposed acquisition, the health insurance industry's largest, comes three weeks after Aetna Inc agreed to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion.Health insurers are finding it tougher to raise prices following the roll-out of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, while grappling with soaring expenses of medications including cancer drugs that can cost each patient more than $100,000 a year. Anthem said buying Cigna would help it reduce costs and negotiate lower prices with doctors and hospitals.State insurance regulators and federal antitrust authorities are expected to scrutinize how the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals would affect competition for Medicare and individual and commercial insurance.Within a few hours of the announcement, several U.S. lawmakers and a leading physicians group said they feared the pending acquisitions would hurt consumers by raising prices or limiting access to healthcare providers.""The lack of a competitive health insurance market allows the few remaining companies to exploit their market power, dictate premium increases and pursue corporate policies that are contrary to patient interests,"" the American Medical Association (AMA) said in a statement.Under the deal, which the companies expect to close in the second half of 2016, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish would serve as CEO and chairman. Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and chief operating officer.In a joint conference call, Swedish told analysts Anthem had no prior discussions ""at all"" with regulators about the deal, but was confident about approval.Shares of Cigna on Friday fell 5.6 percent to $145.72, far below the $188 offered in the buyout, suggesting major Wall Street concern over the antitrust risk. ""Strategically and financially it's very attractive, but they will face regulatory scrutiny,"" said Ana Gupte, analyst with Leerink Partners. ""They also both possibly face divestitures and may have to make concessions to consumers to make the merger go through.""The AMA said its own analysis shows 41 percent of U.S. metropolitan areas already have a single health insurer with a commercial market share of 50 percent or more. It believes the Anthem-Cigna merger would be presumed anticompetitive in at least nine of the states where Anthem operates.""It is imperative that we closely examine changes in the healthcare market, and what has caused these changes, to ensure that consumers are not harmed,"" said Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah who is chairman of the Senate's antitrust panel.Apparent worries about regulatory scrutiny have also hit Humana shares, which closed at $181.76 on Friday, well below the value of Aetna's cash-and-stock offer of $230 per share when it was announced on July 3. BIGGER THAN UNITEDHEALTH Cigna has 15 million members, and about 80 percent of its business is with self-insured companies which pay it a management fee, according to Leerink. It also serves large and small employers, Medicare Advantage customers and individuals.About 61 percent of Anthem's 39 million members are served through self-insured companies, while 15 percent have Medicaid coverage. Large and small group policies make up about 12 percent of its business, while Medicare Advantage accounts for 1 percent.The combined company would have about 53 million members, surpassing UnitedHealth Group's 45.86 million as of June 30.Anthem said it will pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of its shares for each Cigna share. The deal is valued at $181.12 per share based on Anthem's Friday close of $150.86. Anthem said on Friday the offer was valued at $188 per share based on its stock price on May 28 before media reports surfaced that the two companies were in talks.The offer's equity portion is valued at $49.11 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on 261.2 million Cigna shares outstanding as of March 31.Another question is whether Anthem would violate rules of  the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, a federation of 36 independent insurers of which it is the biggest member.The association collectively insures 106 million Americans. Anthem provides coverage to the most people and operates in 14 states. No other Blue Cross member operates in more than five states.Blue Cross operators are not supposed to compete with one another, but Cigna does compete against Blue Cross members in a handful of states, which could cause controversy in the association.""There will no doubt be debate among the board of directors,"" said a person knowledgeable about Blue Cross who requested anonymity to protect business relationships.""We will remain Blue,"" Swedish said on the conference call, adding that Anthem feels confident that even after acquiring Cigna, the combined company will satisfy ""the Blue rules.""Swedish said he would serve as CEO for only two years, and remain as chairman afterward. Cordani could be a contender for the CEO role at that point, but no guarantees were provided, said a source familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the person was unauthorized to publicly discuss details of the transaction.Both Anthem and Cigna would be liable to pay the other a fee equivalent to 3.8 percent of the deal's value if either walks away from the planned merger.Anthem's lead financial adviser is UBS Investment Bank. Credit Suisse also served as financial adviser, and White & Case LLP as legal adviser.Morgan Stanley is Cigna's financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP its legal adviser.

102,"  (Adds Saunders interview)By Caroline HumerNEW YORK, July 27 Allergan plc CEO Brent Saunders is ready to put the $36 billion his company will net from the sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to work, possibly with another large, ""transformational"" merger.The readiness for a new transaction just after the Teva deal was announced on Monday represents what Saunders calls a strategy to remain nimble and open to opportunity as the healthcare sector remakes itself.Saunders has already shown a penchant for quick deal-making. Just last year, he helped orchestrate the $25 billion sale of Forest Laboratories Inc, where he was CEO, to Actavis Plc.As head of Actavis, he then sealed a $66 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan, beating out rival suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its acquisition partner, hedge fund billionaire William Ackman.The latest deal had just closed in March and Saunders was busy integrating the two companies under the Allergan name. At the time, he did not consider unloading the generics assets of Actavis.""While I had a different strategy a few months ago, the thing that sets us apart ... is our strategy to be nimble,"" Saunders said in an interview. Saunders now plans to use the proceeds from its $40.5 billion asset sale to Teva to increase the size of existing drug businesses, expand into new therapy areas and pursue larger deals.He declined to discuss any specific targets, a list Wall Street that analysts speculated may include Biogen Inc, AbbVie Inc and Amgen Inc.""Clearly we are watching many companies - we have been for some time - but what has changed is our timeline for being able to execute has accelerated, if the opportunity presents itself,"" Saunders said.The $40.5 billion cash-and-stock sale of generic drugs business to Teva is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. That will essentially ""reload"" Allergan's balance sheet for more acquisitions, Saunders added. When asked if Allergan planned to spend the cash within 18 months, he replied that the company would, as long as it could maintain its investment-grade credit rating.CONSOLIDATION AHEAD Saunders said his change of direction for Allergan came only a few weeks ago when Teva CEO Erez Vigodman called to make an offer. Vigodman had already approached Actavis earlier in the year, but the company was not interested at that time. ""To be fair, I didn't think it was a good idea to sell it until Erez called me and put a compelling offer on the table,"" Saunders said. ""It caused me to step back and think about the industry and the dynamics.""The healthcare industry has consolidated in the past year, with pharmacies and distributors aligning through merger deals or purchasing agreements that give them more leverage over prices for generic drugs.These deals, such as CVS Health's purchases of Target Corp's pharmacies and the Omnicare specialty pharmacies and distributor McKesson Corp's purchasing agreement with pharmacy Rite Aid Corp, will force more consolidation among generics makers so they can compete, Saunders said.Two of the largest U.S. health insurers - Humana Inc  and Cigna Corp - have also agreed to be bought in the past month, signaling fresh pressure on prices, Saunders said.Of the seven main therapeutic areas that Allergan will focus on after the generics sale, he said there are four with the strongest opportunities in terms of unmet medical care: aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system therapies and gastrointestinal therapies.Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Asset Management, which owns Allergan shares, said Saunders should look for something with a reasonable risk versus reward profile.""If it were my $40 billion, I would probably do four or five deals in the $10 billion range, aiming for late-stage drug programs where you have some idea if the drug works,"" Funtleyder said. If two of those deals panned out, ""that would be a good use of capital.""

Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note that the ratio was 50 basis points worse than Wall Street consensus.Investors closely watch this ratio as a sign of whether insurers, who have benefited from years of low medical use and claims, will be caught out by sudden shifts in demand. Humana first said in early July that costs related to the rate of hospital admissions among Medicare customers were higher than it had anticipated. It cut its 2015 outlook by 8 percent and shares fell at that time. On Wednesday, Humana said medical costs have not worsened since it issued that outlook earlier this month. It reiterated that it believes it has priced its 2016 premium rates to cover these costs, indicating that this key metric should improve. Humana had missed analyst expectations several quarters in a row because of cost issues, contributing to investor skepticism about the Aetna deal. The deal is also expected to face antitrust scrutiny as regulators weigh the impact of the combination on competition. Authorities are also expected to closely look at Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) $54 billion purchase of Cigna Corp (CI.N) and require some asset sales.    The managed care sector is consolidating as insurers seek to cut costs and negotiate with doctors and hospitals over pricing. Humana shares were off 0.5 percent at $183.59 in Wednesday morning trade. Aetna was off 2 cents at $112.29.Excluding tax benefits from the sale of Concerta Inc, Humana earned $1.67 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On that basis, it had reported earnings of $2.19 per share in the year-ago quarter. In early July, the company told analysts to expect earnings of $1.60 to $1.65 per share on an adjusted basis.Net income rose to $431 million, or $2.85 per share, in the second quarter, from $344 million, or $2.19 per share, a year earlier.The company reported revenue of $13.73 billion, which missed the average analyst estimate of $13.81 billion.

115,"  (Adds Hillary Clinton comment, updates shares)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonOct 29 Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.""Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,"" Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: ""The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.""From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.SMOOTHER PATH ""These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,"" he said in a statement. ""We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland.Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.""Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,"" Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.""Pfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent. Given that both sides characterized the talks as ""friendly,"" Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's  board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.""It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,"" said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. ""The hurdle will really be the price.""Moody's Investor Service said the deal would have ""credit positive implications for both companies.""A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy.Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal.Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines. Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   for $40.5 billion.CASH FROM BOTOX A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.(Additional reporting by Gregory Roumeliotis and Caroline Humer in New York, Vidya L Nathan in Bengaluru, Ben Hirschler in London and Amanda Becker in Littleton, N.H.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Christian Plumb)",2015-10-29,HUM,"Thu Oct 29, 2015 | 6:02pm EDT","UPDATE 5-Pfizer, Allergan drug merger talks raise tax hackles in U.S.",http://www.reuters.com//article/allergan-ma-pfizer-idUSL3N12T51K20151029?type=companyNews

119,"   By Karen Brettell, David Gaffen and David Rohde | NEW YORK  NEW YORKWhen health insurer Humana Inc reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings in late 2014 – including a 21 percent drop in net income – it softened the blow by immediately telling investors it would make a $500 million share repurchase.In addition to soothing shareholders, the surprise buyback benefited the company’s senior executives. It added around two cents to the company’s annual earnings per share, allowing Humana to surpass its $7.50 EPS target by a single cent and unlocking higher pay for top managers under terms of the company’s compensation agreement.Thanks to Humana hitting that target, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard earned a $1.68 million bonus for 2014.Most publicly traded U.S. companies reward top managers for hitting performance targets, meant to tie the interests of managers and shareholders together. At many big companies, those interests are deemed to be best aligned by linking executive performance to earnings per share, along with measures derived from the company’s stock price.But these metrics may not be solely a reflection of a company’s operating performance. They can be, and often are, influenced through stock repurchases. In addition to cutting the number of a company’s shares outstanding, and thus lifting EPS, buybacks also increase demand for the shares, usually providing a lift to the share price, which affects other performance markers.As corporate America engages in an unprecedented buyback binge, soaring CEO pay tied to short-term performance measures like EPS is prompting criticism that executives are using stock repurchases to enrich themselves at the expense of long-term corporate health, capital investment and employment.“We’ve accepted a definition of performance that is narrow and quite possibly inappropriate,” said Rosanna Landis Weaver, program manager of the executive compensation initiative at As You Sow, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that promotes corporate responsibility. Pay for performance as it is often structured creates “very troublesome, problematic incentives that can potentially drive very short-term thinking.”A Reuters analysis of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index found that 255 of those companies reward executives in part by using EPS, while another 28 use other per-share metrics that can be influenced by share buybacks.In addition, 303 also use total shareholder return, essentially a company’s share price appreciation plus dividends, and 169 companies use both EPS and total shareholder return to help determine pay.STANDARD PRACTICE EPS and share-price metrics underpin much of the compensation of some of the highest-paid CEOs, including those at Walt Disney Co, Viacom Inc, 21st Century Fox Inc, Target Corp and Cisco Systems Inc.Fewer than 20 of the S&P 500 companies disclose in their proxies whether they exclude the impact of buybacks on per-share metrics that determine executive pay.Humana would not say whether it adjusted targets to account for its buyback last year. In a statement to Reuters, the company said it sets annual per-share targets for executives that take into account the company’s “capital allocation strategy,” which includes buybacks, dividends, acquisitions and investments.Experts said Humana would not have reached the target without the $500 million buyback. The company told analysts at the time of the repurchase announcement in November 2014 that it expected to report annual earnings per share of between $7.40 and $7.60 for the full year.“Given the magnitude of the repurchase, the EPS would have been below $7.50 had it not been for the repurchase,” said Heitor Almeida, a professor of finance with the College of Business at the University of Illinois in Champaign.As reported in the first article in this series, share buybacks by U.S. non-financial companies reached a record $520 billion in the most recent reporting year. A Reuters analysis of 3,300 non-financial companies found that together, buybacks and dividends have surpassed total capital expenditures and are more than double research and development spending.Companies buy back their shares for various reasons. They do it when they believe their shares are undervalued, or to make use of cash or cheap debt financing when business conditions don’t justify capital or R&D spending. They also do it to meet the expectations of increasingly demanding investors.Lately, the sheer volume of buybacks has prompted complaints among academics, politicians and investors that massive stock repurchases are stifling innovation and hurting U.S. competitiveness - and contributing to widening income inequality by rewarding executives with ever higher pay, often divorced from a company’s underlying performance.“There’s been an over-focus on buybacks and raising EPS to hit share option targets, and we know that those are concentrated in the hands of the few, and that the few is in the top 1 percent,” said James Montier, a member of the asset allocation team at global investment firm GMO in London, which manages more than $100 billion in assets.The introduction of performance targets has been a driver of surging executive pay, helping to widen the gap between the richest in America and the rest of the country. Median CEO pay among companies in the S&P 500 increased to a record $10.3 million last year, up from $8.6 million in 2010, according to data firm Equilar.At those levels, CEOs last year were paid 303 times what workers in their industries earned, compared with a ratio of 59 times in 1989, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit.SALARY AND A LOT MORE Today, the bulk of CEO compensation comes from cash and stock awards, much of it tied to performance metrics. Last year, base salary accounted for just 8 percent of CEO pay for S&P 500 companies, while cash and stock incentives made up more than 45 percent, according to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services.Thomson Reuters Corp, owner of Reuters News, used EPS to determine half of the performance awards in the three-year pay cycle ended in 2014 for CEO Jim Smith and other executives. Smith last year took home $6.6 million in compensation. The company’s three-year performance awards going forward are based on both EPS and free cash flow per share. A company spokesman said Thomson Reuters does not adjust for the impact of stock buybacks on those metrics. Share repurchases can make the difference in meeting preset targets, according to a Reuters review of corporate proxies.At Xerox Corp, revenue, net income and spending on research and development all declined last year. But the printer and copier maker’s EPS target of $1.12 was unchanged from the prior year, and managers hit it exactly after $1.1 billion in share repurchases.Half of CEO Ursula Burns’s annual bonus target was predicated on hitting that EPS level; ultimately, she received a bonus of $1.98 million out of a possible $2.2 million. EPS is also a major determinant of even bigger bonuses for a three-year performance cycle ending this year.Xerox repurchased $1.35 billion of its shares in the first three quarters of this year. The company declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not indicate whether it adjusts targets to account for buybacks.Managers at information technology company EMC Corp hit their EPS target for 2014 of $1.90 with the help of $3.7 billion in share repurchases. Based on the share count before the buybacks, EPS last year would have been only $1.81, little changed from $1.80 a year earlier, according to a Reuters calculation.The EPS target accounted for half of CEO Joseph Tucci’s annual $1.01 million bonus. It also is used to determine 45 percent of bonus share awards for the company’s future three-year targets.EMC declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not address whether it makes adjustments to account for buybacks. It has bought back $3.11 billion in shares so far this year.Buybacks can boost a company’s share price to benefit executives whose shares vest over a period of years. Activision Blizzard Inc, purveyor of “Guitar Hero,” “Call of Duty” and other well-known video games, signed Chief Executive Robert Kotick to a contract in 2012 that included $56 million in share awards that vest over time, depending in part on the share price and EPS.Last year, Kotick ended up getting about $22 million in performance-based cash and stock awards, about the same as the year prior, even as net income dropped 17 percent. How? The stock rose substantially, meeting goals for total shareholder return and increasing the value of share awards.Total shareholder return was helped by an $8.2 billion repurchase made in late 2013 – when the company and a group of investors led by Kotick and Activision Chairman Brian Kelly bought out a stake held by then-majority shareholder Vivendi. The company said the deal allowed Activision to operate with more flexibility.The shares rose 33 percent from the date of the buyback announcement in July 2013 through the end of 2014. The share price has continued to rise this year, making the awards even more valuable.Activision declined to comment.In 1992, Congress changed the tax code to curb rising executive pay and encourage performance-based compensation. It didn’t work. Instead, the shift is widely blamed for soaring executive pay and a heavier emphasis on short-term results. Companies started tying performance pay to “short-term metrics, and suddenly all the things we don’t want to happen start happening,” said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York. “Despite 20 years of trying, we have still failed to come up with an objective performance metric that can’t be gamed.”Shareholder expectations have changed, too. The individuals and other smaller, mostly passive investors who dominated equity markets during the postwar decades have given way to large institutional investors. These institutions tend to want higher returns, sooner, than their predecessors. Consider that the average time investors held a particular share has fallen from around eight years in 1960 to a year and a half now, according to New York Stock Exchange data.“TOO EASY TO MANIPULATE” Companies like to use EPS as a performance metric because it is the primary focus of financial analysts when assessing the value of a stock and of investors when evaluating their return on investment.But “it is not an appropriate target, it’s too easy to manipulate,” said Almeida, the University of Illinois finance professor.In 2011, Amgen Inc CEO Kevin Sharer oversaw $8.32 billion of buybacks, by far the largest in the pharmaceutical maker’s history. More than $5 billion of those repurchases came in the fourth quarter of the year.Soon after, Amgen reported that net income was lower than it had been in the three preceding years. At the same time, the buybacks lifted EPS far above the target level that determined 30 percent of Sharer’s bonus, doubling the amount he earned for that portion of his $4.88 million annual bonus. Without the buyouts, EPS would have fallen below the target level.Sharer left the company in May 2012 and is now on the faculty of Harvard Business School. He did not respond to requests for comment.The Amgen board’s compensation committee removed EPS as a performance metric the next year. It opted, instead, to begin using net income, saying in a 2012 proxy statement that doing so would “align compensation with a measure that more directly correlates with the underlying performance of our operations.”Members of Amgen’s 2011 compensation committee declined to comment.Some companies, including software developer Citrix Systems Inc and kidney dialysis company DaVita Inc, say they avoid EPS in pay calculations because it is too vulnerable to manipulation.Most companies that use per-share metrics for executive awards, however, say little about whether they adjust results to account for buybacks. A select few, including Johnson & Johnson, FedEx, Time Warner Inc and IBM, do disclose that they strip out the potential effect of buybacks on performance metrics. FedEx, in its most recent filing, said it excluded the effect of buybacks because the positive effect on EPS “did not reflect core business performance.” Time Warner Inc said it adjusts for buybacks “so that payouts were not advantaged” if the media company repurchased more shares than it initially anticipated when setting performance goals.Steve Pakela, managing partner at Pay Governance LLC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which advises more than 40 S&P 500 companies on executive pay, said some directors “believe you shouldn’t strip out the effect” because share buybacks may be the best use of capital.In addition to EPS, there is total shareholder return, which typically comprises a company’s share price appreciation plus dividends over time. Total return, often used to compare performance among peer companies, has also become a popular performance measure for executive pay.By providing a lift to a stock’s price, buybacks can increase total shareholder return to target levels, resulting in more stock awards for executives. And of course, the higher stock price lifts the value of company stock they already own.“It can goose the price at time when the high price means they earn performance shares … even if the stock price later goes back down, they got their shares,” said Michael Dorff, a law professor at the Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles.Exxon Corp, the largest repurchaser of shares over the past decade, has rejected shareholder proposals that it add three-year targets based on shareholder return to its compensation program. In its most recent proxy, the energy company said doing so could increase risk-taking and encourage underinvestment to achieve short-term results.The energy giant makes half of its annual executive bonus payments contingent on meeting longer-term EPS thresholds. Since 2005, the company has spent more than $200 billion on buybacks.ADDITIONAL TWEAKS While performance targets are specific, they aren’t necessarily fixed. Corporate boards often adjust them or how they are calculated in ways that lift executive pay.Humana specifies EPS ranges to determine annual bonuses paid to its executives. For the past three years, buybacks of more than $500 million a year increased EPS. That wasn’t all, however. For each of those years, the board altered calculations in ways that also bumped EPS higher.For 2012, then-CEO Michael McCallister received a higher bonus than he otherwise would have -- $1.63 million -- after Humana’s board removed litigation expenses from its EPS calculation.He was succeeded as CEO at the start of 2013 by Broussard. For that year, Broussard’s annual bonus was lifted into the maximum range, for a payment $2.44 million, after accounting for the cost of posting additional reserves against long-term insurance policies.For 2014, Humana discounted from its EPS calculation losses from paying down some bonds, even as its overall debt levels increased. That adjustment brought the company just below its EPS target of $7.50.The $500 million buyback the company announced late last year, part of its total $872 million in buybacks in 2014, was an accelerated share repurchase. In this sort of deal, a company buys all the stock from an investment bank in a single transaction. That allows it to book the reduction in shares outstanding immediately, and the bank then buys the shares on the open market over the ensuing months.Humana’s accelerated share repurchase lifted EPS to $7.51, just above the target.Susan Young, an associate professor of accounting and taxation at Fordham University in New York, said accelerated buybacks are commonly used to reach compensation targets. “I can’t think of a good reason for this form of repurchase,” she said, noting that the programs restrict a company’s flexibility to reduce or stop buybacks if shares become too expensive.Roy Dunbar, a member of the Humana board’s compensation committee, declined to comment on Humana specifically. He said the benefit of accelerated repurchases is to, “in a controlled way, buy a significant slice of available shares early in the program,” before an announced buyback pushes up the share price and increases the cost to the company.He also said an accelerated program allows shareholders to see immediate action, which is “important to signal a higher degree of confidence in something shareholders care a great deal about.”In general, he said, “effective compensation committees are aware of impact of share repurchases on EPS, particularly when EPS is part of the equity compensation of management.”In July, Aetna Inc announced that it would acquire Humana in a deal that at the time valued Humana at $37 billion. If Broussard leaves after the deal, he won’t go empty-handed.Just before the Aetna deal was announced, Broussard’s compensation agreement was modified to accelerate equity awards and remove restrictions on exercising some stock options if he leaves or is terminated within two years of any acquisition, a regulatory filing shows.At the end of last year, Broussard held unvested share awards valued at around $12.8 million, which have since increased in value as Humana’s share price has climbed 18 percent.

120,"   By Karen Brettell, David Gaffen and David Rohde | NEW YORK  NEW YORKWhen health insurer Humana Inc reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings in late 2014 – including a 21 percent drop in net income – it softened the blow by immediately telling investors it would make a $500 million share repurchase.In addition to soothing shareholders, the surprise buyback benefited the company’s senior executives. It added around two cents to the company’s annual earnings per share, allowing Humana to surpass its $7.50 EPS target by a single cent and unlocking higher pay for top managers under terms of the company’s compensation agreement.Thanks to Humana hitting that target, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard earned a $1.68 million bonus for 2014.Most publicly traded U.S. companies reward top managers for hitting performance targets, meant to tie the interests of managers and shareholders together. At many big companies, those interests are deemed to be best aligned by linking executive performance to earnings per share, along with measures derived from the company’s stock price.But these metrics may not be solely a reflection of a company’s operating performance. They can be, and often are, influenced through stock repurchases. In addition to cutting the number of a company’s shares outstanding, and thus lifting EPS, buybacks also increase demand for the shares, usually providing a lift to the share price, which affects other performance markers.As corporate America engages in an unprecedented buyback binge, soaring CEO pay tied to short-term performance measures like EPS is prompting criticism that executives are using stock repurchases to enrich themselves at the expense of long-term corporate health, capital investment and employment.“We’ve accepted a definition of performance that is narrow and quite possibly inappropriate,” said Rosanna Landis Weaver, program manager of the executive compensation initiative at As You Sow, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that promotes corporate responsibility.

122,"   By Caroline Humer | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Aetna Inc (AET.N) Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said on Tuesday that he still expects the company's $37 billion acquisition of rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to close this year.The deal is being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has been seeking documents about Aetna's and Humana's business as it assesses how the deal, and a pending $47 billion combination of Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N), could affect consumers. ""So far, we have nothing to believe it will be any slower than that, or any faster,"" Bertolini said in an interview at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference.The two proposed mergers would be an unprecedented consolidation of the U.S. health insurance industry, and critics have warned it could lead to higher prices for consumers. Insurers say the combinations will give them greater leverage to control rising healthcare costs. Aetna said it expects the regulators to wrap up their document requests in the next month, and then the company will move onto discussions with them and consider any divestitures that might be needed.Aetna and Humana sell health plans for individuals as well as Medicare Advantage plans for seniors. Humana's operations  does not overlap with Aetna’s large corporate business. U.S. antitrust regulators have recently blocked large mergers in a variety of industries, raising questions among investors about whether Aetna's and Anthem's acquisitions will close.

123,"   By Diane Bartz  Aetna Inc's plan to buy smaller insurer Humana Inc for $31 billion will mean seniors will pay higher Medicare Advantage premiums, according to a new report by the think tank Center for American Progress (CAP).Aetna's proposed deal for Humana would combine Aetna's 7 percent of the Medicare Advantage market with Humana's 19 percent, and make it the largest provider, according to CAP, which was founded by John Podesta who worked in the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan for seniors that is largely paid for by the government but administered by private insurers. The deal is one of two giant insurance mergers announced in July. The other was Anthem's $45 billion bid for Cigna Corp. Deal values were calculated based on Wednesday's closing stock prices.CAP said in one analysis it found that in counties where Aetna competed with Humana, Aetna's average annual premiums were $302 lower. Using a more conservative approach, it determined that Aetna's average annual premiums were $155 less if it competed against Humana, while Humana's premiums were $43 less if it competed against Aetna, CAP said. Aetna said that seniors who are hit with price increases with Medicare Advantage could always switch to traditional Medicare, and that two-thirds of seniors are on traditional Medicare.

133,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, April 19  NEW YORK, April 19 UnitedHealth Group Inc's  decision to exit most of its Obamacare health insurance exchanges next year means rivals will need to raise prices further to prop up an unprofitable business, healthcare analysts and policy experts said on Tuesday.The largest U.S. health insurer's move would likely reduce consumer choices, particularly in states where UnitedHealth has been one of only a handful of players to offer insurance under President Barack Obama's healthcare law, they said.Large pullbacks by providers like Anthem Inc and Aetna Inc are unlikely as they each await approval from the administration for proposed merger deals with smaller rivals, some analysts said.Spokespeople for Aetna and Anthem declined to comment on Tuesday.UnitedHealth is one of the biggest sellers of Obamacare plans, offering them in 34 states in 2016. The company warned in November that it was losing too much money on the business due to low enrollment and high service costs. On Tuesday, it said it would exit all but a handful of those markets.Many of the estimated 650,000 UnitedHealth plan members at the end of 2016 would need to find another insurer.""You will see significant rate increases for 2017 as the (health) plans try to figure out what is a premium at which (they) can make money,"" said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at research firm Avalere Health. The government provides income-based tax credits to most exchange users, which would help soften the blow from any higher premiums, she said.""In terms of viability of the exchanges, I don't think that this is going to affect that in the long term,"" said Yevgeniy Feyman, deputy director of health policy at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.Even if other insurers decided to leave, he said, he could not envision the exchanges being so unprofitable that they ceased to work.A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study found UnitedHealth's departure would leave only one insurer in 29 percent of the 1,855 counties where it offered health plans. The report found that if United had not participated in the exchanges in 2016, the national weighted average benchmark ""silver"" plan would have been about 1 percent higher in 2016. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which provides tax credits to help uninsured individuals buy medical coverage. They have said it creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and have warned that insurers would be left to cover sicker and older individuals.TOUGH BUSINESS U.S. health insurers including Aetna and Anthem have also lost money on the exchanges, but have not said they would exit. The Obama administration estimates more than 12 million people signed up for private insurance on the exchanges for 2016.Insurers are in the midst of submitting proposed premium rates for 2017 ahead of mid-May deadlines set by state exchanges and insurance regulators. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini has questioned whether the Obamacare business was sustainable, but said he was working with the government to improve it. Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish has said that the company was committed to the exchanges.""I would still be surprised if other major insurers followed United's lead. United was in some sense in a category all its own,"" Kaiser Family Foundation Senior Vice President Larry Levitt said.Health plans sold to individual members represented a small part of UnitedHealth's revenue compared to large-scale contracts with employers, while Aetna and Anthem both had substantial business serving individuals.Aetna and Anthem are undergoing a U.S. Department of Justice review of what would be an historic consolidation in the health insurance industry.

135,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Aetna Inc (AET.N) said more customers opted for its Obamacare plans in the first quarter than it had expected, but added that the program needed to be more flexible to become sustainable.The health insurer hopes that the next government would allow companies to tailor Obamacare individual plans every year, just like it does with Medicare and Medicaid, Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said.Many insurers have lost money on the healthcare exchanges, which were set up under the Affordable Care Act, because total enrollment has fallen sharply, while some patient costs have been higher than expected.""We have not been able to touch this product because of the politics, but if we can get to that point, we believe, we are in a very good place to make this a sustainable program,"" he said on a call with analysts. Aetna said it had ended the quarter with 1.2 million individual members, which exceeded their previous membership estimates. Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), another big player in the industry, said on Wednesday it planned to stick to the business and was planning to grow in that market.However, UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the biggest U.S. health insurer, confirmed last week that it was exiting the business in 2017.Aetna, which is in the process of buying smaller rival Humana Inc (HUM.N), reported first-quarter operating earnings that topped analysts' estimates.  The company said it was on track to close the Humana acquisition by the second half of the year and that it had obtained about two-thirds of the necessary state approvals required to close the deal.Aetna's medical benefit ratio, which compares the amount spent on medical claims with income from premiums, deteriorated to 80.5 percent from 79.1 percent a year ago.  The company's operating earnings of $2.30 per share was above the average analyst estimate of $2.23, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose 4 percent to $15.69 billion, beating estimates of $15.45 billion.Aetna shares were up 1.5 percent at $115.52 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

136,"  U.S. health insurer Humana Inc (HUM.N), which plans to be bought by larger Aetna Inc (AET.N), is considering ending the sale of Obamacare individual plans in some states in 2017 to stem losses there.Humana's individual business, which sells plans under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, has been a drag on results, and the company still expects to lose money this year. Humana sells plans in 15 states.The company said on Wednesday that first-quarter earnings fell 46 percent due to higher costs in individual plans, including Obamacare, and its direct-to-customer Medicare Advantage plans.UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) said last month it was losing money and would largely exit the 34 states where it sells plans. Aetna said it is reviewing 2017 exchange participation state by state and that changes are needed to stabilize the exchanges.More than 12 million people have signed up for health insurance on the exchanges, but insurers say they are enrolling only when they need to use services. Because the market is smaller than foreseen, there is not a big enough pool of healthy users to cover the costs, they say. Humana said it is in the process of finalizing the sort of insurance plans it will offer in the business next year, but is considering a number of changes, including exiting certain states or products. It also said it may raise premium prices.Humana said there is higher use of medical services and prescriptions among 2015 members who renewed 2016 plans versus those who canceled them. New members in Obamacare plans sold outside the exchanges also had higher use than those who renewed, Humana said.In late 2015 the company set aside $176 million in reserves to cover losses on the individual business. This quarter, it earned money on the operation but increased reserves by that amount to cover additional anticipated losses, it said. Humana said it had 875,700 individual members as of March 31, a decline of 150,000 from a year earlier. Net income fell to $234 million, or $1.56 per share, in the first quarter, from $430 million, or $2.82 per share, a year earlier. It earned $1.86 per share on an adjusted basis and revenue was $13.80 billion versus $13.83 billion.

But the tradeoff is much less ability to use their preferred doctors and hospitals.Seniors can choose between traditional fee-for-service Medicare - which is accepted by most healthcare providers - or a Medicare Advantage plan. The latter encompasses health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or preferred provider organizations (PPOs), which control costs by creating healthcare provider networks that enrollees must use.In theory, prospective Advantage enrollees can review lists of in-network providers before opting into a plan. But a new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) finds that provider data often is very difficult to review, can be out of date and frequently contain inaccurate information.KFF’s review also found shortcomings in the quality of providers in some Medicare Advantage provider networks. One out of every five plans did not include a regional academic medical center - institutions which usually offer the highest quality care and top specialists. And only 40 percent of Advantage provider networks included top-quality cancer centers, as indicated by membership in the National Cancer Institute’s network.NCI-designated cancer centers offer cutting-edge treatments and tend to have greater access to clinical trials. They are especially important for patients with rare and advanced cancers, or other complicating conditions, said Gretchen Jacobson, KFF’s associate director of the program on Medicare policy and co-author of the study. The upshot: Medicare Advantage may be just fine if you are  healthy, but problems may crop up if your healthcare needs become more complex and you have very specific healthcare provider preferences. This year, 31 percent of Medicare enrollees are in Advantage plans, up from 11 percent in 2010. That number is expected to hit 41 percent by 2026, according to a forecast by the Congressional Budget Office.When Medicare enrollees join Medicare Advantage plans, their Part B premiums continue to be paid to Medicare, which then makes a monthly capitated payment to the Advantage plan. The payment is based on the plan’s estimated cost per enrollee, the plan’s quality rating and the health status of the enrollee.The largest providers are UnitedHealthcare, Humana Inc and Blue Cross Blue Shield. One often hears critics claim that healthcare providers are bailing out of traditional Medicare in large numbers - but that is not actually the case. Last year, 14 percent of Medicare enrollees who were seeking a new primary care doctor reported major problems in finding a physician who would treat them, according to survey data from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent congressional agency. Among those seeking a new specialist, 6 percent reported major problems. In both cases, that represents 1 percent of the total Medicare population. ADVANTAGES, PITFALLS  Advantage plans often offer extra benefits, such as health club memberships, vision care and some limited dental care. Cost-sharing is often lower, and many plans provide prescription drug coverage with no extra premium. “It can be very attractive to many seniors who are living on a fixed budget,” Jacobson said. The trade-off is limited provider networks - and the challenges prospective enrollees face in determining who they are allowed to see for healthcare, and who is off-limits. KFF reviewed 409 Advantage plans, including 307 HMOs and 102 PPOs. Researchers found provider directories often were riddled with errors, omissions and outdated information.“There’s no reason in this era of technology why this needs to be as difficult as it is,” Jacobson said. “People should be able to simply tell the system who their doctors are, the illnesses they have, and get a recommendation for a plan that will work for them.”KFF also found that Advantage provider network quality differs significantly. For example, Los Angeles has three NCI-designated cancer centers. Most of the Advantage plans there do not include any of them, but one plan includes all three.A report last year by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which runs Medicare, needs to improve its oversight of Advantage plans to assure that provider networks are robust. The report also criticized CMS for doing too little to assess the accuracy of Advantage plan provider lists.Even when Advantage enrollees are able to confirm participation by their healthcare providers, there is no guarantee that will continue. Advantage plans are free to add or drop health providers during the course of an enrollment season.  That became an especially hot issue in 2014 when UnitedHealthcare dropped providers who covered thousands of the insurer's patients, including the prominent Yale-New Haven Hospital system.Democrats in Congress have proposed legislation that would prohibit Advantage plans from dropping providers without cause during the middle of an enrollment year.Under current rules, plans must provide 30 days’ notice to enrollees when providers are dropped. Enrollees who lose access to a provider can make a midyear plan change only under very limited circumstances. “You can do it only if you are receiving ongoing care from a provider that is terminated,” Jacobson said. “Otherwise you need to wait until the next open enrollment period.”The annual enrollment period for Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans are held from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 each year. At that point, a beneficiary could switch to a different Advantage plan, or shift back to traditional Medicare. But a serious diagnosis in January would leave you hamstrung until the following year.Said Jacobson: ""It can be a roll of the dice.""(This version of the July 7 story corrects paragraph 8. An earlier version of this column said that the enrollee's Part B premium ""goes to the insurance company providing the plan"".)

158,"   By Caroline Humer and Carl O'Donnell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK While Wall Street is largely betting that antitrust regulators will stop Humana Inc's (HUM.N) takeover by larger rival Aetna Inc (AET.N), shares of Humana could still fall as much as 18 percent if the deal unravels, investors and analysts say.    Doubts over Aetna's purchase of Humana and over a second proposed transaction in which Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) would buy rival Cigna Inc (CI.N) have run high since both deals were announced about a year ago.Shares of Humana and Cigna have traded well below their buyout agreements. Antitrust regulators at the U.S. Department of Justice have concerns over how both deals would affect competition and prices in the healthcare market.    Of the two transactions, the Humana deal is still seen as having a higher probability of gaining approval.Equity analyst Ana Gupte at Leerink Partners has forecast a chance of less than 50 percent that the Anthem-Cigna deal will close, but expects that Aetna will receive a green light to buy Humana by the third quarter of this year.    ""The Aetna-Humana deal always seemed more realistic and likely that they can divest certain parts more easily and we still think that's the case,"" said Oliver Marti, portfolio manager at Columbus Circle Investors' Healthcare Strategies fund. CCI did not own any of the insurer shares as of April 30 according to regulatory filings.     Aetna and Humana's overlap is primarily in managing Medicare Advantage health programs for the elderly, a position Aetna hopes to strengthen through the merger. However, Aetna has outlined plans to sell some Medicare Advantage assets in the transaction where there is regional overlap, and has told the Justice Department it has several willing buyers, Reuters reported last week.    Humana shares now trade around $159, far below Aetna's buyout offer worth about $224 per share. They could fall an additional 9 percent to $145 if the Justice Department sues to block the deal, and sink as much as 15 percent to $135 if Aetna decides to immediately walk away or does not ultimately reach a settlement, according to four investors who focus on deal arbitrage.      Leerink's Gupte has also said Humana stock would trade at $140 to $150 if the Justice Department sues to block the deal, while Marti sees it falling as low as $130 if the acquisition is scrapped entirely.     The investors, who rank among the 125 largest shareholders in Humana, spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss investments. They said the estimated downside represents a view shared among many investors, who expect a decision from the Justice Department sometime this month.      Another investor, Joel Emery, chief investment officer at an investment fund called Tareo Capital, said he is in the camp that still sees a possible deal between Aetna and Humana. If either that transaction or Anthem's purchase of Cigna are blocked, he expects the insurers to boost profit growth through share buybacks, and to seek smaller acquisitions. Tareo holds Cigna shares.    ""I think the sector still has the ability to consolidate,"" Emery said.

164,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings said today that its ratings on Anthem  Inc. (ANTM), Aetna Inc. (AET), Cigna Corp. (CI) and Humana Inc. (HUM) remain on  Rating Watch following ANTM's and AET's separate announcements that they intend  to challenge today's decisions by the Department of Justice's (DOJ) to block  their respective acquisitions of CI and HUM.  Fitch anticipates the companies' ratings remaining on rating watch pending the  ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. If ANTM and AET ultimately prove unsuccessful  in challenging the DOJ's lawsuits, Fitch expects to complete a review of the  insurers' then current capital and operational strategies. Assuming these  capital and operational strategies are broadly consistent with those the  insurers maintained prior to entering into their respective merger agreements,  Fitch, consistent with previous comments, would likely affirm the insurers'  ratings at their current ratings levels.   Should the challenge prove successful, Fitch, consistent with previous comments,  expects to affirm ANTM's ratings at their current levels with a Negative Outlook  once the company accesses the capital markets to fund its acquisition. Fitch  would also expect to downgrade the ratings on CI's senior notes one notch upon  the acquisition's close. Similarly Fitch would expect to downgrade AET's ratings  and to upgrade HUM's ratings upon the close of their transaction. These  anticipated rating actions would be subject to a review of potential asset  divestiture required by the DOJ and the extent to which they would alter the  profiles of the combined organizations. This is an area of heightened concern  given the DOJ's assertion that divestitures proposed by the companies to date  have fallen short of those required to prevent the DOJ from filing suits to  block the transactions.  Fitch's ratings on ANTM and AET, the acquiring companies in their respective  transactions, are on Rating Watch Negative reflecting the higher leverage and  lower interest coverage that would result from the transactions' completion and  integration risks. In Fitch's view, these risks are outweighed from a ratings  perspective by the size and scale benefits that would result from the completion  of the transactions.  Fitch's ratings on CI and HUM, the companies to be acquired in their respective  transactions, are also on Rating Watch. Ratings on CI's senior unsecured  securities are on Rating Watch Negative, reflecting concerns about a combined  ANTM-CI organization's leverage, interest coverage and integration risks. HUM's  ratings are on Rating Watch Positive reflecting anticipated ratings benefits  from a combined AET-HUM organization's more diverse product portfolio as well as  the fact that HUM's current ratings are two notches lower than AET's current  ratings.

We will not shy away from complex cases,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a news conference on Thursday. ""We will protect the interests of the American people.""The deals would hurt consumers in the different markets served by the four companies, from medical coverage provided by large corporations to their employees to Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly and insurance sold to individuals on exchanges created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, the Justice Department said.""We have no doubt that these mergers would reduce competition from what it is today,"" said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General William Baer, who spearheaded the antitrust reviews.Merging Aetna's and Humana's Medicare Advantage businesses would create the largest U.S. manager of the healthcare insurance for seniors and the disabled.The Anthem deal for Cigna would create the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, with about 53 million members, surpassing UnitedHealth Group's 45.9 million as of June 30, and make it the leader in employer-based health insurance.Aetna and Anthem had each argued their proposed purchases would help lower prices for consumers by giving them greater leverage in negotiating with doctors and hospitals.AETNA VOWS LEGAL FIGHT Aetna and Humana said Thursday they plan ""to vigorously defend the companies' pending merger,"" worth $33 billion. Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said the company has proposed divesting enough assets to ensure competition in markets where it overlaps with Humana.""If we can't come to a negotiation on what markets to divest, although we have two very complete remedies in front of the Department of Justice now, I think I'm willing to let a judge decide,"" Bertolini told business news channel CNBC. ""We'll go all the way we need to to make this happen.""Anthem had a more muted response, saying it was committed to working toward a settlement with the Justice Department for its $45 billion transaction, but would challenge the lawsuit if necessary. Cigna said it was evaluating its options. It does not believe a deal would close before 2017, ""if at all.""After news of the lawsuit, Humana raised its 2016 earnings forecast, saying its core businesses, Medicare Advantage and Healthcare Services, are performing better than expected.

""There's somewhat of a relief rally, too, given that this has been an overhang for so long, particularly with Anthem and Cigna,"" he said.CONCERN FOR DIFFERENT CONSUMERS In the lawsuit against Aetna, the Justice Department cited specific concerns about damage to 1.6 million people in 364 counties who are customers of Medicare Advantage, the program that serves older people.It also said there were issues for the individual plans sold on Obamacare exchanges, where the government has sought to spur competition and keep prices low.About 20 state insurance departments were required to review the Aetna-Humana deal. Missouri came out firmly against it, while others, including California and New York, approved it after reaching a settlement. In the lawsuit against Anthem-Cigna, antitrust regulators said the combination would substantially lessen competition in an already consolidated industry, harming millions of Americans, doctors and hospitals.The Justice Department said it was concerned about the impact on the national corporate business, which serves large companies and which it said has only four competitors.It also said there were issues with local business markets, the individual Obamacare exchanges and the impact a combined company could have on contracts with doctors.The presidential campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton, who said when the deals were announced she was ""very skeptical"" they would benefit consumers, said Thursday they ""applaud"" the Justice Department's decision.""Hillary will continue to fight to reduce health costs and strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent corporations from gaining too much market power,"" Clinton policy adviser Ann O'Leary said in a statement.Doctors and hospitals had urged the Justice Department to try to block the deal, and some large employers were also against the combination.Aetna and Anthem had each proposed asset sales to the regulators, but they did not adequately address the loss of market competition, Baer said.Eleven states and the District of Colombia joined the Justice Department lawsuit against Anthem and Cigna; eight states and DC joined the lawsuit against Aetna and Humana.If the government successfully scuttles the deals, Anthem would owe Cigna $1.85 billion in breakup fees. Aetna would have to pay Humana $1 billion. If the deals fail for other reasons, the breakup fees would be different.The unusual move against two deals in the same industry represents a repeat of history for Baer, who headed the department's Antitrust Division until a short time ago and is now the No. 3 official in the Justice Department.In March 1998, Baer asked a court to stop a major consolidation of the U.S. drug wholesaling business.

171,"   By Caroline Humer and Carl O'Donnell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), whose $33 billion purchase of Humana Inc (HUM.N) has been spurned by the U.S. government, faces a tough but not impossible legal battle to try to reinstate the deal.Aetna vowed to fight “to the very end” after the Department of Justice filed suit earlier on Thursday to block the merger, which had been in the works for more than a year. Antitrust reviewers say the combination will hurt consumers and the companies' proposed fix - selling some health plans to a competitor - is insufficient. The Justice Department simultaneously sued to block Anthem Inc’s (ANTM.N) proposed $45 billion deal for Cigna Inc (CI.N), moving against an unprecedented effort to consolidate the U.S. health insurance market.Of the two deals, analysts and investors see Aetna and Humana as having a slight chance to reverse the decision through a court battle. They face a Justice Department empowered by a series of high-profile successes against mega-mergers, scuttling deals in industries from oil services to retail stores and telecommunications.""My initial impression from the complaint ... is that the Justice Department and the states are on much safer ground"" in their argument against an Aetna-Humana tie-up, said Beau Buffier, co-head of the antitrust group at Shearman & Sterling in New York.The Justice Department lawsuit focused on a county-by-county analysis of where Aetna and Humana have what is deemed too much market share in providing Medicare Advantage for elderly people and in the individual health plans created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Aetna will argue in court that the Justice Department defined the market for Medicare Advantage too narrowly, which has caused it to see competition issues where they do not exist, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said in an interview. The government has failed to take into account that seniors can not only choose between Medicare Advantage plans sold by private players, but also have the government-run Medicare program as an option.""Let a judge decide. Is Medicare Advantage competitive with Medicare fee-for-service? If that is indeed the case, then there isn't any market we need to divest,"" Bertolini said. ""If we have to divest, can we provide an appropriate remedy? And we have.""The Justice Department has already rejected that argument. However, Aetna will use evidence that the Obama administration envisioned Medicare and Medicare Advantage as direct competitors as it sought support for the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. Aetna and Humana also have an answer to the concerns over the Obamacare market, since Humana has already announced plans to cut back dramatically on its presence in that business.""We think over time, that becomes less of an issue,"" Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said in an interview. Humana will in 2017 offer Obamacare plans in only about 160 U.S. counties, compared with 1,351 counties this year. The Justice Department has signaled antitrust concerns in 19 counties.Aetna may also gain some leverage if the Anthem-Cigna deal breaks up first, according to some antitrust experts. In that scenario, Anthem could become a buyer of some Medicare Advantage business they need to divest. “If Cigna-Anthem craters, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Justice Department agreeing to some kind of divestiture package,” said Matthew Cantor, an antitrust lawyer at Constantine Cannon.Bertolini said Aetna has presented a package of assets to sell that nearly matches up with the 364 counties in 21 states where the Justice Department cites a lack of competition. Aetna has two buyers for those health plans that have experience in Medicare Advantage, he said. A source familiar with the situation said the two companies that have offered to buy all the assets are WellCare Health Plans Inc (WCG.N) and Molina HealthCare Inc (MOH.N).The Justice Department has argued that the proposed buyers are not strong enough players on their own. ""Overall, this will be all about litigating the fix,"" said Andrea Murino, co-chair of Goodwin's antitrust group based in Washington D.C. ""What DOJ wants when they come up with a remedy is an immediate and expansive competitive response - to substitute one company in for another without missing a beat.""

185,"  NEW YORK Aetna Inc, the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, on Monday said that due to persistent financial losses on Obamacare plans, it will sell individual insurance on the government-run online marketplaces in only four states next year, down from the current 15 states.Aetna's decision follows similar moves from UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc., which have cited similar concerns about financial losses on these exchanges created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law.Aetna is also trying to buy Humana and is currently fighting a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at blocking the $34 billion deal.Aetna, which earlier this year said it was too soon to give up on the exchanges despite its challenges, this month signaled it was reconsidering. On Aug. 2, the company said it would not expand in 2017 and would review all its individual business.Many insurers last year had said they expected to profit on the exchanges, but now say more exchange rules must be changed for it to be sustainable. Only about 11 million people have signed up through the exchanges, about half as many as expected.Larry Levitt, healthcare economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that if enrollment stagnates, small technical fixes likely will not be enough to bring big insurers back. ""More healthy people need to be encouraged to sign up,"" Levitt said by email.  Aetna said that the current risk adjustment system, in which the government balances out the costs of sicker than typical populations through payments to insurers, is not adequate. Aetna said that it had a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million on the individual business and has lost $430 million since the plans first went on sale in 2014. Kevin Counihan, Chief Executive of the U.S. government-run individual marketplace, said that the risks of the customer pool is improving. ""It’s no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality rather than by denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions,"" Counihan said in a statement.Aetna on Monday said it would continue to sell plans on the exchanges in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia in 2017. The plans, which are eligible for income-based government subsidies, will be sold in 242 counties, down from 778 counties this year. States it is exiting include Florida and Ohio. It will continue to sell individual plans that meet the law's requirements - such as not denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions - outside of the exchanges where it does now, the company said.

192,"  Health insurer Humana Inc (HUM.N) on Wednesday said a U.S. government health department cut its quality rating on Humana Medicare plans that currently enroll more than 1 million people, which could affect how much the government pays the insurer in 2018.Humana said it disagreed with the new quality ratings and that it will ask the government to reconsider its assessment. It also said it would take operational actions to mitigate the financial impact of the ratings drop.The cut could mean at least a $1 billion revenue hole for 2018, JP Morgan analyst Gary Taylor wrote in a research note. He suggested that Humana could cut some benefits and move other enrollees to higher performing plans to protect profits, but that it would be difficult to cover all of the gap.Shares of Humana, whose plan to be bought by larger rival Aetna Inc (AET.N) is being challenged by the U.S. Justice Department in court, fell 5.8 percent, or $10.34, to $167.19.

The government reimburses insurers more for 4-star rated Medicare plans than it does for lower-rated plans.The change in ratings would affect these payments in 2018, but is not expected to impact membership growth in 2017, Humana said.Humana raised its 2016 earnings forecast, citing better-than-projected performance in its Medicare Advantage business. Humana now anticipates earnings of about $8.80 per share on a GAAP basis and about $9.50 on an adjusted basis for the year ending Dec. 31, or $0.25 per share above its previous guidance.Medicare uses a Star rating system to measure how well Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans perform.

207,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. Justice Department attorney told a federal judge on Monday that health insurer Aetna Inc's planned acquisition of Humana Inc would break antitrust law by reducing competition in Medicare Advantage and Obamacare exchange businesses, kicking off a trial expected to last weeks.The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in July asking the court to stop Aetna's $34 billion deal for Humana, arguing it would lead to higher prices for seniors and the disabled on Medicare and for people who use the individual insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Aetna defended the deal on Monday, arguing that Medicare Advantage competes with the government's traditional Medicare program for elderly or disabled patients. It also said that it plans to stay out of the Obamacare exchanges in the near future.Both programs, as well as antitrust enforcement, could face changes under Republican President-elect Donald Trump.Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath told Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that traditional government-managed Medicare does not compete with Medicare Advantage, which is run by insurers. A witness called by the government, Aetna executive Nancy Cocozza, president of Aetna's Medicare Business, was shown internal documents that appeared to show that Aetna considered Humana a major competitor but not original Medicare. The documents were not visible in the court.Shown one assessment of top competitors that did not have Medicare, Cocozza protested, ""These are MA (Medicare Advantage) competitors but there are others.""Conrath also said that Aetna's plan to largely exit the Obamacare exchanges in 2017 should be disregarded because the company could re-enter the market as soon as 2018 if it chooses. Conrath said written communications showed that Aetna left Obamacare because of the antitrust lawsuit. Aetna has said it would not return to the exchanges until 2019 at the earliest.Share prices of both companies dropped Monday. Humana closed down 2.2 percent at $208.83 while Aetna was down 3 percent at $129.45.Aetna attorney John Majoras argued that traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage did compete, citing a U.S. government website. There could soon be more competition, he said, noting ""entry has been common and it has been widespread."" Majoras also argued that the Obamacare exchanges were unprofitable and said that was the real reason the company planned to drop out of 11 of the 15 states where they are on the exchanges. ""The result to Aetna has been mounting losses,"" Majoras said. ""Humana's losses were actually even a bit worse.""The Justice Department filed another lawsuit in July to stop Anthem Inc's planned $45 billion purchase of Cigna Corp. That trial is underway in the same courthouse. The trials will be over before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. He has pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare and has said Medicare should be modernized.   Humana is the second largest Medicare Advantage insurer while Aetna is the fourth, and the two compete in more than 600 counties, the government said in its complaint.
