0,"  VANCOUVER Nov 25 British Columbia has approved a liquefied natural gas export terminal being developed by Malaysia's Petronas, along with two pipelines to service the province's fledging LNG industry, the province's Ministry of Environment said on Tuesday.A federal environmental review of Petronas' Pacific NorthWest LNG project is still ongoing, with the Malaysian state-owned energy firm expected to make a final investment decision on the $11 billion facility before year end. Provincial environmental assessment certificates were issued for Petronas' terminal, along with the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission pipeline, being developed by TransCanada Corp , and the Westcoast Connector Gas Transmission pipeline, proposed by Spectra Energy Corp. More than a dozen LNG export terminals have been proposed for British Columbia as energy companies from around the world race to export cheap Canadian gas to international markets. But uncertainties around taxation, the regulatory process and aboriginal consent have called into question whether any of the projects will ultimately be realized.

2,"  (Adds confirmation from Spectra, quotes)By Nia WilliamsCALGARY, Alberta, April 29 Pipeline company Spectra Energy Corp is cutting 170 jobs as it consolidates positions at its Calgary and Vancouver offices in western Canada, the company said on Wednesday. Gary Weilinger, vice-president of external affairs, said abut 85 contractors and 85 employees would be let go. There will be no cuts in field positions.In total, Spectra has around 1,200 employees in western Canada. The pipeline and midstream company focuses on gathering, processing and transporting natural gas and liquids across North America. Weilinger said the job cuts were not related to weak global oil prices, which more than halved between June 2014 and January this year, and pipeline volumes remained strong. ""We have got a number of office and support functions around western Canada that operate parallel to others and we are consolidating some of those functions,"" he said.Some of the affected employees will leave Spectra on Wednesday. Others will leave by the end of the year, and a third group will be offered relocation packages to Spectra offices elsewhere, Weilinger said.

4,"   By Catherine Ngai | CALGARY, Alberta, July 9  CALGARY, Alberta, July 9 Spectra Energy Corp's  280,000-barrel-per-day Express pipeline cannot pull crude oil from Gibson Energy Inc's Hardisty, Alberta terminal, where a booster pump is being repaired, a spokesman for Spectra said on Thursday.Work expected to be completed on July 21, he added. Gibson Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a shipper notice sent out last week and seen by Reuters said all affected shippers should contact the Express pipeline scheduler for alternate solutions.It is unknown how many barrels per day the Gibson terminal puts on the Express pipeline, which runs from Hardisty to Casper, Wyoming, and carries a variety of light, medium and heavy crudes. One trader in Calgary said the overall market impact appeared to be limited so far. Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for August delivery last traded at 50 cents per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers, having settled at 40 cents per barrel below on Wednesday.Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for August delivery traded at $12.95 per barrel below WTI, widening from $12.65 per barrel below the previous day.

5,"   By Mike De Souza | CALGARY, July 14  CALGARY, July 14 Canada's national energy regulator has ordered Spectra Energy Corp to correct a series of ""management system failures"" following more than two dozen safety and security incidents at its Canadian plants and facilities since 2014.The National Energy Board (NEB) issued a safety order to the Houston-based pipeline and midstream company on Tuesday, outlining several concerns and asking management to fix the problems at its Westcoast Energy processing plants in western Canada.The Board has issued C$122,300 in fines to Spectra Energy Corp since the beginning of 2015, and a spokesman for the regulator said more sanctions could follow if the company is unable to abide by the order. ""The Board expects Westcoast to address safety concerns on a systemic basis, throughout all its gas processing plants and facilities,"" said the safety order sent to Mark Fiedorek, the president of Spectra Energy Transmission West. ""Based on recent violations described below, the Board is not confident safety concerns are being addressed in this manner.""The order, signed by the regulator's secretary, Sheri Young, said that Spectra Energy Corp had violated regulations for processing plants 27 times since April 2014. The infractions related to issues such as inadequate inspection and testing of material handling equipment. The company said in a statement that it was committed to taking appropriate steps to improve all safety and environmental protection-related practices.""This includes providing the NEB with the information it has requested and demonstrating that a systematic approach to management systems has been implemented,"" said the statement. The regulator said it was also investigating Spectra over a June 26 incident involving a spill at a terminal in Hardisty, Alberta on its Express pipeline.Board spokesman Darin Barter said the company can expect to see more inspections from the regulator in the future.""The safety order is a guarantee that we'll see progress,"" he said.

6,"   By Mike Stone  Spectra Energy Corp (SE.N), an oil and natural gas pipeline company, is bidding for the whole of Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N), even though its market capitalization is about half that of Williams, people familiar with the matter said. Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams decided to put itself on the auction block after it rejected an all-stock acquisition proposal from rival Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) in June. At the time the bid was worth $53.1 billion including the assumption of debt; it was contingent upon Williams' canceling its plans to acquire the portion of its pipeline subsidiary Williams Partners LP (WPZ.N) that it does not already own for $14 billion.Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) is also interested in Williams, but would face potential antitrust issues if it proceeded with a bid, the people added.Williams collected an initial round from prospective bidders in late July according to the people.      Final bids for Williams are due the last week of August, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions were private.Energy Transfer has tied up at least eight investment banks that are now working on its bid, the people said, narrowing the financing options for rivals looking to compete for Williams, which has a market capitalization of around $38.5 billion.Wells Fargo is advising Houston-based Spectra, the people said.  Spectra, Williams and Wells Fargo declined to comment. ETE  and Kinder Morgan were not immediately available to comment. Deals in the energy sector, especially oil and gas pipeline and processing companies, are turning to a more traditional corporate structure as advantages associated with a master limited partnership (MLP) wane over time. Energy Transfer would be the latest MLP to propose using a C-corporation as a way to maximize tax advantages, increase cash flows and broaden institutional interest.The sector had previously embraced the MLP structure because the tax burden is passed through to investors who receive fat yields. Because the partnership pays no taxes, it has a lower cost of capital.

7,"  HOUSTON Spectra Energy Corp (SE.N) shut its Platte Pipeline that carries crude oil from Guernsey, Wyoming, to Wood River, Illinois, as a precaution due to flooding on the Mississippi River, the company said.Spectra said in an email it will restart the pipeline as receding floodwaters permit. The 932-mile Platte Pipeline transports up to 164,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Casper, Wyoming, to Guernsey and 145,000 bpd from Guernsey to Wood River.  The pipeline is the second crude system delivering into Wood River to shut as a result of flooding following severe weather throughout parts of the Midwest. Phillips 66 (PSX.N) operates a 306,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Wood River. On Tuesday, Enbridge confirmed its 200,000-barrel-per-day Ozark pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Wood River, shut due to the flooding.
