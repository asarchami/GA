Goldman's earnings fell 21 percent. Citigroup's profit missed expectations.The results followed fairly positive reads on the financial sector with earnings from Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co earlier this week.Goldman's stock slid 2 percent to close at $175.17.

14,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) Citigroup's (Citi) fourth quarter 2013 (4Q'13)  reported results declined 17% sequentially, driven mainly by weaker trading  results, elevated legal and related charges, and higher provision expenses. This  was partially offset by margin and spread income expansion, well-controlled core  expenses, and decent loan growth. Further, other credit risk fundamentals remain  strong with continuing improvements in liquidity and capital levels.   Excluding the CVA/DVA loss of $164 million and a $189 million gain on the credit  card divestiture, Citi's estimated core return on average assets (ROAA) declined  to just 57 basis points (bps) during the quarter. This performance is viewed as  relatively weak, both in absolute terms and when compared to its large bank  peers. Nonetheless, performance is much improved from the 4Q'12, and full-year  comparisons also reflect an overall improving financial profile. Citi's  full-year reported ROA was approximately 74bps (adjusted 73bps), as compared to  40bps (adjusted 62bps) in 2012 which includes a couple of large one-time  charges, primarily the significant repositioning charges in 4Q'12, and  impairments related to the divestiture of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint  venture and Akbank.  By business line, Citi's Securities & Banking net income was most hard hit in  4Q'13, falling 11% on a sequential basis (excluding CVA/DVA). Most of Citi's  Securities & Banking revenue comes from its fixed income markets business, which  fell 16% from the prior quarter. This compares poorly to improved FICC income  for BAC and GS, and a more modest decline for JPM. Positively, Citi reported  strong growth in investment banking revenues on a linked-quarter basis  reflecting growth in equity underwriting and M&A. Supported by stronger  investment banking and equity markets, as well as lower expenses in 2013,  full-year net income in securities & banking was up 9% from 2012.  Global Consumer Banking net income was flat on a sequential basis, supported by  growth in Latin America and the Best Buy card portfolio acquisition, offset by  continuing declines in mortgage refinancing activities. Transaction Services net  income was down slightly on a sequential basis. Assets under custody are up 10%  from a year ago.  Citi continues to wind down its assets housed in Citi Holdings, which fell to  $117 billion or 6% of consolidated assets. Despite the continual wind-down, Citi  Holdings continues to drag down consolidated earnings, with a loss of $422  million in 4Q'13 related to the aforementioned legal charges. Positively,  mortgage repurchase provision expenses have abated, and Citi has now finalized  settlements with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Future repurchase-related risk  would stem from sponsored private-label securitizations (PLS), though Fitch  views Citi as relatively less exposed to future PLS legal risk than both BAC and  JPM.   Legal and related charges remain elevated at approximately $800 million during  the quarter, totaling over $3 billion for the year. Fitch expects legal charges  will likely remain elevated over the near- to intermediate-term for Citi and its  large bank peers. To date, litigation losses have been materially less than at  both BAC and JPM. However, Citi remains exposed to LIBOR, currency trading, and  credit-default swap investigations, to name a few, though Fitch notes that  visibility into future legal-related costs is very limited. Unlike its large bank peers, Citi reported both a sequential increase in net  charge-offs (NCOs) and provision expenses, up 5% and 16%, respectively, driven  by higher credit costs in Latin America and Citi Holdings. However, Citi  continues to release reserves, albeit at a measured pace, especially when  compared to some of its large bank peers. As such, its level of  reserves-to-loans remains the highest of the large banks at roughly 3% at  year-end. This is viewed as prudent, given still elevated levels of  non-performing assets (NPAs) (inclusive of accruing troubled debt  restructurings). Citi's capital ratios continued to remain very strong. Retained earnings growth  during 4Q'13 was offset by an increase in operational risk-weighted assets,  reflecting model changes during the quarter that incorporated recent external  operational losses. Under Basel III, Citi's estimated Tier I common ratio was  10.5%, and above its current long-term target of 10%. Citi also disclosed that  its estimated Basel III supplemental leverage ratio was an estimated 5.4% at  Dec. 31, 2013, while Fitch expects the bank-level ratio remained above the 6%  bank-level requirement.

But they also cut into profits.Goldman's profit fell 21 percent, as revenue from fixed income trading dropped 11 percent after adjusting for an accounting charge, it reported on Thursday.Citigroup, which also reported on Thursday, said fixed income revenue slid 15 percent to $2.33 billion in what it called a ""challenging trading environment.""Profit at Citi, the third-largest U.S. bank, rose 21 percent, after adjusting for items, as it cut costs and released dipped into funds set aside for bad loans, but the results missed analysts' estimates in large part because of weakness in the bond trading business.At rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) bond trading revenue rose 1 percent, while at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), it jumped 16 percent. Goldman shares fell 2.3 percent to $174.65, while Citi was off 4.2 percent to $52.68.Many fixed-income, currency and commodity trading businesses are complex and rely on large amounts of capital. For years, the operations supercharged Wall Street's profits as banks borrowed extensively and minimized the capital they had locked up in the business.The weak results in the fourth quarter could raise questions about why banks such as Goldman and Citigroup are not moving faster to prune their bond trading operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, it was 25.3 percent, including accounting charges. At the same time, Goldman's overall return on equity, which measures how much profit it wrung out of its balance sheet, was 11 percent for 2013, well below the 30 percent returns that the bank generated before the crisis despite some improvements.Some banks are making big changes to fixed income. Swiss banks UBS AG UBSN.VX(UBS.N) and Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX(CS.N), under more pressure by their regulators, have taken the lead in paring down. UBS largely exited the fixed income business, while Credit Suisse has consolidated and exited operations to bring the number of product areas in its bond sales and trading unit to 80 from 120.Others such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are relying more heavily on businesses such as wealth management for growth and as a source of steady revenues. The unit is expected to be a bright spot for Morgan Stanley, when it reports fourth-quarter results on Friday.But consultants and bankers said many on Wall Street are still holding out on cutting their fixed income businesses. They are waiting to see which rivals scale back. For those that stay, they hope less competition makes bond trading profitable. On a conference call with analysts, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the bank was ""very comfortable"" in fixed income, and hopes to benefit as competitors exit.BRIGHT SPOTS As fixed income trading comes under sustained pressure, other operations such as equities trading, and asset and wealth management, are helping counter some of the headwinds.In its equities business, Goldman's revenue from client stock trading fell 22 percent to $598 million, even as stocks hit new highs.

The S&P financial sector index fell 0.7 percent, making it the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors.""This group is very tied to the economy, and it makes it difficult to argue that we could see a higher GDP ahead, given these,"" said Paul Nolte, managing director at Dearborn Partners in Chicago. ""The earnings picture, along with some recent data, suggests we haven't made it out of the very slow growth rate that we've been seeing.""UnitedHealth Group Inc was the Dow's biggest decliner, falling 3.2 percent to $72.47 even as the largest U.S. health insurer reported a higher fourth-quarter profit and said 2014 earnings would improve.CSX Corp shares also sank, dropping 7.4 percent to $27.07 a day after the major U.S. railroad reported profits that missed expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 78.16 points, or 0.47 percent, at 16,403.78. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 4.45 points, or 0.24 percent, at 1,843.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.64 of a point, or 0.02 percent, at 4,214.25.After a lackluster start to 2014 on concerns that stock valuations may be too high after the S&P 500's rally of 30 percent last year, the index surged 1.6 percent over the past two sessions to close at a record high on Wednesday, its first since Dec. 31.""Stocks are a little more expensive at these levels, but I don't think we're overly due for a correction,"" said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New York. ""If we saw a pullback of even 10 percent, I would view that as a buying opportunity."" The stock of Best Buy Co Inc plunged 27.6 percent to $27.19, easily the S&P 500's worst performer after the world's largest consumer electronics chain reported a drop in holiday sales and forecast a bigger-than-expected decline in quarterly operating margins.In the latest economic data, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in December while the core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, edged up only 0.1 percent, suggesting underlying inflation was muted.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000 in the week ended Jan. 11. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, suggesting a sharp slowdown in job growth in December was likely to be temporary.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index stood at 9.4 points in January, compared with 6.4 in December. This month's reading exceeded the median forecast of 8.6 among economists polled by Reuters. But companies' outlook for the months ahead worsened.In the deal arena, Apollo Global Management LLC said it would buy CEC Entertainment Inc, the parent of the Chuck E Cheese restaurant chain, for about $948 million.

21,"  HONG KONG Citi (C.N) said on Monday it had launched an automated RMB cross-border pooling solution for its clients in the China (Shanghai) Free Trade Zone, a move that could help multinational companies optimize their cash management and enhance capital efficiency.The solution enables companies to automatically sweep RMB between their onshore and offshore entities freely, without providing supporting documents or applying for approvals on a deal basis.Citi's cross-border yuan sweeping solution was pioneered for Roche, a leading European pharmaceutical company, which marks an important step in the ongoing financial development in the free trade zone.""We are using state-of-the-art global concentration platforms to address clients' local and cross-border RMB needs, enabling them to capitalize on opportunities that evolving regulatory reforms bring,"" Amol Gupte, Citi's Asia Pacific head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, said in a statement. China launched the Shanghai free trade zone in late September and officials promised a far more open and streamlined environment for foreign firms to do business there, along with the relaxation of policies for a raft of service sectors.A batch of banks including Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Citibank, DBS (DBSM.SI), Hang Seng Bank (0011.HK), HSBC (0005.HK) and Bank of East Asia (0023.HK) have received approvals to start operations in the pilot zone. HSBC said last week it had offered cross-border RMB sweeping service for Dover, a manufacturer of diversified industrial products, to help it deploy funds more efficiently between its overseas and domestic affiliates.Beijing is stepping up efforts to open up domestic financial markets and lift the global status of its currency, aiming to reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar as the world's second-largest economy. With a slew of policies introduced to promote the ""redback"", the yuan already overtook the euro to become the second-most used currency in trade finance, data from global transaction services organization SWIFT showed.The pace is expected to accelerate.

22,"  Jan 21 Citigroup Inc has warned against the United Kingdom opting out of the European Union, saying such a move could hurt the British economy and reduce investment from international companies, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.Jim Cowles, Citi chief executive officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told the Financial Times that there was ""mounting concern"" among clients about their ability to use the United Kingdom as a regional hub if the country exits the EU.""It is not that international companies will stop investing in Britain, but their investment just will not be at the scale we have become accustomed to,"" Cowles told the newspaper.He added that the existing trade arrangements will be at risk and Britain will have no influence in making the rules in the future. Citigroup is the latest corporation to say it favours Britain continuing its membership of the 28-member trading bloc after Prime Minister David Cameron promised voters he would renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by 2017 if his ruling Conservatives were returned to power after elections due in May 2015. According to the Financial Times, the British Bankers' Association has also sent a submission to a Treasury review of powers between the United Kingdom and Germany. The submission said that a single market for financial services is a significant factor in the success of the United Kingdom as a financial centre, and of considerable value to the UK economy.European aerospace group Airbus, one of Britain's largest employers, on Tuesday had voiced concerns over the possibility of the country leaving the EU, saying the benefits of an alternative economic model needed to be proven. The London-based Centre for European Reform (CER) predicted last week that Britain would struggle to maintain trade with other EU member states - now 54 percent of goods trade - if it left the bloc.British finance minister George Osborne recently warned the European Union that it must reform if it wants Britain to remain a member, and said it faces decline if it resists change.",2014-01-22,C,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 7:27pm EST",Citi warns against Britain's exit from the EU -FT,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-eu-citigroup-idUSL3N0KV5EL20140122?type=companyNews

The Treasury post was previously occupied by Lael Brainard, who stepped down last year and was nominated by President Barack Obama earlier this month to serve on the Fed's board of governors.The White House and the Treasury Department had no comment, while Sheets did not immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment.Sheets has been the global head of international economics at Citi in New York since 2011. He was hired in part to focus on the position of the United States in the global economy. Prior to joining Citi, which is one of the world's largest banking conglomerates, Sheets spent much of his career as an economist at the Fed. At one point he was an adviser to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on international economics.""(He's) highly experienced and well-respected in both the public and private sectors,"" said Timothy Adams, who held the under secretary for international affairs post at the Treasury during the administration of President George W.

31,"  By Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO Feb 4 Rising borrowing costs, declining defaults and an unexpected jump in loan disbursements drove record profit for Itaú Unibanco Holding SA in the fourth quarter, even after expenses at Brazil's largest private-sector bank exceeded expectations.Recurring net income, or profit excluding one-off items, came in at a record 4.680 billion reais ($1.95 billion) in the quarter, up 16.4 percent from the prior three months, according to a securities filing on Tuesday. A Thomson Reuters poll of seven analysts predicted profit of 4.144 billion reais.On a quarterly basis, recurring profit rose at its fastest in nine quarters. Loan book expansion was the strongest in three years, delinquencies fell for a sixth straight quarter and net interest income reached the highest level in a year - taking most analysts in the poll by surprise.The stunning results led shares of Itaú to post their biggest gain in 2 -1/2 years. Analysts at Grupo BTG Pactual raised their recommendation on Itaú to ""buy,"" saying earnings data partially offset concerns over a weak economy in Brazil.""Itau Unibanco is clearly ahead of the pack,"" wrote Credit Suisse Securities analyst Marcelo Telles in a client note. Fourth-quarter results ""came to confirm Itaú is turning the business around very successfully.""The results underpin the success of Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal's strategy in the past 18 months, consisting of growing in mortgages and payroll loans rather than riskier credit, and controlling expenses. Setubal, Itaú's CEO since 1994, is steering the bank through three years of flagging economic growth and rising household debt.""We are reaping what we sowed in recent years,"" Setubal said in a news conference at Itaú's São Paulo headquarters. ""We are prepared to grow in a consistent, sustainable way going forward.""Return on equity (ROE) - a gauge of profitability that measures how well a bank spends shareholder money - jumped to 23.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest in three years. The poll expected ROE, as the indicator is known, of 21 percent. GETTING A LIFT ROE could fluctuate or even move downwards this year, because of market turmoil that could impact Itaú's trading-related income line, Setubal said.Preferred shares in Itaú gained as much as 6 percent, the highest intraday jump since Sept. 1, 2011. Shares in smaller rivals Banco Bradesco SA and Banco Santander Brasil SA, whose prices fell last week as their quarterly results let investors down, got a lift from Itaú's jump.Borrowing costs are rising in Brazil as part of central bank efforts to head off accelerating inflation. As a result, risk-adjusted net interest margin, or the average rate at which Itaú lends money, climbed to 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter from 6.5 percent in the prior three months. Net interest income, or revenue from loan-related transactions, rose to a higher-than-expected 12.703 billion reais due to higher rates. Fee income, or revenue from financial services, rose 8 percent on a quarterly basis.Loan book, fee income and expense growth estimates that Itaú released on Tuesday also indicate that earnings momentum will continue into 2014, analysts said.Itaú forecasts loan book growth - or credit - to rise between 10 percent and 13 percent this year. Bad loan provision expenses could total between 13 billion reais and 15 billion reais this year. Based on the mid-point of Itaú's guidance, Telles, the Credit Suisse Securities analyst, expects Itaú's net profit to rise 21 percent this year.Loan book growth, which had been modest during the first nine months of the year, accelerated in the fourth quarter - signaling that higher rates in Latin America's largest economy are beginning to offset lending risks. Outstanding loans at Itaú rose 5.9 percent in the quarter to 483.40 billion reais.Credit card and large corporate loans drove growth in Itaú's loan book during the quarter, followed by rising disbursements of mortgage and payroll loans, the filing said. Loans across Latin America jumped too. Last year, credit rose 13.3 percent, exceeding the bank's guidance of 8 percent to 11 percent loan book expansion.HIGHER EXPENSES Sales, general and administrative expenses rose at a faster pace than analyst estimates in the quarter, thanks to charges related to the integration of merchant acquiring unit Rede.For 2013, SG&A expense growth of 7.4 percent surpassed the bank's own estimate between 4 percent and 6 percent, the filing said, citing the impact of Rede integration and a jump in payroll costs stemming from a new wage accord with unions.Itaú seeks growth for the indicator between 5.5 percent and 7.5 percent excluding charges from the integration of consumer finance company Credicard, which it bought from Citigroup Inc.Loan loss provisions surprised on the upside, despite a reduction in the loan default ratio. Provisions were 4.191 billion reais, above the poll's estimate of 3.981 billion reais.Defaults for more than 90 days fell for a sixth straight quarter, hitting 3.7 percent of the bank's loan book. The poll expected a so-called loan default ratio of 3.8 percent.",2014-02-04,C,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 3:07pm EST","UPDATE 4-Brazil's Itaú hits record profit as revenue jumps, shares soar",http://www.reuters.com//article/itauunibanco-results-idUSL2N0L90BI20140204?type=companyNews
32,"   By Sakthi Prasad  Feb 6 Citigroup Inc has agreed to pay $110 million to thousands of homeowners who were forcibly charged expensive property insurance premiums, a court filing showed, as several U.S. banks and insurers were criticized by regulators over such practices.The class-action lawsuit filed in a New York federal court involves ""force-placed insurance,"" which is placed by a bank or other mortgage lenders to protect their interests in a property if the homeowner's insurance lapses.The class members who were charged for force-placed hazard insurance will receive back 12.5 percent of the premium upon submitting a claim, as per an agreement between Citigroup and the plaintiffs. The agreement, which needs to be approved by the court, calls for Citi to stop accepting commissions for force-placed insurance for a period of six years from the effective date of the settlement.Banks have been under increasing scrutiny from regulators over force-placed insurance. Mortgage agreements give lenders the right to force-place insurance, but regulators have accused banks and insurance companies of pushing up policy prices with improper commission and reinsurance agreements.

35,"  By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jennifer AblanFeb 14 Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby's to big retailers Target Corp and Walgreen CoGeneral Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra.But on Friday, the automaker's stock rose 75 cents, or 2.13 percent, to $35.95.Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by billionaire investor George Soros, purchased new stakes in banking giants J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup in the fourth quarter. Soros also boosted holdings in GM.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don't disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there's also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.  Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter.JP MORGAN CHASE, CITIGROUP Soros's fund owned about 2.8 million shares of JP Morgan as of December 31, and 2.3 million shares of Citi. Soros held no shares in either bank at the end of the third quarter.SOTHEBY'S Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick McGuire, boosted the firm's holdings of Sotheby's by 35 percent, having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction house to now own 4,562,991.Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management also is a huge fan of Sotheby's, buying an additional 265,000 shares, bringing the firm's stake to 2.2 million shares.FACEBOOK Tiger Consumer Management got back into Facebook after exiting it in the third quarter. The filing shows the fund owned 1,384,507 shares of the social media powerhouse at the end of the fourth quarter. Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors bought an additional 13.9 million class A shares, bringing its stake to 18.3 million class A shares.Scout Capital Management closed out of its position, selling 3 million shares. Scout Capital may be going on a junk food diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods  and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in Yum! Brands Inc.The fund's owners said last month that they are splitting up and shutting down the $6.7 billion fund after 13 years. Returns were strong at 21 percent last year.GENERAL MOTORS Kyle Bass's Hayman Capital announced in early December that he established a position and that the 4,606,005 million shares he owned made up nearly one quarter of his portfolio.Bridger Capital trimmed its holdings in General Motors Co by selling 155,000 shares, but the fund still owns 1,695,000 shares, which ranks the stock as the fund's fourth largest position.Bronson Point Management, founded by former managers at SAC and Pequot, added to its holding of GM by buying another 400,000 shares, increasing its stake by 34 percent.

38,"  NEW YORK Feb 20 Citigroup Inc has settled a lawsuit against Barclays Plc in which it sought to recover more than $141 million for providing foreign exchange services to a unit of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc  during the 2008 financial crisis.In a letter filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the banks said they had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the case.Terms were not disclosed. U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice and gave Citigroup 30 days to refile if warranted.Barclays declined to comment. Citigroup had no immediate comment. The case related to Citigroup's role in the Continuous Linked Settlement system, which was designed to ensure that foreign exchange trades are completed. Citigroup said it sought to stop settling trades for Lehman's brokerage unit on Sept. 17, 2008, two days after Lehman filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, because it was incurring large losses.It said that because Barclays was then buying Lehman's U.S. broker-dealer business, the British bank urged it to continue the services, and would cover its losses from Sept. 17 to 19. Citigroup had said Barclays failed to honor this indemnity, causing it to lose $580 million. It later reduced this sum to $90.8 million, and sued for the lowered amount plus interest and legal fees.The case is Citibank NA v.

41,"  By Elinor Comlay and David HenryZUMPANGO Mexico/NEW YORK - Feb 25 Just outside the town of Zumpango, about an hour from Mexico City, packs of stray dogs sniff around abandoned homes in a half-empty neighborhood.The Santa Fe housing development, where power outages and flooding are the norm, is a casualty of Mexico's dysfunctional housing market. Work on the subdivision stalled before the sewer or the high school was finished. Water pipes and doors have been looted from homes.The neighborhood has created heartache for its residents, but it is also disappointing for Citigroup Inc, which helped finance Desarrolladora Homex, the site's developer and once Mexico's second-largest homebuilder.Last year, the U.S. bank posted weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings after effectively writing down more than a quarter of the value of loans made to Homex and two other struggling Mexican homebuilders, Corporación GEO and Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos. And some banking analysts say they fear the loan losses could be a taste of further emerging market credit losses to come for Citigroup.The $300 million in loans were made starting in 2009. Bank executives at Citigroup in New York turned down at least some of the business because it seemed too risky, two sources involved with the lending process said. The executives were reluctant to make real estate loans in emerging markets after losses from the U.S. housing bubble led to three government rescues for Citigroup in 2008 and 2009.New York balked, but the bank's Mexican subsidiary, Banco Nacional de Mexico, better known as ""Banamex,"" went ahead and lent to the homebuilders. Banamex, which is the second biggest bank in Mexico with 1,700 branches, has room to make some loans that do not get vetted by New York, as long as its overall portfolio is safe enough, the sources said.""New York turned them down because they made no sense,"" said one of the sources, referring to loan applications by Mexican homebuilders at the time.Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio said in a statement that ""the origination and management of the homebuilder loans, as with all loans in Mexico, was conducted under the oversight and framework of Citi's independent risk management function, and any suggestion to the contrary is false.""He added, ""Citi has a robust and independent risk management framework that provides oversight for lending decisions that are made in every country in which we operate. This framework results in a loan portfolio that is diversified by obligor, industry and region.""Costiglio declined to comment specifically on whether New York executives had opposed lending to the homebuilders. The company believes any additional losses from the loans will not be significant.A Banamex spokesman declined to comment in detail about the loans, but said the bank generally has one of the lowest rates of credit losses on loans in Mexico. Urbi and Homex did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Geo declined to comment.To be sure, the size of the problem, pegged at roughly $85 million in Citigroup's 2013 income statements and public comments, is minuscule compared to the $13.9 billion the bank earned last year, or for that matter the tens of billions of dollars the firm lost during the U.S. financial crisis. And the sources were unclear as to whether the loans that Banamex made had identical terms to the loans that New York officials had rejected.The Mexican homebuilder loans are ""noticeable, but it is not a driver to the overall earnings of the company,"" said Moshe Orenbuch, a bank analyst at Credit Suisse. While banks try to avoid losses whenever possible, they are a fact of life in banking, he said.Citigroup's stock price have been reflecting concern about its emerging markets exposure, some analysts say. The shares have fallen 12 percent since the bank posted fourth-quarter results on Jan. 16, trailing the broader KBW bank stock index , which has declined about 5 percent.Growth in developing nations such as China is showing signs of slowing and a number of major emerging markets are vulnerable to political turmoil and investment outflows as the U.S. Federal Reserve reduces its bond-buying stimulus.And while Citigroup has little exposure to countries where growth seems to be weakening the most, such as Argentina and Turkey, a broad malaise in emerging markets may already be having an impact on its results: the bank's losses on Latin American credit card loans, for example, rose 19 percent to $234 million in the fourth quarter. A LESSON TO BE LEARNED? Citigroup has long seen its vast international presence as its main competitive advantage. As the financial crisis was heating up in May 2008, the Chief Executive at the time, Vikram Pandit, introduced Manuel Medina-Mora to analysts. Medina-Mora was then the CEO of Banamex, which Pandit said was a prime example of the ""universal bank model"" that Citigroup would use in emerging markets around the world, where it strives to provide a wide range of services to clients.Medina-Mora told the analysts that his unit had managed to triple its earnings in Mexico in the previous six years by focusing on relationships.""It's not a risk-intensive model, but rather a relationship-intensive one,"" he said.Medina-Mora, who through a spokesman declined a request for an interview for this article, had been with Banamex for 37 years at the time he made those comments. He was named co-president of Citigroup last year by CEO Michael Corbat and remains chairman of its Mexico business, in addition to being CEO of its global consumer business. The Mexican homebuilders ran into difficulty after building too many developments far away from urban centers. Much of that building ramped up around 2009, which is also when Banamex increased its lending to the companies, the homebuilders' public filings show.Developers targeted lower-income households, but these customers could only afford the homes with the help of government subsidies on their mortgages.Buyers came to realize something about living far from cities: it was not as cheap as it seemed. In the case of the Santa Fe development near Zumpango, bus fare to and from Mexico City is about equal to a day's minimum wage, according to residents of Santa Fe.Soon after Banamex made the loans, a government census showed that as many as 20 percent of residents in some regions of the country had abandoned their homes. Seeing this problem, the government began shifting subsidies to urban areas in 2011. Early last year, under new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the government formally overhauled its housing subsidy program to focus on apartment building complexes in cities.With the policy shift, Mexico became littered with un-finished subdivisions, and Citigroup began setting aside money to cover its exposure to the homebuilders.Although Citigroup's $300 million of loans to Mexican homebuilders is less than 1 percent of the bank's loan book in the country, Charles Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at Portales Partners in New York, said they should not be ignored.""There really is a lesson to be learned here,"" Peabody said, namely that when new government or central bank policies change behavior, lenders can suffer. That happened with the Mexican homebuilders, but could also happen more broadly in emerging markets if the Federal Reserve's changing stimulus policies result in investors pulling money out of the countries, or putting less in, he said.Back at the Santa Fe development on a recent visit, a slow trickle of people came by the Star of Zumpango convenience store to report broken street lights and other problems to proprietor Jesus Moreno. He has become a fix-it man for the neighborhood since Homex representatives stopped answering residents' calls.Moreno, 38, said many people bought the homes in this development unseen, attracted by the cheap prices and the idea of owning their own home.It was only when they took a bus to the development for the first time that they discovered there were few employment opportunities nearby, he said.""Maybe 60 percent of the people didn't know where their home was,"" Moreno said. ""We're in a distant town, and there are no jobs.""",2014-02-25,C,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 7:00am EST",RPT-INSIGHT-How Citigroup stumbled in the Mexican housing market,http://www.reuters.com//article/citigroup-mexico-idUSL1N0LT29Q20140225?type=companyNews

43,"   By Elinor Comlay and David Henry | ZUMPANGO  ZUMPANGO Mexico/NEW YORK - Feb 25 Just outside the town of Zumpango, about an hour from Mexico City, packs of stray dogs sniff around abandoned homes in a half-empty neighborhood.The Santa Fe housing development, where power outages and flooding are the norm, is a casualty of Mexico's dysfunctional housing market. Work on the subdivision stalled before the sewer or the high school was finished. Water pipes and doors have been looted from homes.The neighborhood has created heartache for its residents, but it is also disappointing for Citigroup Inc, which helped finance Desarrolladora Homex, the site's developer and once Mexico's second-largest homebuilder.Last year, the U.S. bank posted weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings after effectively writing down more than a quarter of the value of loans made to Homex and two other struggling Mexican homebuilders, Corporación GEO and Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos. And some banking analysts say they fear the loan losses could be a taste of further emerging market credit losses to come for Citigroup.The $300 million in loans were made starting in 2009. Bank executives at Citigroup in New York turned down at least some of the business because it seemed too risky, two sources involved with the lending process said. The executives were reluctant to make real estate loans in emerging markets after losses from the U.S. housing bubble led to three government rescues for Citigroup in 2008 and 2009.New York balked, but the bank's Mexican subsidiary, Banco Nacional de Mexico, better known as ""Banamex,"" went ahead and lent to the homebuilders. Banamex, which is the second biggest bank in Mexico with 1,700 branches, has room to make some loans that do not get vetted by New York, as long as its overall portfolio is safe enough, the sources said.""New York turned them down because they made no sense,"" said one of the sources, referring to loan applications by Mexican homebuilders at the time.Citigroup spokesman Mark Costiglio said in a statement that ""the origination and management of the homebuilder loans, as with all loans in Mexico, was conducted under the oversight and framework of Citi's independent risk management function, and any suggestion to the contrary is false.""He added, ""Citi has a robust and independent risk management framework that provides oversight for lending decisions that are made in every country in which we operate. This framework results in a loan portfolio that is diversified by obligor, industry and region.""Costiglio declined to comment specifically on whether New York executives had opposed lending to the homebuilders. The company believes any additional losses from the loans will not be significant.A Banamex spokesman declined to comment in detail about the loans, but said the bank generally has one of the lowest rates of credit losses on loans in Mexico. Urbi and Homex did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Geo declined to comment.To be sure, the size of the problem, pegged at roughly $85 million in Citigroup's 2013 income statements and public comments, is minuscule compared to the $13.9 billion the bank earned last year, or for that matter the tens of billions of dollars the firm lost during the U.S. financial crisis. And the sources were unclear as to whether the loans that Banamex made had identical terms to the loans that New York officials had rejected.The Mexican homebuilder loans are ""noticeable, but it is not a driver to the overall earnings of the company,"" said Moshe Orenbuch, a bank analyst at Credit Suisse. While banks try to avoid losses whenever possible, they are a fact of life in banking, he said.Citigroup's stock price have been reflecting concern about its emerging markets exposure, some analysts say. The shares have fallen 12 percent since the bank posted fourth-quarter results on Jan. 16, trailing the broader KBW bank stock index , which has declined about 5 percent.Growth in developing nations such as China is showing signs of slowing and a number of major emerging markets are vulnerable to political turmoil and investment outflows as the U.S. Federal Reserve reduces its bond-buying stimulus.And while Citigroup has little exposure to countries where growth seems to be weakening the most, such as Argentina and Turkey, a broad malaise in emerging markets may already be having an impact on its results: the bank's losses on Latin American credit card loans, for example, rose 19 percent to $234 million in the fourth quarter. A LESSON TO BE LEARNED? Citigroup has long seen its vast international presence as its main competitive advantage. As the financial crisis was heating up in May 2008, the Chief Executive at the time, Vikram Pandit, introduced Manuel Medina-Mora to analysts. Medina-Mora was then the CEO of Banamex, which Pandit said was a prime example of the ""universal bank model"" that Citigroup would use in emerging markets around the world, where it strives to provide a wide range of services to clients.Medina-Mora told the analysts that his unit had managed to triple its earnings in Mexico in the previous six years by focusing on relationships.""It's not a risk-intensive model, but rather a relationship-intensive one,"" he said.Medina-Mora, who through a spokesman declined a request for an interview for this article, had been with Banamex for 37 years at the time he made those comments.

Citigroup's 2013 profit fell by $235 million to $13.67 billion after the write-down. Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat called the incident a ""despicable crime"" and said the bank believes it was an isolated episode.The bad loans were made to Mexican oil services company Oceanografia OCNGR.UL, a contractor for Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex PEMX.UL.Oceanografia borrowed from Citigroup's Mexican unit, Banco Nacional de Mexico, known as Banamex, using expected payments from Pemex as collateral.In recent weeks, Banamex learned that Oceanografia appeared to have falsified invoices to Pemex that were collateral for loans, Corbat said in a separate memo to employees. The bank wrote down about $400 million of loans backed by the bogus invoices.On February 11, Pemex suspended Oceanografia from receiving any government contracts for 21 months and 12 days, a serious blow for a company that receives about 97 percent of its revenue from the Mexican oil company. Public records show that Oceanografia was awarded almost $3 billion through more than 100 contracts with Pemex between 2003 and last year.Citigroup said it began looking at its exposure to Oceanografia after the suspension.Mexico's attorney general's office said on Friday it was investigating Oceanografia for possible crime, and said it had seized the company's assets and appointed an administrator to salvage whatever business is left. Calls for the press representative at Oceanografia and an email to an investor relations official were not returned.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is aware of the loan losses and is monitoring the situation for possible criminal activity, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. The source said it was too early to determine whether an investigation was merited, but the FBI was continuing to look at new developments in the case before making a decision.Citigroup CEO Corbat said in the statement that Banamex is exploring legal options. Criminal actions ""may allow us to recover damages,"" he added.Citigroup has about $1.9 trillion of assets on its balance sheet, and so far the bank has found $400 million of Oceanografia loans that it has trouble with.Mexican officials had raised questions about Oceanografia before. In 2012, the nation's Federal Audit Office published a report criticizing Pemex for failing to investigate what appeared to be contract irregularities with Oceanografia as well as overpayment for work that was not running on time.But it was not until February 11 that Pemex's internal control body sanctioned Oceanografia, sparking an investigation by Citi of its loans. ACCOUNTABILITY In the memo to employees, Corbat noted that a Banamex employee had processed the fraudulent invoices that appeared to be from Oceanografia, and said that it is ""not clear how many people were involved in the fraud.""""I can assure you there will be accountability for those who perpetrated this despicable crime and any employee who enabled it, either through lax supervision, circumvention of our controls or violating our code of conduct,"" Corbat said.Citigroup shares have fallen in recent weeks on concerns that slowing growth in emerging markets may reveal bad loans and may trigger more trading losses. In the third quarter of 2013 problems with about $300 million of loans that Banamex had made to three Mexican homebuilders prompted Citigroup to book reserves for expected losses.Sources told Reuters that executives in New York had rejected at least some loans to the homebuilders because they were not comfortable with the risk.

58,"  March 5 Moody's Investors Service has decided against raising its credit ratings on debt of Banamex, the Mexican subsidiary of Citigroup Inc, because of the bank's disclosure last week of losses on some $400 million on fraudulent loans to an oilfield services company.Positive credit trends at Banamex that on Feb. 12 prompted Moody's to put the bank on review for an upgrade have ""been offset by the more recent negative effects"" of Banamex's charge to 2013 earnings for the alleged fraud, the ratings services said in an announcement on Wednesday.Moody's said it has confirmed its current ratings on Banamex and finished the review.Citigroup said on Friday that it discovered $400 million in fraudulent loans at Banamex and said employees may have been in on the crime. (ID:nL1N0LX187] The loans were made to services company Oceanografia on the basis of money it was supposedly owed by state-owned oil company Pemex. The charge for the bad loans reduced Citigroup's 2013 net income by less than 2 percent. For Banamex, Moody's said, the charge reduced net income by 19 percent and hurt its financial strength. ""In addition, the charge revealed a breakdown of controls and auditing functions, as well as weaknesses in risk management and measurement as it relates to one of the bank's largest credit exposures,"" Moody's said.""Moody's believes that such weaknesses increase the risk of additional charges to earnings that could affect the bank's ability to maintain sound capitalization, and limit its ability to expand business volumes,"" the statement said. The service said it had previously considered upgrading Banamex in anticipation of the bank's ability to make money from its diversified franchise and ample deposits in an improving Mexican economy.Fitch Ratings on Monday said the Oceanografia losses have had no material financial impact on Banamex. The service did not change its ratings.

71,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO, March 12  SAO PAULO, March 12 The chief executive officer of independent Brazilian investment bank BR Partners Banco do Investimento SA on Wednesday called Moelis & Co LLC's hiring of three of its top bankers ""unethical"" and are evaluating a potential response.On Tuesday, Moelis hired Otávio Guazzelli, Jório Salgado-Gama and Erick Alberti from BR Partners to open the New York-based bank's first office in Brazil.According to BR Partners CEO Ricardo Lacerda, the executives were approached improperly, especially since the two banks had worked together for over two years.The relationship, developed during a series of transactions the two banks handled together, gave Moelis access to confidential information about BR Partners, Lacerda said. A Moelis spokeswoman denied any wrongdoing.In a phone interview, Lacerda said, ""the bad faith and misconduct of Moelis is well documented and we are evaluating which actions to take."" He called Moelis' move ""unethical and improper,"" but did not say what actions, legal or otherwise, BR Partners was considering.The feud underscores the fierce battle for top executives in many areas of Brazil's financial markets. Though local capital markets are facing the weakest year in more than a decade, the demand for banking talent continues, especially as some global banks pull back because of a sluggish economy. Fabio Okumura, the head of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA's  proprietary trading desk, has quit and taken eight members of his team with him, sources said on Tuesday.Lacerda said Moelis first approached BR Partners in 2011 to explore a potential cooperation agreement but nothing was ever finalized. The two banks worked together on several deals and Moelis, he added, has abused the relationship by luring away the executives.Moelis, through a spokeswoman in New York, said the executives had already left BR Partners when they were hired. ""Moelis & Co started conversations with these bankers in January after they had all announced their decision to leave their previous employment,"" she said. Guazzelli and Salgado, two of the former BR Partners executives, will co-manage Moelis' unit in Brazil, which will be based in São Paulo, the nation's financial hub. None of the three bankers could be reached for comment.At BR Partners, which Lacerda and other bankers founded in 2009, Guazzelli led investment banking, while Salgado-Gama was head of mergers and acquisitions. Recently, BR Partners hired Diego Rauter from Credit Suisse and Fernanda González from Goldman Sachs Group Inc to bolster a team of 25 investment bankers. GAINING A FOOTHOLD BR Partners also operates a bank and a broker-dealer in Brazil. Lacerda himself was head of Brazilian investment-banking for Goldman and Citigroup Inc for most of the past decade.The announcement came about a week after New York-based Moelis filed for an initial public offering in the United States. M&A activity has had its strongest start since at least 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data.By establishing a foothold in Brazil, Moelis will try to take advantage of global interest for cross-border deals in a market with about 200 million consumers.

72,"  By John WasikCHICAGO, March 17You can get most of what you want for your investments from off-the-shelf index funds, but you may have to dig deeper to make your portfolio more productive.For most mainstream investors, a focus on S&P 500 index funds and a general bond market index serves them well. Yet what if you concentrated on a mixture of different asset classes instead of only picking the usual suspects in conventional index funds that hold the most popular stocks and bonds? You may be able to boost returns while insulating yourself from off years.An ""asset-class investing"" approach still relies upon low-cost, passively managed funds as core vehicles, but it puts a greater focus on diversification, which could enhance returns. Giving yourself a piece of every corner of the market means investing in large-, medium- and small-sized companies in developed and emerging markets, plus a broad selection of U.S. and global bonds.How does it differ? Take the standard approach to indexing the U.S. stock market. Most financial advisers would tell you to buy an S&P index fund, which holds the most popular stocks in the U.S. A good choice would be the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, which holds a mostly passive portfolio at an expense ratio of 0.09 percent annually.Since many index funds hold stocks that investors have assigned the highest values to, you may not be getting the best prices on them.What if you shifted to a value approach, and sought bargain-priced stocks?Then you'd want to buy a fund like the DFA US Large Cap Value I fund, which has beaten the S&P 500 index by almost 4 percentage points in annualized return over the past 15 years through March 14. Charging 0.27 percent for annual expenses, the fund has top holdings like Bank of America Corp , Citigroup Inc and Chevron Corp. Over the last three years, it's posted an annualized return of nearly 16 percent through March 14. With this approach, you may realize more upside because these companies aren't valued as highly as companies like Apple Inc and ExxonMobil Corp, which top the popularity contest for U.S. stocks at the moment and sit on top of the holdings for most big-stock index funds.Another aspect of the asset-class approach is to spread your stock allocation across companies of all sizes throughout the world. Combining a value and small-company stake can also be potent.Over time, the return advantage of small-cap value over the S&P 500 index is impressive.The DFA US Small Cap Value Portfolio, for example, has outperformed the S&P index by more than 8 percentage points in annualized returns over the past 15 years. But you probably wouldn't recognize most of the holdings of this fund, which include companies like CNO Financial Group Inc and Esterline Technologies Corp.  It costs 0.52 percent annually in expenses. THE BIG PICTURE If there is one theme in asset class investing, it's ignoring what's popular at the time - whether it's a fund or a stock - and hewing to a broad picture of the entire universe of stocks and bonds.Assuming that the mix of funds matches your stomach for risk and can beat inflation, pulling everything together is a matter of finding the best funds in each asset class. DFA funds, which I've cited above, are good vehicles, but are only available through advisers. You can find comparable funds within the iShares, SPDR or Vanguard Groups.Eric Nelson of Servo Management in Oklahoma City employs asset class investing for his clients. His approach is mostly passive, but he tailors each portfolio.Part of the strategy is holding funds that are sagging at the moment, like emerging markets or large-company value. This approach may also entail lower risk since you're not over-concentrated in the highest-priced stocks on the market.Nelson estimates that asset-class investing has returned about 8 percent annually over the past decade, through February, compared to 6 percent for active management and 7 percent for a ""tactical"" strategy that bounces between hot and cold sectors.""Asset class investing is customized to what you are trying to accomplish,"" Nelson says. ""And there's no benefit in buying actively managed funds.""The other key element in the strategy is to be true to the kind of risk you want to take. The trade-off for investing in small companies looking for high return is that they involve more risk in the short term. That's where diversification comes in. By investing in a wide mix of stocks and bonds, Nelson's asset-class portfolio lost only 22 percent in 2008, compared to about 32 percent for active portfolios.Making this strategy work might entail working with an adviser to set up a portfolio of low-cost passive funds or finding a pre-designed portfolio online from services such as Betterment, Wealthfront.com, folioinvesting.com. Just make sure that you have a piece of everything: Large, medium and small companies across the globe and bonds from the U.S. Treasury, corporations, and emerging markets.",2014-03-17,C,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 11:55am EDT",COLUMN-Drop the S&P index fund for asset-class investing,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-wasik-idUSL2N0ME0R920140317?type=companyNews

76,"  * Telecom sale is most prized in privatisation programme* Asset sales aimed at helping Slovenia avert bailout* Deutsche Telekom, Telenor may be interested   (Adds details, NKBM sale, background)LJUBLJANA Slovenia's government is likely to sell its stake in Telekom Slovenia, the most prized asset in the euro zone country's planned privatisation programme, by the end of the year, Economy Minister Metod Dragonja said on Tuesday. ""It is my expectation that Telekom will be privatised by the end of this year,"" Dragonja told a news conference.The telecoms company is the largest among more than a dozen companies the government listed for privatisation last year as part of its efforts to overhaul the economy and avoid becoming the next euro zone member to have to seek an international bailout. Telekom Slovenia has a market capitalisation of 860 million euros ($1.20 billion) and, according to Thomson Reuters data, the government currently owns 62.5 percent of the company.In October, the government's investment fund SOD, which is in charge of selling Telekom, chose U.S. bank Citigroup as a financial advisor in the sale but there have been no further steps reported on the privatisation since then. Sources close to the deal told Reuters in December that Deutsche Telekom and Telenor, as well as other telecom companies and private equity groups could be interested.SOD, which is also managing the privatisation of the country's second-biggest bank, Nova KBM (NKBM), said on Tuesday it had chosen auditing company KPMG to perform due diligence on the lender. It did not say when the bank would be sold.In December Slovenia injected 3.3 billion euros into local banks, including NKBM, and started transferring their bad loans to a state bad bank, enabling it to narrowly avoid an international bailout.

77,"  * MAGE-A3 fails to hit goal in Phase III lung cancer trial* Setback follows disappointing 2013 results in melanoma* GSK hopes to find patient sub-set in which vaccine works* Shares fall 2 percent   (Adds analyst comments, latest shares, further details)By Ben HirschlerMarch 20 An experimental cancer vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline has failed in a second test - this time against lung cancer - but the British company said it still hoped to identify a sub-group of patients in which it would work.Thursday's news that the MAGE-A3 therapeutic vaccine did not help patients with non-small cell lung cancer in a late-stage study is a further blow to the high-risk, high-reward project after a similar setback in melanoma in September.Unlike traditional preventative vaccines, the MAGE-A3 treatment is designed for people with established disease, helping their immune systems to prevent the return of disease after surgery. The large Phase III study, involving more than 2,000 lung cancer patients, found that the experimental therapy did not help patients live longer without their disease recurring.Nonetheless, GSK plans to continue the clinical trial in the hope of finding a sub-population that will benefit. It is also doing the same with patients suffering from melanoma and results of analyses looking at these sub-sets of patients with particular genetic profiles are expected in 2015.Vincent Brichard, head of immunotherapeutics at GSK Vaccines, said the company was disappointed by the outcome but remained committed to the project.Shares in GSK fell by 2 percent by 0945 GMT, underperforming a 0.7 percent decline in the European drugs sector. Many investors had been expecting a disappointing read-out from the lung cancer study, following the earlier setback in melanoma, and there are doubts as to whether GSK will be able to prove the vaccine works for a smaller group of genetically selected patients.But despite the problems GSK Chief Executive Andrew Witty painted a surprisingly upbeat picture of prospects for MAGE-A3 at full-year results last month. Witty described the cancer vaccine and another drug for heart disease called darapladib that has also disappointed in tests as among the most promising in the company's pipeline.10 PERCENT CHANCE  Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he estimated there was a 10 percent probability that MAGE-A3 could result in a significant benefit in a gene-signature defined population group, which would still be a substantial market.As a result, Citi has a risk-adjusted sales forecast for the product of 216 million pounds ($360 million) in 2022.Other companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and Merck & Co, have had some recent notable successes in clinical trials of innovative drugs to boost the immune system, but GSK is still pushing the scientific boundaries with its vaccine-based approach.So-called immunotherapy, in which the body's own immune system is enlisted to fight tumour cells, is a hot area of pharmaceutical research and development at the moment, although cancer vaccines have proved difficult to develop over the years.U.S.-based Agenus has contributed technology to the GSK vaccine and its shares are sensitive to news on the project. The vaccine contains Agenus' QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant, or booster.Although news on MAGE-A3 and darapladib has been disappointing for GSK, the company's overall drug research has been improving recently, with notable new drug approvals in 2013 for HIV, cancer and respiratory disease.GSK, which is the only major drugmaker to report its internal rate of return on R&D investment, said last month that returns had now reached 13 percent, up from 12 percent two years earlier and 11 percent in 2010. It has set a target of reaching 14 percent.

83,"   By Emily Stephenson and David Henry | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The Federal Reserve on Wednesday rejected Citigroup Inc's plans to buy back $6.4 billion of shares and boost dividends, saying the bank is not sufficiently prepared to handle a potential financial crisis.The decision marks the second time in three years that Citigroup has failed to win the Fed's approval for its plan to return money to shareholders, known as the ""capital plan.""Officials at the bank never saw the rejection coming, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday.The rejection underscores that whatever strides Citi's chief executive, Michael Corbat, has made in fixing the bank's difficulties, he still has work to do. Shares of Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, fell 5.4 percent to $47.45 in after-hours trading.Since taking the reins at the bank in 2012, Corbat has been working hard to cultivate close relationships with regulators in Washington. His predecessor, Vikram Pandit, had a famously testy relationship with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's then chairman Sheila Bair, among other regulators.But even after mending fences in Washington, Corbat was blindsided by the Fed's decision to nix his plan for paying out money to shareholders. His first hint that something might be awry with the bank's capital plans came last week, when the Fed disclosed its views of how global turmoil would affect the bank's capital levels, the source said. The Fed's projections were much less rosy than Citi's.The bank, like its competitors, faces two opposing goals. It wants to have large amounts of capital to please regulators; it also wants to please its shareholders, and high levels of capital weigh on profitability.Citi was one of five banks whose payout plans were rejected by the Fed on Wednesday. Three were the U.S. units of European banks. The fifth, Zions Bancorp, was expected because it was the only bank last week to fail a model run of a simulated crisis similar to the 2007-09 credit meltdown in the first part of the Fed's stress tests.The Fed said it approved capital plans submitted by the remaining 25 big banks in this year's tests.Corbat, said in a statement that the Citigroup is ""deeply disappointed"" by the Fed's decision and that the bank's request for returning additional capital to shareholders was modest.Last year, the Fed granted Citigroup permission to buy back $1.2 billion worth of shares and said it could continue to pay $120 million a year in dividends, representing a quarterly rate of a penny a share. This year Citigroup sought to spend more than five times as much buying back shares and to lift its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share. The bank earned $13.67 billion last year.Analysts, on average, had estimated that Citigroup's quarterly dividend would increase to 12 cents per share, according to surveys by Thomson Reuters.ANALYSTS SEE PROBLEMS IN CITI'S COMPLEXITY On Wednesday, the Fed said that Citigroup has improved its risk management practices in recent years, but the bank cannot determine well enough how its revenue and income would be hurt under stressful scenarios around the world. The bank's internal examination process does not sufficiently consider how global crises could influence its broad number of businesses, the Fed added.In 2012, the Fed rejected the plan by Citi's then CEO Pandit, a step that contributed to his ouster in October of that year. In the 2012 test, Citigroup did not prove to the Fed's satisfaction that it could adequately measure risk in loans to some consumers in Southeast Asia, where credit rating standards are not as well developed as in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Fed said on Wednesday that some of Citigroup's deficiencies had been ""previously identified by supervisors as requiring attention"" and that ""there was not sufficient improvement."" A Fed official said that regulators had raised their expectations for banks with each set of stress tests, and it expected improvements in areas that had previously been identified as needing work.Citigroup's complexity -- it operates in over 100 countries, and was built over decades of acquisitions -- may be working against it, analysts said.""Citi needs to make this defeat into victory by improving the pace of restructuring,"" said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA, saying the bank should consider breaking itself up more dramatically than it already has.The other banks blocked by the Fed on Wednesday in their plans for higher dividends or share buybacks were the U.S. units of HSBC, RBS and Santander, due to weaknesses in their capital planning processes.Zions, the fifth bank whose plan was barred, was the only bank out of 30 to miss minimum hurdles for regulatory capital in a first stage of the stress tests, which simulate a future crisis as severe as the 2007-09 credit meltdown. ""Both the firms and supervisors have more work to do as we continue to raise expectations for the quality of risk management in the nation's largest banks,"" Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said in a statement on Wednesday.The five banks can continue with shareholder payouts at the same pace as they did last year. They can also change their proposals and resubmit them, a move that Citigroup said it is considering.Fed officials told reporters that capital distributions at the banks had been sufficiently modest in past years that they could continue at current levels without hurting the firms.The Fed's criticism of internal controls, risk-identification and other planning elements at the foreign banks underscores regulators' concerns about the safety of those firms' operations in the United States.Foreign banks will have to wall off their U.S. units and meet tougher capital requirements under rules recently finalized by the Fed.The Fed has said HSBC, RBS and Santander all would likely fall under those new rules.Two large Wall Street banks, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, had to resubmit their capital plans after seeing their first set of stress test results.Bank of America received approval to increase its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 1 cent per share previously, and approval for the authorization a new $4.0 billion share buyback program. Last year, the Federal Reserve approved Bank of America's request to redeem $5.5 billion in preferred stock and $5.0 billion in common shares.The annual tests aim to determine whether banks are robust enough to weather the next crisis. Under the toughest stress scenario considered this year, the banks had to show how they would cope with the stock market falling by 50 percent.

84,"  (Adds detail on Citigroup CEO, analyst comment)By Emily Stephenson and David HenryWASHINGTON/NEW YORK, March 26 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday rejected Citigroup Inc's plans to buy back $6.4 billion of shares and boost dividends, saying the bank is not sufficiently prepared to handle a potential financial crisis.The decision marks the second time in three years that Citigroup has failed to win the Fed's approval for its plan to return money to shareholders, known as the ""capital plan.""Officials at the bank never saw the rejection coming, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday.The rejection underscores that whatever strides Citi's chief executive, Michael Corbat, has made in fixing the bank's difficulties, he still has work to do. Shares of Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, fell 5.4 percent to $47.45 in after-hours trading.Since taking the reins at the bank in 2012, Corbat has been working hard to cultivate close relationships with regulators in Washington. His predecessor, Vikram Pandit, had a famously testy relationship with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's then chairman Sheila Bair, among other regulators.But even after mending fences in Washington, Corbat was blindsided by the Fed's decision to nix his plan for paying out money to shareholders. His first hint that something might be  awry with the bank's capital plans came last week, when the Fed disclosed its views of how global turmoil would affect the bank's capital levels, the source said. The Fed's projections were much less rosy than Citi's.The bank, like its competitors, faces two opposing goals. It wants to have large amounts of capital to please regulators; it also wants to please its shareholders, and high levels of capital weigh on profitability.Citi was one of five banks whose payout plans were rejected by the Fed on Wednesday. Three were the U.S. units of European banks. The fifth, Zions Bancorp, was expected because it was the only bank last week to fail a model run of a simulated crisis similar to the 2007-09 credit meltdown in the first part of the Fed's stress tests.The Fed said it approved capital plans submitted by the remaining 25 big banks in this year's tests.Corbat, said in a statement that the Citigroup is ""deeply disappointed"" by the Fed's decision and that the bank's request for returning additional capital to shareholders was modest. Last year, the Fed granted Citigroup permission to buy back $1.2 billion worth of shares and said it could continue to pay $120 million a year in dividends, representing a quarterly rate of a penny a share.This year Citigroup sought to spend more than five times as much buying back shares and to lift its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share. The bank earned $13.67 billion last year.Analysts, on average, had estimated that Citigroup's quarterly dividend would increase to 12 cents per share, according to surveys by Thomson Reuters.ANALYSTS SEE PROBLEMS IN CITI'S COMPLEXITY On Wednesday, the Fed said that Citigroup has improved its risk management practices in recent years, but the bank cannot determine well enough how its revenue and income would be hurt under stressful scenarios around the world. The bank's internal examination process does not sufficiently consider how global crises could influence its broad number of businesses, the Fed added. In 2012, the Fed rejected the plan by Citi's then CEO Pandit, a step that contributed to his ouster in October of that year. In the 2012 test, Citigroup did not prove to the Fed's satisfaction that it could adequately measure risk in loans to some consumers in Southeast Asia, where credit rating standards are not as well developed as in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Fed said on Wednesday that some of Citigroup's deficiencies had been ""previously identified by supervisors as requiring attention"" and that ""there was not sufficient improvement.""A Fed official said that regulators had raised their expectations for banks with each set of stress tests, and it expected improvements in areas that had previously been identified as needing work.Citigroup's complexity -- it operates in over 100 countries, and was built over decades of acquisitions -- may be working against it, analysts said.""Citi needs to make this defeat into victory by improving the pace of restructuring,"" said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA, saying the bank should consider breaking itself up more dramtically than it already has.The other banks blocked by the Fed on Wednesday in their plans for higher dividends or share buybacks were the U.S. units of HSBC, RBS and Santander, due to weaknesses in their capital planning processes.

85,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citigroup, Inc's (Citi)  long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' and upgraded its Viability Rating  (VR) to 'a' from 'a-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The VR upgrade is supported  by an improving risk profile, very solid capital and liquidity profiles, and  enhanced risk management framework. This upgrade represents a forward-looking  view of Citi's earnings profile, and that its performance will improve modestly  and converge to peer averages over the near term. With the VR upgrade, Citi's  IDR no longer incorporates any uplift from sovereign support, as the long-term  IDR is now underpinned by the standalone rating. A full list of rating actions  is at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review of support for  banks globally and also as part of a periodic review of the Global Trading and  Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active banking  groups. Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable on balance. Earnings pressure  in securities businesses, particularly in fixed income, and continued conduct  and regulatory risks present in the GTUBs are offset by stronger balance sheets  as capitalization and liquidity remain sound. Fitch forecasts stronger GDP  growth in most economies, which should contribute to a more balanced economic  environment, which, however, is likely to remain challenging in 2014. Today's rating actions assume that Citi will perform adequately under the CCAR  stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any potential qualitative  rejections for Citi, or any of the other 29 banks subject to regulatory stress  testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a capital plan request under CCAR  would be viewed negatively, it is not expected to have any rating implications  for Citi. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT The company's risk profile continues to improve, reflecting its key strengths:  diverse revenue mix, conservative liquidity management, improved capital  position, and enhanced risk management framework. Citi has also made modest  progress in improving its earnings profile despite a challenging economic and  operating environment. Fitch views Citi's strategy as appropriate in light of  the evolving regulatory and economic environment. Fitch's rating actions  incorporate a forward-looking view of Citi's ability to execute on that  strategy, including its ability to successfully meet financial targets, over the  near- to intermediate-term.  Citi's ratings are underpinned by the strength of its franchise and diversity of  revenues. The diversity in geography, business lines, and product offerings is  viewed favourably from a credit risk perspective, despite potential revenue  headwinds presented by an emerging markets slowdown. Fitch views any credit risk  related to an emerging markets slowdown as relatively manageable for the  company, given the modest direct consumer and corporate loan exposure to those  countries currently under stress. Citi's franchise is also supported by its  highly profitable transaction services business line, and solid presence in  fixed income.  Citi's VR is supported by very strong liquidity and capital levels. The  company's liquidity profile is much improved with a large percentage of high  quality liquid assets (HQLA) as a percentage of assets at YE2013 (23%). Citi's  Fitch Core Capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets was 12.8% at YE2013,  roughly in line with average for the other GTUBs, though on a tangible basis,  the FCC ratio was the highest of all the GTUBs. Fitch notes that Citi also  compares favourably to many of its peers with regard to compliance with various  pending regulatory rules, including compliance with fully phased-in requirements  for Basel III capital ratios, the U.S.-based Supplemental Leverage Ratio at both  Holding Company and Bank-level, and U.S.-proposed LCR rule. Its compliance is  well ahead of phased-in timelines for these pending rules, and as such, its  balance sheet and earnings profile have likely also already incorporated the  impacts of all these rules.  Citi's financial performance continues to improve, and is converging to peer  averages. While there was some slowdown in operating performance in 2H13, Fitch  expects that over the near- to intermediate-term, Citi will be able to execute  on its strategic initiatives, and its earnings performance will fall in line  with Fitch's expectations. The earnings drag from Citi Holdings will lessen, and  Fitch expects Citi Holdings will break-even during 2015 reflecting the absence  of mortgage repurchase costs, and a decline in legal charges.   Citi made significant strides in 2013 in addressing some of its material  mortgage-related issues. However, Citi is still exposed to potential litigation  risk stemming from its role in setting interbank offered rates, foreign currency  trading, credit default swaps and private-label securitizations. As such, Citi  is still exposed to elevated legal risk and associated costs. However, Fitch's  ratings incorporate an expectation that legal charges will remain manageable for  Citi's capital profile. Legal charges to date have been materially less than for  BAC and JPM, though totaled over $3bn in 2013 or 15% of pre-tax income. Fitch  notes that visibility into future legal-related costs is very limited. Citi's VR upgrade also reflects continuing improvements in asset quality.  Nonaccrual loans are down 22% from a year ago, and reserve levels remain good.  Of the U.S.-based GTUBs, Citi continues to remain the most conservative in  releasing reserves, and has the highest reserves to loans at approximately 3% at  YE2013, considered appropriate given its significant exposure to credit card  loans, exposure to Latin America, and a still seemingly fragile recovery in the  U.S. housing market.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch sees limited near-term upward rating potential beyond today's rating  action given a now high relative and absolute rating. In terms of downgrade  sensitivities, Citi is more vulnerable to a downturn in the emerging markets  than its peers. Citi is more exposed in the event of a slowdown in key emerging  markets, including Mexico, Brazil, China, and India, with revenue likely more at  risk than asset quality. Downward pressure on the VR would result from a material loss, reduction in  capital ratios or significant deterioration in liquidity levels. It is the  strength of the liquidity and capital profiles that underpin Citi's rating.  Fitch's ratings action incorporates an expectation that Citi will manage its  capital and liquidity profiles relatively conservatively, and although capital  distributions will likely increase over the near term, they will still be  governed by the regulatory stress testing profile and as such, remain  reasonable.  Fitch also expects a relatively conservative capital profile is  appropriate in light of economic uncertainty, potential volatility in AOCI, and  the low visibility into future legal risks.  Any unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other charges could also have  adverse rating implications for Citi.  Litigation charges have weighed down  earnings, and will likely continue to impact earnings over the near term,  despite the fact that Citi's legal charges to date have been lower than some of  its peers. Fitch notes there is very little visibility into legal-related risk  for Citi or the industry, though Fitch's ratings action expects litigation costs  will remain manageable relative to capital.   With such expansive operations around the globe, Citi is also exposed to  elevated levels of operational risk. Fitch views Citi's risk management  infrastructure favourably, with significant enhancements made since the  financial crisis. While no institution is immune to a material operational loss,  Citi's experience to date has been favourable to some of its peers.  Fitch notes that the recent disclosure regarding fraud discovered in its Mexican  subsidiary, prompting Citi to revise downward 2013 earnings by approximately  $235m after-tax, represents failure in its risk management function. However, it  is not considered a ratings driver as it was very manageable in the context of  capital, and disclosed to be an isolated event. Fitch expects a certain level of  operational loss events can occur in any institution given the complexity of  products and services banking institutions offer, but these operational events  do not represent downward rating events in themselves. However, Citi's ratings  could be vulnerable to a large operational loss that depletes capital in a  material way, or if an operational event calls into question Fitch's assessment  of Citi's risk management function and its ability to accurately identify,  monitor, and mitigate risks throughout the organization.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Citi's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's  expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support from the  U.S. government (AAA/Rating Outlook Stable) if required. This expectation  reflects the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given  its strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain.  Specific to Citi, our view of support likelihood is based mostly on its systemic  importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness given its size and  operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share and its  position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy. Citi's  IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support because Citi's VR is  now equal to its SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise Citi's SR  to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' within the next one to two years, likely to be  some point in late 2014 or in 1H15. A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean no change to Citi's Long-term IDR  and debt ratings because Citi's viability rating is now equal to its SRF. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Citi and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from Citi's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles. These ratings have  thus been upgraded due to the upgrade of the company's VR. RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Citi and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in Citi's VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY Citi's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should Citi's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of Citi's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Citibank,  N.A. and Citibank Banamex USA are equalized across the group.  The IDRs and VRs of Citi's other major rated operating subsidiaries are  equalized with Citi's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core  to Citi's business strategy and financial profile. These entities include:  Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc, Citigroup Global Markets Limited,  Citigroup Derivatives Services LCC, Citibank Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd,  CitiFinancial Europe plc, and Citibank International PLC, whose IDRs would be  sensitive to the same factors that might drive a change in Citi's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Citi's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. However, Citi's uninsured  deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift because they do  not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the deposit is  expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States. Since Fitch  cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do  not get the rating uplift. KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by Citi and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in Citi's long- and short-term IDRs.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of Citi to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in Citi's IDRs.  To the extent that one of Citi's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from Citi's IDR. The rating actions are as follows:  The following ratings were upgraded: Citigroup Inc. --Subordinated to 'A-' from 'BBB+';   --Preferred to 'BB+' from 'BB'; --Viability Rating to 'a' from 'a-'.

86,"  * Citigroup shares slump after Fed rejects capital plan* GDP grew 2.6 pct in Q4; jobless claims unexpectedly drop* Dow off 0.03 pct; S&P off 0.2 pct; Nasdaq off 0.5 pct   (Updates to close)By Angela MoonNEW YORK, March 27 U.S. stocks fell on Thursday, erasing most of the S&P 500's year-to-date gain, as banking and technology stocks led the selloff.The benchmark S&P 500 turned nearly flat for the year after falling almost 1 percent this week as many of the market's biggest trading favorites lost their momentum.""The decliners once again are the tech and small-cap names. The decline is not as steep as it was earlier this week, but the continued weakness we see in these sectors suggests that investors are becoming more cautious as money continues to leave the stock market,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.A steep drop in Citigroup Inc shares, which suffered their biggest daily decline since November 2012, helped push the S&P 500 lower a day after the Federal Reserve rejected the bank's capital plan. The S&P financial index lost 0.6 percent and was the worst-performing sector. But the S&P 500 managed to hold above the 1,840 level, which has recently acted as support, as the end of the quarter approached and money managers engaged in ""window dressing,"" adjusting positions to improve the look of their portfolios.""The market has been given plenty of reasons to sharply sell off, and it does not seem as though there is that spirit to do it.

92,"   By Emily Stephenson and David Henry | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The Federal Reserve on Wednesday rejected Citigroup Inc's plans to buy back $6.4 billion of shares and boost dividends, saying the bank is not sufficiently prepared to handle a potential financial crisis.The decision marks the second time in three years that Citigroup has failed to win the Fed's approval for its plan to return money to shareholders, known as the ""capital plan.""Officials at the bank never saw the rejection coming, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday.The rejection underscores that whatever strides Citi's chief executive, Michael Corbat, has made in fixing the bank's difficulties, he still has work to do. Shares of Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, fell 5.4 percent to $47.45 in after-hours trading.Since taking the reins at the bank in 2012, Corbat has been working hard to cultivate close relationships with regulators in Washington. His predecessor, Vikram Pandit, had a famously testy relationship with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's then chairman Sheila Bair, among other regulators.But even after mending fences in Washington, Corbat was blindsided by the Fed's decision to nix his plan for paying out money to shareholders. His first hint that something might be awry with the bank's capital plans came last week, when the Fed disclosed its views of how global turmoil would affect the bank's capital levels, the source said. The Fed's projections were much less rosy than Citi's.The bank, like its competitors, faces two opposing goals. It wants to have large amounts of capital to please regulators; it also wants to please its shareholders, and high levels of capital weigh on profitability.Citi was one of five banks whose payout plans were rejected by the Fed on Wednesday. Three were the U.S. units of European banks. The fifth, Zions Bancorp, was expected because it was the only bank last week to fail a model run of a simulated crisis similar to the 2007-09 credit meltdown in the first part of the Fed's stress tests.The Fed said it approved capital plans submitted by the remaining 25 big banks in this year's tests.Corbat, said in a statement that the Citigroup is ""deeply disappointed"" by the Fed's decision and that the bank's request for returning additional capital to shareholders was modest.Last year, the Fed granted Citigroup permission to buy back $1.2 billion worth of shares and said it could continue to pay $120 million a year in dividends, representing a quarterly rate of a penny a share. This year Citigroup sought to spend more than five times as much buying back shares and to lift its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share. The bank earned $13.67 billion last year.Analysts, on average, had estimated that Citigroup's quarterly dividend would increase to 12 cents per share, according to surveys by Thomson Reuters.ANALYSTS SEE PROBLEMS IN CITI'S COMPLEXITY On Wednesday, the Fed said that Citigroup has improved its risk management practices in recent years, but the bank cannot determine well enough how its revenue and income would be hurt under stressful scenarios around the world. The bank's internal examination process does not sufficiently consider how global crises could influence its broad number of businesses, the Fed added.In 2012, the Fed rejected the plan by Citi's then CEO Pandit, a step that contributed to his ouster in October of that year. In the 2012 test, Citigroup did not prove to the Fed's satisfaction that it could adequately measure risk in loans to some consumers in Southeast Asia, where credit rating standards are not as well developed as in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Fed said on Wednesday that some of Citigroup's deficiencies had been ""previously identified by supervisors as requiring attention"" and that ""there was not sufficient improvement."" A Fed official said that regulators had raised their expectations for banks with each set of stress tests, and it expected improvements in areas that had previously been identified as needing work.Citigroup's complexity -- it operates in over 100 countries, and was built over decades of acquisitions -- may be working against it, analysts said.""Citi needs to make this defeat into victory by improving the pace of restructuring,"" said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA, saying the bank should consider breaking itself up more dramatically than it already has.The other banks blocked by the Fed on Wednesday in their plans for higher dividends or share buybacks were the U.S. units of HSBC, RBS and Santander, due to weaknesses in their capital planning processes.Zions, the fifth bank whose plan was barred, was the only bank out of 30 to miss minimum hurdles for regulatory capital in a first stage of the stress tests, which simulate a future crisis as severe as the 2007-09 credit meltdown. ""Both the firms and supervisors have more work to do as we continue to raise expectations for the quality of risk management in the nation's largest banks,"" Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said in a statement on Wednesday.The five banks can continue with shareholder payouts at the same pace as they did last year. They can also change their proposals and resubmit them, a move that Citigroup said it is considering.Fed officials told reporters that capital distributions at the banks had been sufficiently modest in past years that they could continue at current levels without hurting the firms.The Fed's criticism of internal controls, risk-identification and other planning elements at the foreign banks underscores regulators' concerns about the safety of those firms' operations in the United States.Foreign banks will have to wall off their U.S. units and meet tougher capital requirements under rules recently finalized by the Fed.The Fed has said HSBC, RBS and Santander all would likely fall under those new rules.Two large Wall Street banks, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, had to resubmit their capital plans after seeing their first set of stress test results.Bank of America received approval to increase its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 1 cent per share previously, and approval for the authorization a new $4.0 billion share buyback program. Last year, the Federal Reserve approved Bank of America's request to redeem $5.5 billion in preferred stock and $5.0 billion in common shares.The annual tests aim to determine whether banks are robust enough to weather the next crisis. Under the toughest stress scenario considered this year, the banks had to show how they would cope with the stock market falling by 50 percent. The eight biggest banks had to weigh the impact of a default by their largest derivatives trading counterparty.Last week, the Fed looked at what the banks' capital levels would look like in stress scenarios, assuming they did not change their payouts to investors. In the results released on Wednesday, regulators looked at whether banks could carry out their planned capital distributions and still maintain a buffer in a downturn.(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Emily Stephenson in Washington; Additional reporting by Douwe Miedema in Washington, and Peter Rudegeair and Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins and Leslie Adler)",2014-03-27,C,"Wed Mar 26, 2014 | 9:55pm EDT","Fed bars shareholder payouts from Citi, four others",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-banks-capital-idUSBREA2P1ZF20140327?type=companyNews
93,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK, March 28  NEW YORK, March 28 James Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive and chairman, was awarded total compensation of $12 mln for 2013, double what he got the previous year, the bank said in its proxy filing on Friday.Gorman's compensation for 2013 could rise to $18 million under a long-term incentive plan, if he meets certain performance targets in the future, the filing said.But Gorman, whose performance was cited by Morgan Stanley's board of director as ""exceeding expectations,"" could have reaped total compensation of $20 million or more if the board had determined that the bank had ""substantially exceeded expectations.""The board's compensation committee based Gorman's pay on its finding that ""Morgan Stanley's performance was strong, with room for continued progress, and Mr. Gorman's individual performance as exceeding expectations,"" the bank said in its filing.Of Gorman's total compensation package, only his $1.5 million base salary and $316,000 cash bonus were awarded immediately. Morgan Stanley was one of the best-performing financial stocks last year, up 64 percent, as investors saw signs of progress in the bank's years-long turn around plan engineered at the height of the financial crisis.Although still less profitable than rivals, Morgan Stanley finished its acquisition of the Smith Barney business from Citigroup Inc, whittled down more of a big book of problematic fixed-income trades, and laid out plans to hit a return-on-equity of 10 percent in the near term. In describing its rationale for Gorman's pay, the board cited those factors, as well as cost-cutting, a narrowing of Morgan Stanley's credit-default swap spreads -- indicating the bond market views the bank as less risky -- and the start of a stock repurchasing program for the first time since the financial crisis.This week, Morgan Stanley said it would build on that program after the Federal Reserve approved its plan to buy back $1 billion worth of more stock and raise its dividend.The bank still has work to do. Its return-on-equity last year was less than half of Gorman's target, and rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc  and JPMorgan Chase & Co are more profitable and further along in plans to return excess capital to shareholders.Goldman's board awarded its CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, an estimated $23 million compensation package, while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon received $20 million.Under Gorman's pay package, he will also receive $10.2 million worth of deferred compensation, half in cash and half in stock, and up to $6 million worth of long-term incentive compensation that he can receive if Morgan Stanley hits the 10 percent return target and shareholder returns above the S&P Financials Index.(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-03-28,C,"Fri Mar 28, 2014 | 5:47pm EDT",Morgan Stanley CEO awarded $12 mln for 2013 -and that could rise,http://www.reuters.com//article/morganstanley-ceopay-idUSL1N0MP1XW20140328?type=companyNews
94,"  March 28 Weaknesses in auditing led to Citigroup Inc failing the U.S. Federal Reserve capital assessments, fueling fears that there is negligence in controls at the U.S. bank, the Financial Times reported on Friday citing executives and others sources familiar with the matter.Executives at Citi are promising better auditing and anti-money laundering processes and will try to allay the concerns that led regulators to veto the bank's plan to return more cash to shareholders, the newspaper reported on its website. (r.reuters.com/cer97v)There is also tension brewing among the bank's management, the business daily said citing company sources.

96,"  (New throughout, updates with CVM decision, adds implications, background)By Joan Magee and Guillermo Parra-BernalNEW YORK/SAO PAULO, April 1 Brazil's securities industry watchdog CVM on Tuesday lifted a suspension on Grupo Oi SA's 6 billion real ($2.7 billion) share offering, paving the way for the Brazilian telecommunications company's merger with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA.Regulators last week halted the offering after Oi Chief Executive Officer Zeinal Bava breached a mandatory quiet period ahead of the transaction. Grupo BTG Pactual SA, the bank handling the deal, and Oi agreed to urge investors to ignore Bava's remarks, a condition CVM said in a statement was enough to lift the suspension.The decision takes effect past midnight and allows Oi to launch the offering within hours. Bankers were preparing to lunch the offering late on Tuesday, pending the CVM decision, two sources with knowledge of the situation told Thomson Reuters' IFR.The offering is the backbone of Oi's planned capital increase of 14 billion reais that will allow it to tie up with Portugal Telecom, its biggest shareholder. The offer was originally scheduled to price on April 16.Last week, shareholders of Oi and Portugal Telecom approved the capital increase and separate asset appraisals at their respective assemblies in Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon. Executives at the companies say the tie-up will give the resulting entity more clout to compete inside Brazil with bigger rivals such as Spain's Telefonica SA, Telecom Italia SpA's TIM Participações SA and Mexico's America Movil SAB . The shorter timeline underscores Oi's urgency to get the deal done before more banks endorsing the offering have second thoughts. Banco Bradesco SA and Itaú Unibanco Holding SA are considering pulling out of the deal because of demands by regulators that they to buy up remaining shares if demand falls short, two sources told Reuters, requesting anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue.Itaú and Bradesco, both based in São Paulo, as well as another 12 banks signed a firm commitment to the transaction about two weeks ago. Oi had obtained firm commitments from a group of lenders led by Grupo BTG Pactual SA, sources told Reuters late in March.Portugal Telecom and Oi have been discussing how to merge since the former bought 25 percent of Oi in 2010. The market value of both companies has fallen more than half over the past three years, a sign investors believed a merger would take place sooner or later. Many Oi shareholders have criticized the tie-up, saying the capital increase favors Oi's largest shareholders, including Portugal Telecom, at the expense of minority investors.SHARES FALL  Oi common shares tumbled 6.2 percent in Tuesday trading. Preferred shares of the company fell 7.7 percent. Itaú and Bradesco were both up about 1 percent.Bloomberg News first reported the possibility of banks backing out of the deal on Tuesday. According to the Bloomberg report, a group of four banks, including Itaú, Bradesco, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc are weighing pulling out of the deal.Oi, Itaú and Bradesco declined to comment. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup had no immediate comment on the Bloomberg report.Other banks involved in the operation include Bank of America Corp, Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG, Banco Espírito Santo SA, Banco do Brasil SA, Caixa Geral de Depositos SA, HSBC Holdings Plc , Morgan Stanley & Co, and Banco Santander Brasil SA.($1 = 2.25 Brazilian reais)   (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Additional reporting by Luciana Bruno in Rio de Janeiro, and Brad Haynes and Walter Brandimarte in São Paulo; Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid, Andre Grenon and David Gregorio)",2014-04-01,C,"Tue Apr 1, 2014 | 6:38pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Brazil watchdog lifts suspension of Oi offer, paves way for merger",http://www.reuters.com//article/grupooi-brazil-offering-idUSL1N0MT1H720140401?type=companyNews

Itaú and Bradesco, both based in São Paulo, as well as another 12 banks signed a firm commitment to the transaction about two weeks ago.The offering, which was scheduled to price on April 16 but was suspended last week by Brazil's securities industry watchdog CVM, is a key step to complete the phone carrier's merger with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA.

According to the Bloomberg report, a group of four banks including Itaú, Bradesco, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc are weighing pulling out of the deal because CVM asked that banks be required to buy any remaining shares of Oi, even if there is no demand.Oi, Itaú and Bradesco declined to comment. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup had no immediate comment on the Bloomberg report. Common shares of Oi tumbled 2.9 percent in early Tuesday trading. Preferred shares of the company fell 2.2 percent.

Some Citigroup officials are asking whether the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to veto its plan to boost dividends and buy back more shares was linked to its Mexico troubles.Citigroup has cut the compensation for Manuel Medina-Mora, who has run Banamex for many years and is also co-president of Citigroup - a role in which he oversees global consumer banking.Medina-Mora was paid $9.5 million in total compensation for 2013, according to a proxy statement filed by Citigroup on March 12.

Citigroup last year consented to an order from the Federal Reserve to take corrective steps. Medina-Mora has declined to comment on the pay cut.The bank has also taken $40 million of pay back from Banamex employees' bonus pool and said in a filing that it may cut pay for 2014 for senior executives at the bank.The Citigroup spokeswoman said Banamex was subject to the same oversight and controls required across the company.

108,"  April 3 Federal authorities have opened an investigation into a $400 million fraud involving Citigroup's  Mexican unit, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.Citigroup disclosed in February it had discovered at least $400 million in fraudulent loans in its Mexico subsidiary, Banco Nacional de Mexico, known as Banamex, and said employees may have been in on the crime.The bad loans were made to Mexican oil services company Oceanografia, a contractor for Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex. The investigation, overseen by the FBI and prosecutors from the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, is focusing on whether holes in Citigroup's internal controls contributed to the fraud in Mexico, the New York Times said. (link.reuters.com/gat28v)The FBI and prosecutors are questioning whether Citigroup was equal parts victim and enabler, the newspaper said. Reuters reported in February that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was aware of Citigroup's loan losses due to fraud by a Mexican company and was monitoring the situation for possible criminal activity. FBI in New York and Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, could not immediately be reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

The deal would include 45 retail bank offices and at least 300 staff, two sources familiar with the talks said.Banks worldwide have been pulling out of struggling businesses, or operations no longer central to their strategy, as they cut costs and bulk up capital to meet regulator demands.Spain has been particularly tough for international lenders in recent years as an economic downturn spurred a wave of local bank mergers, cementing the dominance of domestic firms.Even local players have been shutting or trying to sell branches, after a 2008 property crash halted their expansion and left some short of capital and in need of bailouts.Popular was not rescued by the state, but like peers it is still recovering from the crisis that landed it with soured real estate loans and housing. It swung back to profit in 2013, though its net income from loans fell from a year earlier.In a market increasingly centered on fewer than 10 top players - after most of the 45 Spanish savings banks that existed in 2010 were merged - the country's banks have been trying to increase their share, buying assets from foreign rivals leaving or nationalized lenders being auctioned off.A Popular acquisition of Citi's business would come with about 100,000 retail clients and about 1.1 million credit cards in issue, one of the sources familiar with the deal said, adding that the talks could conclude in two or three months.

111,"   By Julien Toyer, Arno Schuetze and Christoph Steitz | MADRID/FRANKFURT  MADRID/FRANKFURT Germany's biggest utility, E.ON SE (EONGn.DE), has hired Citi (C.N) to advise it on the sale of its assets in Spain, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a bid to pull out of weak energy markets in southern Europe.E.ON's plans to pull out of Spain, first reported in December, mark a further step by the energy firm to sell some of its underperforming coal and gas ventures, which have come under pressure from renewable power as well as tepid energy demand in Europe.Weighed down by 32 billion euros ($43.9 billion) in net debt, E.ON is also looking to sell its Italian operations, sources have said, which would effectively end its pricey foray into southern Europe after having to take billions of euros of writedowns on these assets.Bankers and analysts have estimated that the Spanish unit could fetch between 800 million and 1.2 billion euros, depending on whether the company sells all the business or just parts of it.""The price will also greatly depend on the new delivery contracts for E.ON's power plants,"" one of the people said.On a standalone basis, the energy producing units have a low value, he said, but if long-term contracts to supply energy to consumers are negotiated and then attached to the sale terms, their value increases significantly.""The sticker price for the assets can be engineered depending on how you shape the delivery contracts,"" he added. No timeline for the sale has been set, one of the people said, adding such a deal could take 12 to 18 months to materialize.Likely buyers for the assets could include specialized private equity funds with a focus on energy, including ContourGlobal First Reserve and Riverstone, two of the sources said.A spokesman for E.ON said the company was ""continuously reviewing the strategic options"" for its portfolio, but declined to comment on Spain. Citi also declined to comment. ContourGlobal, First Reserve and Riverstone were not available for comment.SMALLER PLAYER E.ON's operations in Spain, where it employs roughly 1,200 in staff, include 3.2 gigawatts (GW) worth of thermal plants and 1.1 GW of renewable capacity.It sells electricity to about 688,000 customers, a fraction of Spain's more than 17 million household consumers, but has been campaigning to capture new clients who are fed up with paying some of the highest electricity prices in the European Union. The distribution market has been traditionally dominated by Spain's largest electricity utility Endesa (ELE.MC), with a 43 percent market share and the primary player in Spain's southern and northeastern regions.Iberdrola (IBE.MC) and Gas Natural Fenosa (GAS.MC) are the main distributors in northern and central parts of Spain with total market share of 34 percent and 16 percent respectively. E.ON's main distribution areas are in the northern regions of Cantabria, Galicia, Asturias and Castille and Leon.It is also one of the smaller players in terms of generation, with 4.3 GW in a country with total capacity of 107 GW, of which only half are used, even during peak demand.Recent Spanish energy reforms, meant to curb a 30 billion euro tariff deficit caused by a gap between regulated prices and costs, have infuriated investors in renewable energy assets who complain the new rules are retroactive and drastically cut their return on investment.($1 = 0.7291 Euros)(Additional reporting by Tracy Rucinski; editing by Ludwig Burger and Tom Pfeiffer)",2014-04-04,C,"Fri Apr 4, 2014 | 5:37am EDT",E.ON hires Citi as advisor for Spanish asset sale,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-eon-spain-idUSBREA330GA20140404?type=companyNews

Established by Citi's legacy securities and banking business during 2005-2008, these residential mortgage-backed security trusts were represented and warranted by Citi affiliates.

116,"  (Adds detail from bill)By Douwe MiedemaWASHINGTON, April 7 U.S. lawmakers on Monday launched a bill to rewrite the rules of of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), giving more leeway to smaller players in the derivative markets it oversees.The agency became one of the most prolific reformers of Wall Street after the financial crisis under its previous chairman, Gary Gensler, who was frequently criticised by some in the financial industry for his hard-nosed style and sometimes-hasty adoption of new rules.In a so-called reauthorization bill to fine-tune the CFTC's mandate, the chairman and the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee drew up a list of changes to many of the tough rules the agency has written.""The CFTC's rulemaking process has been less than ideal. The rulemaking process has proven confusing,"" the four lawmakers launching the bill said in a statement.The bill also directed the CFTC to finish a study into high-frequency trading if it were adopted.The CFTC was a little-watched overseer of agriculture and other futures before the crisis, but the 2010 Dodd-Frank law put it in charge of the $690 trillion swaps market, dominated by large investment banks such as JP Morgan Chase & Co, Citibank and Bank of America.That has earned the agency a strong reputation among critics of big banks, but has drawn the ire of financial industry associations as well as from users of derivatives who fear the new rules may ramp up their costs.Frank Lucas, the Republican from Oklahoma who chairs the Committee, and Collin Peterson, the ranking Democrat from Minnesota, urged the other members of the committee to adopt the bill at a hearing on Wednesday. Separately, the Senate Agriculture Committee on Tuesday will vote on the candidacy on a new CFTC chairman, and two new commissioners.The CFTC needs to be reauthorized every five years, though it has in the past gone for several years without that stamp of approval. The launch of the bill is the first step of what will likely be a drawn-out process to get it through Congress.President Barack Obama's administration is opposed to making any changes to Dodd-Frank before it is fully implemented, and previous attempts to tweak it have stalled.THREE TITLES IN BILL  The bill has three titles: one to better protect customers in futures markets, a second to reform the CFTC, and the third to fine-tune changes in the swaps market for those clients who use it to hedge risk, and not to speculate.Client protection issues were at the heart of two major collapses of futures brokers overseen by the CFTC, MF Global and Peregrine Financial, and the agency has since tightened its rules for the long-regulated industry.But the lawmakers said the agency's new rules made the market too expensive for farmers, who use futures to protect revenue from their crops against wild swings in market prices, and proposed making regulations easier on them.The second title to reform the CFTC's procedure may well be among be the bill's most explosive, and could draw criticism from the left that the lawmakers are tethering the agency. If enacted, it would make the agency's staff responsible to the full five-strong Commission - which ordinarily is majority-led Democrats or Republicans, depending on the reigning administration - and not just its chairman.It would also subject all the agency's decisions to a so-called cost-benefit analysis, a frequently used tool with which opponents of regulation have knocked out rules in court.The agency is facing a court battle over how it applies its rules to foreign companies and U.S. companies doing business abroad, with the argument focusing on whether it followed proper procedure.The so-called cross-border guidance wasn't vetted by the Commission, but issued by staff. The bill would limit that practice, which puts decisions outside the reach of its politically controlled top level, to a minimum.The bill also touched on a row between the agency and the world's largest future exchange, the CME Group Inc., which last year accused it of sharing sensitive market data with outside researchers, leading the agency to temporarily shut down its research program for visiting academics.The lawmakers in the bill proposed setting up a new office of the chief economist, also answerable to the full commission, and with tighter procedures and internal controls.The third title would exempt so-called end-users in swaps markets - who use swaps to hedge risk, and not to speculate - from costly rules that require them to set aside money for each trade they enter into, so-called margin.It would also exempt them from certain record-keeping requirements the CFTC has introduced to combat fraud.Lastly, the bill would require a vote before the agency lowers the threshold above which a company needs to register with the agency as a so-called swap dealer, and comply with its harshest rules, from $8 billion where it is now.

119,"   By David Henry  As Citigroup Inc (C.N) Chief Executive Mike Corbat prepares to talk to investors on Monday about the bank's biggest failure during his 18-month tenure, his biggest struggle may be with how little he knows about the reason he failed.The U.S. Federal Reserve said on March 26 that it had rejected Citigroup's request to boost its dividend and buy back more shares. The news was a stinging blow to Corbat, who was charged with improving the bank's relationship with regulators in October 2012, when he was named the new CEO.The Fed still had not explained as of earlier this week why Citigroup failed to win approval, a bank executive told Reuters. Corbat, he said, has little information as to what went wrong and why. Corbat, through a spokesman, declined to comment.The regulator's rejection has wrecked what was left of Citigroup's chances of meeting a key profitability target that Corbat personally announced a year ago: 2015 profits equal to at least 10 percent of a measure of the bank's common equity. That ratio, known as ""return on tangible common equity,"" is a measure of how effectively the bank uses shareholders' money to generate income.Corbat is getting ready to talk to investors after the bank posts first quarter earnings on Monday. Even putting aside the bank's capital plan rejection, Citigroup's first-quarter results are not expected to be strong.Net income is likely to be down 6 percent from a year earlier, according to the average analyst estimate. The reasons expected include a sharp drop in revenue from fixed-income markets and continued high legal and restructuring expenses. The bank has likely had to spend more money on legal and compliance matters after announcing it had found a $400 million loan fraud in Mexico.Add it all up, and the bank's CEO has a lot of explaining to do, analysts said.""All eyes are on Mike Corbat,"" said analyst Mike Mayo of CLSA. Banks across Wall Street are expected to post lower first quarter results, hurt by weaker trading revenue.But Corbat and his executives have extra difficulties to contend with, and have been debating what they should do about the target for return on tangible common equity, according to the bank executive. With regulators rejecting the bank's plan for lowering its equity levels by buying back more shares and paying higher dividends, Citigroup's income is almost certain to fall short of the levels required to meet the return on equity target, analysts say.The CEO has few palatable options now, analysts said. If he postpones resetting the target, he risks leaving investors frustrated by the lack of direction. If he reduces the target, the shares, which are already trading at lower valuations than competitors, could be hit. Announcing a big new set of cost-cuts and layoffs to improve profitability, as the company did in December 2012, would contradict Corbat's pledge to make trimming expenses a steady, ""business as usual"" practice under his administration.And reducing staff could also risk further alienating the Federal Reserve, which has said publicly that it had repeatedly found Citigroup deficient in projecting revenue and losses for its operations around the globe under a stressful scenario.""Analysts are going to want to know how deep are these issues,"" said Fred Cannon of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""How delayed is the capital return story going to be at Citi?""To be sure, Corbat's chances of meeting the 10 percent return on tangible common equity target looked slim before the Federal Reserve ruled, according to analyst estimates. But the denial by the regulators has made missing it a virtual certainty, Cannon said. It seems too soon for the company to replace executives, said Cannon. ""They only put this management team in place a little over a year ago,"" he said. Corbat became the CEO in 2012 at the urging of the current board chairman, Michael O'Neill, and he named his executive team in January 2013.Corbat announced a series of profitability targets in March 2013 as a way for Wall Street to track his results. After having been named CEO when directors pushed Vikram Pandit out of the post, Corbat saw Citigroup shares rise steadily for about six months, largely on confidence that he and O'Neill would make the company more efficient and return capital to shareholders.That momentum has gone, adding pressure on Corbat to handle the questions deftly on Monday. Citigroup shares trade for an industry-low fraction of their tangible book value, 85 percent, according to analyst John McDonald of Bernstein Research. That means stockholders cannot get as much for their shares as Citigroup's balance sheet shows they are worth.And eight days after Monday's conference call Corbat is in line for more of the same kind of questioning by stockholders at the company's annual meeting in St. Louis. The price of their shares on Thursday was almost the same as at last year's meeting even though the KBW bank stock index is 23 percent higher.CLSA's Mike Mayo, who recommended the stock after Corbat was made CEO, says he plans to go to the meeting and ask Corbat and O'Neill what corrective actions they will take.""That is going to be the front and center question,"" Mayo said. ""Hopefully, this is a catalyst for more aggressive change when it comes to restructuring, regulatory relations and responsibility to shareholders.""(Editing by Dan Wilchins and Eric Walsh)",2014-04-10,C,"Thu Apr 10, 2014 | 4:54pm EDT","Citigroup CEO faces grilling over failed plan, missed target",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-citigroup-results-corbat-idUSBREA391YW20140410?type=companyNews
120,"  * American Express, Citigroup, Discover prevail* Cardholders alleged collusion to require arbitration   (Adds comments from Citigroup, Discover lawyer)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, April 10 Consumers suffered a setback on Thursday as three big credit card issuers won the dismissal of U.S. lawsuits accusing them of colluding to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than class action lawsuits.U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said cardholders failed to show that American Express Co, Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  conspired to violate the Sherman antitrust law.The plaintiffs had argued that the conspiracy ran from May 1999 to October 2003, when 10 card-issuing banks and their lawyers held 28 meetings to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements.Pauley said his decision in the decade-old case was a close call, given the ""conscious parallel action"" among the biggest card issuers to include the clauses.""It was only by a slender reed that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the lawyers who organized these meetings had spawned a Sherman Act conspiracy among their clients,"" Pauley wrote in a 92-page decision, following a 2013 non-jury trial.Class action litigation can allow consumers to pool resources and obtain greater recoveries at lower cost than individual arbitrations. ""This is a big dent for consumer rights,"" said Curtis Arnold, a consumer advocate and founder of CardRatings.com in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""Class action lawsuits have over the years kept this industry in check. Individuals don't have much recourse taking on card giants by themselves.""Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years.Merrill Davidoff, a partner at Berger & Montague representing the plaintiffs, said his clients were ""obviously disappointed"" and strongly disagreed with Pauley's decision. He said it is premature to address whether there will be an appeal.Robert Sperling, a partner at Winston & Strawn representing Discover, said the cardholders ""never came close to proving collusion."" Citigroup spokeswoman Emily Collins said that the bank is pleased with the decision. Spokeswomen for American Express did not respond to requests for comment. American Express, Citigroup and Discover collectively held about 31.1 percent of U.S. outstanding credit card balances in 2013, according to the Nilson Report.AVOIDING A BACKLASH In April 2010, Bank of America Corp, Capital One Financial Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co settled with the plaintiff cardholders by agreeing to remove their arbitration clauses for 3-1/2 years. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated in December that just over 50 percent of outstanding credit card loans remain subject to the clauses. It said the percentage would have been 94 percent absent the earlier settlements.Other industries also use arbitration clauses. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 upheld contracts used by AT&T Inc  requiring consumers to arbitrate disputes individually.In his decision, Pauley noted that of the 10 banks that had been part of the litigation, just two had mandatory arbitration clauses at the start of the alleged collusion.He found ""compelling evidence"" that cardholders would have little economic incentive to fight alleged abuses absent class actions, and said that the banks' ""need to parry consumer backlash and temper any 'rogue' players"" established a motive to conspire.""A motive to conspire, however, does not mean that a conspiracy existed,"" he said. ""This court is convinced that the evidence is just as consistent with legitimate activity in furtherance of the issuing banks' independent self interests.""Pauley said the case also offered a ""cautionary lesson"" to lawyers, given that the banks' cost to defend against the lawsuits offset potential savings from the arbitration clauses.""In retrospect, the issuing banks' short-term goal of lowering litigation costs eluded them,"" he wrote.The cases are in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. They are Ross et al v. American Express Co et al, No. 04-05723; and Ross et al v. Bank of America NA et al, No. 05-07116.

125,"   By David Henry  At a meeting with 300 senior Citigroup officials in the first week of February, Chief Executive Michael Corbat said the bank needed to focus on two things above all else this year: expenses and efficiency.The bank's first quarter results on Monday showed just how much work Citigroup executives have ahead of them in those areas.In Citigroup's main businesses, revenue fell 3.5 percent in the quarter while operating expenses eased only 1.5 percent compared with a year earlier, the bank said. It still needs to cut another 3.5 percent, or $1.5 billion, from its annual operating expenses to meet its own 2015 targets for efficiency, according to Reuters calculations.The company's expenses are too high given its weak revenues, said Gary Townsend, a longtime bank stock investor who owns Citigroup shares and formerly ran Hill-Townsend Capital.High costs have bedeviled Citigroup for a decade. For years, the bank's problems were mainly linked to its failure to fully integrate businesses built up over years of acquisitions.That integration is mostly done. But now the bank, like other major American banks, is struggling to cut costs as it seeks to cope with the expense of complying with a welter of new laws and regulations following the financial crisis. Executives at Citigroup, which had to be rescued by the U.S. government three times during that crisis, in the past 18 months have already eliminated $2.8 billion from the company's overall annual expense base through layoffs and assorted reorganization and productivity steps, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on a conference call with analysts. A big chunk of that stems from the company's December 2012 announcement that it was eliminating more than 11,000 jobs.But of the $2.8 billion, only 20 percent is going to the bottom line, Gerspach said.Some 40 percent is being spent to comply with regulations and control risks. The other 40 percent is covering other expenses and the added costs that come with investments, such as Citigroup's purchase of the Best Buy store group's credit card portfolio.For Citigroup, cost cutting is particularly difficult, because it operates in more than 100 countries, making it the most international of the U.S. banks. Being global hurts the bank on at least two fronts: it makes complying with U.S. laws more difficult, and it gives the bank dozens of other regulatory regimes to deal with.The Federal Reserve recently rejected Citigroup's request to pay higher dividends to shareholders and buy back more shares, citing the bank's inability to properly forecast how any markets and economic difficulty would hurt its many businesses globally.Gerspach said the bank needs to devote more resources to deal with the concerns raised by the Fed. As it is now, Citigroup has more than 500 people who spend more than half of their time on the bank's capital requests with the Fed, and somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 other people that spend at least some of their time on the process. Citigroup has so much work to do in fixing this that it is not going to reapply to the Fed for permission to pay an increased dividend this year, and is instead focusing on a new application for 2015, Corbat said on the conference call.Meanwhile, the bank has regulatory and control problems overseas. In Mexico, Citigroup is reviewing its entire control structure after a series of problems there. In February, the bank said its Banamex unit lost $400 million from making loans to a supplier to Mexican oil company Pemex. Those loans turned out to be bogus, and Mexico's attorney general is investigating how Pemex supplier Oceanografia allegedly defrauded Citigroup.To make matters worse, Gerspach said on Monday that the bank had discovered fraudulent loans made to another Pemex supplier. He declined to identify the company, but said the loans involvedwould be somewhere around $30 million, and the losses would be much lower.Citigroup's Banamex unit also lost some $80 million from bad loans to homebuilders that executives in New York had nixed but that Mexican executives made anyway. <ID: nL2N0L526O>(Reporting by David Henry; Editing by Dan Wilchins and Martin Howell)",2014-04-14,C,"Mon Apr 14, 2014 | 6:51pm EDT",Citigroup still has a way to go in cost-cutting program,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-citigroup-results-expenses-analysis-idUSBREA3D1V220140414?type=companyNews

129,"   By David Henry and Tanya Agrawal  Citigroup Inc posted better-than-expected quarterly income as losses on troubled assets narrowed, but revenue declined in many of its major businesses and operating expenses remained stubbornly high.The biggest boon to Citigroup's first-quarter results came from Citi Holdings, the unit that houses the assets it's looking to shed. But echoing JPMorgan Chase & Co's results on Friday, Citigroup was hurt overall by a decline in revenue from bond trading and home mortgage lending.Citigroup's Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said he would not be surprised if bond trading revenue fell 5 to 10 percent for the industry this year.As with JPMorgan, many of Citigroup's other major businesses posted double-digit percentage declines in revenue.But Citigroup's results did beat analysts' average expectations, and shares rose 4.2 percent to $47.61, putting them on track to log their biggest one-day percentage gain since January 2013.The stock gains came after the bank's shares lost some 9 percent since late March, when Citigroup failed to win Federal Reserve approval to pay a higher dividend and buy back more shares.Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat has been struggling to improve the bank's relationship with regulators, and the Fed's rejection was a stinging blow. Corbat said he expects to be held accountable for the rejection when the board of directors determines his pay.The bank has given investors other bad news recently.In February Citigroup said it was investigating $400 million of fraudulent loans it discovered it had made to a company in Mexico. The bank has terminated one employee in the fraud, and expects to dismiss others, Corbat told analysts on Monday.Citigroup has found a second set of fraudulent loans, also linked to a supplier of Mexican oil company Pemex, but the loans were less than $30 million, and it expects to fully recoup the funds, Gerspach said. He declined to identify the company. First-quarter adjusted net income rose to $4.15 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $4.00 billion, or $1.29 per share a year earlier, the third-largest U.S. bank said on Monday.Total net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles rose to $3.94 billion, or $1.23 per share, from $3.81 billion, or $1.23 per share.Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The adjusted loss at Citi Holdings, which holds the bank's portfolio of troubled assets left over from the financial crisis, eased to $292 million from $798 million a year earlier.For all of Citigroup, adjusted revenue dropped 2 percent to $20.12 billion.Operating expenses fell at a slower rate, slipping 1 percent to $12.15 billion. STILL WAITING MORE WORD FROM FED The Fed's capital plan rejection wrecked what was left of Citigroup's chances of meeting a key profitability target Corbat announced a year ago - a 2015 profit equal to at least 10 percent of a measure of the bank's common equity.That ratio, known as return on tangible common equity, is a measure of how effectively the bank uses shareholders' money to generate income.""We are committed to bringing our capital planning process to the highest possible standards, befitting an institution of our global reach. I will dedicate whatever resources and make whatever changes necessary to achieve this critical goal,"" Corbat said in a statement.Gerspach told reporters that the bank still has not received a formal letter from the Fed detailing its issues with the bank's capital plan. He said, however, that Citigroup has no reason to believe the Fed objects to its global business model. Instead, regulators seem to have taken issue with the way Citigroup identifies and quantifies risks in stress scenarios when it is planning for its capital needs, Gerspach said. Citigroup's two previous quarterly reports missed market estimates, adding to the pressure on the bank's executives to deliver on Monday.JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported lower-than-expected earnings on Friday, largely due to a 21 percent decline in bond trading revenue.Bank of America Corp will report quarterly results on Wednesday, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley will report on Thursday.In fixed-income trading for Citigroup, adjusted revenue fell 18 percent to $3.85 billion from a year earlier as clients took to the sidelines to await more clarity from the Fed on interest rates. For its adjusted results, Citigroup strips out tax changes and the impact of changes in value of its debt and in the creditworthiness of its derivatives.Investors are trying to gauge how much of the decline in fixed income business is temporary, and how much is permanent because of new, tighter rules being imposed by regulators to protect the financial system.Citigroup has cut another 200 to 300 jobs, or about 2 percent of its global markets workforce due to market conditions, a source said.Expenses for job cuts and other costs linked to repositioning its businesses rose to $211 million from $148 million a year earlier.Legal costs rose to $945 million from $710 million.Ahead of Monday's report, analysts had said Citigroup would likely have to spend more on legal and compliance matters because of the rejection of the capital plan and multiple problems at its Mexican subsidiary, Banamex.(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr, Sofina Mirza-Reid and Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-04-14,C,"Mon Apr 14, 2014 | 2:20pm EDT",Citi posts higher income as troubled assets perform better,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-citigroup-results-idUSBREA3D0R820140414?type=companyNews

The three sectors rose between 15 and 30 percent in the past year, leaving them trading at hefty premiums to their 10-year average price-to-earnings multiple at a time of falling profit estimates, Datastream data showed.The broader market was propped up by a rise in sectors where earnings are less exposed to fluctuations in the economic cycle, such as food and beverages, which was up 1 percent.""With earnings forecasts now looking not so good for 2014, people are looking at valuations,"" said Tom Elliott, international investment strategist at deVere Group.""That favours defensives over cyclicals.""Tech stocks, in particular, are the most expensive in Europe, trading at around 19 times their 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of about 16 times and the STOXX 600's price-earnings ratio of 14.

132,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) WARSAW/LONDON/MOSCOW, April 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Poland-based  Bank Handlowy w Warszawie's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-' with a  Stable Outlook and its Viability Rating (VR) at 'bbb+'. A full list of rating  actions is provided at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS The IDRs and Support Rating of Bank Handlowy w Warszawie are based on the  extremely high probability that Handlowy would be supported, if required, by its  ultimate 75% shareholder, Citigroup Inc. (A/Stable). Fitch believes that  Handlowy is a strategically important subsidiary for its parent. The Stable Outlook on Handlowy's Long-Term IDR reflects that on Citigroup. A  downgrade of Citigroup's IDRs or weakening of its propensity to support Handlowy  would result in a downgrade of the subsidiary's Long-Term IDR. However, any  potential downgrade of the bank's Long-Term IDR would be limited to one notch  because of Handlowy's VR of 'bbb+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES -VR Bank Handlowy's VR of 'bbb+' is underpinned by its robust capitalisation, ample  liquidity, conservative risk management and stable funding base. Handlowy's capitalisation is supported by healthy performance, moderate appetite  for credit risk and high coverage of impaired loans by specific reserves (73% at  end-2013). In Fitch's opinion, the bank's flexibility to absorb potential credit  losses is high. At end-2013, the bank could incur an additional PLN2.4bn of loan  impairment charges (about 13.6% of gross loans at end-2013) before its Fitch  core capital (adjusted for declared dividends for 2013) would fall to 10%. Handlowy's liquidity position is a rating strength and is underpinned by a large  portfolio of unencumbered domestic debt securities eligible for repo refinancing  with the Polish central bank. At end-2013, the bank's liquidity buffer equalled  PLN20.5bn (or 45% of total assets), which was sufficient to repay all wholesale  funding and then about half of customer deposits. Handlowy lends mainly to the largest (domestic and international) companies  operating in Poland and affluent individuals. At end-2013, the bank's impaired  loans ratio of 7.6% was somewhat higher than the market average of 7.3%.  However, excluding low-risk residential mortgages (about 7% of total loans at  Handlowy compared with around 35% market average) these ratios were 8.1% and  9.5%, respectively.  At end-2013, customer deposits accounted for 78% of total funding (excluding  derivatives), of which 74% comprised corporate deposits. The bank's gross  loans/deposits ratio of 62% was one of the lowest among the largest banks in  Poland. Non-retail deposits are stable, reflecting well-established banking  relationships (comprehensive services for large corporates) and strong focus on  acquiring (Basel III-compliant) operational accounts. Non-core deposits from  price-sensitive large companies were on average a material USD1bn (12% of total  deposits at end-2013), but their potential outflow would not materially weaken  the bank's ample liquidity buffer. Handlowy's performance in 2014 could suffer from likely lower trading gains on  debt securities (2013 results benefited from several reference rate cuts), but  net interest margin should stabilise. The bank expects a modest fall in  operating costs, while the cost of risk could somewhat increase if credit growth  gains momentum. Fitch does not expect a downgrade of the VR due to Handlowy's large capital and  liquidity buffers, although the rating could come under pressure if there is a  marked deterioration in the Polish operating environment. An upgrade of  Handlowy's VR to the 'a' category is unlikely, in light of its rather limited  franchise.

133,"  * Ukraine tensions sap appetite for risk* Shares dependent on economic growth hit on valuation worry* FTSEurofirst 300, Euro STOXX 50 both flatBy Francesco CanepaLONDON, April 14 Cyclical shares weighed on European bourses on Monday as tensions in Ukraine and volatile global markets prompted investors to take a more cautious stance on growth and cash in on some of the best performers of the past nine months.Appetite for risk dried up as Ukraine's president threatened military action against pro-Russian separatists, raising the prospect of costly international sanctions and further straining investor nerves after a sharp selloff in global equities last week.Shares in sectors which depend the most on economic activity, such as travel and leisure, tech and financial services fell between 1.5 percent and 1.9 percent, underperforming flat pan-European indexes.The three sectors rose between 15 and 30 percent in the past year, leaving them trading at hefty premia to their 10-year average price-to-earnings multiple at a time of falling profit estimates, Datastream data showed. ""With earnings forecasts now looking not so good for 2014, people are looking at valuations,"" said Tom Elliott, international investment strategist at deVere Group.Tech stocks, in particular, are the most expensive in Europe, trading at around 19 times their 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of about 16 times and the STOXX 600's price-earnings ratio of 14.Smaller biotech names such as Cellectis and Genfit, shares in which more than doubled in value since the start of the year, fell nearly 10 percent each.

135,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 15 (Fitch) Citigroup's (Citi) first quarter 2014 (1Q'14) reported  results reflect broad industry challenges in fixed income and mortgage banking,  according to Fitch Ratings. Excluding CVA/DVA, which were immaterial, Citi  reported net income of $4.1 billion on $20.1 billion of revenues. Although 1Q'14  was sequentially higher, this reflects seasonal factors, particularly in  securities trading. Expenses remain controlled, reflecting Citi's focus on  improving its overall efficiency. Core return on assets came in at 0.89 basis  points (bps), which reflects progress towards closing the gap with some of its  large bank peers.   While overall results were solid, Citi was not immune to the slowdown in fixed  income markets, which hurt its Institutional Clients Group results. Fixed income  trading was down 18% (excluding CVA/DVA) vs. 1Q'13 reflecting the fall off in  activity, particularly in securitized products, rates, and currencies.  Investment Banking was down sequentially and vs. 1Q'13. Some of the decline in  fixed income and investment banking was offset by growth in Corporate Lending  and Equities.  International Consumer Banking showed modest revenue growth overall despite the  impact of market exits in some EMEA countries. The year-over-year growth mainly  came from Latam. Fitch notes that net charge-offs (NCOs) in Latin American  continue to deteriorate mainly stemming from higher credits in Mexico. Some of  the increase was related to incremental credit costs related to the Pemex  supplier program, while Citi also attributed some of the deterioration to Mexico  card portfolio seasoning. Citi expects that the full-year NCO rate in Latin  America will stabilize around 4.6% due to fiscal reforms in Mexico and generally  slower pace of economic recovery in the country. As a result, Fitch expects Citi  to maintain a conservative approach to loan loss reserve levels in the  international consumer segment, which continued to be the only business segment  reporting a reserve build in 1Q'14.  North American Consumer Banking reported strong growth on a sequential basis in  net income despite overall revenue declines, mainly due to lower mortgage  refinancing activity. Results were helped by improved credit costs and $269  million reserve release. In terms of efficiency, the consumer banking business  is somewhat below Citi's targeted 2015 efficiency ratio of between 49% and 52%,  running around 55% in 1Q'14.  Citi Holdings was less of a drag on 1Q'14 earnings with a loss of $292 million  as revenues showed some growth, though Fitch does not consider the 10%  linked-quarter revenue growth to be sustainable. Citi continues to wind down its  assets, and ended the quarter with $114 billion in total assets at Citi Holdings  or 6% of consolidated assets.  Following the announcement of the proposed settlement regarding private-label  securitization repurchase claims, Fitch views future repurchase risk as  manageable. Assuming this settlement is ratified, Citi has now addressed a  majority of its legacy repurchase claims, including Fannie, Freddie, FHFA, and  now a bulk of the PLS activity that occurred between 2005 and 2008. This  agreement does not cover mortgage loans sold through CitiMortgage, Inc., or  roughly $24.6 billion, a manageable amount to potentially resolve.  Legal and related charges remain elevated at approximately $945 million during  the quarter, reflecting ongoing challenges facing the industry on a number of  fronts. Fitch expects legal charges will likely remain elevated over the  near-to-intermediate term for Citi and its large bank peers. Although Citi's  legal charges have been below peer banks thus far, Citi remains exposed to  LIBOR, currency trading, and credit-default swap investigations, to name a few,  though Fitch notes that visibility into future legal-related costs is very  limited.  Citi's capital ratios continued to remain very strong and generally above global  peers. Citi reported that it would already be in compliance with the  supplementary leverage ratio at the holding company with a 5.6% ratio. The  Federal Reserve's rejection of Citi's capital distribution will cause Citi to  continue to build capital over the coming quarters and further delays Citi's  return on capital objectives.

138,"   By Peter Rudegeair and Tanya Agrawal  Bank of America Corp reported an unexpected first-quarter loss on Wednesday after it took a $6 billion charge to cover litigation expenses, a figure that far exceeded the legal settlements the No. 2 U.S. bank has announced recently.Revenue improved in many of the bank's major businesses, but the results were overshadowed by its bigger-than-expected legal costs. The bank had previously said that a settlement would cut into its earnings by $3.7 billion before taxes.The extra litigation expenses came from setting aside money to cover future legal settlements tied to previously disclosed mortgage-related matters, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson told reporters.Still, the bank's setting aside more money does not mean a settlement is imminent, Thompson told analysts on a separate conference call.The bank's shares fell 2.1 percent to $16.04 on the New York Stock Exchange shortly after midday.Rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc had made profits for the quarter.Bank of America's quarterly loss, its first since the second quarter of 2011, underscores how much the bank is still suffering from its disastrous acquisition in 2008 of Countrywide Financial Corp at the height of the financial crisis. That deal was a key factor in the more than $50 billion of legal expenses the bank has logged since the financial crisis.In March, Bank of America agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement to resolve claims that Countrywide and other Bank of America entities overstated the quality of the mortgages they sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007. [ID:nL1N0MN1XF] The bank had previously set aside funds to cover much of the settlement with the two agencies, but not all of it.Indeed, the bank still has other home loan issues to resolve. In March, Bank of America said it was still subject to penalties and fines from the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other government authorities for mortgages and related bonds.There was positive news for the bank in the results.Income rose in its wealth management, trading, and retail banking businesses, and it wrote off fewer bad loans. It cut staff levels.""Higher litigation costs clearly blurred the progress we made,"" said Thompson. The bank reported a net loss for shareholders of $514 million, or 5 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31. That comes after it earned a profit of $1.11 billion, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier.Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 5 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.LAGGING RIVALS In 2013's first quarter, results were hit by $1.6 billion in charges related to disputes with bond insurers.Revenue fell 3.8 percent to $22.66 billion, excluding accounting adjustments, but beat the average analyst estimate of $22.33 billion.Bank of America's performance lagged rivals. Both Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co reported better-than-expected profit, while JPMorgan Chase & Co missed estimates as bond-trading revenue fell. Bank of America's 2011 quarterly loss came after it took more than $20 billion of mortgage-linked charges. Taking into account the expense of paying dividends to preferred shareholders, the bank posted a net loss to common shareholders in the third quarter of 2012.Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley will report first-quarter results on Thursday.The loss follows Bank of America's best year since before the financial crisis.The bank's 2013 net income of $11.4 billion was the highest since 2007, but large legal bills and settlements left over from the financial crisis remain a drag on performance.BofA made progress resolving many of its legal issues in the first quarter, although some proved to be costly.In addition to the settlement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bank received a New York judge's approval for its $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities that went sour. Litigation expenses of $6 billion compared with $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Non-interest expenses increased to $22.24 billion from $19.50 billion.Costs in the bank's Legacy Assets and Servicing division, excluding litigation expenses, fell to $1.6 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier and $1.8 billion in the third quarter.The Charlotte-based bank has said that costs in the unit, which handles delinquent mortgage loans, would fall below $1.1 billion a quarter by the end of 2014 and will be about $500 million a quarter by the end of 2015.BAD LOAN ALLOWANCES Bank of America released $379 million from its allowances for bad loans, compared with $804 million in the same period a year earlier and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter.BofA's net charge-off ratio fell to 0.62 percent in the quarter from 1.14 percent in the same period a year earlier.Revenue from fixed-income trading declined 1.7 percent to $2.95 billion as many clients took to the sidelines in the quarter, awaiting clarity from the Federal Reserve on its interest rate intentions.Results in the year-ago quarter were hurt by a settlement with a bond insurance company. Adjusting for that settlement, bond trading revenue fell 15 percent in the first quarter of 2014, the company said.Still, the bank performed better than Citigroup, whose revenue from the business fell 18 percent.

The bank had previously said that a settlement would cut into its earnings by $3.7 billion before taxes.The extra litigation expenses came from setting aside money to cover future legal settlements tied to previously disclosed mortgage-related matters, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson told reporters.Still, the bank's setting aside more money does not mean a settlement is imminent, Thompson told analysts on a separate conference call.The bank's shares fell 2.1 percent to $16.04 on the New York Stock Exchange shortly after midday.Rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc  had made profits for the quarter.Bank of America's quarterly loss, its first since the second quarter of 2011, underscores how much the bank is still suffering from its disastrous acquisition in 2008 of Countrywide Financial Corp at the height of the financial crisis. That deal was a key factor in the more than $50 billion of legal expenses the bank has logged since the financial crisis.In March, Bank of America agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement to resolve claims that Countrywide and other Bank of America entities overstated the quality of the mortgages they sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007.  The bank had previously set aside funds to cover much of the settlement with the two agencies, but not all of it.Indeed, the bank still has other home loan issues to resolve. In March, Bank of America said it was still subject to penalties and fines from the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other government authorities for mortgages and related bonds.There was positive news for the bank in the results.Income rose in its wealth management, trading, and retail banking businesses, and it wrote off fewer bad loans. It cut staff levels. ""Higher litigation costs clearly blurred the progress we made,"" said Thompson.The bank reported a net loss for shareholders of $514 million, or 5 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31. That comes after it earned a profit of $1.11 billion, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. [IDn:nBw50C1C1a]Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 5 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.LAGGING RIVALS In 2013's first quarter, results were hit by $1.6 billion in charges related to disputes with bond insurers.Revenue fell 3.8 percent to $22.66 billion, excluding accounting adjustments, but beat the average analyst estimate of $22.33 billion. Bank of America's performance lagged rivals. Both Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co reported better-than-expected profit, while JPMorgan Chase & Co  missed estimates as bond-trading revenue fell.Bank of America's 2011 quarterly loss came after it took more than $20 billion of mortgage-linked charges. Taking into account the expense of paying dividends to preferred shareholders, the bank posted a net loss to common shareholders in the third quarter of 2012.Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley  will report first-quarter results on Thursday.The loss follows Bank of America's best year since before the financial crisis.The bank's 2013 net income of $11.4 billion was the highest since 2007, but large legal bills and settlements left over from the financial crisis remain a drag on performance.BofA made progress resolving many of its legal issues in the first quarter, although some proved to be costly. In addition to the settlement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bank received a New York judge's approval for its $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities that went sour. [ID: nL2N0L518W]Litigation expenses of $6 billion compared with $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Non-interest expenses increased to $22.24 billion from $19.50 billion.Costs in the bank's Legacy Assets and Servicing division, excluding litigation expenses, fell to $1.6 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier and $1.8 billion in the third quarter.The Charlotte-based bank has said that costs in the unit, which handles delinquent mortgage loans, would fall below $1.1 billion a quarter by the end of 2014 and will be about $500 million a quarter by the end of 2015.BAD LOAN ALLOWANCES Bank of America released $379 million from its allowances for bad loans, compared with $804 million in the same period a year earlier and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter.BofA's net charge-off ratio fell to 0.62 percent in the quarter from 1.14 percent in the same period a year earlier.Revenue from fixed-income trading declined 1.7 percent to $2.95 billion as many clients took to the sidelines in the quarter, awaiting clarity from the Federal Reserve on its interest rate intentions.Results in the year-ago quarter were hurt by a settlement with a bond insurance company. Adjusting for that settlement, bond trading revenue fell 15 percent in the first quarter of 2014, the company said.Still, the bank performed better than Citigroup, whose revenue from the business fell 18 percent. JPMorgan Chase's bond trading revenue dropped 21 percent, including an accounting adjustment that Bank of America and Citigroup strip out.Bank of America's net interest margin, excluding market-related adjustments, was 2.36 percent, compared with 2.30 percent in the first quarter of 2013.During the quarter, the bank received the Federal Reserve's blessing to increase its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 1 cent and repurchase $4 billion in common shares.

142,"   By David Henry | ST. LOUIS  ST.

The Fed apparently turned down the capital plan because of multiple issues with Citigroup processes for managing its capital and testing risk in stressful scenarios, said Corbat, citing conversations with regulators. He and O'Neill said the rejection did not seem to reflect a disagreement with Citigroup's strategy or business model.Corbat said Citigroup will spend more money on staff and information systems to upgrade its capital planning tools in time for the Fed's next annual review in early 2015. The spending will be funded through cost-cutting and productivity gains in other areas, he said.Costs have been a chronic problem for the company and Corbat has told executives reducing expenses is their number one priority. He said at Tuesday's meeting he recently gave executives six different sets of assignments to improve the company's business processes and eliminate unnecessary steps. The executives will give the board of directors a progress report this summer.O'Neill acknowledged that the Fed's rejection of the capital plan had made it virtually impossible for Citigroup to meet a key performance goal set last year of delivering 2015 profits amounting to 10 percent of tangible common equity. O'Neill said he still believes the company is capable of that level of return but did not say when it could be reached. ""I have a lot of confidence in Mike and his management team,"" O'Neill said in the meeting. The chairman was the key force on the board in October 2012 in pushing out then-CEO Vikram Pandit and replacing him with Corbat, now 53.O'Neill said, however, he expects directors will factor into Corbat's and other executives' pay this year their failure to win approval of the capital plan.The company said 84.6 percent of shareholders had endorsed the company's executive pay for 2013, by a preliminary count, down from 92 percent shareholder approval a year ago.

152,"  (Adds details on possible bidders, share price and comment from minority shareholder)By Peter Maushagen, Tim Hepher and Sagarika JaisinghaniFRANKFURT/PARIS May 5 German aircraft seating maker Recaro is looking at buying assets from B/E Aerospace  after the U.S. company announced a surprise review that could lead to a shakeup of the $3 billion cabins industry.Florida-based B/E Aerospace on Sunday postponed Monday's investor meeting and said it has hired Citigroup Inc  advisers to explore options, including a possible sale, merger or spinoff of the company or selected businesses.The statement came less than two weeks after the company reported a record quarter for new orders amid rising demand for wide-bodied jets, and said it was looking at two potential aerospace acquisitions and had completed a third.Analysts said the review could lead to a break-up of the 26-year-old company, which has grown through more than two dozen acquisitions to become one of the largest makers of aircraft seats, with a leading role in the parts distribution chain.Asked in Frankfurt whether Recaro Aircraft Seating was interested in buying any assets from B/E Aerospace, Chief Executive Mark Hiller told reporters: ""We are looking into it"".B/E shares jumped around 10 percent in early U.S. trading on Monday to $97.99.In Paris, B/E's closest rival in the seats market, Zodiac Aerospace, declined to comment. Its shares were down 1.2 percent, slightly lagging a weaker overall market.""Zodiac cannot be considered a potential bidder on the deal in our view,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christophe Menard.Given B/E Aerospace's $9 billion market value, ""an acquisition in full of the company could only be carried out by a much larger player in aerospace,"" he said in a note.But several of the large companies that could bid for all or part of B/E Aerospace appeared already occupied with other acquisition strategies.General Electric Co said last week that its $13.5 billion offer for the power business of France's Alstom  would effectively fill its allotment for acquisitions through next year, while the company's aviation division is focused predominantly on manufacturing jet engines. At United Technologies Corp analysts have said recently that the diversified manufacturer is more likely to focus on deals to boost its commercial building businesses, which sell elevators and climate control systems, than on aerospace.On United Technologies' earnings call last month, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said the idea of striking a big deal this year was very unlikely.Honeywell International Inc said in March that it was planning for $10 billion in deals through 2018 as part of its five-year financial plan. That deal value would more than double what Honeywell spent in the previous five years on acquisitions, but the spending was expected to be spread across the whole company, not just the aerospace division, which works primarily on electrical and mechanical systems.Avionics maker Rockwell Collins took on significant debt recently to buy Arinc, whose computer networks help flight crew navigation. That may limit its ability to do a big deal.Spokesmen for GE, United Technologies, Honeywell and Rockwell declined to comment.A bid from within the industry for the seats business would have to overcome competition hurdles, with Zodiac and B/E controlling around 70 percent of the market between them. Buying assets from B/E Aerospace could help Recaro, a family run firm, to expand in the lucrative market for premium seating. Recaro says it is the market leader for economy seats, but wants to expand its grip on profitable premium seats.On Monday, the unlisted German company reported sales of 337 million euros for 2013 and said it was aiming to reach 600 million in 2018, not including the effects of any acquisitions.BREAK-UP TALK B/E Aerospace makes lavatories for the Boeing 737 and galleys for the Airbus A350, as well as seats and oxygen units. It also has a spare parts distribution business.The company made just over half its 2013 revenue of $3.48 billion from commercial aircraft, with about a third coming from consumables management, as the spare parts business is known. Consumables management is the slowest-growing part of the company. The rest of B/E Aerospace's revenue comes from luxury fittings for business jets. In 2008, B/E Aerospace bought the consumables distribution business of Honeywell for $1 billion to create what it describes as the world's largest distributor of fasteners or specialist bolts, operating in a market estimated at $4.5 billion a year.Most analysts said a sale was most likely to work if B/E Aerospace split the interiors business from distribution. And several researchers, including Oppenheimer, said the abrupt weekend announcement suggested talks were already under way.B/E Aerospace shares have risen 40 percent in the past year. In midday trading in New York the stock was up 10.8 percent at $98.60.Several brokers raised their price targets to as much as $121, while noting aerospace acquisitions are looking expensive as commercial suppliers ride a wave of orders and increases in production.B/E Aerospace shares trade at 19.1 times this year's forecast earnings, compared with an average multiple of 16.3 for its industry peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.The company, which has net debt of $1.6 billion, has an enterprise value of 11.6 times its forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, giving it a premium over the sector average of 10.2, according to the data.Scott Thompson, who heads PricewaterhouseCoopers' aerospace and defence coverage, said the announcement from B/E underscored growing interest in acquisition and mergers.""We see things heating up,"" said Thompson, who put out a study last week predicting increased M&A activity this year.B/E management likely has a clear idea of what they can get for the company, and is in a strong position having posted robust earnings in a market ripe with potential investors, said George Young, a partner at St. Denis J. Villere & Co LLC, which owns about 2 percent of the company.He's hoping for a deal priced at the top end of broker targets.""If it's less than $120 per share, then I would be somewhat disappointed,"" Young said.

153,"  (Removes stray characters in headline. No changes to text)By Barani KrishnanNEW YORK May 7 Two-thirds of commodity hedge funds lost money in the first quarter, extending last year's dismal run, possibly because they bet against higher crop and energy prices in a rallying market, data from futures broker Newedge and banker HSBC showed on Wednesday.Of some 120 commodity-focused funds in the United States and Europe that either trade on discretion or follow trends, about 70 finished lower in the three months through March, despite a run-up in the corn, wheat, soybean, arabica coffee, lean hog and natural gas markets, the data showed.That was in contrast to results from investment banks such as Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Group Ltd, which showed strong gains from commodities in the first quarter as the firms traded in or hedged against higher gas prices for their clients during a brutal winter. The trading desks of some oil companies, including BP Plc, also reported good returns.The funds listed by Newedge and HSBC could have missed out on gains by going short on markets as the polar vortex across the United States swept energy, power and grains prices higher. Some of the funds also had investor redemptions, extending outflows last year.London's Armajaro Commodities Fund, run by Armajaro Asset Management, had a drop in capital of nearly 25 percent to below $700 million during the first quarter, Newedge's Nelson Report on alternative investment funds showed.Krom River Commodity Fund in Baar, Switzerland lost 20 percent of its assets, to below $230 million, in the quarter, according to HSBC's HedgeWeekly data. Both funds confirmed with Reuters they had redemptions.The woeful performance of the many commodity hedge funds could alienate investors even as raw materials prices continue rising, analysts said. Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index , which tracks 19 commodity markets, rose 9 percent during the quarter for its best three months since Sept 2012.""The reality is commodities remain one of the most hated places in the investment space,"" said Marcus Storr, head of hedge funds at Feri, an asset manager in Bad Homburg, Germany, managing $24 billion euros of mostly institutional client money. ""In general, since 2012 and through 2013, the commodities hedge fund space has lost quite a lot of money.""The best performing commodity fund for the first quarter on the Newedge's Nelson Report was London-based Cumulus Energy, a $490 million discretionary-based fund, which posted a return of more than 20 percent. Cumulus, run by City Financial Investment Co, declined comment.The largest commodity fund on the Nelson report, the $1.8 billion trend-following Gresham Tangible Asset Program in New York, returned nearly 5 percent for the quarter. It was one of the few funds that appeared to have asset growth during the period, with its capital rising from $1.66 billion in December.Jon Spencer, president of Gresham Investment Management LLC, confirmed the fund did well, but declined further comment.On HSBC's Hedge Weekly, the $134 million Merchant Commodity Fund, which trades out of London, was the best performing commodity fund, returning more than 10 percent for the quarter. Merchant gained from being long on natural gas and U.S. crude oil, and short on coal and U.K. Brent crude, its Singapore-based risk manager Michael Coleman told Reuters.

158,"  (Repeats story published Wednesday; no changes to text)By Swati PandeySYDNEY May 14 Australia and New Zealand Banking Corp pulled off a major coup on Wednesday by poaching a senior Citigroup executive with extensive experience in Asia, where it has been bolstering its presence in recent years.Farhan Faruqui's appointment to head up international banking from Hong Kong is the latest in a string of appointments by ANZ designed to boost growth in Asia at a time when it is reshuffling its organisational structure and exiting non-performing investments.Faruqui's appointment follows that of Sameer Sahwney who became the head of global banking for international and institutional banking this April. Both report to Andrew Géczy who was appointed CEO of ANZ's international and institutional banking late last year.ANZ first announced its ""super regional strategy"" in 2007/08 to step up income from outside Australia, but made slower-than-expected progress, missing its own initial five-year targets.The business has since grown, but driving revenues faster and improving investor returns remain key challenges in ANZ's push to become a major regional player amid stringent capital rules and growing competition. ""We have seen returns inching lower in recent periods and this is a banking market which is well contested. So, certainly there is a growth-return trade-off,"" James Ellis, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse said.ANZ's Asia business posted a 40 percent growth in net profit at $455 million in the first half of the year ending in September. Its Asian share of institutional banking has risen to 27 percent from 14 percent four years ago.It expects to see return on equity (ROE) at 16 percent by 2016 from 15.5 percent now, raising scepticism from both investors and analysts about its ability to achieve that target as margins shrink.In a recent presentation, ANZ said it was focussed on geographies offering scale and increasing its product mix as it looks to leverage itself as a trade bank. At home, ANZ also has a retail presence. ASIA GROWTH ANZ exited a partnership in Vietnam in 2012 and may exit stakes in Cambodia and Indonesia as it looks to own 100 percent of the business rather than small stakes to improve investor returns. The strategy, which aims to capture booming Asian growth, trade and investment flows, differentiates ANZ from its peers in Australia, although analysts say it was too soon to compare it with Standard Chartered, HSBC and Citi - who already derive most of their income from Asia.Géczy told Reuters that the bank will take advantage of strong trade flows and foreign investments into Asia.""What I aspire to do with the organization structure that I've created and the appointments that followed on is to derive on getting delivery of our strategy and to make it come alive,"" Géczy said by phone.ANZ shares have gained almost 13 percent since Géczy took over in September, better than its local rivals and outperforming the benchmark index, Citi, Standard Chartered and HSBC.""I think the business is progressing. There is a concern that it's capital intensive, it requires a lot of capital support, but the last results showed they are doing okay,"" said John Buonaccorsi, banking analyst with CIMB.(Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-05-14,C,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 5:57pm EDT",RPT-ANZ lands senior Citigroup exec for Asia expansion,http://www.reuters.com//article/australia-anz-banking-grp-asia-idUSL3N0O06AM20140514?type=companyNews

Citigroup has discovered some $565 million in loans linked to fraud at Banamex, suffered losses on loans made to homebuilders in Mexico, and fired a pair of rogue traders at the unit.Banamex faces a U.S. criminal investigation of possible violations of money-laundering laws, a source has told Reuters, as well as probes by U.S. and Mexican authorities into the fraudulent loans.The latest firings included employees across business lines, Chief Executive Michael Corbat said in the memo. Of the four managing directors let go, two were business heads in Mexico. Further disciplinary action could be taken against other employees both inside and outside of Mexico as the investigation continues, according to the memo.A source close to the matter said that the executives fired in Mexico include the local business head of the bank's treasury and trade solutions group, and officials in corporate banking and risk management. The person declined to name them.Citi said in late February it had discovered some $400 million in fraudulent loans at Banamex, prompting the bank to reduce its 2013 profit by $235 million. The bad loans were made to Mexican oil services company Oceanografia OCNGR.UL, a contractor for Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex PEMX.UL. Oceanografia appeared to have falsified invoices to Pemex that were used as collateral for loans from Banamex, Corbat said in a memo to employees in February.Mexican officials had raised questions about Oceanografia before. In February Pemex suspended the company from receiving government contracts for 21 months and 12 days. Later that month, Mexican authorities seized Oceanografia's assets and named an administrator to salvage the remaining business.A spokesman for the Mexican government entity administering Oceanografia declined to comment on Wednesday on the invoices.

162,"   By Nia Williams | CALGARY, Alberta  CALGARY, Alberta May 14 Citigroup Inc  plans to start trading physical Canadian crude oil, three sources have told Reuters, setting itself up to jockey with banks and traders to fill the vacuum left by other Wall Street giants offloading physical commodity businesses.Three participants in the Canadian crude market, who declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media, said Citi is in the process of preparing for physical trading of the most liquid Canadian grades.That would likely include Western Canada Select heavy blend , the de facto Canadian benchmark, as well as sweet grades.A spokesman for Citi declined to comment.Citi's expansion into the physical market bucks the recent trend of big U.S. banks retreating from commodities trading as tighter government regulations eat into profits.JPMorgan Chase & Co is preparing to sell its physical commodities business, including a collection of long-term leases on more than 6 million barrels of storage tanks in Hardisty, Alberta.Morgan Stanley is selling its global physical oil trading business, including its Canadian division, to Russian state-run oil company Rosneft. ""There has been this negative attention but it seems there's still space to maneuver and to operate profitably, and to serve the needs of their clients,"" said Raymond James analyst Daniel Marchon. ""Citi would not be getting into this if it was not important to their institutional clients.""Citi is seeking to rebuild its commodities trading operations, which focus on power and gas, after scaling back its exposure to energy, metals and agricultural markets following a government bailout during the world economic crisis.In Canada, Citi would compete with big commodity merchants like Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura, as well as oil producers like Suncor and Cenovus.The bank's revenue from commodities transactions nearly doubled in the first quarter of 2014 year-over-year. Last year Citi was No. 10 among the world's top 10 investment banks in commodities according to UK consulting firm Coalition. The top 10 banks together made $4.5 billion trading commodities in 2013, Coalition said, down from more than $14 billion in 2008.BARRIERS TO ENTRY Canadian crude production is expected to more than double to 6.7 million barrels per day by 2030, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, making the physical market a potentially lucrative source of trading revenue. However, the volatility of the market, with WCS discounted at $10 to $40 a barrel below U.S. benchmark crude futures last year, deters some new entrants.The risk required can be a deterrent, said one of the traders, speaking from Canada's oil capital, Calgary. He said new entrants need access to credit lines and at least 10 to 15 counterparties willing to do business with them.New entrants also face challenges in attracting business as people need to determine ""whether they want to take a risk in doing business with you,"" he added.For a bank like Citi, already well-known for trading financial crude contracts and physical barrels in the U.S. oil market, counterparty credit is a minor issue.However, a sticking point could emerge over what general terms and conditions govern trading. One source said industry standard is either BP Plc's or ConocoPhillips'  terms and conditions because they have been around a long time and are seen as the most fair to both buyers and sellers.If Citi insists on counterparties signing up to the bank's own proprietary terms and conditions, setting up trading partners may be a struggle.None of the sources were able to say whether Citi had entered into talks to buy or lease storage space, which enables market players to ride out the more volatile price swings often caused by heavy congestion on export pipelines out of Canada. The exact timing of the launch is not yet known.

163,"   By Swati Pandey | SYDNEY  SYDNEY May 14 Australia and New Zealand Banking Corp pulled off a major coup on Wednesday by poaching a senior Citigroup executive with extensive experience in Asia, where it has been bolstering its presence in recent years.Farhan Faruqui's appointment to head up international banking from Hong Kong is the latest in a string of appointments by ANZ designed to boost growth in Asia at a time when it is reshuffling its organisational structure and exiting non-performing investments.Faruqui's appointment follows that of Sameer Sahwney who became the head of global banking for international and institutional banking this April. Both report to Andrew Géczy who was appointed CEO of ANZ's international and institutional banking late last year.ANZ first announced its ""super regional strategy"" in 2007/08 to step up income from outside Australia, but made slower-than-expected progress, missing its own initial five-year targets.The business has since grown, but driving revenues faster and improving investor returns remain key challenges in ANZ's push to become a major regional player amid stringent capital rules and growing competition.""We have seen returns inching lower in recent periods and this is a banking market which is well contested. So, certainly there is a growth-return trade-off,"" James Ellis, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse said. ANZ's Asia business posted a 40 percent growth in net profit at $455 million in the first half of the year ending in September. Its Asian share of institutional banking has risen to 27 percent from 14 percent four years ago.It expects to see return on equity (ROE) at 16 percent by 2016 from 15.5 percent now, raising scepticism from both investors and analysts about its ability to achieve that target as margins shrink.In a recent presentation, ANZ said it was focussed on geographies offering scale and increasing its product mix as it looks to leverage itself as a trade bank. At home, ANZ also has a retail presence. ASIA GROWTH ANZ exited a partnership in Vietnam in 2012 and may exit stakes in Cambodia and Indonesia as it looks to own 100 percent of the business rather than small stakes to improve investor returns. The strategy, which aims to capture booming Asian growth, trade and investment flows, differentiates ANZ from its peers in Australia, although analysts say it was too soon to compare it with Standard Chartered, HSBC and Citi - who already derive most of their income from Asia.Géczy told Reuters that the bank will take advantage of strong trade flows and foreign investments into Asia.""What I aspire to do with the organization structure that I've created and the appointments that followed on is to derive on getting delivery of our strategy and to make it come alive,"" Géczy said by phone.ANZ shares have gained almost 13 percent since Géczy took over in September, better than its local rivals and outperforming the benchmark index, Citi, Standard Chartered and HSBC.""I think the business is progressing. There is a concern that it's capital intensive, it requires a lot of capital support, but the last results showed they are doing okay,"" said John Buonaccorsi, banking analyst with CIMB.(Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-05-14,C,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 3:36am EDT",ANZ lands senior Citigroup exec for Asia expansion,http://www.reuters.com//article/australia-anz-banking-grp-asia-idUSL3N0O02YY20140514?type=companyNews

167,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO May 19 Greenhill & Co Inc and other global boutique investment firms are moving into Brazil, aiming to take advantage of strong mergers and acquisitions activity by poaching clients and deals from big-name banks.Wealthy Brazilian investors such as retail tycoon Abilio Diniz and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, who controls drug and beauty care products maker Hypermarcas SA, are increasingly tapping boutiques to oversee some deals and help them find potential investment opportunities locally and abroad.Worried about potential conflicts of interest with banks that act as both lenders and advisors, more Brazilian companies are turning to boutiques to help with cross-border takeovers and debt restructurings.Major banks often seek top-notch deals as a springboard to selling loans, derivatives and other products while boutiques  provide tailor-made advisory services.The number of Brazilian takeovers involving boutiques has risen almost 20 percent since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data.BR Partners Banco de Investimento SA, led by star dealmaker Ricardo Lacerda, has advised on more than 80 transactions worth $35 billion in the period, with Rothschild increasingly beating the largest investment banks for mandates for share offerings, M&A and debt restructurings.""Ours is a competitive business everywhere in the world and Brazil is no exception,"" said Scott L. Bok, Greenhill's chief executive. ""History in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere shows that clients will increasingly turn for advice to firms that are focused solely on advising clients rather than selling them many financial products.""Greenhill set up shop in Brazil in October, confident that the outlook for deals would remain attractive despite a sluggish economy. It says it also wants to advise companies preparing IPOs.Moelis & Co, a New York-based firm that recently listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, opened an office in São Paulo in March. Industry sources told Reuters that Jefferies Group LLC and Centerview Partners Holdings LP, also based in New York, are exploring options to enter Brazil, either by setting up shop or through a partnership with a local peer. Both firms declined to comment.Brazil is catching up with a global trend that began during the 2008 financial crisis in which independent advisors snatch market share from the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Since 2009, at least five independent firms have ranked in the top 20 advisors in Brazil M&A league tables.Boutiques were also involved in 75 percent of the top 20 takeover deals in the United States last year.Still, newcomers to Brazil face a challenging market as rivals fight for talent and a bigger share of a shrinking fee pool. Since 2010, total investment-banking fees slipped from $1 billion to about $800 million as flagging initial public offerings offset a rise in the number of M&A transactions.""Newcomers must have enough scale to create deal flow and, especially, structure more intelligent deals to be profitable,"" said Ricardo Mollo, a corporate finance professor at Insper, a São Paulo business school. ""Not everyone will be in a position to do that - only sustainable structures with the best banker roster and best global connections may make it."" GOLDMAN RETREATS So-called bulge-bracket banks like Goldman, Deutsche Bank AG  and Barclays Plc have scaled back in Brazil as four years of weak economic growth put a damper on the market.Sources say Goldman cut its roster of investment bankers in Brazil to below 20 from 45 a year ago, while Barclays and Deutsche Bank trimmed their research, sales and trading staff. But big banks are not the only competitors the newcomers face in Brazil. They also have to contend with well-established boutiques that got here first.Rothschild, the Britain-based bank that has been the most active independent advisor in Brazil for the past decade, BR Partners, G5 Evercore Partners and Lazard Ltd have all  carved out a niche in recent years.Big global banks including Credit Suisse Group AG  and Goldman tend to shy away from the middle-market M&A deals where boutiques thrive. But Brazil's homegrown investment banks, namely Itaú BBA and Bradesco BBI, could be tempted to target that niche if large takeovers drop off, Insper's Mollo said.Advisory fees for mid-sized M&A transactions can reach over 2 percent versus about 1 percent for the largest ones, industry sources said. This year, 15.2 percent of Brazil's M&A fee pool went to independent advisors, up from 9 percent in 2009, data from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting showed.Conscious of the need to have well-known bankers leading their local units, Greenhill and Moelis sought out heavyweight dealmakers.Last year, Greenhill hired Daniel Wainstein, a former chairman of Goldman's investment banking unit in Brazil. It also brought in another former Goldman banker as managing director, Rodrigo Mello, and plans to hire a senior vice president, a vice president, a few junior associates and analysts for its advisory operation by July, Wainstein said in an interview.Moelis, for its part, hired Otávio Guazzelli, Jório Salgado-Gama and Erick Alberti from BR Partners. Prior to their stint at BR Partners, the three were part of Citigroup Inc's  investment-banking unit in Brazil.The independent advisors could also seek to win mandates in share offerings, an area where banks use financing as a way to obtain businesses.Rothschild and BR Partners have participated in a series of those deals in Brazil in recent years. Rothschild was a leading advisor in Cia de Bebibas das Americas SA's transition from a dual-stock to a single stock regime, the largest ever corporate restructuring in Brazil. BR Partners had a role in Via Varejo SA's $1 billion follow-on offering last December.    (Additional reporting by Matthew G.

Representatives of Healogics, CD&R, Metalmark and TPG declined to comment, while representatives of Ares and Leonard Green did not respond to requests for comment.Jacksonville, Florida-based Healogics and its affiliated companies partner with more than 550 hospitals in the United States to provide wound care services and treat about 200,000 patients annually, according to its website. Reuters reported in January that Metalmark had tapped Goldman Sachs Group Inc to explore a sale of Healogics. In 2011, Healogics was created with the merger of two companies - National Healing Corp and Diversified Clinical Services. Metalmark received a majority equity stake in the combined company by buying Diversified Clinical Services from another private equity firm, The Jordan Company. Metalmark had acquired a majority stake in National Healing in 2008.The potential sale of Healogics underscores private equity's  interest in wound care. Large industry peer Kinetic Concepts Inc, a maker of medical devices used in wound care, was taken private in 2011 for $6.3 billion by a consortium comprised of Apax Partners LLP and Canadian pension funds.Citigroup Inc divested New York-based Metalmark last year as the bank sought to comply with the Volcker rule, which limits investment bank investments in illiquid asset classes.

176,"  NEW YORK Citigroup Inc may finally be able to sell its OneMain Financial personal loan business later this year, CEO Mike Corbat said on Thursday.Corbat, speaking at an investor conference in New York, said Citigroup could dispose of the company through an outright sale to a private equity firm, a public stock offering, or a combination of the two, if prices are good.Citigroup, the third biggest U.S. bank by assets, has wanted to unload the business since shortly after the financial crisis but has been unwilling to let it go for the prices offered, he said.

179,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Sarah N. Lynch | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON A federal appeals court on Wednesday handed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a big victory by voiding a judge's pathbreaking decision to reject the regulator's $285 million fraud settlement with Citigroup Inc (C.N).The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff abused his discretion in scuttling the civil accord, saying he failed to give ""significant deference"" to the SEC and was wrong to require the regulator to show the ""truth"" of what it alleged.Rakoff had objected to the SEC's decades-old policy of letting some corporate defendants settle without admitting or denying its charges.The decision makes it more likely the Citigroup accord will win approval, and lawyers said it may make it easier for the SEC to decide on its own how best to enforce securities laws, as well as win settlements without worrying that judges may reject them because of a lack of proven facts.Writing for the 2nd Circuit, Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler said it was ""an abuse of discretion to require, as the district court did here, that the SEC establish the 'truth' of the allegations against a settling party as a condition for approving the consent decree. ""The district court's failure to make the proper inquiry constitutes legal error,"" she added.Rakoff’s November 2011 rejection of the Citigroup settlement, which concerned a 2007 sale of mortgage-linked securities debt that caused more than $700 million of estimated investor losses, is credited with altering the public debate over SEC settlements that lack admissions of wrongdoing. It prompted other federal judges to scrutinize several similar accords closely. Last June, citing the need for public accountability, SEC Chair Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor, adopted a policy of requiring admissions in certain major cases. Rakoff must now review the Citigroup settlement again unless he pursues an appeal. One judge on the 2nd Circuit panel, Raymond Lohier, said he would have ordered Rakoff to approve the accord. Circuit Judge Susan Carney was also on the panel.In an email, Rakoff said: ""I don't think it's appropriate to comment.""Andrew Ceresney, chief of the SEC enforcement division, said he was pleased with the decision. He said the SEC will continue to seek admissions of wrongdoing when appropriate, but that settlements lacking them can also serve the public interest by returning money to harmed investors more quickly.Citigroup Spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to comment. REBUKE The decision is a rebuke to Rakoff, who in two decades on the bench has earned a reputation as a brilliant, iconoclastic judge.Rakoff has also been a thorn for the SEC, having in 2009 rejected as a slap on the wrist its original accord with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) over the bank's purchase of Merrill Lynch.Wednesday's decision could affect several other pending cases, and may make it easier for the SEC to win approval of its $602 million insider trading accord with a unit of billionaire Steven A. Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors LP. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in April 2013 conditioned approval of that accord on the outcome of the Citigroup case. Michael Klausner, a Stanford Law School professor, said upholding Rakoff's ruling could have strained SEC resources by forcing many more trials, even as it raised public awareness of a need to hold Wall Street accountable. The SEC has recently had a mixed trial record in big cases.""Rakoff has made a point,"" he said. ""But I don't think it is feasible in very many cases in the enforcement regime.""PRAGMATISM Citigroup's settlement was meant to resolve claims that the bank misled investors in 2007 about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation, Class V Funding III, and simultaneously bet against the debt as the U.S. housing market began to falter.Rakoff rejected the accord as neither fair, nor adequate, nor in the public interest, saying the ""neither admit nor deny"" policy left him no facts on which to judge the settlement. Pooler, however, said such fact-finding should be left for  trials, while ""consent decrees are primarily about pragmatism.""The SEC did go to trial against former Citigroup manager Brian Stoker, the only individual sued over the CDO, but a jury in July 2012 found him not liable.James Cox, a Duke University law professor who signed a court brief urging that Rakoff be upheld, said the 2nd Circuit decision gives the SEC too much leeway to settle cases, while allowing judges like Rakoff some freedom not to be ""rubber stamps"" for settlements they don't like.""I don't think it will dampen his resolve at all,"" Cox said.The 2nd Circuit adopted a new standard for reviewing settlements with U.S. enforcement agencies that involve injunctive relief.It said judges must assess whether such accords are fair and reasonable, and whether the public interest ""would not be disserved."" The court said an SEC settlement of this type must have a ""basic legality,"" must be clear, must resolve the underlying claims and not be tainted by collusion or corruption.The 2nd Circuit invited Rakoff to ask the SEC and Citigroup, if needed, to provide more evidence that there was no collusion.Under White, the SEC has extracted several admissions of wrongdoing, including from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) over its $6.2 billion trading loss in London, and from billionaire Philip Falcone over transactions at his hedge fund firm.In early 2012, under White's predecessor Mary Schapiro, the SEC decided to stop allowing settling defendants to neither admit nor deny its charges when they admit guilt in related U.S. Department of Justice criminal cases.The case is SEC v.

181,"   By Tracy Rucinski  and Ana Isabel Martinez | MADRID/MEXICO CITY  MADRID/MEXICO CITY Mexico's state oil giant Pemex said it has sold most of its stake in Spain's Repsol SA for 2.09 billion euros ($2.9 billion) on Wednesday, and plans to unload the rest soon, ending a quarter-century partnership and freeing up cash to invest in its own energy sector.Pemex [PEMX.UL] sold 7.86 percent of Repsol to unspecified private investors at 20.10 euros each, a 3.7 percent discount to the Spanish company's closing price on Tuesday. The Mexican company later said it aimed to sell its remaining 1.4 percent stake in Repsol in August.Pemex's exit as one of Repsol's (REP.MC) top three shareholders ends a relationship that had become increasingly fractious in recent years due to disagreements on policies ranging from top management to the handling of Repsol investments in Argentina.Pemex had publicly criticized Repsol Chairman Antonio Brufau's compensation and management, in particular his handling of the Argentine government's move to nationalize Repsol's YPF unit. The Mexican company sought to oust Brufau in 2011.Tensions reached breaking point last month when Brufau appointed a chief executive officer whom Pemex had not endorsed.""The decision to end the Repsol investment is due to the low profitability of the shares obtained by the current administration compared with other oil firms and our differences on its corporate governance,"" Pemex said in a statement.Pemex said it had made a more than $900 million gain on its decades-long investment. Repsol said in a statement that Pemex had resigned from its board seat.The sale comes five days before Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto makes his first official visit to Spain and as the Latin American country is putting an end to the oil and gas production monopoly Pemex has had since 1938. Two sources close to the matter said that the books were not covered, leaving bookrunners Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) holding an unspecified number of shares.     Separately, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA.L) declared a 5.37 percent stake in Repsol worth 1.4 billion euros on Tuesday, becoming the oil firm's fourth-largest shareholder behind lender CaixaBank SA (CABK.MC), builder Sacyr SA (SCYR.MC) and Singapore's Temasek Holdings Ltd [TEM.UL].    Shares in Repsol closed 3.62 percent lower on Wednesday at 20.11 euros, ending around the price of the placement.Shares in Repsol have risen less than 30 percent since the end of October 2004, when Brufau took over, compared with a more than 130 percent increase in the NYSE Arca Oil Index .XOI of leading oil companies.Pemex Chief Financial Officer Mario Beauregard said the company would look to sell its remaining shares in due course. ""Once this financing is complete, we'll look for the best market conditions to get rid of the remaining position,"" he said. The plan was to sell the shares in August, Beauregard said, confirming what company sources had earlier told Reuters.Pemex said it would remain open to making investments in other companies if opportunities arose.NO TEARS     Repsol analysts welcomed the departure of Pemex, saying it should help ease boardroom tensions at Repsol and allow Brufau to focus on acquisition plans.    ""We believe that this gives Repsol management a free rein to decide on the next strategic steps for the company,"" Exane BNP Paribas analyst Alejandro Demichelis said.  Repsol has raised $6.3 billion from its exit from Argentina after that country seized the oil major's YPF unit in 2012. It could spend part of the funds boosting growth at its upstream business, with a search for cash-generating oil assets.It will also pay a 1 euro-per-share special dividend with part of the Argentine proceeds on June 6.After being left with a significant Repsol holding, Citi and Deutsche Bank said in a regulatory filing a ""guarantee"" on the deal had come into effect, without giving details on what type.Deutsche Bank and Citigroup declined to comment.

188,"  (Adds comment by Los Angeles city attorney, paragraph 13)By Dena AubinJune 9 A lawsuit by the City of Los Angeles accusing Citigroup Inc of mortgage discrimination can go forward, a federal judge ruled on Monday, turning down the bank's motion to dismiss the case stemming from last decade's real estate boom.The lawsuit, filed in December, accuses Citigroup of engaging in a ""continuous pattern"" of discrimination since at least 2004 by targeting minorities for high-cost mortgage loans, violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act. The city is seeking damages from the bank for the costs of extra services and lost tax revenue in blighted neighborhoods.Citigroup is one of four banks that Los Angeles has sued since December for allegedly giving minorities home loans they could not afford, resulting in a wave of foreclosures and a lower tax base.Lawyers for Citigroup had challenged the city's right to sue, saying it had not offered specific or concrete details of harm. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright said a loss of tax revenue and increased spending on services in blighted neighborhoods was a sufficient injury to allow the city to sue.A Citigroup spokesman said the bank remained confident it would ultimately prevail in the case.""This is not a ruling on the facts in the case, and we continue to believe the suit is without merit,"" spokesman Mark Rodgers said. ""Citi is proud of its deep commitment to make sure our lending standards are fair to all of our customers,"" he said.Filed in Los Angeles federal court, the lawsuit said Citi issued high-cost loans to minorities, then refused to refinance the loans later on the same terms it extended to white borrowers, resulting in defaults. Loans in predominantly minority neighborhoods were 4.8 times more likely to end in foreclosure than loans in predominantly white neighborhoods, the lawsuit said.A typical foreclosure costs local governments more than $19,000 for safety inspections, police and fire calls and maintenance, the lawsuit said.

189,"   By Dena Aubin | June 9  June 9 A lawsuit by the City of Los Angeles accusing Citigroup Inc of mortgage discrimination can go forward, a federal judge ruled on Monday, turning down the bank's motion to dismiss the case stemming from last decade's real estate boom.The lawsuit, filed in December, accuses Citigroup of engaging in a ""continuous pattern"" of discrimination since at least 2004 by targeting minorities for high-cost mortgage loans, violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act. The city is seeking damages from the bank for the costs of extra services and lost tax revenue in blighted neighborhoods.Citigroup is one of four banks that Los Angeles has sued since December for allegedly giving minorities home loans they could not afford, resulting in a wave of foreclosures and a lower tax base.Lawyers for Citigroup had challenged the city's right to sue, saying it had not offered specific or concrete details of harm.U.S. District Judge Otis Wright said a loss of tax revenue and increased spending on services in blighted neighborhoods was a sufficient injury to allow the city to sue. A Citigroup spokesman said the bank remained confident it would ultimately prevail in the case.""This is not a ruling on the facts in the case, and we continue to believe the suit is without merit,"" spokesman Mark Rodgers said. ""Citi is proud of its deep commitment to make sure our lending standards are fair to all of our customers,"" he said.Lawyers for Los Angeles could not immediately be reached for comment.Filed in Los Angeles federal court, the lawsuit said Citi issued high-cost loans to minorities, then refused to refinance the loans later on the same terms it extended to white borrowers, resulting in defaults. Loans in predominantly minority neighborhoods were 4.8 times more likely to end in foreclosure than loans in predominantly white neighborhoods, the lawsuit said.A typical foreclosure costs local governments more than $19,000 for safety inspections, police and fire calls and maintenance, the lawsuit said. Banks should repay such costs when they are caused by discriminatory lending, it said.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan  were hit with similar lawsuits by the city.

190,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Large U.S. banks are finding the billions of dollars they paid in recent years to settle lawsuits and fix broken businesses are coming back to haunt them in another place: their capital requirements.Under the new global rules known as ""Basel III,"" banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) must hold more capital to account for potential losses from trading scandals, regulatory probes and related issues.Regulators are concerned that such potential problems, known as ""operational risk,"" can be severe enough to hobble banks. In recent tests, the Federal Reserve estimated that losses from operational risk and related problems reduced earnings during a period of market turmoil by about a third.""It speaks volumes that some of the most significant losses banks have sustained in the last several years were attributable not to the loans they made but rather to lapses in operational risk management and the ensuing legal judgments, regulatory fines and reputational damage,"" the U.S. comptroller of the currency, Thomas Curry, said in a speech last month.These losses have come at most big banks: JPMorgan Chase lost over $6 billion on bad derivatives trades in 2012; large mortgage lenders have struggled to foreclose on homes because they could not find critical paperwork; and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has agreed to pay over $50 billion in crisis-related legal settlements.Although Basel III rules were finalized for U.S. banks last year, they are still coming to grips with the level of capital they need to set aside after U.S. regulators in February said eight big U.S. banks can use their own models to determine the riskiness of their assets and operations.For individual banks, the extra capital can be enormous. Regulators told JPMorgan Chase it needed to hold over $30 billion in capital to offset operational risk exposures, almost four times the level it needed in 2010 and around twice the capital it holds for market risk, finance chief Marianne Lake said in February. That $30 billion is about 20 percent of the bank's current Basel III capital.Executives argue that regulators' demands are excessive. Bank of America finance chief Bruce Thompson told investors in April the bank received no capital relief from businesses it exited, like packaging and selling private-label mortgage bonds. People familiar with regulators' thinking said that even if banks have shed problematic businesses, they have often not addressed factors like poor oversight of employees or vendors that resulted in the losses.Higher capital requirements reduce profitability, encouraging banks to push their regulatory capital as low as possible. The U.S. government had to rescue banks during the financial crisis because many of them had insufficient capital.Fed officials fear that the banks' ability to use their own models allows them to understate risk, and instead they view the Fed's own test of how assets perform under stress as the main measure of safety.But the ""stress tests"" also account for operational risk. Even if the Fed shifts to another risk measure, banks will hold more capital to account for it. THE BIGGEST RISK For years most U.S. banks paid scant attention to operational risk because earlier versions of Basel neglected it. Additionally, such risks, like the possibility of a rogue trader, are highly unpredictable.""Operational risk is really a bear to model,"" said Mayra Rodriguez Valladares, managing principal of MRV Associates, a consulting firm.

192,"  (Recasts, add details, financial advisers, GP Investments' return, share performance)By Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier and Guillermo Parra-BernalPARIS/SAO PAULO, June 9 Michelin & Cie  agreed on Monday to buy Brazilian digital truck-fleet management company Sascar Participações SA for 440 million euros ($600 million) to tap into robust growth in the South American nation's truck industry.Michelin will assume Sascar's debt of about 80 million euros, the French company said in a presentation. The deal is subject to the approval of Brazilian authorities.The agreement comes three years after GP Investments Ltd, the largest Latin American private-equity firm, took control of Sascar, betting that car insurers, logistics firms and security risk managers would boost demand for monitoring services.Sascar earned 280 million reais ($126 million) in revenue last year, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization accounting for 37 percent of that and sales up 16 percent. Michelin, Europe's largest tire maker is expanding across emerging markets, where demand for vehicles and auto-related services should rise in coming years.""Michelin will benefit from the client base and human, technical and marketing skills built up by Sascar in the fast-growing telematics market for professional truck fleets,"" Jean-Dominique Senard, Michelin's chief executive officer, said in a statement.Sascar is Brazil's No. 1 fleet management firm with a 23 percent market share. Fleet management and monitoring is a fast-growing market in Brazil, where only 4 percent of vehicles are tracked. The industry is expected to grow an annual 15 percent over the next four years. Sao Paulo-based Sascar has 870 employees and manages 33,000 fleets totalling 190,000 trucks.In a separate statement, GP Investments said the sale of its 46 percent stake in Sascar earned it $260 million. The Sascar deal will generate a return for GP Investments equal to 2.6 times the amount originally invested, and an internal rate of return of 33 percent measured in U.S. dollars. Sascar's total enterprise value was estimated at 520 million euros. That means the company was priced at about 11 times projected operational earnings this year, compared with 14 to 19 times for similar companies.GP Investments hired Itaú BBA and Barclays Plc , the firm said in a statement. Citigroup Inc's  investment-banking unit advised Michelin on the deal.Shares of Michelin fell 0.7 percent to 91.84 euros on Monday.

195,"  * Alpha to buy Citi's Greek retail ops for 2 mln euros* Part of consolidation trend in industry* Citi says wants to focus on corporate clients   (Adds details)By George GeorgiopoulosATHENS, June 13 Alpha Bank, Greece's fourth-biggest lender by assets, said on Friday it had agreed to buy Citibank's loss-making retail operations in Greece for 2 million euros ($2.72 million), the latest deal in the sector's consolidation. Greece's debt crisis has hammered its banking industry, prompting foreign players, including Credit Agricole, Societe Generale and Portugal's Millennium bcp , to sell local units to Greek lenders in recent years.Hit by a sovereign debt restructuring and rising loan impairments during a deep six-year economic slump, the industry has consolidated down to four big players after a wave of acquisitions and the winding down of non-viable banks.The fortunes of National, Piraeus, Eurobank, and Alpha, which now control more than 90 percent of the banking market, have begun to improve after two recapitalisations and regained capital market access. On Friday Eurobank said it had hired five investment banks to arrange a possible bond sale, becoming the fourth Greek lender to tap international investors with a senior unsecured bond issue.Alpha's statement confirmed what banking sources told Reuters on Thursday about a deal for Citi's local retail operations. The Greek bank said the acquisition would contribute to its pre-provision income from the first year and improve liquidity ratios.The deal involves Citi's wealth management unit with 2.1 billion euros of client assets, including deposits of about 1 billion euros, credit card loan balances of 400 million euros and 20 retail branches.Citibank, which started shipping and corporate lending operations in Greece in 1964 and expanded into retail banking in the 1980s, said the sale was part of its strategy to divest non-core operations and focus on corporate and shipping clients.The sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2014. A total of about 730 Citi employees will be transferred to Alpha Bank.

197,"   By Sophie Sassard and Anjuli Davies | LONDON  LONDON London-listed drugmaker Shire has hired investment bank Citi as an adviser, expecting to receive takeover approaches following a wave of deals in the healthcare sector, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Much of the dealmaking has been fueled by U.S. companies seeking lower tax rates abroad. With its tax base in Ireland - where effective corporate tax rates are among the lowest in the world - and a mid-sized market value of around $35 billion, Shire could be a prime target, analysts and bankers believe. ""Something could happen this year,"" said one of the sources on condition of anonymity because the matter is private.Shire, which specializes in treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a range of rare diseases, was not immediately available to comment. Citi declined to comment.  Shire, which was founded in 1986 in Britain but conducts most of its business in the United States, has been domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008.It has already been approached by Botox-maker Allergan months before the U.S. group itself became a takeover target for Valeant, Reuters reported earlier this year. That approach did not lead to serious discussions between the two parties and there are currently no talks with Allergan, one source said.Shire is a relative rarity in being a mid-sized drugmaker with no controlling shareholder, making it a perennial subject of takeover speculation. Sector bankers think it could appeal to U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech firms such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, Abbvie, Gilead and Biogen.But Shire's reliance on ADHD drugs has put off potential bidders in the past, as using stimulants to treat ADHD in children is controversial in some doctors' eyes, they added. ADHD medicines account for around 40 percent of Shire’s sales. The firm also sells pricey drugs to treat rare genetic disorders and is building up a portfolio of treatments in ophthalmology and other speciality disease areas.The current imperative for major drugmakers to keep up with rivals in terms of a low tax rate and to use offshore cash that would otherwise be taxed punitively if brought back home, could now be changing the calculation, some industry watchers believe. INVERSION DEALS ""The benefits of lower taxation is a key M&A driver in this cross-border wave of U.S./EU healthcare deals,"" said one pharmaceuticals analyst on condition of anonymity. ""Shire would make another attractive target despite the fact that it is a niche business and sells amphetamines.""The race to strike so-called ""inversion"" deals offering lower tax rates was underscored at the weekend when U.S. medical device maker Medtronic agreed to buy Covidien for $42.9 billion and move its base to Ireland. Ireland is a particularly attractive destination for such transactions since it has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, compared with 35 percent in the United States.A Reuters review showed about 50 such inversion deals had been done in the past 25 years, with half occurring since the 2008-2009 financial crisis abated.""Any halfway decent, EU-based company will be looked at very seriously. The latest deals have upped the ante. The metric of purely strategic rationale has been put aside – anything is possible,"" said one sector banker, who added that two or three more possible inversion deals could happen soon. Some U.S. lawmakers are concerned the deals erode government revenue by giving corporations a tax-avoiding loophole. Two bills in the U.S. Congress and a White House proposal would make inversions harder to do, but neither has gained much traction. That could change if another major U.S. company or two tried to conduct inversions, tax lawyers and analysts said last week.U.S.-based Pfizer's $118 billion bid for British drugmaker AstraZeneca was rejected last month, scuppering what would have been the largest such inversion deal, but there is speculation talks may yet revive. Under British takeover law, the UK firm can approach Pfizer at the end of August to discuss a sweetened bid, or Pfizer can try again in November.

225,"  July 1 Citigroup Inc has bought Deutsche Bank AG's U.S. power trading books, the latest move by the U.S. bank to build its energy trading business as other Wall Street rivals retreat, two sources said on Tuesday.The sources said Deutsche sold two power trading books to Citi last week covering the ERCOT region in Texas and the East and Midcontinent.Citi has been building its commodities trading operations, which focus on power and natural gas, after scaling back its exposure to energy, metals and agricultural markets following a government bailout during the world economic crisis in the late 2000s.Citi's revenue from commodities transactions nearly doubled in the first quarter of 2014 year-over-year.Last year, Citi was No. 10 among the world's top 10 investment banks in commodities according to British consulting firm Coalition. In May, Reuters reported the bank will start trading physical Canadian crude oil and plans to grow its commodities trade finance business. Deutsche, Germany's largest bank which was one of the top-five financial players in commodities, said in December it will cease trading in energy, agriculture, base metals, coal and iron ore, retaining only precious metals and a limited number of financial derivatives traders, due to toughening regulations and diminished profits.The Deutsche sale to Citi as part of the closure of its energy trading business was first reported by trade journal SparkSpread. Officials at Deutsche and Citi declined comment.Since the financial crisis of the late 2000s, several banks like Deutsche have scaled back their exposure to U.S. power markets due in part to increased government regulation and market manipulation investigations. In January 2013, Deutsche settled with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for $1.7 million over allegations the bank's traders manipulated the California power market.Earlier this year, Deutsche initiated a sale of 17 books of commodities trading positions, including crude and refined products structured transactions; dry bulks; and mining finance, according to a marketing document, according to SparkSpread.Deutsche recently sold its European power & gas trading books to EDF Trading, a unit of Electricite de France SA , SparkSpread said earlier in June.

226,"  * Citi to sell more Eurobonds for Nigeria banks* Investors shrug off security and election risks* Citi growing in Africa's biggest economyBy Chijioke OhuochaLAGOS, July 2 Worsening security in Nigeria has not deterred foreign investors from buying its assets, Citigroup's country head said on Wednesday, citing $1.1 billion worth of Eurobonds it had traded for three local lenders so far this year.But any spread of attacks further south or to the commercial hub of Lagos could start to put even established investors off, Omar Hafeez told Reuters in an interview.A violent Islamist insurgency in Nigeria has killed hundreds this year, with the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by Boko Haram making world headlines in April and overshadowing the country's rise to overtake South Africa as the continent's top economy.Africa's top oil producer also faces polls in 2015 that are likely to be the most closely fought since the end of military rule in 1999, with many fearing political violence and rampant spending on patronage, as usually happens in election cycles. ""The investment community is very well informed ... Nigeria is a loan market and financial investors have been tapping into treasury bills and bonds for a very long time,"" Hafeez said.""The way the market looks at Boko Haram ... it's still relatively restricted in terms of geographic presence ... but an increase (of attacks) to anywhere in the major centres will have consequences,"" he said.Nigeria is growing as an investment destination, attracting capital equity and debt investors, but security and political risks cloud its outlook. Hafeez said Nigeria was witnessing an increase in both  foreign direct investments and portfolio flows.Hafeez said Citi was the largest arranger of Eurobonds in Nigeria and had sold $500 million for Zenith Bank, $400 million for Access Bank and $200 million for Diamond Bank in the first half of the year.FCMB last week mandated Citi and Standard Chartered Bank to raise Eurobonds. Hafeez said he expected more to follow.""The demand for long-term dollars is increasing in Nigeria as industries such as oil and gas and power develop,"" he said, adding that the demand could not be met locally. He said banks were tapping Eurobonds to bolster their capital bases and also to finance big-ticket deals in the oil and gas and newly privatised power sectors.Elections next year could become a worry if they affect the naira exchange rate to the dollar and interest rates.""I think we could expect a certain amount of volatility pre-election but have I seen people sitting on the fence? Not really,"" he said.""Commercial realities determine the strategies, so it's really not elections per say, it's what elections will do to the FX, interest rate market.""Incoming central bank governor has said he will work to maintain a stable exchange rate and will not lower interest rates before 2015.He said Nigeria was Citibank's biggest operation across sub-Saharan Africa and that it was expanding its footprint to bank more local firms, especially as multinational oil firms divest from the oil industry to domestic companies.

230,"  (Adds comment from Citigroup)By Dena AubinJuly 10 A federal judge has dismissed mortgage discrimination lawsuits filed by the City of Miami against Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, following the dismissal of a similar lawsuit against Bank of America Corp  earlier this week.On Wednesday U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas dismissed the city's claims against Citi and Wells under the U.S. Fair Housing Act. He referred to his reasoning in the Bank of America case, where he said Miami lacked standing to sue.Miami had sued the three banks in December, accusing them of causing a flood of foreclosures in minority neighborhoods during the last decade's housing crisis by giving borrowers high-cost mortgage loans they could not afford. The city sought damages under the 1968 Fair Housing Act for lost property tax revenue because of a decline in home values and for extra city expenses in blighted neighborhoods.""We are pleased with the court's ruling,"" Citigroup spokesman Mark Rodgers said. ""Citi is proud of its deep commitment to make sure our lending standards are fair to all of our customers.""Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said the bank is pleased with the ruling and will continue working to expand home ownership and revitalize distressed neighborhoods. A spokesman for Miami could not immediately be reached for comment.In his dismissal of the Bank of America case, Dimitrouleas had said that the city's claims were not covered by the Fair Housing Act, which was passed to prevent discrimination and assure fair housing across the country. The judge said Miami's claims were only ""marginally related"" to the purpose of the act.The city's alleged harm was also too remote from the bank's conduct to bring a suit, Dimitrouleas said.A similar lawsuit filed by Miami last month against JPMorgan Chase & Co is still pending. The bank has not yet filed a motion for dismissal.The cases are City of Miami v Wells Fargo & Co, Case No 13-cv-24508, and City of Miami v Citigroup, Case No 24510, both in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida   (Reporting by Dena Aubin in New York; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-07-10,C,"Thu Jul 10, 2014 | 4:36pm EDT","UPDATE 1-Miami's mortgage discrimination suits against Citi, Wells dismissed",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-housing-discrimination-miami-idUSL2N0PL2AX20140710?type=companyNews
231,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A popular way for big U.S. banks to boost profits may have run its course.The practice of dipping into funds set aside for bad loans, known as releasing loan-loss reserves, has helped the industry weather weak loan demand and lower fee income. But it is expected to have a smaller impact on banks' second-quarter earnings, which will start being unveiled on Friday, because loss rates and reserves are nearing their lower limits.""This could be the first quarter where credit doesn't bail out most banks,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden wrote in a recent report.Analysts at Credit Suisse expect JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest U.S. bank, to report $300 million worth of loan-loss reserve releases, down 80 percent from $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2013. They expect releases to drop 40 percent at Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc and 30 percent at Wells Fargo & Co.The decline in income from reserve releases is the latest obstacle for banks to increase earnings in an environment of slow economic growth and low interest rates. Bankers have been able to justify large reserve releases as the economy gradually recovers from the financial crisis. As more borrowers make payments on time, banks can set aside less money for losses.Though banks have released reserves for years, the practice has become more crucial in recent quarters. Revenue from a boom in mortgage refinancing dried up since the second quarter of 2013, and legal and regulatory costs have ballooned.Most big banks have already cut loan-loss reserves for some products, like credit cards, as low as they can, said Charles Peabody, a banking analyst at Portales Partners. Although there is still some room to reduce mortgage reserves, it will be difficult for bankers to justify large releases because home prices are now rising more slowly, he said. Moreover, U.S. regulators are more closely scrutinizing banks' loans to indebted companies, which could result in an increase in commercial reserves, Peabody said.""There's no way the banks are going to release the same amount in the second quarter as they did in the first,"" Peabody said. As the jolt from reserve releases fades, revenue stresses remain. Mortgage volume is half of what it was a year ago, after a rise in rates caused refinancing activity to plummet, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Banks' trading revenues are also expected to suffer.

234,"   By Aruna Viswanatha  Citigroup Inc has agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve claims it misled investors about shoddy mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis, in a deal that includes the largest civil fraud penalty ever levied by the U.S. Justice Department.The settlement, announced on Monday, is more than twice what many analysts expected but less than the $12 billion the government sought in negotiations with Citi C.N, the third largest U.S. bank. The accord came roughly six years after the height of the financial crisis. It is one of several Justice Department probes into the packaging and sale of risky home loans.Many of the securities were marketed as safe, even though the banks knew they were destined to collapse.

""Given some of the strong data that we've had recently since her last speech, there's at least some expectations of her acknowledging that,"" said David Thielke, interest rate strategist at Nomura Securities in New York. ""If anything, the risks are skewed to the hawkish side.""Yellen is also set to speak before a House committee on Wednesday. The Fed chief delivers testimony on monetary policy twice a year to Senate and House committees.Private-sector jobs and nonfarm payrolls growth in June beat expectations, while the unemployment rate fell to a near six-year low of 6.1 percent. Traders are watching the Fed closely for signs of when the central bank will raise rates, which will hurt bond prices. Analysts also said the installment of a new chief executive at Portugal's top bank, Banco Espirito Santo, and a statement that the bank's main shareholder had sold a 4.99 percent stake eased concerns of potentially destabilizing losses at the bank.Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last down 5/32 in price to yield 2.54 percent, from a yield of 2.52 percent late Friday.

243,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 15 (Fitch) Citigroup's (Citi) second quarter 2014 (2Q'14) results  were negatively impacted by the company's settlement with the U.S. Department of  Justice (DOJ) and certain state attorneys general. During the quarter, Citi  incurred a $3.8 billion pre-tax charge to reflect the cost of the settlement.  Excluding CVA/DVA, which were immaterial this quarter, Citi reported net income  of $181 million on $19.4 billion of revenues. Adjusting for this and the  settlement, Fitch Ratings views the decline in adjusted revenues down both  sequentially and versus prior year reflecting general weakness in fixed income  trading. The company continues to keep a focus on operating costs, which were  down 3% from the prior quarter. Excluding the settlement, core earnings would  have been $3.9 billion.  The overall cost of the settlement is $7 billion, with $4.5 billion representing  fines and penalties, while $2.5 billion is earmarked for consumer relief.  Although Citi's 2Q'14 results were marred by the settlement, Fitch considers the  cost to be manageable in the context of Citi's capital position and future  earnings potential. Moreover, it reflects continued progress by Citi to move  past legacy issues stemming from the financial crisis. Notably, Citi's  settlement resolves investigations into  its residential mortgage lending and  securitization as well as its collateralized debt obligation (CDO) activities  during period covered by the settlement (2003-2008).  As expected, Citi's fixed income trading within the Institutional Clients Group  (ICG) struggled, with revenues (ex CVA/DVA) down 12% versus the prior year. The  downdraft in fixed income trading, which is not unique to Citi, reflects lower  market volatility, subdued clients volumes, and responses to tougher regulatory  standards. The company's investment banking and corporate lending were relative  bright spots in an otherwise challenged quarter for ICG.   International Consumer Banking struggled during the quarter as a result of  repositioning charges, mainly in Korea. Year-over-year revenue growth came  mainly from Latam, while Asia and EMEA were slightly down. Credit costs  continued to increase owing to portfolio growth and seasoning. Fitch notes that  net charge-offs (NCOs) in Latin America continue to deteriorate mainly stemming  from higher credits in Mexico and Fitch anticipates that Mexican NCOs will  stabilize and moderate from current levels. As such, Fitch expects that Citi  will to maintain a conservative approach to loan loss reserve levels in the  international consumer segment.  North American Consumer Banking also showed weakness mainly due to lower  mortgage refinance volume. For the quarter, the segment reported $1 billion of  net income, although this was helped by a $396 million reserve release  reflecting solid credit performance. Citi's credit card results were relatively  flat as lower receivables balances were offset by higher purchase volumes and  improved spreads on the portfolio. Credit costs in the card portfolio remain  strong and in Fitch's view are likely hovering near a trough in the credit  cycle. As such, Fitch would expect some reversion in card credit metrics over  time, but expects this to be manageable. Citi continued to make progress in reducing the impact of Citi Holdings on  overall results. Citi Holdings generated net income of $244 million while assets  continued to shrink and came in at $111 billion. Citi Holdings now represents 6%  of total assets. Fitch would expect the results from Citi Holdings to remain  lumpy going forward repositioning costs could offset reserve releases as the  portfolio continues to wind down. Nevertheless, Fitch views positively the  absence of a drag on overall results this quarter. Citi's capital ratios continued to remain very strong and generally above global  peers. Citi's Basel III Tier 1 Common equity (CET1) ratio modestly increased to  10.6% from 10.5% in the prior quarter.  Fitch views this as significant because  it included the DOJ settlement which restrained capital generation during the  quarter as well as $13bn growth in risk-weighted assets (the denominator in  capital ratio calculations). Citi also reported that it would already be in  compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio at the holding company with a  5.7% ratio.

244,"  (Adds details on trading volumes, other banks, analyst comment, updates stock price)By Anil D'Silva and Lauren Tara LaCapraJuly 15 Goldman Sachs Group Inc posted a 5 percent rise in quarterly profit, spurred by higher revenue from stock underwriting and a smaller decline in fixed-income trading than many on Wall Street had predicted.The bank's stock was up 0.7 percent at $168.17 on Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.Goldman posted net income for shareholders of $1.95 billion, or $4.10 per share, in the three months ended June 30, up from $1.86 billion or $3.70 per share in the same period a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.05 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Institutional investors have been shying away from the bond market because of a lack of strong opinions about interest rates and currency moves.Rival banks Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co  said a pickup in trading volume in June helped offset slowness in April and May. ""The sustainability of that trend is in question,"" said Brian Kleinhanzl, a research analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who rates Goldman a ""market perform.""JPMorgan said on Tuesday that the June improvement in bond trading has not carried over to July.Goldman's net revenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity trading for customers, known as FICC, fell 10 percent to $2.22 billion. Analysts had expected a bigger decline. Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz had estimated $1.8 billion in fixed-income trading revenue for the quarter.In May, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup forecasted declines in overall trading revenue closer to 20 percent for the second quarter, compared with the same period last year.Goldman's net revenue in its investing and lending division jumped 46 percent to $2.07 billion. This included net gains of $1.25 billion from investments in equities.The bank was also helped by better results in investment banking, where it ranked No. 1 in mergers and acquisitions, as well as equity underwriting, for the first half of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. In equity underwriting, the bank's revenue rose 47 percent to $545 million, helped by Goldman's work on deals including the initial public offering of Ally Financial.Investment banking revenue overall, which includes M&A, debt underwriting and stock underwriting, rose 15 percent to $1.78 billion.Goldman executives often say that investment banking is the center of its broader franchise, because those clients also generate revenue for its trading, investment management and lending businesses.The bank makes most of its money from trading and investing in capital markets. This sets it apart from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup and Bank of America Corp, which have big consumer and corporate lending businesses.JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, on Tuesday reported an 8 percent decline in second-quarter profit as a pullback in trading of bonds and currencies by big institutions hit revenue in its securities trading business.On Monday, Citigroup reported a 16 percent drop in trading revenue.

(bloom.bg/1mkKR3S)ZF said last week that it was in early-stage buyout talks with the American auto parts supplier, but did not disclose any financial details. A Bloomberg report at the time said ZF valued TRW at $11 billion to $12 billion. Privately owned ZF is working with Citigroup Inc, and Morgan Stanley and several European banks are also advising the company and financing the deal, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The German company can borrow as much as $16 billion, Bloomberg calculated, based on ZF's ability to borrow as much as four times its and TRW's combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Now that talks are public, the companies could reach an agreement in three to four weeks to prevent management disruption and allay concerns among automakers, Bloomberg said.TRW North America spokesman John Wilkerson and ZF North America spokesman Bryan Johnson declined to comment.

247,"  NEW YORK, July 18 Citigroup Inc has about $280 million in loans tied to commodities in two Chinese ports which are at the center of a probe into possible fraud, a senior executive said on Friday, becoming the first U.S. bank to disclose its potential exposure.The total is a large portion of the bank's roughly $400 million worth of so-called repo commodity financing deals in China. Short for repurchasing agreements, repo deals give customers access to short-term credit in exchange for goods.""At this stage we believe the activities are isolated and just specific to those very specific locations,"" Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in a conference call with analysts.The loans are to clients that are non-Chinese subsidiaries of large multi-national corporations and the contracts are guaranteed by the parent companies, he said. Citi is the latest bank to disclose the size of its financing business in Qingdao, China's seventh largest port, and nearby Penglai where authorities have been investigating suspected metals financing fraud since May. The probe centers on a private metals trading firm, Decheng Mining, and its related companies, which are alleged to have used fake warehouse receipts at the ports to obtain multiple loans secured against a single cargo of metal.The company has not commented on the probe. As the fall-out of the scandal that has engulfed the base metals market continues, other foreign banks including Standard Bank Group and trading and investment firms, such as Citic Resources Holdings Ltd, face hundreds of millions of dollars of losses.This week, Standard Chartered launched legal action to recoup its losses.

251,"   By Elinor Comlay | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former middle manager at Citigroup's Banamex unit in Mexico denied he was involved in abetting a corporate loan fraud involving oil pipeline maintenance company Oceanografia. As reported by Reuters on July 21, Banamex is looking into how it lost more than $500 million from the lending to Oceanografia, and has zeroed in on Jose Ortega as a key figure, according to two people familiar with its probe. The sources said that Ortega changed employee manuals that the bank used when deciding whether to lend to Oceanografia and other companies that supply services to Mexican state oil company Pemex.The changes resulted in loans to these companies receiving less scrutiny and therefore enabled fraudulent borrowing, the sources said. Ortega could not be reached to comment for that story. Two days after that story was published, Ortega told Reuters in a statement that he never had the authority to change employee manuals on his own, and never made any changes in favor of any particular customer.  He did not work at the bank while the fraudulent loans were made, he added. ""I have been unfairly mistreated by something that I did not participate in and that I did not have any knowledge about, because I had quit the bank more than a year previously,"" he said in his statement.      A spokesman for Citigroup declined to comment on the matter.The Mexican banking regulator, Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV), has poured scorn on the suggestion that Ortega was instrumental in the fraud, and says Ortega probably played only a bit part. The real problem was with the bank’s institutional failure to have proper controls in place, CNBV President Jaime Gonzalez said in the July 21 story.In that story, Reuters reported that in 2012 the Mexican bank fired Ortega for having an outside business relationship with Oceanografia, creating a conflict of interest, according to one of the two sources familiar with the bank's probe. Banamex had discovered that Ortega had received $200,000 from Oceanografia's CEO Amado Yanez, the source added. One of the two sources also said Ortega worked for Oceanografia as a consultant after leaving Banamex.  In Ortega's statement, he said that he resigned from the bank, and that he had never been an employee of Oceanografia or any other company run by Yanez. On Friday, one of the sources said that Ortega was forced to resign.  Ortega also said in his statement that the $200,000 of payments were for an apartment and for art, which his wife Susana Sabines independently sold to Yanez. He added that his wife's dealings with Yanez never had any influence on his work at Banamex. Sabines confirmed on Friday that she sold the apartment as well as some works of art to Yanez.

257,"   By Junko Fujita | TOKYO, July 25  TOKYO, July 25 Japan will in October invite bids for the operating rights for a major international airport, an official said on Friday, in a deal expected to be among the biggest in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's drive to draw private funds into public infrastructure.The licence for New Kansai International Airport, which will be bundled with the operating rights for smaller Osaka International Airport, should fetch at least 2 trillion yen ($20 billion), Keiichi Ando, the chief executive of the government-owned New Kansai International Airport Co, told reporters.The operating licence for both airports will be for 45 years and the auction is open to foreign and domestic investors, he added. The winner is likely to be announced by June next year.The company, which runs both airports, will use the proceeds to repay its 1.2 trillion yen debt to the state, Ando said. New Kansai International Airport is a regional hub in Osaka bay and Japan's fifth-largest airport by passenger traffic while Osaka airport is smaller. SMBC Nikko Securities, the investment banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and Citigroup Inc  are among the advisers for the sale.The auction is part of Abe's target to triple private-sector investment in Japan's infrastructure to 12 trillion yen over the next decade as he tackles bloated government debt. Last month, the government started the bidding process for the operating rights of Sendai Airport. Earlier this year, an official at Goldman Sachs Group Inc  said the investment bank was considering investing in Kansai airport.Ando said he hoped Japan's three largest banks, as well as the state-owned Development Bank of Japan, would take part in the sale.

258,"  (Adds Citi departures, background on equity derivatives trading)HONG KONG, July 25 Citigroup Inc has named James Boyle as global head of equity derivatives, according to an internal memo, replacing Simon Yates who left for New York hedge fund Two Sigma Investments LLC in early July.Yates was the second executive in Citi's equities division to leave the U.S. bank for a hedge fund this year, after global head of equities trading Mike Pringle departed for Moore Capital Management in May.Boyle will remain based in Hong Kong until the end of this year and move to New York in the new year, according to the memo seen by Reuters on Friday. A spokesman for Citi in Hong Kong confirmed the contents of the memo. Boyle started at Citi in 2012 as head of derivatives trading in Asia, shortly afterwards assuming responsibility for all trading in the region.

Although trading such instruments can be risky, investment banks globally have bet on them in recent years to bolster equity desks' revenue amid a slump in fees from trading ordinary cash shares.In Asia last year, banks saw a spike in equity derivatives trading revenue.

260,"   By Elinor Comlay | MEXICO CITY  MEXICO CITY A former middle manager at Citigroup's Banamex unit in Mexico denied he was involved in abetting a corporate loan fraud involving oil pipeline maintenance company Oceanografia. As reported by Reuters on July 21, Banamex is looking into how it lost more than $500 million from the lending to Oceanografia, and has zeroed in on Jose Ortega as a key figure, according to two people familiar with its probe. The sources said that Ortega changed employee manuals that the bank used when deciding whether to lend to Oceanografia and other companies that supply services to Mexican state oil company Pemex.The changes resulted in loans to these companies receiving less scrutiny and therefore enabled fraudulent borrowing, the sources said. Ortega could not be reached to comment for that story. Two days after that story was published, Ortega told Reuters in a statement that he never had the authority to change employee manuals on his own, and never made any changes in favor of any particular customer.  He did not work at the bank while the fraudulent loans were made, he added. ""I have been unfairly mistreated by something that I did not participate in and that I did not have any knowledge about, because I had quit the bank more than a year previously,"" he said in his statement.      A spokesman for Citigroup declined to comment on the matter.The Mexican banking regulator, Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV), has poured scorn on the suggestion that Ortega was instrumental in the fraud, and says Ortega probably played only a bit part. The real problem was with the bank’s institutional failure to have proper controls in place, CNBV President Jaime Gonzalez said in the July 21 story.In that story, Reuters reported that in 2012 the Mexican bank fired Ortega for having an outside business relationship with Oceanografia, creating a conflict of interest, according to one of the two sources familiar with the bank's probe. Banamex had discovered that Ortega had received $200,000 from Oceanografia's CEO Amado Yanez, the source added. One of the two sources also said Ortega worked for Oceanografia as a consultant after leaving Banamex.  In Ortega's statement, he said that he resigned from the bank, and that he had never been an employee of Oceanografia or any other company run by Yanez. On Friday, one of the sources said that Ortega was forced to resign.  Ortega also said in his statement that the $200,000 of payments were for an apartment and for art, which his wife Susana Sabines independently sold to Yanez. He added that his wife's dealings with Yanez never had any influence on his work at Banamex. Sabines confirmed on Friday that she sold the apartment as well as some works of art to Yanez.(This version of the story was refiled to change the dateline to Mexico City.)

278,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. judge on Tuesday reluctantly approved a $285 million fraud settlement between Citigroup Inc (C.N) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, two months after an appeals court voided his decision to reject it as inadequate.U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said he had little choice but to approve the deal, which did not require the bank to admit to any wrongdoing. But he said he feared the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision would rob such settlements of any ""meaningful oversight.""""That court has now fixed the menu, leaving this court with nothing but sour grapes,"" he wrote in a brief opinion outlining his disappointment.Rakoff had objected to the SEC's decades-old practice of letting some corporate defendants settle allegations without admitting or denying the charges, a decision that is credited with altering the public debate over such deals.Last June, SEC Chair Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor, adopted a policy of requiring admissions in certain major cases, citing the need for more public accountability.The 2nd Circuit in June ruled that Rakoff had abused his discretion in rebuffing the settlement in November 2011, finding he had failed to give enough deference to the regulator. The appeals court said Rakoff was wrong to require the SEC to show the ""truth"" of its allegations. Such fact-finding is left for trials, while ""consent decrees are primarily about pragmatism,"" Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler wrote for the court.The SEC complaint against Citigroup concerned a 2007 sale of mortgage-linked securities debt that caused more than $700 million of investor losses.In his opinion on Tuesday, Rakoff characterized the standard set forth by the 2nd Circuit for approving settlements to be ""very modest"" and warned that it left judges with little role.""This court fears that, as a result of the Court of Appeal's decision, the settlements reached by governmental regulatory bodies and enforced by the judiciary's contempt powers will in practice be subject to no meaningful oversight whatsoever,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment. But SEC Enforcement Division Director Andrew Ceresney said the settlement ""holds Citigroup accountable, deprives the firm of its ill-gotten gains, and provides $285 million for harmed investors.”The appeals court decision was seen among legal experts as a victory for the SEC, even as they emphasized the impact Rakoff's ruling had on public opinion and the agency's enforcement policies.The iconoclastic Rakoff has questioned the SEC in the past; in 2009, he rejected as too lenient the regulator's original accord with Bank of America Corp over the bank's purchase of Merrill Lynch. In recent years, he also has publicly criticized U.S. prosecutors for failing to hold Wall Street executives accountable for the financial crisis.Under White, the SEC has extracted several admissions of wrongdoing, including from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) over its $6.2 billion trading loss in London, and from billionaire Philip Falcone over transactions at his hedge fund.In 2012, under White's predecessor Mary Schapiro, the SEC decided to stop allowing settling defendants to neither admit nor deny charges when they acknowledge guilt in related U.S. Department of Justice criminal cases.The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

282,"  (Adds details of investigations, negotiations, second source)By Aruna Viswanatha, Karen Freifeld and Jonathan StempelAug 6 Bank of America Corp is close to a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay more than $16.5 billion to end investigations into mortgage securities that the bank and  companies it bought sold in the run-up to the financial crisis, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.A settlement would likely cap more than four years of work by Brian Moynihan, the bank's chief executive, to rid Bank of America of nearly all of the massive mortgage liabilities it took on through the acquisitions of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co by his predecessor, Kenneth Lewis.The bank has agreed to pay about $9 billion in cash and the rest in assistance to struggling homeowners, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment.A $16.5 billion payout would be the largest in a series of soaring penalties against banks for a range of misconduct, including violating U.S. sanctions and inappropriately marketing mortgages.JPMorgan Chase & Co paid $13 billion last year to resolve similar civil fraud claims that it misled mortgage bond investors, and Citigroup Inc agreed to pay $7 billion over similar charges last month.Those two settlements and the one expected with Bank of America are the product of a task force President Barack Obama directed the Justice Department to convene in 2012 to examine fraud in mortgage securities that helped fuel the financial collapse. The announcement came after his administration faced criticism that it was not sufficiently holding accountable those who contributed to the crisis. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Wednesday the progress in settlement talks.Negotiations between Bank of America and the government continued on Wednesday, with a meeting between Bank of America general counsel Gary Lynch and the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, Tony West, two people familiar with the talks said. An announcement of a final deal is not expected this week.The agreement in principal was reached after a phone call last week between Moynihan and Attorney General Eric Holder, sources said.Bank of America had earlier sought a meeting between Moynihan and Holder, but the Justice Department had declined the request last month. Last week the bank raised its earlier offer of $14 billion, to resolve three Justice Department investigations as well as claims from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and several states, sources said.The phone call between Moynihan and Holder came after U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan on Wednesday ordered Bank of America to pay a $1.27 billion penalty for what he called a ""brazen fraud"" over shoddy mortgages sold by Countrywide, which the bank bought for $2.5 billion in July 2008.While a jury last October found the second-largest U.S. bank liable for the conduct, it was not clear how large a penalty the bank might face.Bank of America had argued it should have owed nothing because Countrywide lost money on the loans. The separate Justice Department negotiations were driven by allegations about securities sold by Merrill, which the bank also agreed to acquire in 2008, people familiar with the matter have said.Analysts have said the purchases of Countrywide and Merrill have already cost Bank of America well over $50 billion through litigation, loan buybacks and other mortgage relief.According to a regulatory filing, about $245 billion, or just over one-fourth, of the $965 billion of mortgage-backed securities and loans issued between 2004 and 2008, and sold to private investors - and now attributed to Bank of America - are either in default or severely delinquent.Countrywide accounted for $187 billion, or 76 percent, of the problematic securities, while Bank of America accounted for just $10 billion, or 4 percent. The rest came from Merrill and the former First Franklin Financial Corp, which Merrill bought in 2006.The consumer help portion of the settlement is expected to mirror past deals, which included cutting loan balances for underwater borrowers, refinancing mortgages, and other types of help to struggling homeowners.Bank of America shares closed Wednesday up 20 cents at $15.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. They were little changed after market hours.The news of the deal comes just after Bank of America said the Federal Reserve approved its plan to raise its quarterly dividend for the first time since the financial crisis.Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan is involved in the negotiations, according to her spokeswoman. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has also been involved in the talks, a separate person familiar with his involvement said. A spokesman for Schneiderman declined comment.

283,"  LONDON Commodities trading house Trafigura's warehouse business Impala has become the latest company to initiate legal action in connection with suspected metals financing fraud at two of China's ports, according to a legal document. Trafigura has started legal proceedings in London against two units of U.S. bank Citi and trade house Mercuria Energy Trading, according to the document written by Citi's lawyers that outlines the bank's argument in separate, but related, litigation against Mercuria. Chinese authorities launched an investigation in May into whether private metals trading firm Decheng Mining and its related companies used fake warehouse receipts at Qingdao Port and nearby Penglai to obtain multiple loans secured against a single cargo of metal. The Citi document does not say what action Impala is taking or why, and it does not implicate Impala, Citi or Mercuria in the alleged fraud. But it shows that Impala has joined other trading houses and global banks, including Mercuria, Citi, Standard Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, in initiating lawsuits and counter-suits over an estimated $1 billion exposure to the suspected fraud in China. A spokeswoman at Trafigura said the company does not comment on legal matters. Citi declined to comment on Impala's action beyond what is contained in its document.  A spokesman for Mercuria said of Trafigura's action: ""The matter is rather complex and we do not estimate it is appropriate to comment on it at this stage."" The dispute between Citi and Mercuria pivots on contract obligations and the ownership of metal worth more than $250 million held in warehouses in Penglai and Qingdao. Impala is one of the warehouse operators in those locations.  The Chinese authorities imposed a lockdown on parts of the two ports where the metal is held, preventing anyone, including Citi, Mercuria and the warehouse operators, from accessing the material, according to Citi's document.It says there is a range of steps which the party with responsibility for the metal will need to take. ""The parties will need to know what steps to take against the warehouse operators,"" Citi's lawyer Daniel Toledano says in the document.  ""In particular, proceedings have already been commenced against Mercuria and Citi by one of the warehouse operators, Impala, and the parties need to be able to consider how their interests are affected by those proceedings and take a view as to whether, and how, to contest them.""

285,"  FRANKFURT Aug 14 Deutsche Pfandbriefbank , the successor to failed German lender Hypo Real Estate that was nationalised during the financial crisis, has mandated Citigroup to help it with a planned privatisation, the German bank said on Thursday.Citigroup advisers will be working closely with Pfandbriefbank executives and federal government officials in the coming weeks to evaluate various options for either a sale or an initial public offering of the lender, Pfandbriefbank chief financial officer Andreas Arndt said.The European Union has demanded that Pfandbriefbank, or PBB, change ownership by the end of 2015 in exchange for allowing a state bailout during the financial crisis.Pretax profit rose 45 percent to 45 million euros ($60 million) in the second quarter, putting the bank more than halfway towards its full year target of 140 million euros by the end of June. ""What we show is what we've promised,"" Arndt said. The bank's management hope a sharp jump in earnings this year and flourishing new business will bolster its valuation. However, the privatisation of Pfandbriefbank may be dogged by precedent.Its sister lender, Depfa bank, a part of the HRE group that specialised in lending to governments, had also been slated for privatisation, with Citigroup as adviser. In Depfa's case, the German government in the end decided against a privatisation, seeing a transfer of the lender's assets to a state ""bad bank"" as a better option to limit the hit to taxpayers.Berlin's decision prompted Manuela Better, the chief executive of HRE and Pfandbriefbank, to resign. A replacement for Better has yet to be found.

286,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  A unit of Morgan Stanley (MS.N) must pay $4.5 million to Citigroup Inc's (C.N) Banamex unit which alleged the firm had allowed funds in a family's trust account to be used to repay third-party loans without its authorization, according to a ruling on Friday.A Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel found Morgan Stanley & Co Inc liable for negligence in the case, filed by Banamex in 2012. Banamex, which served as trustee to a family's trust account, had sought more than $5.2 million, according to the ruling.“We are disappointed in the arbitration panel's award,"" a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said in a statement. The firm believes the evidence showed that the family's ""patriarch"" had pledged the trust accounts as collateral for loans that benefited the family and that the accounts were treated that way for the period at issue, the spokeswoman said.The trust was set up in 2007 with proceeds from the sale of property that a group of adult siblings and their mother had inherited, according to Jeff Erez, a lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who represented Banamex in the case. Banamex and the trust beneficiaries enlisted a broker at Morgan Stanley to manage their accounts that same year. The ruling does not disclose the broker's name. The trust accounts were held at a banking unit of Morgan Stanley & Co and managed by the brokerage unit. They were set up in a way that did not allow the assets to be used as guarantees to pay off third-party loans taken by another family member's account, Erez said.Banamex alleged that Morgan Stanley caused the trust accounts to guarantee payment of third-party loans of a family member without Banamex's authorization, Erez said. The FINRA arbitration panel, as is customary, did not explain the reasons for its decision.

Lending has been sluggish in Japan overall, as corporations sitting on massive amounts of cash are reluctant to borrow or invest aggressively with domestic growth prospects looking limited, while dull wage growth has left households cautious about spending.Citibank Japan's deposits are split about evenly between yen- and foreign currency-denominated funds, according to one source close to the bank who was not authorized to speak with the media.While it offers domestic mortgages and loans, its main appeal to customers has been global services such as local currency withdrawals from overseas ATMs, industry officials say.Prospects for a sale could be dampened by worries that customers would flee if their deposits changed hands to a Japanese lender and they lost access to Citi's global banking network. A source with direct knowledge of Citi's management said the bank may need to offer a sweetener to attract buyers, such as allowing customers continued access to overseas banking.The bank has also faced persistent compliance problems.

307,"  Aug 31 Citigroup Inc has told senior staff in Europe that they would receive fixed monthly pay in addition to their salaries in an attempt to compensate for rules that limit bonuses to up to twice the level of base salaries, the Financial Times reported, citing several people.More than 600 of Citigroup bankers in Europe were affected by the bonus cap and will therefore be paid such allowances, several people told the newspaper. (on.ft.com/Z3H47g)They said the U.S. bank had sent out letters to senior staff in recent weeks. The FT said about half of the bankers had received similar allowances in the past after Citi introduced them a few years ago to mitigate the impact of regulatory demands for higher bonus deferrals for key staff.One senior Citi banker told the FT the allowances had been structured so that the bank's European staff would still receive the same amount of overall pay and a similar mixture of cash and shares as their U.S. and Asian peers. ""We do not want people to have geographic preferences based on compensation,"" the banker told the FT.

At the time it was Europe's biggest bankruptcy and its demise wiped out the savings of more than 100,000 small investors.In 2008 the Superior Court of New Jersey threw out a lawsuit brought by Parmalat claiming Citibank had played a part in thefts that had helped bankrupt it. Instead the court ruled Parmalat had to pay the New York-based bank damages for false statements and fraud.""Following the demand by Citibank for recognition (of the U.S. ruling) in Italy, the Bologna Court of Appeal has now ruled that the U.S. sentence be recognised in Italy against Parmalat..."", Citi's lawyers Clifford Chance said. Parmalat emerged from bankruptcy and returned to the Italian stock market in 2005 after a two-year reorganization.In 2011 it was taken over by French dairy company Lactalis  in a 4.3 billion euro deal. Citibank now has to file an application with the Parma bankruptcy court in Italy asking it to verify its claim, the lawyers said.If the claim is upheld by the Parma court the damages will have to be paid to the U.S. bank in Parmalat shares.It was not clear if the whole amount would have to be paid or only a part. Lawyers for Clifford Chance said there was a chance that Parmalat would be called on to pay the full amount of $431 million.Parmalat said the company had the right to appeal the decision to the Italian supreme court.

318,"  NEW YORK Citigroup Inc's (C.N) third-quarter expenses are running ""slightly higher"" than three months ago because of efforts to prove to regulators that its risk and balance sheet management is good enough to allow more spending for dividends and share buybacks, the bank's chief financial officer said on Monday.John Gerspach told an investor conference the company is ""well on the way to making needed changes"" in its capital planning for the Federal Reserve's next stress test early next year.In March, the Fed Reserve rejected Citigroup's last capital plan in a surprising rebuke for Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat. Gerspach acknowledged that the company had been wrongly confident in that plan. He said the company had 'a false set of understanding' of Fed requirements going into that test and has since been working constantly to improve its management.Gerspach, in the first comments on third-quarter trading results from a major Wall Street executive, also said equity and fixed income market revenue is ""roughly in line"" with a year earlier. Investment banking revenue is expected to be better than a year earlier, but less than in the second quarter because of seasonally lower underwriting, Gerspach said. The CFO also said that Citigroup now estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point rise in short and long-term rates would increase the company's 2014 earnings by 43 cents a share. Stock analysts estimate, on average, that the company will earn about $3.69 per share this year, according to Thomson Reuters.In Monday morning trading in New York Citigroup shares were up 0.3 percent to $52.46.

It expects to price the IPO at $60 to $66 per American Depositary Share, which are scheduled to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange later this month.Industry analysts had expected Alibaba to try for a valuation in excess of $200 billion, ranking it among the 20 largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The marketing effort, which will take Alibaba on a globe-trotting tour, will help determine whether the company will price above its initial range and come closer to that valuation.Several investors who spoke with Reuters before and after the event said they went into the presentation with a series of questions about Alibaba, ranging from concerns about its corporate governance and transparency, to plans for U.S. acquisitions and growth. They said they did not learn anything new during the lunch - of boxed turkey sandwiches - but came away feeling the event was well-choreographed.Akram Yosri, a managing partner at 3iCapital Group, said he had hoped to find out more about how the company planned to grow globally, and particularly how it plans to compete with Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc in the United States.""Did I learn anything? Absolutely not,"" he said. But Yosri and other investors said they found Ma to be impressive, with some describing the former English teacher who founded the company in his apartment as ""charismatic"". In his 10-minute remarks, Ma emphasized how the company serves small businesses in China and addressed issues of governance, investors said.Alibaba accounts for about 80 percent of all online retail sales in China, where rising Internet usage and an expanding middle class helped the company generate gross merchandise volume of $296 billion in the 12 months ended June 30. Revenue in the June quarter increased 46 percent to $2.54 billion from a year earlier, faster than the 38.7 percent growth in the previous quarter.But the company has seen its share of controversy, in particular over governance and the outsized influence of its founder and senior managers. Ma holds deep sway over executive and board appointments at the company, an influence that is set to strengthen further after it goes public.In 2010, a decision to spin off Alipay to a company Ma controlled also led to objections from major investors, including Yahoo Inc and SoftBank Corp.Ma surprised investors at the event by talking about the move unprompted. ""Ma said it was a tough decision and time will prove it was a good one,"" one investor at the luncheon said, referring to the Alipay decision. Two other investors who had flown from Toronto to attend the roadshow said they understood Ma's comments to mean, ""'Trust me on this one.'""An Alibaba spokesman declined comment.Alibaba has been billed as one of the hottest IPOs of the year, eliciting the kind of anticipation among investors that was last seen in 2012 when Facebook Inc went public in a $16 billion offering.Alibaba's draw was evident on Monday. Investors waited on long lines for elevators, making some fret about being able to make it to the venue on time and other hotel guests wondering about the cause of the commotion. Among the investors attending the event was Mario Gabelli, CEO of Gabelli Asset Management. The event, which started later than expected, kicked off with a video about the company. Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai presented some slides; Ma's remarks followed.Management took questions from investors. But 3i's Yosri said all questions were screened. He said he was disappointed they didn't take ""the tough New York questions.""EARLY START Alibaba executives and bankers started their day early, with a management presentation to about 300 salespeople for the six banks underwriting its offering. They gathered at Citigroup Inc's offices on Greenwich street in Lower Manhattan for an hour, according to the source familiar with the meeting.Besides Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group AG,  Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley are the joint bookrunners for Alibaba's IPO. Rothschild is Alibaba's independent equity adviser.Tsai fielded questions and did the main presenting to the sales force at the Citigroup meeting, according to the source.Alibaba is selling 123.1 million of the 320.1 million ADS shares slated for the IPO. Shareholders including Ma, Tsai and Yahoo are offering the remainder.The company plans a Tuesday presentation at the Four Seasons hotel in Boston, according to a person who saw an invitation.

320,"   By Suzanne Barlyn | NEW YORK, Sept 8  NEW YORK, Sept 8 Banks are putting more brokers in the empty spaces of their branches, raising some potential problems as they work more independently from their day-to-day brokerage supervisors.JPMorgan Chase & Co, for example, reached a goal last year of placing advisers from its Chase Private Client business, including brokers, inside 2,000 branches.A spate of recent enforcement cases against bankers with securities licenses, including at JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc , shows how the brokerage and banking worlds are colliding on the regulatory front and spurring questions about the best way to supervise brokers inside a bank branch.Brokerages need to match their growing ranks of brokers at bank branches with supervision, said Alan Wolper, a securities lawyer in Chicago. Brokerage compliance staff can help bridge the gap between bank brokers and supervisors, in part, by conducting surprise audits to keep brokers in line, Wolper said. Securities industry rules require ""reasonable"" supervision, said Wolper, also former director of FINRA's Atlanta office. ""They do not have to be under 24-hour surveillance.""Meanwhile, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street's industry-funded regulator, disciplined six bankers in August, including one at Citigroup and three at JPMorgan Chase. All had licenses to sell securities and were accused of banking-related frauds, such as deposit theft, that were unrelated to securities sales. The cases were part of nearly 100 disciplinary cases resolved last month by FINRA.JPMorgan and Citigroup each declined to comment on the cases. FINRA's discipline resulted in five employees being barred from the securities industry and one suspended. Four of the six who were disciplined signed agreements in which they neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Two were barred after not responding to FINRA's requests. The backdrop is fierce competition among banks for gathering wealth management dollars.Banks are expected to increase their wealth management assets overall to $7.5 trillion by 2018 from $5.8 trillion  through their bank-affiliated brokerages and other operations such as trust departments and stand-alone trust companies, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based research firm. CROSS REGULATION FINRA can take action against anyone licensed to sell securities for conduct that does not meet ""high standards of commercial honor."" That is so whether they act as bankers, brokers or fee-based advisers. But those individuals may not have the close supervision they would have if they sat in a traditional brokerage office instead of a bank, say compliance professionals. Bank and brokerage supervisors can both be responsible for overseeing employees who have securities licenses, depending on the employees' roles, lawyers say.FINRA is not formally targeting bank employees, said Emily Gordy, a senior vice president of FINRA enforcement. Cases typically draw the regulator's attention after the banks and their affiliated brokerages uncover misconduct, fire the employees and disclose the terminations in regulatory filings that FINRA reviews, she said.

321,"  (Recasts with comments on higher expenses and background)NEW YORK, Sept 8 Citigroup Inc's  third-quarter expenses are running ""slightly higher"" than three months ago because of efforts to prove to regulators that its risk and balance sheet management is good enough to allow more spending for dividends and share buybacks, the bank's chief financial officer said on Monday.John Gerspach told an investor conference the company is ""well on the way to making needed changes"" in its capital planning for the Federal Reserve's next stress test early next year. In March, the Fed Reserve rejected Citigroup's last capital plan in a surprising rebuke for Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat. Gerspach acknowledged that the company had been wrongly confident in that plan. He said the company had 'a false set of understanding' of Fed requirements going into that test and has since been working constantly to improve its management.Gerspach, in the first comments on third-quarter trading results from a major Wall Street executive, also said equity and fixed income market revenue is ""roughly in line"" with a year earlier. Investment banking revenue is expected to be better than a year earlier, but less than in the second quarter because of seasonally lower underwriting, Gerspach said. The CFO also said that Citigroup now estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point rise in short and long-term rates would increase the company's 2014 earnings by 43 cents a share. Stock analysts estimate, on average, that the company will earn about $3.69 per share this year, according to Thomson Reuters.In Monday morning trading in New York Citigroup shares were up 0.3 percent to $52.46.

But the judge said he would wait to rule on the subpoena request until after a federal appeals court next week considers whether to uphold his decision blocking Citigroup from processing the payments on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued under Argentine law. The subpoena was issued by Elliott Management's NML Capital Ltd, which has been suing for full payment on bonds in default since 2002. ""It almost goes without saying whatever the court of appeals decides will have an effect on the issues we're dealing with here,"" Griesa said.

328,"   By Taro Fuse | TOKYO  TOKYO Citigroup Inc (C.N) on Friday told bidders for its Japanese retail banking operations that it was looking to sell its profitable Diners Club card business in Japan with the retail unit, sources with knowledge of the matter said. The U.S. bank has been preparing to sell its Japanese retail unit after having struggled to turn around the business amid weak loan demand and falling interest margins in Japan's banking industry. On Friday, about 10 banks including Japan's top three lenders Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T), Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T) participated in the first round of bidding for the retail business, the sources said.  Resona Holdings Inc (8308.T), Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc (8309.T) and Shinsei Bank Ltd (8303.T) as well as some regional banks also submitted preliminary bids, said the sources, declining to be identified as the bidding was not public. Citibank and the six Japanese lenders declined to comment.  Citibank's Japanese retail business has drawn interest from suitors hoping to take over its wealthy clientele. It has some 3.6 trillion yen ($33.6 billion) in deposits, of which close to 2 trillion yen is dollar-denominated, and this is seen as attractive for Japanese banks seeking stable procurement of foreign currencies, the sources said. However, it is effectively losing money, weighed down by labor costs at its 33 branches in Japan. Citibank is therefore also seeking to sell the Japanese credit card business to entice bidders, the sources said. Citibank does not plan to sell the credit card business on its own, they added.

330,"  (Updates with further details from arguments, background on litigation)By Nate Raymond and Joseph AxNEW YORK, Sept 18 A U.S. appeals court signaled its displeasure with Argentina on Thursday as Citigroup Inc  warned it faces ""serious and imminent hazard"" if it follows a judge's order not to process an upcoming interest payment due to bondholders.The bank urged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to reverse a judge's ruling blocking payments on $8.4 billion in bonds issued under Argentine law following its 2002 default.Citigroup faces regulatory and criminal sanctions by Argentina, which defaulted again in July, if it cannot process the $5 million payment by Sept. 30, said Karen Wagner, Citigroup's lawyer.""If we obey, we have a gun to our head, and the gun will probably go off,"" Wagner said. ""I ask this court, what good will that do? It won't change what Argentina does.""But some panel members questioned why they should consider Argentina's position when the country was taking steps, including passing legislation, to avoid complying with orders that it pay $1.33 billion plus interest to creditors suing for full payment on defaulted bonds.""I'm not sure why we're even listening to this,"" said Circuit Judge Reena Raggi. ""Your client is the person or entity holding the gun to Ms. Wagner's client's head."" Argentina defaulted in July after refusing to honor a court order to pay bondholders led by Elliott Management's NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management.The hedge funds had spurned the country's 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings, which resulted in exchanges for about 92 percent of the country's defaulted debt. Investors who accepted Argentina's terms on average were paid less than 30 cents on the dollar.The country's most recent default came after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina's appeal of a lower court ruling that it must pay the holdouts at the same time it paid holders of the exchange bonds. U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, who has for years overseen the Argentine bond litigation, subsequently blocked Bank of New York Mellon Corp from processing a $539 million interest payment on what the country says is over $28 billion in restructured debt.The order sent Argentina on a course to default after it failed to reach an agreement with the holdouts.Amid the litigation, Citigroup sought Griesa's assurances it could process any payments it received from the country on bonds issued under Argentine law.Griesa initially ruled for Citigroup, which has a branch in Argentina, but on July 28 reversed course, blocking future payments by the country on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued under Argentine law. Wagner said Thursday that Citigroup will ""undoubtedly"" get another transfer of money from Argentina by Sept. 30. She stressed the risks the bank faced, though she said the bank would follow any order upholding the injunction.Citigroup has argued payments on the bonds, which are regulated and paid in Argentina, cannot be blocked by a U.S. court.Failure to pay could result in the loss of its Argentine banking license, its takeover by the country or the imprisonment of bank officials, Citigroup has said.""Citibank Argentina faces a serious and imminent hazard,"" Wagner said.Roy Englert, a lawyer for the hedge funds, countered that Argentina's ""evasion plan would be aided and abetted by this court"" if the judges reversed Griesa.One judge, Barrington Parker, voiced skepticism over Citigroup's argument, saying, ""I don't know how you can seriously argue the Argentine law bonds aren't covered by the injunction.""

But Griesa on July 28 blocked Citi from processing payments on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued under Argentine law.Last week, Argentina's Congress passed a bill intended to allow the government to make payments on about $29 billion in foreign-held bonds either in Argentina or elsewhere out of U.S. jurisdiction.Daniel Pollack, a court-appointed mediator, said Friday he would ""anticipate conducting a continuing effort to find a negotiated resolution to this dispute.""Consultants with Albright Stonebridge Group, co-chaired by former U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, separately have met with Argentine officials on behalf of bondholders in hopes of finding ""a mutually acceptable resolution,"" said spokesman Ben Chang.He declined to say which bondholders the firm represented and whether they held defaulted or exchanged bonds.

Currently, LBMA has 12 market makers which serve in either one, two or all three of the spot, forwards and options markets.

Laureri was formerly an executive director of precious metals with UBS, according to his Linkedin profile. With the exception of Citi, other global banks have mostly reduced exposure to gold and silver trading, driven by increased scrutiny of precious metals 'fixes' by European and U.S. watchdogs in the wake of benchmark manipulation in other financial markets.Earlier this month, the LBMA has formally started the process to find a new administrator for the century-old mechanism that will halt the telephone call that four institutions enter twice a day in favor of an electronic solution.

349,"   By Tomás Sarmiento | MEXICO CITY  MEXICO CITY The head of Citigroup Inc's Mexican unit Banamex has resigned, the bank said on Friday, after problems this year that included a major loan scandal that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.Ernesto Torres Cantu, a veteran of more than 25 years at the Mexican bank who previously headed its retail unit, will replace Javier Arrigunaga, said Banamex, Mexico's No. 2 bank by assets.""Given the difficulties our institution has faced during the past year, Javier Arrigunaga reached the decision that new leadership was needed for the group,"" Manuel Medina Mora, the chairman of Banamex's board, said in a statement.The bank said Torres will be supported by Rodrigo Zorrilla, who was appointed deputy chief executive of Banamex.Arrigunaga, who had led Mexico's Bank Association (ABM) since April 2013, also stepped down from that role, the association said, praising him for his work in helping the government pass a financial reform last year.The financial reform was designed to encourage banks to boost lending in Latin America's No. 2 economy. UNDER PRESSURE Banamex management has been under pressure since Citigroup said in February it uncovered $400 million in bogus loans made to Mexican oil services company Oceanografia, whose assets the government seized.The bank later uncovered other bad loans linked to Oceanografia and another oil services company, bringing the total losses to $565 million.Banamex also suffered losses on loans to Mexican homebuilders, and fired a pair of rogue traders at the unit.  Citigroup this year has fired about a dozen staff members who either were directly involved or failed to stop the bad loans to Oceanografia. People familiar with the matter said that one of the fired employees was accused of spiriting away documents early in the bank's internal probe. In May, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said in a memo that he expected more employees to be disciplined. Earlier this year, Citigroup's board of directors said it may cut Medina Mora's 2014 pay and claw back some prior compensation because of the loan fraud at Banamex.  It separately cut his 2013 pay to $9.5 million from $11 million in 2012 after regulators sanctioned Banamex USA for lax anti-money laundering controls.    In a report that Reuters has reviewed, Mexico's banking regulator said its own investigation found that Banamex failed to follow internal protocols.That failure was the main problem, and not material changes to the procedures, according to the 77-page report by the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV).Mexico's attorney general, Jesus Murillo, said in June he was seeking to arrest three Banamex employees in connection with the bank's fraud claims, but not one of those arrests has been made.Appearing before Congress at the end of September, Murillo was questioned about the lack of arrests in the case and said the investigation was continuing.

350,"  (Adds details from trial, background)By Aruna ViswanathaWASHINGTON Oct 6 Former Treasury Secretary Henry ""Hank"" Paulson told a packed courtroom on Monday that AIG shareholders were singled out for punishment as part of the U.S. government's attempt to contain the contagion of the 2008 financial crisis.The testimony from Paulson appeared to bolster some claims contained in a lawsuit brought by former AIG Chief Executive Hank Greenberg, who contends the terms of a government loan to AIG cheated its shareholders.""AIG, either fairly or unfairly, ... became a symbol for all that is bad on Wall Street,"" Paulson said as he testified about  the U.S. government's bailout of the insurance giant, which  began with a $85 billion loan from the New York Federal Reserve in September 2008.Paulson, who appeared relaxed as he testified in federal court in Washington, said he supported the loan as appropriate for the circumstances, especially because officials needed to send a message that any bailout would come with strings attached.But he did not shed much light on how the terms of the loan were selected, which is at the heart of the case.Paulson was one of the chief architects of the U.S. government's response to the unprecedented global credit crisis of 2007-2009, and he has since written a book about the experience. Monday's courtroom setting put Paulson on the hot seat in a way he has not experienced since Congress wrapped up its hearings on the subject years ago. Legal experts have doubted the strength of the lawsuit, which is seeking as much as $50 billion from the government. The outcome of the lawsuit may affect how much flexibility regulators will have when they respond to future financial crises.MORAL HAZARD In the case of AIG, the Fed initially charged a high interest rate for the first loan and required a nearly 80 percent stake in the company in exchange, which Greenberg's lawyers have said was illegal. While Paulson said he was not involved in setting the specific terms, he said the provisions were necessary to protect against ""moral hazard,"" or concerns that other companies would take reckless risks under the belief that the government would bail them out with few consequences.But in response to questions from a government lawyer, Paulson said Citigroup Inc's shareholders were not subject to similar terms when the bank also started to falter during the crisis.Paulson said Citigroup was different, in part because policymakers were concerned about short sellers who were exerting pressure on Citi's stock and would profit if the rescue targeted Citi's shareholders.Paulson said he was worried the traders would take the same strategy to the next bank, a concern he said he did not have about any of AIG's peers. AIG's problems stemmed from insurance it wrote on $79 billion worth of shoddy mortgage securities; Citigroup and other banks facing mounting losses on toxic assets they held.Paulson took the stand Monday morning wearing a dark suit and red tie, answering questions so directly that Greenberg's lawyer, star litigator David Boies, wrapped up what he expected to be six hours of testimony within a little over one hour.The testimony by Paulson comes in the second week of what is expected to be a six-week trial. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are expected to testify later this week.Boies has sought to portray the government as shutting down possible alternative rescues for AIG in 2008, including one from Chinese government investors. Paulson testified that such offers from China were unrealistic without a U.S. government backstop, which he said he had not been authorized to provide.On Monday Paulson also said he had spoken in 2008 to then-presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama about the AIG bailout, and had informed them that AIG shareholders would be treated harshly. Paulson said he hoped that assurance would help convince the two candidates to avoid criticizing the deal in public.Paulson, who served as President George W. Bush's Treasury secretary from 2006 to 2009, was previously the chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and now runs an institute that focuses on climate change and other issues.The case is Starr International Co v.

351,"   By Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 6 Former Treasury Secretary Henry ""Hank"" Paulson told a packed courtroom on Monday that AIG shareholders were singled out for punishment as part of the U.S. government's attempt to contain the contagion of the 2008 financial crisis.The testimony from Paulson appeared to bolster some claims contained in a lawsuit brought by former AIG Chief Executive Hank Greenberg, who contends the terms of a government loan to AIG cheated its shareholders.""AIG, either fairly or unfairly, ... became a symbol for all that is bad on Wall Street,"" Paulson said as he testified about  the U.S. government's bailout of the insurance giant, which  began with a $85 billion loan from the New York Federal Reserve in September 2008.Paulson, testifying in federal court in Washington, also said he supported the loan and its terms as appropriate for the circumstances. Paulson was a chief architect of the U.S. government's response to the unprecedented global credit crisis. He has since written a book about the experience, but Monday's courtroom setting put Paulson on the hot seat in a way he has not experienced since Congress wrapped up its hearings on the subject years ago.In the case of AIG, the Fed initially charged a high interest rate for the first loan and required a nearly 80 percent stake in the company in exchange, which Greenberg's lawyers have said was illegal.Paulson said such terms were necessary to protect against ""moral hazard,"" or concerns that other companies would take reckless risks under the belief that the government would bail them out with few consequences.

353,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Greg Roumeliotis  Oct 9 Morgan Stanley is embracing the financial reforms intended to curb its animal spirits to generate bigger profits.Unlike most of its rivals, Morgan Stanley has been building its private equity business using structures that are subject to the Volcker rule, which restricts the amount of money a bank and its employees can contribute to such funds. This, in turn, limits their profit-sharing and, some would argue, their alignment with investors' interests.For Morgan Stanley, the sixth biggest U.S. bank by assets, putting less capital into private equity funds makes sense, people familiar with the bank's strategy said. Under Chief Executive James Gorman, 56, managing clients' wealth has replaced businesses like bond trading and principal investing as the prime supplier of profits. Collecting steady fees without risking much money is more aligned with Gorman's goals than investing alongside clients with the potential of bigger rewards.""The private equity business is the best business model in financial services, hands down,"" said Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co, who covers banks and private equity firms. ""People think of it as a risky business but it's not really. Come hell or high water, you're going to collect your base management fee.""This year, Morgan Stanley has been tapping its network of institutional and individual investors to raise several new funds. In addition to a $1.7 billion Asia-focused private equity fund the bank closed in July, it's also trying to raise $4 billion for a global infrastructure fund, $2.5 billion for a global real estate fund, and $1 billion for a credit fund, according to people familiar with the matter.Reuters has learned the bank is also considering raising another global private equity fund whose target size has not yet been determined, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It would be the first such private equity fund Morgan Stanley has raised since 2008.Kotowski reckons that if a bank contributes just 3 percent of the capital in a private equity fund and the fund's returns are zero, the banks still earns a pre-tax return-on-equity of 24 percent because of management fees. At a 10-percent return, the bank would generate a return-on-equity of 69 percent, and at 25 percent it would generate return-on-equity of 136 percent, thanks to added performance fees. Return-on-equity is a measure of how much profit the bank can wring from its balance sheet for shareholders.""As the return goes to zero you're still solidly profitable but you have nice upside when things work out,"" Kotowski said. ""It's great work if you can get it.""Morgan Stanley declined to comment on its private equity plans.VOLCKER RULE Attracting institutional investors has become more difficult because the Volcker rule caps U.S. banks' and their staff's investments in private equity funds at 3 percent. That has made some big investors less inclined to invest in funds housed within banks, because they prefer managers that have more ""skin in the game.""The rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, has led many of Morgan Stanley's U.S. competitors to exit private equity funds or raise money outside of a fund structure. Even as it stuck with the private equity business, Morgan Stanley had to make changes to mitigate the rule's effect. For example, the bank now shares more of the performance fees it receives with its staff, Reuters first reported in 2012.Building the business will help the bank attain a firm-wide return-on-equity target of at least 10 percent that Gorman has set.That goal has been difficult to meet because of new capital requirements that are punitive to a big book of fixed-income assets Morgan Stanley is now winding down.Last year, Morgan Stanley's return on average common equity was 5 percent, excluding an accounting oddity known as debt valuation adjustments. In the first six months of this year it's risen to 9.5 percent. Investment management had the highest return-on-equity of any business, at 17.7 percent, and the bank is aiming to bring that up to 20 percent.Merchant banking and real estate investing - Morgan Stanley's formal name for the business that includes private equity funds - accounts for about 10 percent of the $396 billion in assets under management in Morgan Stanley's investment-management business.Most of those funds were raised before the financial crisis, and before Morgan Stanley had acquired the Smith Barney business from Citigroup Inc, making it the world's largest wealth management platform by brokerage force. Individual investor money has historically accounted for between 8 percent and 30 percent of funds Morgan Stanley has raised, according to a person familiar with the matter. The portion could go higher, but it is unlikely that a private equity fund will have more than half of its dollars coming from individuals, this person said.To be sure, Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit has an ""open architecture"" platform - meaning its brokers and private bankers are prohibited from prodding clients to buy Morgan Stanley products over others. Still, the business touches scores of millionaires and family offices across the U.S., giving it an in-house network of potential investors that is unparalleled in private equity fund-raising.CLOSEST RIVAL Morgan Stanley's business plan differs from its closest rival, Goldman Sachs, whose strategy still largely centers on putting capital to work in trades, loans and investments. Goldman executives have said they are committed to the same trading businesses that Morgan Stanley is de-emphasizing, and that they have no plans to scale back.Goldman has a fairly consistent track record of putting capital to work in lucrative ways - including its mortgage bets leading up to and out of the financial crisis, its presence as a market-maker in early 2009 when most competitors were still reeling from the crisis and its lucrative principal investments including its role in the buyout of discount retailer Dollar General Inc. Its top management comes from the trading business and its risk-management division is known to have greater sway internally than its traders.Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, was known for having a muddled strategy under chaotic management teams before Gorman took over, and for playing catch-up to Goldman in the approach to the financial crisis. Under Gorman, who fortified his career in Merrill Lynch's retail brokerage, the bank has been working to de-risk its businesses and focus on steadier revenue streams. Goldman has kept the fund model for some of its private funds under Volcker, such as a new infrastructure fund it is considering raising, Reuters reported last week.Yet in other areas, it has raised money from investors to perform individual deals outside of a fund structure, through a business development company called Liberty Harbor, or by using individual investor accounts. It is also using its own balance sheet to do private equity deals and then syndicate some of the equity to investors.FINDING NEW MONEY Morgan Stanley's merchant banking and real estate investing business delivered $559 million worth of net revenue in the first six months of this year, up 12 percent from $498 million in the same period of 2013.The business is tiny relative to Morgan Stanley's overall income statement, representing just 3 percent of total revenue.The investment management division it sits inside of is the smallest of Morgan Stanley's three major business units. It brings in about one-fifth of the revenue that institutional securities or wealth management does. It also delivers the highest returns and profit margins, and is the only one that already meets Gorman's expense target. Its main task now is to grow.Gregory Fleming, 51, who heads both investment management and wealth management for Morgan Stanley, has set a target of $500 billion in assets.""The most important benchmark in an investment management business I say again and again, (is) performance,"" Fleming said at a conference in February. ""If you perform, existing clients will give you more money to manage and you will bring in new clients across merchant banking and real estate.""Performance is on Morgan Stanley's side as it goes about raising new funds.According to Preqin, a market research firm, four of its five funds in the private equity area are in the top 25 percent of performers; the fifth is in the second quartile. Its overall performance is behind just four other private equity firms globally.Morgan Stanley's most recent global private equity fund has posted gross returns of 27 percent, according to a person familiar with its performance. Similarly, its mezzanine credit fund has gross returns of 20 percent since inception, which is much better than the average fund, this person said.(Reporting by Lauren LaCapra and Gregory Roumeliotis.

The roles will be reversed for the $40 million of taxable bonds in the deal. Those amounts are preliminary and could change, he said. The deal will take into account the city's high debt over the next two to three years. The bonds will be issued over 25 years, although the structure has yet to be finalized,"" Stinson added.Citi and Jefferies both declined to comment on the deal. Atlantic City once had a monopoly on East Coast gambling and was the second biggest market behind Las Vegas, Nevada. The city's casino industry has been slammed by competition from nearby states, especially Pennsylvania, which overtook Atlantic City in 2012 as the second biggest U.S. gaming market. This year, four of Atlantic City's 12 casinos have closed. Another could close next month at about the same time the city will seek to bring its bond sale to the market.One big sore spot for the city's finances has been tax appeals by casinos, whose properties have lost value. The city issued bonds in recent years to help pay for those appeals, but this year's deal will be the biggest so far and will largely be used to pay an $88 million settlement with the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa.(Reporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Chris Reese and Andre Grenon)",2014-10-14,C,"Tue Oct 14, 2014 | 6:15pm EDT","UPDATE 1-Citigroup, Jefferies to lead Atlantic City bond sale",http://www.reuters.com//article/new-jersey-atlanticcity-bonds-idUSL2N0S92NE20141014?type=companyNews

356,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 14 (Fitch) Citigroup's (Citi) third quarter 2014 (3Q'14) showed  improved results from a year ago, reflecting higher revenues and a profitable  quarter in Citi Holdings. This was partially offset by higher expenses and  taxes, and a smaller reserve release, according to Fitch Ratings. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, Citi's adjusted return on assets (ROA) of 77  basis points (bps) and reported ROA of 72bps still lag peer averages, though  improved from a year ago. CVA/DVA was a negative $371 million in 3Q'14 and  included a $474 million pre-tax charge related to Citi's implementation of  funding valuation adjustments (FVA). Citi remains committed to its 90bps  reported ROA target for full-year 2015. Citi reported revenue growth (excluding CVA/DVA) of 10% from a year ago,  supported by strong M&A and underwriting activity and better trading revenues.  Fixed income was up 5% from a year ago given strength in securitized products  and rates and currencies. Revenues were also aided by gains on the sales of  consumer operations in Greece and Spain, as well as growth in consumer banking  revenues both in the U.S. and abroad. Excluding the mortgage settlement in 2Q'14, expenses increased both from a year  ago and last quarter reflecting higher legal charges and repositioning costs, an  adjustment to incentive compensation driven by better than anticipated  year-to-date performance in ICG, as well as increased regulatory and compliance  costs as Citi works to continue to improve its regulatory capital stress testing  process. Taxes were also higher in 3Q'14 as compared to both last quarter and a  year ago due to tax costs related to Citi's sale of its consumer operations in  Greece and Spain in 3Q'14. Legal related charges continue to weigh on Citi's results, with $951 million  reported in 3Q'14, costing approximately 13bps from the reported ROA (assuming a  36% tax rate). While litigation-related charges remain very elevated for all of  the large banks, in Fitch's view, Citi also remains exposed to LIBOR, currency  trading, and credit-default swap investigations, though Fitch notes that  visibility into future legal-related costs is very limited.  Citi also disclosed that as part of an outside review that was initiated in  July, Citi uncovered illegal conduct in Banamex's personal security services  unit, which provides security services for executives and Board members. Related  to this, Citi incurred a $15 million charge, and has since disbanded the unit.  While the charge is immaterial relative to overall results, it does point to the  challenges Citi continues to face in effectively identifying, monitoring, and  mitigating risk across its global franchise.  Fitch continues to recognize the  enhancements it has made to its overall risk management framework. However,  Citi's ratings could be vulnerable to a large operational loss that depletes  capital in a material way, or if an operational event calls into question  Fitch's assessment of Citi's risk management function. Fitch views Citi's plan to exit consumer operations in 11 countries (or a third  of its international consumer footprint) favorably as the company continues to  streamline its consumer franchise and allocate resources to markets with the  best return potential. On a pro forma Citicorp-basis, the last 12 months ROA  would have improved by 1bp excluding results from these 11 countries.  While the pro forma financial impact appears somewhat muted, from a creditor  perspective, continued streamlining of operations is viewed favorably as it  incrementally reduces operational, credit, and reputational risk abroad. Citi  disclosed that substantially all of these sales will be completed by year-end  2015, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. Citi's new consumer  banking footprint will still serve retail customers in 24 markets that capture  over 95% of Global Consumer Banking's existing revenue base.  Fitch notes that net charge-offs (NCOs) in Latin American continue to  deteriorate while North America and Asia continue to improve. As a result, Fitch  expects Citi to maintain a conservative approach to loan loss reserve levels in  the international consumer segment.  Citi continues to wind down its assets, and ended the quarter with $103 billion  in total assets at Citi Holdings or 5% of consolidated assets. Citi Holdings  also reported a $238 million profit during the quarter. Much of the quarterly  profit in Citi Holdings was attributed to gains on the sale of consumer  operations in Greece and Spain. Citi's capital ratios continued to remain very good and generally above global  peers. The company's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully  phased-in basis improved to 10.7% at quarter-end, and Citi was able to utilize  approximately $700 million of its DTA in 3Q'14 and $2.9 billion year-to-date  which aids capital accretion as roughly $40 billion was disallowed from  regulatory capital ratios at year-end 2013. Utilization of the DTA added 48bps  to the CET1 ratio during the year, which was offset by approximately $56 billion  of additional operational risk-weighted assets related to Citi's approved exit  from Basel III parallel reporting, effective last quarter.  Citi also reported that it would already be in compliance with the supplementary  leverage ratio at the holding company with a 6% ratio.

""If this market doesn't calm down and we continue to see sentiment turn negative, it could set up for a difficult period over the next two months,"" he said.While up, indexes were well off their highs for the session as energy shares extended their recent slide along with oil prices. The S&P energy index was down 0.1 percent for the day and 8.5 percent for the year.Early third-quarter earnings reports have been mixed, but Citigroup, up 2.7 percent at $51.26, was among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P index after the bank posted better-than-expected quarterly results and said it would pull out of consumer banking in 11 markets. JPMorgan Chase shares lost 0.3 percent to $58, after the biggest U.S. bank reported a lower-than-expected third-quarter profit. Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank, lost 1.1 percent to $49.65 after its results.The S&P financial index gained 1 percent. Eight of the 10 major S&P sectors were in positive territory, led by industrials, up 1.9 percent.The S&P 500 index on Monday closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 16, 2012, and is now 5.6 percent below its record closing high on Sept. 18. S&P 500 companies are expected to show earnings growth of 6.4 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, with 4 percent revenue growth expected. After the close, Dow component and chipmaker Intel is set to post results.At 2:50 p.m. Eastern time, the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 65.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,386.87, the S&P 500 gained 11.88 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,886.62 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.42 points, or 0.72 percent, to 4,244.07.The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Delta Air Lines, which rose 6.2 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Gilead, down 4.4 percent.Advancing issues were outnumbering declining ones on the NYSE by 2,068 to 983, for a 2.10-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,785 issues were rising and 884 falling for a 2.02-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 index was posting 10 new 52-week highs and 23 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 19 new highs and 153 new lows.

361,"  Oct 14 Citigroup Inc said on Tuesday it would exit consumer banking in 11 markets, as the most international of the big U.S. banks looks to shrink its way to better profits.Citigroup also reported a 13 percent rise in adjusted third-quarter net profit, helped by better results from its portfolio of troubled assets left over from the financial crisis. Adjusted net profit for the quarter rose to $3.67 billion, or $1.15 per share, from $3.26 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.

369,"  * Australian bank continues push into commodities trading* Deal includes uranium stockpiles valued at around $200 mlnBy David SheppardLONDON, Oct 21 Australian investment bank Macquarie Group has bought Deutsche Bank's uranium book, a source familiar with the matter said, as the increasingly commodities-focused lender pushes deeper into global energy trading.The deal includes Deutsche's long-term trading contracts and stockpiles of low-grade uranium yellowcake, which were valued at the end of last year at around $200 million.Industry experts say they comprise enough uranium to fuel around 10 average-sized nuclear power plants for 12-18 months.The source said the deal was completed late this summer, but did not reveal how much it was worth.Macquarie has been growing its global energy business and is now seen as a top-five player amongst banks in raw materials trading, with the Australian firm expanding even as rivals retreat in the face of tighter regulations and lower margins.The Australian bank previously looked at buying Goldman Sachs' uranium trading business at the beginning of this year, sources said, but that deal appears to have fallen by the wayside. Goldman was the only other investment bank known to trade uranium in early 2014. A spokeswoman for Macquarie in London declined any comment.In the 12 months to March, Macquarie earned A$1.1 billion ($970 million) in net income from commodities trading, propelling it into the big leagues of much-larger American rivals who have long dominated the sector.The top 10 banks tracked by British consulting company Coalition (not including Macquarie) together made $4.5 billion trading commodities in 2013, a report from the firm said earlier this year, down from more than triple that in 2008.Walter Pye, who heads up Macquarie's fixed-income, currency and commodities division for the Americas, has described its natural resource trading operations as like a ""commodity company within a bank"". For a bank that has financed a large part of Australia's natural resources boom over the last decade, including uranium miners, the trading operation is seen by some as a good fit.While prices of yellowcake - known as U308 UX-U3O8-SPT in the industry - have declined markedly since the Fukushima disaster in Japan, hitting a nine-year low of $28 a pound in June, they have rallied by around 25 percent since then.Macquarie's own mining and metals analysts have cautioned, however, that the price jump may not last, with oversupply still dominating a market that traded closer to $70 a pound before Fukushima sharply curbed demand in early 2011.Deutsche announced it was largely exiting commodity trading in December, with Citigroup Inc buying most of its energy and metals book. URANIUM SUPERPOWER Australia's uranium reserves are the world's largest, according to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), accounting for almost a third of known global deposits. New mines are planned, the WNA said in an updated country profile this month.The country's existing three mines produced 7,488 tonnes of U3O8 last year, making it the world's third-largest uranium producer after Kazakhstan and Canada.About 80 percent of global uranium supplies are traded via long-term contracts between producers and utilities, but around 20 percent of deals are done in the spot market, which sets the marginal price, according to the WNA.Goldman and Deutsche entered the uranium market in 2009, when tightening supplies threatened to send prices soaring before Fukushima. They would grow to handle almost a third of all uranium trades in the spot market, according to sources.Market participants say yellowcake trading is safe, with banks taking no risk in transporting the radioactive material, only taking title to the yellowcake once it is in secure storage facilities.Trading firms hold uranium stockpiles in warehouses specially licensed to store the fuel, like U.S. conglomerate Honeywell International Inc's ConverDyn facility in Illinois; Cameco's Port Hope facility in Ontario; and Areva SA's facility in France.

371,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. judge has scheduled a Dec. 2 hearing to weigh whether or not Citigroup Inc (C.N) can process an expected interest payment by Argentina on bonds issued under its local laws following its 2002 default.The hearing before U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan, set out in an order issued late Wednesday, would be  less than a month before a Dec. 31 interest payment by Argentina on the bonds is due.Citigroup has said it faces regulatory and criminal sanctions by Argentina, which defaulted again in July, if it cannot process the country's interest payments on U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued under Argentine law.Argentina defaulted in July after refusing to honor a court order to pay $1.33 billion plus interest to so-called ""holdout"" bondholders led by Elliott Management's NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management when it paid holders of bonds swapped during the country's 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings.The hedge funds had spurned Argentina's past restructurings, which resulted in exchanges for about 92 percent of the country's defaulted debt. Investors who accepted Argentina's terms were paid less than 30 cents on the dollar on average. Griesa, who oversees the litigation, in July blocked Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) from processing a $539 million interest payment on what the country says is over $28 billion in restructured debt. That order sent Argentina on a course to default after failing to reach a settlement with the holdouts.Separately, the federal appeals court in New York on Thursday scheduled a Dec. 17 oral argument for Argentina's appeal of a September 2013 order from Griesa, requiring the country and 29 non-party banks to comply with dozens of subpoenas and information requests from the holdouts. Argentina said these demands were overbroad, and that the holdouts should not be allowed to pursue property protected by treaty or federal law. The holdouts said Argentina cannot be trusted to decide which property is immune from their claims.Citigroup had sought Griesa's guidance on whether it could process interest payments it received from Argentina on bonds issued under its own laws.Griesa has for the last two quarters allowed Citigroup's  branch in Argentina to make one-time payments to bondholders. In a letter Tuesday, Citigroup urged the judge to schedule a hearing again on the holdouts' request to block the payments. A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment. Representatives for the holdouts either had no immediate comment or did not respond to requests for comment.The hearing's scheduling came a day after the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York dismissed Argentina's appeal of Griesa's order directing BNY Mellon to hold onto the $539 million the country deposited with it.

The banks are aiming to settle for a total of around 1.5 billion pounds sterling, or $2.42 billion, sources have told Reuters. Barclays Plc, another of the six banks, said earlier on Thursday that it had set aside 500 million pounds for the third quarter to cover potential fines.Big banks have paid billions of dollars in recent years to settle investigations into their mortgage lending, commodities and interest-rate trading, and a wide range of other activities. Authorities have broadly been trying to hold banks accountable for the excesses that led to the financial crisis. While the legal costs have dragged down profits, weighed on share prices, and consumed managements' time at the banks, they have not forced banks to raise money by issuing shares, and are not expected to. Citigroup, for example, is likely to make nearly $28 billion in pre-tax profits over the next five quarters, way more than enough to cover heightened legal expenses, according to analysts at Bernstein Research.   The bank's shares fell 2 percent to $52.05 in extended trading after it revised down its third-quarter net income to $2.84 billion from the $3.44 billion it had posted on Oct. 14. On a per-share basis, Citigroup adjusted its profit to 88 cents for the quarter. It had earlier reported a profit of $1.07 per share.  Like most banks, Citigroup does not disclose how much money it has set aside to cover legal costs that it can dip into in the future, known as its ""reserves.""

380,"  * Says reviewing dividend policy for increased payout ratio* Confirms outlook seeing revenue down, ""flattish"" profit* Q3 net profit above estimates, helped by low risk costs* To look at Citi consumer banking assets coming up for sale   (Adds analyst, shares, comments on dividend, outlook, Citi sale)By Jason HovetPRAGUE, Nov 6 Czech lender Komercni Banka  posted higher than expected third-quarter net profit on Thursday and signalled it would look at paying a higher dividend ratio in the future, boosting shares.The Czech Republic's third largest bank by assets also confirmed net profit would be ""flattish"" in 2014 and said lending continued to grow as the economy gained steam.Attributable net profit rose 0.6 percent to 3.27 billion crowns ($147.35 million) in the third quarter, above estimates thanks to lower risk costs and higher net interest income.Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast on average that net profit would fall to 3.14 billion crowns. The capital adequacy of the bank, which is 60 percent owned by France's Societe Generale, stands at 17.1 percent, above its target of 15-16 percent.Komercni Banka also said it was reviewing its dividend guidance of paying out 60-70 percent of net profit.""We see 100 percent dividend payout ratio as a clear ceiling which we don't want to exceed in our considerations,"" said Chief Financial Officer Libor Lofler.""We are putting (the policy) under review for (an) increased dividend payout in the range of 70-100 percent.""The bank had said before it was considering a change to its dividend policy to reflect high capital generation, but analysts said the clear signal lifted shares, which traded 1.7 percent higher at 4,770 crowns at midday. GUIDANCE INTACT Like other Czech lenders, Komercni Banka has been hit by official rates near zero for the last two years along with central bank efforts to keep the crown currency weak until 2016 to fight deflation risks and help the economy.The Czech economy is gaining momentum, expanding 2.5 percent year-on-year in the second quarter after exiting a record-long recession at the beginning of 2013. Lofler told Reuters last month the bank expected shrinking risk costs and a recovery in corporate lending to keep its full-year net profit steady on the year in 2014. He repeated that outlook on Thursday, reiterating banking revenue should decline less than 2 percent.The bank's cost of risk, reflecting provisions against losses from loans and investments, fell 20 percent year-on-year in the third quarter. Net banking income was up almost 2 percent while net fees and commission fell 8 percent year-on-year.""Cost of risk remains at record low levels... and should continue this trend,"" Patria Finance analyst Tomas Tomcany said. ""We see some pickup in consumer and especially corporate loans... This could offset pressure on net interest margin.""Lending grew 4 percent in the nine-month period. The bank expects a 3 percent rise in lending for the full year.Komercni Banka Chief Executive Albert Le Dirac'h said there was a good chance the positive economic trend would continue, although risks were coming from a slowdown in the euro zone and crisis in Ukraine.The bank also said it would look at assets coming up for sale after Citigroup Inc said last month it was pulling out of consumer banking in 11 markets, including the Czech Republic. But Le Dirac'h added no process had yet started.($1 = 22.1920 Czech crown)   (Editing by Pravin Char, Susan Thomas and Crispian Balmer)",2014-11-06,C,"Thu Nov 6, 2014 | 6:20am EST","UPDATE 2-Komercni Banka beats Q3 profit estimates, signals higher dividend",http://www.reuters.com//article/komercni-banka-results-idUSL6N0SW1VZ20141106?type=companyNews

Griesa in July blocked Bank of New York Mellon Corp  from processing a $539 million interest payment.Monday's order marked the third time this year that Griesa had allowed Citigroup's branch in Argentina to process a payment to bondholders. Argentina's economy ministry issued a statement criticizing Griesa for taking a piecemeal approach to the question.""With this latest postponement of a final decision, Judge Griesa continues harming the Republic (of Argentina) and the thousands of bondholders that are being held hostage by the vulture funds,"" the statement said, using the government's favorite term to describe the holdout hedge funds. The holdouts get their name from the fact that rather than participating in Argentina's 2005 and 2010 restructurings, which offered around 30 cents on the dollar, they held out for a better deal and sued in U.S. courts.The funds, including Elliott Management's NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management, spurned restructurings in which about 92 percent of Argentina's defaulted debt was swapped for new obligations.Daniel Pollack, the court-appointed mediator, told Reuters he thought Griesa was ""giving the parties every opportunity to settle this long-running dispute.""""It is my hope that the parties will return to the bargaining table promptly after January 1,"" Pollack added.

388,"  SINGAPORE Nov 11 Citigroup has slashed its iron ore price forecast for 2015, predicting the steelmaking ingredient could drop below $60 per tonne in the most bearish estimate yet from a financial institution on the glut-hit commodity.""We expect renewed supply growth to once again drive the market lower in 2015, combined with further demand weakness,"" the U.S. investment bank said in a report on Tuesday.Prices have tumbled more than 40 percent this year on massive oversupply and worries over appetite in key buyer China.Citigroup expects iron ore to average $60 a tonne in the third quarter of next year, down from a previous forecast of $78 and to briefly dip below $60 during that period. It sees iron ore averaging $65 per tonne in both 2015 and 2016, down from an estimated $98 this year.A ramp-up in output by top, low-cost producers at a time when demand growth in top iron ore buyer China was slowing has driven prices to five-year lows. At $75.50 per tonne .IO62-CNI=SI, iron ore has lost nearly 44 percent this year, the hardest hit among industrial commodities. Citigroup's revision follows downgrades by other financial institutions.ANZ Bank on Monday cut its 2015 iron ore forecast to $78 a tonne from $101, and its 2016 estimate to $85 from $95. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have put their 2015 forecasts at $87 and $80 respectively. At below $60 a tonne for iron ore, margins for even low-cost producers would get thinner. Australia's Rio Tinto, the world's No. 2 iron ore miner, had the lowest cash cost in the industry at $20.40 a tonne in the first half of 2014.Sustained prices at $60-levels would be needed to curtail production outside China, Citigroup said, adding that Chinese iron ore output would need to fall further.""We find only modest cutbacks are likely if iron ore remains in the $70s, with sustained prices in the $60s needed to prompt significant cutbacks,"" it said.

389,"   By Kirstin Ridley, Joshua Franklin and Aruna Viswanatha | LONDON/ZURICH/NEW YORK  LONDON/ZURICH/NEW YORK Regulators fined six major banks a total of $4.3 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate the foreign exchange market, following a yearlong global investigation. HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, UBS AG and Bank of America Corp all faced penalties resulting from the inquiry, which has put the largely unregulated $5-trillion-a-day market on a tighter leash, accelerated the push to automate trading and ensnared the Bank of England.Authorities accused dealers of sharing confidential information about client orders and coordinating trades to boost their own profits. The foreign exchange benchmark they allegedly manipulated is used by asset managers and corporate treasurers to value their holdings.Dealers used code names to identify clients without naming them and swapped information in online chatrooms with pseudonyms such as ""the players"", “the 3 musketeers” and “1 team, 1 dream."" Those who were not involved were belittled, and traders used obscene language to congratulate themselves on quick profits made from their scams, authorities said.Wednesday's fines bring total penalties for benchmark manipulation to more than $10 billion over two years. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority levied the biggest penalty in the history of the City of London, $1.77 billion, against five of the lenders.""Today's record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found, and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right,"" FCA Chief Executive Officer Martin Wheatley said. He said bank managers needed to keep a closer eye on their traders rather than leaving it to compliance departments, which make sure employees follow the rules.The investigation already has triggered major changes to the market. Banks have suspended or fired more than 30 traders, clamped down on chatrooms and boosted their use of automated trading. World leaders are expected to sign off on regulatory changes to benchmarks this weekend at the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia.In the United States, which has typically been more aggressive on enforcement than other jurisdictions, the Department of Justice, Federal Reserve and New York's financial regulator are still probing banks over foreign exchange trading. EXASPERATION  Regulators said the misconduct at the banks ran from 2008 until October 2013, more than a year after U.S. and British authorities started punishing banks for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor), an interest rate benchmark. The foreign exchange probe has wrapped up faster than that investigation did, and Wednesday's fines reflected cooperation from the banks. Britain's FCA said the five banks in its action received a 30 percent discount on the fines for settling early.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered the same five banks to pay an extra $1.48 billion. Swiss regulator FINMA also ordered UBS, the country's biggest bank, to pay 134 million francs ($139 million) and cap dealers' bonuses over misconduct in foreign exchange and precious metals trading.The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined the U.S. lenders a total of $950 million. It was the only authority to penalize Bank of America.More penalties are likely to follow. Barclays Plc, which was not included in Wednesday's settlement, said it had pulled out of talks with the FCA and the CFTC to try to seek ""a more general co-ordinated settlement"" with other regulators that are investigating its activities.The FCA said its enforcement activities were focused on those five plus Barclays, signaling it would not fine Deutsche Bank AG.  The CFTC declined to comment on whether it was looking at other banks.Britain's Serious Fraud Office is conducting a criminal investigation, and disgruntled customers can still pursue civil litigation.RBS, which is 80 percent owned by the British government, received client complaints about foreign exchange trading as far back as 2010. The bank said it regretted not responding more quickly. The other banks were similarly apologetic. BANK OF ENGLAND The currency inquiry struck at the heart of the British establishment and the City of London, the global hub for foreign exchange dealing.The Bank of England said on Wednesday that its chief foreign exchange dealer, Martin Mallet, had not alerted his bosses that traders were sharing information.The British central bank, whose governor, Mark Carney, is leading global regulatory efforts to reform financial benchmarks, has dismissed Mallet but said he had not done anything illegal or improper.It also said it had scrapped regular meetings with London-based chief currency dealers, a sign the BOE wants to put a distance between it and the banks after the scandal.Shares of banks involved in the settlement were down slightly Wednesday afternoon. Bank of America dipped 0.2 percent, JPMorgan fell 1.6 percent, and Citi was 0.6 percent lower.RBS was down 1 percent, HSBC was down 0.3 percent, and UBS was down 0.1 percent in after-hours trading.(1 US dollar = 0.9630 Swiss franc) (Additional reporting by Steve Slater, Huw Jones, Jamie McGeever, Clare Hutchison and Matt Scuffham in London and Katharina Bart in Zurich; Writing by Carmel Crimmins and Emily Stephenson; Editing by Alexander Smith, Anna Willard, David Stamp and Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-11-12,C,"Wed Nov 12, 2014 | 5:10pm EST",Regulators fine global banks $4.3 billion in currency investigation,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-banks-forex-settlement-cftc-idUSKCN0IW0E520141112?type=companyNews

399,"   By Mike Stone and Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Citigroup Inc is considering a sale of its index business, two sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday, making it the latest bank to think about jettisoning benchmarking amid increased regulatory scrutiny.The value the Citi Fixed Income Indices business could not be learned. About $174 billion in exchange traded fund and mutual fund assets track Citigroup indexes, according to Morningstar. There are even more institutional assets that track these indexes, although the firm does not disclose that number. Offerings include the World Government Bond Index, which the Citi website calls its flagship. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.  Large banks are increasingly looking to exit index benchmarking as regulators increase their scrutiny, looking at issues such as transparency and potential conflicts of interest, said Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI, a London-based research firm. Barclays Plc, for example, is selling its benchmark business, best known for the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, although that auction is struggling.  At the same time, there is growing demand from firms that already own indexes to expand their offerings through acquisitions because more money is flowing into index-based funds and exchange-traded funds. Investors have poured $401.3 billion into index funds and ETFs since January 2008, according to Lipper, a division of Thomson Reuters. ""Firms that are already in the indexing space want to have economies of scale so they can reduce their costs,"" Fuhr said.      Exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group Inc and index provider S&P Dow Jones Indices told Reuters earlier this year they were interested in acquisitions to grow their index businesses.

401,"  WASHINGTON Nov 19 The U.S. Department of Justice collected a record $24.7 billion in penalties from fraud and other cases in fiscal year 2014, the agency said on Wednesday, as fines against banks for financial misconduct soared.Collections from civil and criminal actions, including money collected on behalf of other agencies, was $8 billion in 2013, and $13 billion in 2012. Collections in 2014 were boosted by multi-billion dollar payouts from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc   to resolve claims they misled investors about the quality of mortgage bonds in the run up to the financial crisis, and include $11 billion in payments made to federal agencies or states. Payouts in fiscal year 2014, which ended Sept. 30, also include hundreds of millions of dollars in fines levied on UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.

409,"  * Citigroup, Deutsche Bank among banks picked* Roadshows begin in UAE, then London and Singapore* Benchmark-sized sukuk to follow   (Adds details, background)HONG KONG, Nov 23 Pakistan has mandated four banks to arrange fixed income investor meetings starting Monday ahead of a potential issue of a U.S. dollar-denominated Islamic bond, a document from lead managers said on Sunday.The sovereign, rated Caa1 by Moody's and B- by Standard & Poor's, has picked Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank and Standard Chartered to arrange the roadshows and the possible deal, it showed.Pakistan will hold roadshows in the United Arab Emirates on Monday, before heading to London and Singapore on Tuesday, with a 144A-compliant, benchmark-sized sukuk to follow, subject to market conditions, the document added. Benchmark size is traditionally understood to mean upwards of $500 million. If a debt issue is 144A-compliant, investors in the United States can buy the offering.The sukuk uses a sharia-compliant sale and lease-back structure to underpin the transaction. Proceeds will be used to purchase land comprising the M-2 Motorway, which connects Lahore to the capital Islamabad. Political instability in Pakistan had temporarily caused some uncertainty around the sovereign sukuk issue as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came under pressure from weeks of demonstrations calling on him to resign.Pakistan, a favourite with frontier market investors since peaceful elections were held there last year, sold $2 billion of dollar-denominated bonds in April after attracting $7 billion in investor orders.In September 2013, the IMF saved Pakistan from possible default by agreeing to lend it $6.7 billion over three years. The sukuk will be issued by Pakistan International Sukuk Company and is expected to be listed in the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.Pakistan's external debt was about 19 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on June 30 and it had a fiscal deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP in 2013-2014, it showed.(Reporting by Umesh Desai; Writing by Archana Narayanan; Editing by David French and Raissa Kasolowsky)",2014-11-23,C,"Sun Nov 23, 2014 | 5:23am EST","UPDATE 1-Pakistan picks banks to hold dollar sukuk roadshows, will start Monday",http://www.reuters.com//article/pakistan-sukuk-idUSL6N0TD05U20141123?type=companyNews

414,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citigroup, Inc.'s (Citi)  long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The  affirmation reflects an improving risk profile, and solid capital and liquidity  profiles. This also incorporates a forward-looking view of Citi's earnings  profile, and that its performance will improve and converge to peer averages  over time. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action  commentary. The rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. On balance, Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable. The 12  banks have continued to strengthen their balance sheets in 9M14. Capitalisation  has improved materially over the past two years and liquidity remains sound.  This strengthening balances continued pressure on earnings, particularly in  securities businesses, and remaining material but unpredictable exposure to  conduct and regulatory risks.  Fitch forecasts weak growth in the eurozone during 2015 while growth in the US  and UK is expected to be somewhat stronger, which should help the GTUBs with a  significant presence in these regions. Spikes in market volatility, most  recently in October 2014, show that uncertainty remains over how expectations of  rising interest rates in the US will affect financial markets. Our expectation  is that rises in interest rates will be gradual and would follow improved  prospects for the economy, which should help business volumes. Sharp and  unexpected hikes in US interest rates would likely result in increased market  volatility and, consequently, additional pressure on banks' earnings, although  we believe that the GTUBs' risk appetite has declined.  Lower risk appetite should help the banks avoid material losses on trading  positions but an adverse operating environment could result in a change of our  outlook if earnings prospects suffer materially. For eurozone-focused banks, a  prolonged deflationary scenario would put pressure on earnings and could result  in a changed outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Citi's ratings are supported by its solid liquidity and capital levels. Citi's  fully phased-in CET1 under Basel III improved to 10.7% at Sept. 30, 2014, higher  than many of its U.S.-based GTUB peers. The company's liquidity profile is much  improved with a large percentage of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) as a  percentage of assets at Sept. 30, 2014 (22%).  The company's capital and  liquidity are much improved from pre-crisis levels, and key rating drivers. Citi has also made considerable progress in winding down legacy higher risk  assets in Citi Holdings, with non-core assets now comprising just 5% of  consolidated assets. Citi has also de-risked its balance sheet in other ways,  with a few examples including lower balances of trading assets, reduced volume  and extended tenor of repos, and reduced and manageable exposure to leveraged  lending.  The company also continues to make progress in meeting its strategic objectives.  Fitch views the planned exit of consumer operations from 11 markets and the  consumer finance business in Korea favorably as it helps to reduce future  operational, compliance, and credit risk.  Fitch views Citi's strategy as  appropriate in light of the evolving regulatory and economic environment. Given  the breadth and complexity of its global operations, continued streamlining of  business operations and legal entities is viewed favorably from a risk  management and creditor perspective.  Through the first nine months of 2014, Citi has made modest progress in  improving its core earnings profile despite a challenging economic and operating  environment.  Despite this, the company's reported return on assets (ROA) in the  third quarter of 2014 (3Q'14) period was 59 basis points (bps), which lags peer  averages, and is below its 90bps ROA target for 2015. This takes into account  the additional legal-related charges that were disclosed after earnings were  first released.  Fitch's rating actions incorporate a forward-looking view of Citi's ability to  execute on its strategy, including its ability to successfully meet financial  targets, over the near- to intermediate-term.  Although not currently assumed  nor incorporated in today's rating action, Fitch is sensitive to increased risk  taking on the company's part in order to meet its 2015 financial targets.  As  such, any perceived changes to the company's risk appetite will be monitored  closely.  Fitch notes that Citi also compares favourably to many of its peers with regard  to compliance with various regulatory rules, including compliance with fully  phased-in requirements for Basel III capital ratios, the U.S.-based Supplemental  Leverage Ratio at both Holding Company and Bank-levels, and the U.S.-finalized  LCR rule. Its compliance is well ahead of phased-in timelines for these pending  rules, and as such, its balance sheet and earnings profile have likely also  already incorporated the impacts of all these rules.  While Citi's higher  relative reliance on short-term funding may translate into a higher G-SIB buffer  when the U.S. rolls out its rules, this would be viewed favorably from a  creditor perspective as it would entail even greater loss protection for  unexpected losses.  Citi made significant strides in addressing some of its material mortgage-related issues. However, Citi is still exposed to potential litigation  risk stemming from its role in setting interbank offered rates, foreign currency  trading, credit default swaps and private-label securitizations. As such, Citi  is still exposed to elevated legal risk and associated costs.  Fitch's ratings  incorporate an expectation that legal charges will remain manageable in the  context of Citi's capital profile, though visibility into future legal-related  costs is very limited. The restatement of earnings in the third quarter resulted  from ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies related to  previously-disclosed matters.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch sees limited near-term upward rating momentum given a relatively high and  absolute rating. The company's complex organizational structure and reliance on  more volatile capital markets revenues act as a key constraint to further upward  movement to ratings.   Any unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other legal-related charges could  have adverse rating implications for Citi.  Litigation charges have weighed down  earnings for the largest banks, and will likely continue to impact earnings over  the near term. Fitch notes there is very little visibility into legal-related  risk for Citi or the industry, though Fitch's ratings action expects litigation  costs will remain manageable relative to capital for Citi.  However, a fine that  was to deplete capital in a material way may lead to negative rating action.  Fitch still views Citi's risk management infrastructure as enhanced since the  financial crisis, notwithstanding the CCAR qualitative objection and the risk  management failures in the Mexican subsidiary. Citi's ratings could be  vulnerable to a large operational loss or if an operational event calls into  question Fitch's assessment of Citi's risk management function and its ability  to accurately identify, monitor, and mitigate risks throughout the organization.  In addition, a second CCAR objection due to qualitative reasons may result in a  downgrade of the VR.  Downward pressure on the VR may also result from a material deterioration in  capital or liquidity levels. It is the strength of the liquidity and capital  profiles that underpin Citi's ratings. Fitch's ratings action incorporates an  expectation that Citi will manage its capital and liquidity profiles relatively  conservatively, and although capital distributions will likely increase over  time, they will still be governed by regulatory stress testing and as such,  remain reasonable.  Fitch also expects a relatively conservative capital profile  is appropriate in light of economic uncertainty, potential volatility in AOCI,  and limited visibility into future legal risks.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Citi's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's  expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support from the  U.S. government (rated 'AAA'/Outlook Stable by Fitch) if required. This  expectation reflects the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks  especially given its strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming  less certain. Specific to Citi, our view of support likelihood is based mostly  on its systemic importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness given its  size and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share  and its position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy.  Citi's IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support because Citi's  VR is now equal to its SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). A key hurdle that remains is whether sufficient contingent capital  exists at the holding company to recapitalize without requiring government  assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise Citi's SR  to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' likely during the first half of 2015. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Citi and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from Citi's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Citi and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in Citi's VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY Citi's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY AND OPERATING SUBSIDIARY Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. This may result  in a possible downgrade of Citi's holding company rating, an upgrade of  operating company ratings, or no changes to ratings if Fitch's views the  long-term debt requirement assigned to Citi as providing an insufficient amount  of bail-in capital at the operating company level. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of Citi's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Citibank,  N.A. and Citibank Banamex USA are equalized across the group.  The IDRs and VRs of Citi's other major rated operating subsidiaries are  equalized with Citi's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core  to Citi's business strategy and financial profile. These entities include:  Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited,  Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Services LCC, Citibank  Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, CitiFinancial Europe plc, and Citibank International  Limited (formerly known as Citibank International PLC), whose IDRs would be  sensitive to the same factors that might drive a change in Citi's IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of Citi to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in Citi's IDRs.  To the extent that one of Citi's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from Citi's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS Citi's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. However, Citi's uninsured  deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift because they do  not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the deposit is  expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States. Since Fitch  cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do  not get the rating uplift. KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by Citi and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in Citi's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Citigroup Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A' with a Stable Outlook;  --Senior unsecured at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Support at '1'; --Support floor at 'A'. --Subordinated at 'A-';   --Preferred at 'BB+'; --Market-linked notes at 'A emr'  --Viability Rating at 'a'.

415,"   By Jamie McGeever and Aruna Viswanatha | LONDON/WASHINGTON  LONDON/WASHINGTON U.S. prosecutors will travel to London in the coming weeks to interview traders about currency market manipulation, the latest sign that authorities are closer to filing criminal charges stemming from the long-running probe, sources told Reuters.Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice will interview current or former employees at HSBC Holdings plc, (HSBA.L) among other banks, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The plans to interview traders from HSBC do not necessarily indicate that prosecutors will file criminal charges against the bank or its employees, sources said, noting it is common for prosecutors to speak to witnesses in any criminal investigation. HSBC declined to comment.    The authorities have given banks under investigation until mid-December to turn over related information, one source said. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), UBS AG UBSN.VX, and others have disclosed that they are under criminal investigation in the foreign exchange probe. A Justice Department spokesman declined comment, as did representatives of the banks. The interviews come soon after U.S., Swiss, and British civil authorities fined those banks and others $4.3 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate the largely unregulated $5-trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. The fines brought total penalties for benchmark manipulation to more than $10 billion over two years.The Justice Department is undertaking a broad probe into whether banks have been colluding to move currency rates and boost their profits in trading, violating fraud or antitrust laws. Prosecutors are also looking at whether traders misled clients.Authorities are expected to charge individuals and banks, though institutions are likely to resolve charges through deferred prosecution agreements or guilty pleas instead of litigation. Banks in recent years have been accused of manipulating benchmarks across a series of markets. The foreign exchange benchmarks under investigation are used by asset managers and corporate treasurers to value their holdings, which run into the trillions of dollars.When announcing the civil settlement over their foreign exchange business, the banks acknowledged wrongdoing, condemned the actions of the involved employees and said they were working to fix the problems. Banks have suspended or fired more than 30 traders, clamped down on chat rooms and boosted their use of automated trading. ""NICE TEAM WORK""      Earlier this month Attorney General Eric Holder said he expected ""the beginning stages of a resolution"" of the Justice Department's investigation into the foreign exchange market to come soon. Holder also confirmed in September the department had enlisted undercover cooperators as part of its probe.     U.S. prosecutors have pursued evidence overseas in other investigations, and flew to London to meet with counterparts, share evidence and conduct joint interviews on an earlier probe into manipulating interest rate benchmarks, including Libor.    That probe has resulted in criminal charges against 11 traders and others including UBS, Dutch lender Rabobank. Two former Rabobank employees pleaded guilty.In the foreign exchange probe, U.S. authorities have leverage to obtain information from Barclays, UBS, HSBC and others because the banks are under deferred, or non-prosecution, agreements to resolve previous misconduct.     HSBC, for example, is under a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department from 2012 that resolved charges it failed to catch hundreds of millions of dollars in drug money that flowed through the bank.     The deals force the banks to turn over any information that prosecutors ask for, and open them up to possible criminal prosecution for both prior failures and crimes committed after the agreement.    The HSBC agreement specifically forces the bank to make any current and former employees available, at the bank's cost, to be interviewed by law enforcement authorities.     The civil settlement from earlier this month over currency manipulation included online chat room transcripts in which traders are seen working together to move rates at which currency pairs like the U.S. dollar and the British pound trade.    In one chat, an HSBC trader and others celebrate moving the rate: ""Well done gents,"" one said. ""Hooray nice team work,""  another responds.

416,"   By Matt Smith and David French | DUBAI  DUBAI Nov 27 Bahrain's Batelco has mandated Citigroup to sell its Jordanian mobile operator Umniah, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Umniah, Jordan's No.3 mobile operator by subscribers, competes with Zain Jordan, a unit of Kuwait's Zain, and France's Orange in the country of 7.9 million people bordering war-torn Iraq and Syria.The Bahraini former monopoly paid 156.9 million dinars ($416.2 million) for a 96 percent stake in 2006, but offloading the business could prove tough due to market dynamics.""It's early stages but I would be surprised if it gets huge interest,"" said a senior Gulf-based banker. ""It's a difficult asset in a difficult market, and most of the regional telcos who would be the natural buyers won't be interested."" The banker and another source familiar with the matter said Citigroup had been mandated for the potential sale.""Batelco's board of directors continues to explore opportunities in the sector as well as monitoring the performance of the investment portfolio,"" the company said in a bourse filing in response to media reports of a potential sale. ""Currently, no decision has been taken by the board to sell any investment.""Citi declined to comment. Batelco, which has a market capitalisation of $1.5 billion according to Reuters data, made a profit of 46.87 million dinars in the nine months to Sept. 30. Of this, Jordan accounted for 4.67 million dinars, or 10 percent.The Jordanian unit's nine-month profit fell 25 percent from a year earlier, despite its mobile subscribers increasing by 8 percent to 2.9 million over the same period.Zain is Jordan's market leader with a 39 percent share of subscribers, according to its third-quarter earnings, followed by Orange with 31 percent and Umniah on 30 percent.($1 = 0.3770 Bahraini dinars)   (Editing by David Clarke)",2014-11-27,C,"Thu Nov 27, 2014 | 9:00am EST",Bahrain's Batelco hires Citigroup to sell Jordan unit -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/bahrain-telecomm-jordan-sale-idUSL6N0TH2VS20141127?type=companyNews

423,"   By Eric Onstad | LONDON  LONDON Suspected metals fraud in China sparked claims of betrayal by both U.S. bank Citigroup Inc and trade house Mercuria over who would absorb about $270 million in exposure to financing deals, a London court heard on Wednesday.The court case that kicked off in London on Wednesday is one of a web of legal actions filed in the wake of a probe launched in May by Chinese authorities of suspected fraud at China's Qingdao port, the world's seventh busiest, and nearby Penglai.Citigroup and Mercuria Energy Trading Ltd had a close business relationship but turned on each other during a frantic several weeks after the suspected fraud was uncovered, seeking to shift financial responsibility onto each other, the court heard.Citi was worried about reporting a potential ""hole"" in its balance sheet to regulators while Mercuria was in the process of arranging a huge acquisition of the physical commodities business of bank JP Morgan Chase, lawyers said.China has been investigating whether private metals trading firm Decheng Mining and its related companies used fake warehouse receipts to obtain multiple loans secured against a single cargo of metal. But the Chinese authorities imposed a lockdown on parts of the two ports where the metal is held, preventing anyone, including Citi, Mercuria and the warehouse operators, from accessing the material, court documents said.""We expect them (Mercuria) to keep us out of a potential messy situation,"" according to an email from John Young, Citi's managing director of commodities business development, cited in court documents.Mercuria's Chief Financial Officer Guillaume Vermersch promised Citi that ""Mercuria would make Citi whole if there were issues concerning the underlying metal"", Citi lawyer Daniel Toledano said in a court document. ""This was no more than Citi expected,"" he added. Young suggested that Mercuria be reminded that it had extensive financial arrangements with Citi, including $4 billion in credit and borrowing facilities and over $14 billion of bilateral trade facilities, plus potential help in financing the purchase from JP Morgan.But Mercuria resisted what it regarded as unfair pressure. ""Mercuria was very disappointed,"" its lawyer Graham Dunning said, referring to attempts to force Mercuria to absorb the potential losses. ""It believes it is entitled to be treated better than that.""Mercuria held copper and aluminium in Chinese warehouses and agreed a series of deals that were effective loans from Citi using the metal as collateral.Under the repurchasing agreements, or repos, Citi agreed to purchase metal from Mercuria before selling it back at a slightly higher price to include interest on the effective loans.The two groups were in the midst of several repo deals when the potential fraud in China was uncovered in warehouses in both Qingdao and Penglai. Citi demanded early repayment of the repos and Mercuria refused.""Citi hoped that...it could force Mercuria to agree on its quick exit from a difficult position and hence enable Citi to fill the potential hole in its balance sheet... which was concerning the regulators in London and New York,"" Dunning said in a court document.",2014-12-03,C,"Wed Dec 3, 2014 | 1:55pm EST","Mercuria, Citi in court over China metals financing deals",http://www.reuters.com//article/china-qingdao-lawsuit-idUSL2N0TN1UF20141203?type=companyNews

""This was no more than Citi expected,"" he added. Young suggested that Mercuria be reminded that it had extensive financial arrangements with Citi, including $4 billion in credit and borrowing facilities and over $14 billion of bilateral trade facilities, plus potential help in financing the purchase from JP Morgan.  But Mercuria resisted what it regarded as unfair pressure.""Mercuria was very disappointed,"" its lawyer Graham Dunning said, referring to attempts to force Mercuria to absorb the potential losses.

Citi demanded early repayment of the repos and Mercuria refused.

428,"  Citigroup Inc will record $2.7 billion in litigation expenses and another $800 million in repositioning charges, leaving the third-largest U.S. bank ""marginally profitable"" in the fourth quarter, its chief executive officer said on Tuesday. Mike Corbat's announcement at a New York investor conference was the second time in six weeks the bank has had to tack on a massive legal charge.The costs stemmed from government investigations into possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets, setting of LIBOR interest rates and lax compliance of money laundering rules. Past legal charges have foreshadowed settlements of cases.Before the announcement, analysts had expected Citigroup would make about $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, instead of a small profit. While dealing with legal problems, Corbat has been trying to meet his profit and efficiency targets for next year. He was appointed CEO in 2012.He is also pressing for Federal Reserve approval next year to return more capital to shareholders through higher dividends and stock buybacks. The Fed rejected Citi's last request after examining how the company would manage risk to its capital under stress. Since Corbat became CEO, Citigroup has reduced its payroll by 20,000 jobs. It employed 243,000 at the end of September.It has also cut its real estate by 10 million square feet, or 15 percent, he said. The company has been closing bank branches, consolidating back-office support centers and getting out of consumer businesses that are too small to be efficient in some countries.  With the $2.7 billion in legal charges, the company has ""largely"" covered its expected liabilities, Corbat said. Repositioning charges will be lower next year, he said. The new $800 million charge was about twice as much as Citigroup has recorded in recent quarters.Corbat said he and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach saw opportunities to ""go ahead and pull some restructuring and repositioning forward"" when they went through the fourth-quarter budget. On Oct. 30, Citigroup reduced third-quarter results because of an additional $600 million in legal costs. The change took Citigroup's third-quarter profit down to $2.84 billion. Corbat also said he expects fourth-quarter revenue from capital markets trading to be down about 5 percent from a year earlier. Interest rate spreads and foreign exchange rates moved sharply in the first few weeks of the quarter and ""we didn't escape that,"" Corbat said.Citigroup stock closed down nearly 1 percent to $55.85.

430,"  (Adds Astenbeck historical fund value and year-to-date gains, paragraphs 2 and 12)By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Jonathan LeffNEW YORK Dec 9 Phibro, the storied energy trading firm run by famed oil investor Andrew Hall, is winding down in its current form, laying off some U.S. employees and pursuing a sale of some overseas operations, sources said on Tuesday.The divestment by Occidental Corp, which bought Westport, Connecticut-based Phibro from Citigroup Inc five years ago, will allow Hall to focus more squarely on his $3 billion Astenbeck hedge fund, one of the world's largest oil-focused funds. Astenbeck managed about $5 billion at its peak before being hit by dismal returns as Hall's bullish bets on oil were hurt by a downturn in crude prices.One source familiar with the change at Phibro said around a dozen U.S. employees had been informed of the job cuts earlier in the day, with more departures possible, although the group's London and Singapore desks might yet be sold. A second source also said Occidental was pursuing a partial sale of overseas units. Other traders working at the firm's headquarters, on the site of a former dairy farm along the Connecticut coast, have been retained to help run Astenbeck, the first source said.Phibro, which was born as metals and grains trader Philipp Brothers in 1901, was once a powerhouse in global oil markets, owning a string of U.S. refineries and routinely shipping millions of a barrels of oil around the world.But in recent years it adopted a much leaner approach, focusing its trading on a small handful of strategically important physical crude oil benchmarks and squeezing profits from small pricing discrepancies. Hall delved deeper into derivatives with his Astenbeck fund, which once managed over $5 billion. The wind-down will not be a big surprise to rivals. Occidental signaled early this year it was planning to pare back proprietary trading, and Phibro was quietly put up for sale. In an SEC filing last week, Occidental said it expected Phibro to ""cease to be an affiliate"" by the middle of next year.An Occidental spokesperson on Monday reiterated the company's previous statement that it was reducing prop trading as part of a strategic review to focus on core businesses. It's been a tough period for asset-light proprietary traders, with volatility in international crude markets waning and big rivals like Vitol and Glencore investing heavily in logistics and other assets to give them an edge.Other similar companies have also sought new backers. Hess Corp. sold its half-share of New York-based Hetco, a proprietary energy trading house, to a California-based distressed asset firm last month.Hall, a UK-born Oxford graduate and avid art collector, burst into wider public view in 2009 for refusing to give up a $100 million bonus from Citi, which caused a furor following the financial crisis.Following the sale to Occidental, however, his bias for bullish oil bets has not panned out. Phibro suffered its first annual loss in over a decade in 2011. Hall has managed to sidestep the worst of the oil price rout in recent months, leaving Astenbeck with a 1 percent gain in November and a 7 percent rise year-to-date, according to his Dec. 1 letter to investors seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

452,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 8 Morgan Stanley said it has raised about $1 billion for a new credit fund, the latest in a series of private equity-type vehicles it is raising despite a new regulation that limits the bank's own participation in such funds.The new fund, called Morgan Stanley Credit Partners II LP, is the second of its kind housed in the Wall Street bank's merchant banking and real estate business. The first fund, which closed in 2011, was the same size.Morgan Stanley began raising the new fund 15 months ago as its predecessor was approaching its four-to-five year investment time frame, said Hank D'Alessandro, head of Morgan Stanley Credit Partners. The strategy of both funds is the same: making new loans and buying existing debt of companies in North America and Western Europe that have earnings of $15 million or more before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.""There's a core need in the middle market where companies can't access junior capital in the liquid markets and need a private market alternative and that's what we provide,"" said D'Alessandro, who oversees a team of 11. The new fund has already invested $144 million in four companies. Investments typically range from $20 million to $65 million in size.After buying Smith Barney from Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley has a much larger base of wealthy individual clients, but does not seem to have relied on them more heavily for fund raising. More than twice as much institutional money was raised for the latest fund in dollar terms compared to the first. D'Alessandro would not disclose the split between institutional and individual investor money in percentage terms.Morgan Stanley's wealth and investment management businesses operate separately and its financial advisers are not allowed to advocate investments in Morgan Stanley funds over others. The credit fund is the latest sign of Morgan Stanley building out its fund businesses despite a new regulatory restriction called the Volcker rule, which limits how much money the bank and its own employees can invest in such funds.The capital commitment in the new fund from Morgan Stanley and affiliates is 3 percent, which is the Volcker rule's limit.Morgan Stanley's strategy is unusual compared to rivals who have either exited private equity or are investing outside of fund structures.Morgan Stanley has also been raising a $4 billion global infrastructure fund, a $2.5 billion global real estate fund and a global private equity fund of unknown size. It closed a $1.7 billion Asia-focused private equity fund last year.

458,"  (Adds details about bonus cuts in Bank of America)Jan 9 Citigroup Inc this week cut its bonus pool for fixed-income and equity market traders after market revenues plunged during the last two weeks of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter.Bonuses will be down about 5 to 10 percent from a year earlier, said the person who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. As of mid-December, they had been expected to hold steady with the past year.The change is the result of declines across the trading businesses in the last half of the month, the person said. On Dec. 9, Chief Executive Mike Corbat said he expected market revenues to be down about 5 percent from a year earlier. The change in bonuses was announced internally on Wednesday by Citigroup co-President James Forese to trading executives and was reported on Friday afternoon by the Wall Street Journal.Bank of America Corp recently moved to shrink its bonus pool earmarked for investment-banking and securities employees after its own lackluster December, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The FTSEurofirst 300 index has swung between lows of around 1,320 points and 1,370 points since the start of 2015, largely because of uncertainty over the outcome of elections in Greece later this month and whether the European Central Bank will begin new economic stimulus measures this month.Some traders expect the European stock markets to remain prone to such volatility until clarity emerged on both those issues.

466,"   By Tanya Agrawal and David Henry  Citigroup Inc said its quarterly profit dropped 86 percent, hurt by legal settlements and falling bond trading revenue, sending the bank's shares down more than 4 percent.The bank took $3.5 billion of charges for legal settlements, matching the figures foreshadowed by Chief Executive Michael Corbat in December. But a 16 percent drop in fixed-income trading revenue was steeper than many analysts had expected, and earnings fell short of analysts' estimates.Citi suffered on a number of fronts during the quarter. The bank, which gets about half of its revenue from overseas, took a hit from the strong dollar, for example. The bank also posted a loss from assets it took on before the financial crisis.The profit setback comes as the Federal Reserve considers the bank's plan to return capital to shareholders, through some combination of share buybacks and dividends.Corbat and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach expressed optimism that the Fed would approve the bank's capital plan.An earlier plan was rejected due to concerns about the processes Citi uses to determine how its business would be hit by stressful situations. ""I feel good about our submission,"" Corbat said on a call with analysts, adding that he was looking for ""an unqualified pass"" from the Fed to return capital.Gerspach said the bank was looking forward to hearing the results of the Fed's decision in March.Citigroup's stock fell to $46.94 in early afternoon trading on Thursday after the bank posted an adjusted net profit of $346 million, or 6 cents per share, down from $2.60 billion, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Net income fell 86 percent to $350 million.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of 9 cents per share, including charges, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Adjusted revenue fell 0.8 percent, largely due to the drop in revenue from fixed-income trading.Like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, Citi was hit by a sudden increase in volatility in bond markets in December. Adjusted operating expenses increased 21 percent.Citigroup may have lost money from its portfolio of troubled assets, but it made further progress in winnowing it down. Assets at the end of December stood at $98 billion, down from $103 billion in the third quarter of 2014.The bank's most recent legal woes stem from government probes into alleged manipulation of currency markets and Libor interest rates as well as lax compliance with money laundering rules. The company still faces other possible actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Reserve.Gerspach said Citi expected ""a significant reduction"" in legal costs in 2015.

471,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) Citigroup's (Citi) fourth quarter 2014 (4Q'14)  results reflect the ongoing drag of legal-related charges on the company, and  the difficult operating environment. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA during all  periods, Citi's adjusted return on assets (ROA) was just 7 basis points (bps) in  4Q'14, and 40bps for the year, well below next year's targets of 90bps to  110bps. The full-year ROA improves to 59bps when both CVA/DVA and the 2Q14  mortgage settlement are excluded. Citi's earnings profile continues to lag its  large bank peers, though the company remains committed to an ROA of at least  90bps in 2015.  The legal and repositioning charges were not excluded, as they represent more  ongoing costs to the company, in Fitch's view. These amounts, previously  disclosed, were $2.9 billion and $655 million, respectively, during the quarter.  While Citi disclosed it believes it has also already recorded a 'significant  portion' of legal-related charges, there continues to be very little visibility  into pending litigation for Citi or its peers. As such, it is unclear how well  prepared Citi is prepared for any settlements, particularly further  foreign-exchange matters that may occur in 2015.  While Citi was able to report revenue growth in North America Consumer Banking,  partially aided by a mortgage loan sale, performance in Markets was worse than  previously guided, reflecting a difficult trading environment and seasonality.  Fixed income was down 16% from a year ago, and 33% on a linked-quarter basis,  while equity markets were down 3% and 38%, respectively. The FICC decline,  particularly in spread products (including credit and muni), and G10 rates was  attributed to more volatile markets, wider credit spreads, and less liquid  market conditions, especially in October and again in December.  While a focus for Citi, along with the industry given revenue headwinds,  expenses (including legal and repositioning charges) continue to tick up given  increased regulatory and compliance-related spending. Expenses were 11% higher  on a linked-quarter basis, and up 21% from a year ago. The revenue headwinds and  elevated expenses contributed to negative operating leverage both in 4Q'14 and  for the full year.  With regard to Citi's exposure to falling oil prices, the company disclosed  energy-related funded and unfunded exposure totaled approximately $60 billion,  or around 35% of tangible common equity at YE2014. The company also disclosed  during its earnings call that around 80% of its borrowers are Investment Grade,  viewed favorably as this is likely a higher proportion than some peer banks.  Global Consumer Banking's reported loan losses increased to 2.33% during the  quarter, and were 2.24% excluding losses related to homebuilder exposure in  Mexico that was fully reserved for. Given Citi's higher loss content credit card  book and emerging markets exposure, loan losses tend to be higher than peer  averages. Citi's total NCOs, including consumer and wholesale, were  approximately 140bps in 4Q14, as compared to just 40bps for BAC and 65bps for  JPM. As such, Fitch expects Citi to maintain a conservative approach to loan  loss reserve levels. Citi reported a 19% increase in its provision for loan  losses, with reserves-to-total loans now at 2.5% at YE2014. Citi continues to wind down its Citi Holding assets, and ended the quarter with  less than $100 billion in total assets or roughly 5% of consolidated assets.  Citi Holdings also reported a quarterly profit during the quarter, its second in  a row, and excluding the 2Q14 mortgage settlement, three quarters in a row.  There will likely be an increase in total assets in Citi Holdings next quarter,  as consumer operations in the 11 markets that Citi plans to exit will be  reported in this segment. The financial impact of these planned exits would have  improved the pro forma ROA in Global Consumer Banking by 15bps to 1.88% for the  full year 2014. In addition to this decent earnings improvement, Fitch views  these planned divestitures favorably as they reduce future compliance,  operational, and reputational risks.  Citi announced it also has plans to exit some non-core securities services and  transaction businesses in the Institutional Clients Group (ICG), including from  hedge fund administration, prepaid cards, certain transfer agency operations,  and wealth management administration. The ROA for ICG would have improved by 1bp  to 0.92% in 2014, on a pro forma basis, and the efficiency ratio would improve  by 100bps as well to 58.4%. These operations will also be reported in Citi  Holdings next quarter.  Citi's capital ratios continued to remain very good and generally above global  peers. The company's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully  phased-in basis fell 15bps to 10.5% at quarter-end. The decline was primarily  attributed to a pension-related other comprehensive income adjustment and an  incremental increase in operational risk weighted assets. It is difficult to  calculate Citi's potential G-SIB surcharge under the proposed U.S. rules.  However, Fitch expects that its capital surcharge will likely increase from its  current 2% buffer under international rules.   Citi also reported that it would already be in compliance with the supplementary  leverage ratio at the holding company with a 6% ratio.

472,"  * Interested in Citi's Egypt retail unit - CEO* 2015 profit growth target 6-10 pct, loan growth 5-8 pct* Plans $500 mln Tier 2 bond once got shareholder assent* Q4 net profit 644.3 mln dhs, up 28 pct y-o-y   (Recasts, updates with CEO comments, detail, context)By David FrenchDUBAI, Jan 18 Mashreq is holding talks with Citigroup about acquiring its retail banking business in Egypt and is targeting net profit growth in 2015 of between 6 percent and 10 percent, the Dubai bank's chief executive said on Sunday.Abdul Aziz al-Ghurair made the remarks to reporters after the emirate's third-largest bank by assets reported a 28 percent jump in fourth-quarter earnings on the back of improved operating income.With Emirates NBD, which recorded a 82 percent net profit increase, it marked a positive start to the fourth-quarter reporting season for the United Arab Emirates' banks, who have benefited from strong domestic economic conditions in recent quarters.Citi has received bids from ten banks for its Egyptian consumer business after putting it up for sale in October to trim costs, sources told Reuters last week. ""We are in dialogue with Citi and the regulator in Egypt to explore the potential of this business,"" Ghurair confirmed, adding Mashreq had yet to appoint advisors but would do so as the process progressed.Citi's assets can only be sold to banks already operating in the North African country as the U.S. lender is retaining its banking licence, Ghurair said. Mashreq has around 10 branches in Egypt.Across the Gulf, strong competition at home is forcing banks to look overseas for their next stage of growth. Ghurair admitted in September that Mashreq was looking to expand in Egypt and Turkey.The bank hopes to generate 25 percent of its revenue from international sources, up from 18 percent now. LOAN GROWTH Mashreq made 644.3 million dirhams ($175.4 million) for the three months to Dec. 31, compared with 504.6 million dirhams in the corresponding period of 2013, boosted by a 20 percent and 18 percent year-on-year rise in fee and net interest income respectively.Rarely traded, Mashreq's shares gained 2.3 percent in positive trading on the Dubai bourse. Into 2015, Mashreq's loan growth was expected to be around 5 percent to 8 percent as increased lending to large corporates and state-linked entities, who could ride out any disruption in the local economy from oil price-related volatility, offset a decline in consumer lending, according to Ghurair.The CEO said he expected its retail business would shrink in the coming 6-12 months as the UAE's recently-introduced credit bureau highlighted customers' total borrowings for the first time, making banks generally more cautious on retail lending.Mashreq's lending book grew 15.1 percent in 2014.The bank plans to sell a $500 million bond which would boost its Tier 2 - or supplementary - capital, Ghurair said, adding the issue just needed shareholder approval before coming to market. He declined to say if banks had been appointed to arrange the transaction.Banks in the UAE, including Dubai Islamic Bank and ENBD, have been selling capital-boosting debt instruments to diversify their shareholder base and enhance their reserves in recent months after two years of strong loan growth.Mashreq's total capital adequacy ratio, a combination of Tier 1 and 2 capital and regarded as one of the key indicators of a bank's health, was 16.6 percent at the end of December, the statement said.In future, Ghurair said Mashreq could also boost its reserves by retaining more earnings, as opposed to paying out dividends to shareholders.Mashreq said its board proposed a 40 percent cash dividend for 2014, in line with its pay-out for the previous year, according to Thomson Reuters data.

490,"   By Julia Edwards and Karen Freifeld | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Tuesday he has given federal prosecutors a 90-day deadline to decide whether they can bring cases against individuals for their roles in the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. attorneys who brought cases against institutions over misconduct in the pooling and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities have been asked ""to try to develop cases against individuals and to report back in 90 days with regard to whether they think they can successfully bring criminal or civil cases against those individuals,"" Holder said in a public appearance at the National Press Club. The Justice Department, in conjunction with other authorities, extracted record penalties from major banks in 2013 and 2014 for inappropriately marketing risky mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) agreed to a $13 billion deal in November 2013; Citigroup Inc (C.N) signed a $7 billion settlement in July 2014; and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) reached a $16.65 billion agreement in August.  Still, the government has been criticized for not bringing cases against top executives for their roles in the misconduct.“I think what we have done has been appropriate,” Holder said on Tuesday. “To the extent that individuals have not been prosecuted, people should understand it is not for lack of trying."" The government cases came out of a task force formed by President Barack Obama in 2012 to probe misconduct that contributed to the financial crisis. Obama said he was creating the group to ""hold accountable those who broke the law"" and ""help turn the page on an era of recklessness.""

491,"  (Adds background, quotes from Holder)By Julia Edwards and Karen FreifeldWASHINGTON Feb 17 U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Tuesday he has given federal prosecutors a 90-day deadline to decide whether they can bring cases against individuals for their roles in the 2008 financial crisis.U.S. attorneys who brought cases against institutions over misconduct in the pooling and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities have been asked ""to try to develop cases against individuals and to report back in 90 days with regard to whether they think they can successfully bring criminal or civil cases against those individuals,"" Holder said in a public appearance at the National Press Club. The Justice Department, in conjunction with other authorities, extracted record penalties from major banks in 2013 and 2014 for inappropriately marketing risky mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase & Co agreed to a $13 billion deal in November 2013; Citigroup Inc signed a $7 billion settlement in July 2014; and Bank of America Corp  reached a $16.65 billion agreement in August. Still, the government has been criticized for not bringing cases against top executives for their roles in the misconduct.""I think what we have done has been appropriate,"" Holder said on Tuesday. ""To the extent that individuals have not been prosecuted, people should understand it is not for lack of trying."" The government cases came out of a task force formed by President Barack Obama in 2012 to probe misconduct that contributed to the financial crisis.Obama said he was creating the group to ""hold accountable those who broke the law"" and ""help turn the page on an era of recklessness.""Because Holder is expected to leave office soon, he said the decision over whether to prosecute individuals would ultimately be up to Loretta Lynch, the administration's nominee to replace him as attorney general, if and when she is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

495,"  (Corrects to say Medina-Mora's pay is the same for 2014 as 2013, not higher, in last paragraph)By David Henry and Lauren Tara LaCapraFeb 20 Manuel Medina-Mora, who helped build up Citigroup Inc's Mexico business only to see it run into trouble after he stopped managing it day-to-day, will retire in June, the bank said on Friday.Medina-Mora, who heads global consumer banking at Citigroup, was expected to retire before his 65th birthday in August, people familiar with the matter said. But the bank did not name a successor for Medina-Mora, which implies that Citigroup had not spent years planning for the move, analysts said.The bank separately announced that its board had cut pay for Chief Executive Michael Corbat by 10 percent.Taken together, the two moves suggest that Citigroup's board is pressing management to perform better after the bank posted a 49 percent decline in profits last year and failed a key regulatory test, analysts said.""Michael O'Neill is the chairman of the board there, and he is absolutely on the scene, keeping the pressure on,"" said Mike Mayo, an equity research analyst at CLSA in New York.Medina-Mora spent most of his decades-long banking career in Mexico, and was known as ""Mr. Mexico"" in Citigroup. He joined  Banamex in 1971 and was CEO of the franchise when Citigroup bought it in 2001. He was promoted to head its Latin American region in 2004 and to lead Citigroup's global consumer banking business in 2010, remaining as Banamex chairman. After the financial crisis, some executives inside the bank saw Medina-Mora as a possible future chief executive. But his ties to Banamex became a liability in recent years, after the bank's Mexican unit had problems ranging from bad loans from apparent fraud to a 2013 trading scandal.Banamex's business in the United States is also facing a U.S. criminal investigation involving possible violations of money-laundering laws, according to company disclosures. The bank last year cited ""control issue"" in Banamex USA as at least one reason for its cutting Medina-Mora's annual compensation for 2013 to $9.5 million from $11 million.Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to comment on the timing of Medina-Mora's departure. In a bank memo to its employees, Citigroup CEO Corbat credited Medina-Mora with turning a scattershot global consumer operation into a unified, cohesive business. He said he will name a replacement soon.During Medina-Mora's tenure as head of global consumer banking, the unit's income from continuing operations rose 49 percent to $6.9 billion from $4.7 billion.The figures exclude income or losses from businesses the bank is looking to shed, housed in a unit called ""Citi Holdings."" That unit may be a step closer to selling another asset: Citigroup is in advanced talks to sell consumer finance business OneMain Financial Holdings to subprime lender Springleaf Holdings Inc, sources told Reuters on Friday. PAY CUT In a separate securities filing on Friday, Citigroup said that Corbat's pay had been cut by about 10 percent in 2014 to $13.1 million. The median U.S. annual household income is just above $50,000.Since last year, Citigroup has failed a crucial regulatory stress test needed to raise its dividend and had to deal with the loans scandal and other issues at Banamex. The bank also paid out billions in legal settlements, which cut into its earnings. Citigroup nearly failed during the financial crisis, forcing it to accept three U.S. government rescues, and has been turning itself around since then.In a separate memo announcing his retirement, Medina-Mora said he made the decision ""after careful consideration and with deep emotion."" He will keep a non-executive chairman role at Banamex even after his retirement on June 1, according to the bank memorandum.Citigroup fired 11 employees linked to the fraudulent loans to oil services company Oceanografia, a supplier to Pemex, and later replaced Banamex's CEO.Citigroup directors held flat Medina-Mora's compensation for 2014 at about $9.5 million, the same as for 2013, according to filings by the company.

497,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Citigroup Inc is in advanced talks to sell its consumer finance unit OneMain Financial Holdings Inc to subprime lender Springleaf Holdings Inc for more than $4 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Springleaf has prevailed over other bidders, including private equity firms, in an auction for OneMain, the people said. The negotiations have not been finalized and Citigroup may still decide to pursue an initial public offering of OneMain as an alternative to an outright sale, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private. Citigroup declined to comment while OneMain and Springleaf representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Springleaf shares soared on the news and were trading up 8.4 percent at $37.05 in afternoon trading in New York. Citigroup shares were up 1.2 percent at $51.71. The move to sell OneMain represents a major step in the No. 3 U.S. bank's plan to sell unwanted assets and focus on wealthier clients.Springleaf and Onemain are the only sizable national participants in the consumer lending industry serving the large and growing population of non-prime customers. OneMain, which has assets of about $10 billion, provides personal loans for meeting unexpected expenses such as medical bills or car repairs and for buying small-ticket items such as refrigerators and televisions.Based in Evansville, Indiana and backed by private equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC, Springleaf provides loans to customers through its nationwide branch network and its internet lending division. Combined, Onemain and Springleaf would have nearly 2,000 branches.

498,"  (Corrects to 10 percent from 7 percent in headline and first paragraph. Corrects Corbat's 2013 pay to $14.5 million from $14.1 million in second paragraph)Feb 20 Citigroup Inc cut Chief Executive Michael Corbat's pay by about 10 percent in 2014, a year in which the bank's profit nearly halved due to higher legal costs and a slump in bond trading.Corbat earned an estimated $13.1 million for the year, including deferred shares worth about $3.49 million based on the stock's Thursday close. He earned $14.5 million in 2013. Deferred stock makes up 30 percent of Corbat's bonus pay under Citi's compensation plan, which was overhauled two years ago amid shareholder pressure.Corbat has been trying to make the bank as profitable as its rivals by scaling down its sprawling operations, built through a series of acquisitions since the 1980s. Citi, like other big banks, has turned to cost cuts to boost profit, as low interest rates and new regulations have crimped revenue growth. But these efforts have been overshadowed by multibillion-dollar fines and higher costs for technology and compliance. Bank of America Corp cut Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's pay by 7 percent in 2014, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.In contrast to Moynihan and Corbat's smaller pay packages, JPMorgan & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon earned $20 million in 2014, unchanged from a year earlier. His pay package included a first cash bonus in three years.

The DoJ declined to comment. Representatives at the Northern District of California were not immediately available for comment.The Justice Department, in conjunction with other authorities, extracted record penalties from major banks in 2013 and 2014 for inappropriately marketing risky mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase & Co agreed to a $13 billion deal in November 2013; Citigroup Inc signed a $7 billion settlement in July 2014; and Bank of America Corp  reached a $16.65 billion agreement in August.

518,"   By Avik Das  Springleaf Holdings Inc (LEAF.N) said it would buy Citigroup Inc's (C.N) OneMain Financial Holdings Inc for $4.25 billion in cash, creating the largest subprime lender in the United States.Citigroup has been seeking to hive off OneMain since at least 2011 as part of the No. 3 U.S. bank's plan to sell unwanted assets and focus on wealthier clients.The deal will create a lender with $15 billion in assets and nearly 2,000 branches, serving the large and growing population of non-prime customers in the United States.Springleaf shares soared 38 percent to a record $52.44 on Tuesday. Citigroup's shares were marginally higher at $53.73.The deal with Springleaf for Citi's most profitable business was widely expected, but the price was less than what many analysts had anticipated. Reuters reported on Feb. 20 that the deal was close.Jefferies & Co, reiterating its ""buy"" rating on Springleaf's stock, said it had expected OneMain to fetch $5 billion. OneMain, which provides loans to meet unexpected expenses and to buy small-ticket items, has been profitable since posting a $2 billion loss in 2010. Profit rose 7 percent to $415 million in the nine months ended September.OneMain has 1,140 branches in the United States, compared with Citibank's 849.Citigroup said it will use a part of the sale proceeds to retire certain funding that supports Citi Holdings. The combination of the debt retirement and the remaining proceeds is expected to add about $1 billion to Citi's earnings before income taxes. OneMain is part of Citi Holdings, created during the financial crisis to park assets that Citigroup wanted to divest or wind down.Citigroup had reduced Citi Holdings' assets to 5 percent of total assets in 2014 from a peak of more than 30 percent.OneMain had filed to go public in October. Citigroup had always preferred an outright sale, but was unwilling to sell at the prices offered and potential buyers had trouble raising funds. The combined company is expected to earn $800-$900 million in 2017, Springleaf CEO Jay Levine said on a call.Springleaf is majority owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG.N), whose shares rose 2.7 percent.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are Springleaf's financial advisers, while Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP is legal counsel.Citi is OneMain's financial adviser and Davis Polk & Wardwell is its legal adviser.

The funds will be used for working capital purposes and to expand business, among other things.Orient's IPO was one of 24 deals approved by the securities regulator which is stepping up the pace of listings in China in an effort to cool down the red-hot stock markets. Brokerages like Orient have seen profits double as retail investor numbers jump and trading volumes soar, spurred by the central bank's surprise interest rate cut in November. Volumes have also been boosted by the Stock Connect scheme, which opened the same month, allowing direct trading of Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks on each other's bourses.Orient Securities set up a joint venture brokerage Citi Orient Securities Co Ltd with Shanghai-Citigroup Global Markets Asia in 2011, according to the JV's official website. Citi Orient is located in Shanghai and has registered capital of 800 million yuan. The other companies approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Monday are mostly small-cap, with 11 aiming to list on the Shanghai stock exchange, four in Shenzhen and eight on the smaller ChiNext exchange.($1 = 6.2720 Chinese yuan renminbi)   (Reporting by Engen Tham and Lujian Xin; Editing by Miral Fahmy)",2015-03-03,C,"Mon Mar 2, 2015 | 8:53pm EST",Citigroup-linked China broker plans $1.6 bln Shanghai IPO,http://www.reuters.com//article/china-ipo-idUSL4N0W502T20150303?type=companyNews

Akbank is Turkey's fourth-largest listed lender by assets.The U.S. bank did not disclose the buyer. Akbank's top shareholder, industrial conglomerate Sabanci Holdings (SAHOL.IS), said it had waived its right of refusal to the stake, adding Citi's offer had been to a ""large number"" of potential buyers.Citi said it remained committed to Turkey, where it aims to increase corporate and commercial lending and employs more than 500 people. Still, the sale comes at an inopportune time for Turkish banking, as overseas investors worry about increased political interference in the industry.Ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned on Wednesday that regulatory actions against an Islamic lender, Bank Asya, illustrated the ""potential for political risk, or the perception of it, to directly or indirectly spill over into the financial system"".Bank Asya, founded by followers of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, is at the heart of a power struggle between Gulen and President Tayyip Erdogan, who accuses the religious leader of attempting to build a ""parallel state"".

525,"  (Repeating story for additional subscribers without changes to text)By David HenryNEW YORK, March 5 Citigroup Inc had at least one advantage in its successful bid for the exclusive right to issue credit cards for Costco Wholesale Corp, rivals and tax specialists say: it lost so much money during the financial crisis that it has billions of dollars of tax credits.Citigroup and Costco have not disclosed terms of the deal, and outsiders can only speculate about the reasons Citigroup bid aggressively enough to win the business.But officials at two rival banks said they suspect Citigroup's tax credits allowed it to offer Costco better terms than competitors could. They declined to be identified because the negotiations were confidential.At the end of last year, Citigroup had $49.5 billion in net tax credits, known as ""deferred tax assets."" They are a boon to the bank because they can reduce - or even eliminate - its federal income tax liability. Other banks could pay as much as 35 percent of their U.S. income in federal tax, though many also use tax-reduction strategies that push their rates lower.American Express said last month that it would not renew its deal with Costco because the retailer was demanding terms that were not economic, an indication that the profit margins for anyone taking on the business were likely to be razor thin.""The deferred tax assets would be quite a dramatic advantage,"" said Robert Willens, an independent accounting and taxation consultant. Citigroup, he said, may well have won the deal by being able to offer far better terms to Costco than banks that pay more in taxes. Citigroup responded to questions about its tax advantage in the deal with a written statement: ""As the world's largest issuer of consumer credit cards, Citi has unrivaled scale, expertise and capabilities in servicing our partnerships with industry leaders. Costco brings the opportunity for consumer spending growth - when you add Costco's customer loyalty with increased Visa acceptance, it is a win for all parties.""It declined to comment on whether its tax credits helped in winning the business.In 2014, Citigroup used about $3 billion of deferred tax assets to reduce tax liability. To competitors, the bank's tax credits are an irritant. A big chunk of the bank's deferred tax assets stem from the billions of dollars of losses it generated during the financial crisis. Citigroup was rescued three times by the U.S. government between 2008 and 2009, and one of the rescues threatened to wipe out some of the bank's deferred tax assets. However, the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service - which were concerned about the stability of the banking system - relaxed the rules governing such assets to help Citigroup and other banks during the crisis.The government's tax rules were relaxed again for Citigroup when the United States looked to sell its roughly one-third stake of the company after the crisis, Willens said.In both cases, the bank came close to triggering a 1986 tax rule designed to prevent healthy corporations from avoiding taxes by buying weak companies with large deferred tax assets.""In an odd kind of way, the U.S. government essentially put Citigroup in a more competitive position"" to bid for business like the Costco deal, said Charles Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at Portales Partners, a broker focused on research. The Costco transaction is not without risks for Citigroup, especially in the event of an economic downturn that would cause more cardholders to default on payments. But such deals typically last for five to seven years, so Citigroup will have an out down the road.Citigroup could continue to benefit from its deferred tax assets in bidding for assets in the future, Willens said, and the bank has done so in the past. In 2013, the bank bought a portfolio of about $7 billion of credit card loans to customers of Best Buy Inc.Banks, like all U.S. companies, keep two sets of books, one for financial markets and a second for the Internal Revenue Service. Many of the losses on loans and securities that Citigroup recognized during the financial crisis were reported on the bank's books for investors, but cannot be reported for tax purposes until the loss actually happens. When the loss happens and the bank has enough taxable income, Citigroup gets a tax credit, but until then, the bank keeps a deferred tax asset on its books, to recognize the future benefit.The bank's $50 billion of tax credits expire over several decades starting in 2017.Based on how credit card deals are typically negotiated, Citigroup would have factored a number of considerations into its bid for the Costco portfolio: how generous to make rewards programs for the store's customers, how much of a break it would give the retailer on transaction processing costs and how much revenue it would share with the company from fees for processing transactions when Costco cardholders use their cards outside of the store.Banks have been competing intensely for the right to issue cards with retailers, airlines and hotel companies.  In the next year or so American Airlines  is expected to review its current deal with Citigroup, which issues cards carrying both the bank and the airline's brand.

534,"  * Citigroup, Morgan Stanley up after the bell following Fed review* Shake Shack shares fall after the bell on results* Indexes down: Dow 0.2 pct, S&P 500 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct   (Updates close with dollar details; Bank of America, Shake Shack down after the bell, Citigroup up)By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK, March 11 U.S. stocks ended lower for a second straight session on Wednesday as worries grew about the timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike and dollar strength further dampened the outlook for U.S. earnings.The move followed the S&P 500's biggest one-day decline in two months in the previous session, which surpassed a selloff of similar magnitude on Friday. The S&P 500 is now off 3.6 percent from its March 2 record closing high and is down 0.9 percent for the year so far.Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report, which solidified views the Fed could raise rates as early as June, was largely behind the recent jitters. ""It's all about rates. I think many are holding onto the view that if the Fed raises rates, stocks stop in their tracks and reverse, and the bull market ends,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.55 points, or 0.16 percent, to 17,635.39, the S&P 500 lost 3.92 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,040.24 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 9.85 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,849.94.The dollar extended its gains against the euro, following the start of the European Central Bank's 1.1 trillion euro bond-buying program. The euro fell 1.5 percent to trade near $1.05 for the first time in 12 years and the single currency  is down 12 percent against the greenback since January. The dollar's sharp rise has added to worries the currency will continue to weigh on U.S. multinationals' earnings.""The dollar continues to strengthen. That's a double-edged kind of development in that it will lead to more investor interest in the United States, but on the other hand, it hampers the ability of U.S. multinationals to compete overseas,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston.S&P 500 earnings are now expected to decline 2.7 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. Shares of Tyson Foods were down 5.6 percent at $37.55 and Pilgrims Pride Corp dropped 4.4 percent. The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in Arkansas.After the bell, shares of major banks were active following the Fed's review of their capital plans.

544,"   By Sarah Marsh | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES Argentina on Friday demanded banks operating in the country process bond interest payments despite a U.S. court ruling that prohibited Citigroup Inc from distributing coupon payments on the country's local law bonds.The government of leftist President Cristina Fernandez warned Citibank Argentina could lose its operating license if it refused. Wall Street analysts said the U.S. ruling dealt a blow to Argentina's hopes of issuing new debt, even under local law.Citigroup is one of several international financial institutions caught up in Argentina's lengthy legal feud with bondholders who rejected the country's bond swaps after its 2002 default and who are pressing for full payment.U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa ruled on Thursday that letting Citigroup process the payments on so-called dollar-denominated exchange bonds would violate a requirement that Argentina treat bondholders equally.Argentina said Griesa had no right to interfere with bonds contracted under Argentine law. His orders already caused the country to default on bonds under foreign law last year. ""It's a shameful abuse of jurisdiction,"" the economy ministry said in a statement.A Citigroup spokesman said the bank would ""pursue all legal measures available to comply both with (Griesa's) decision and Argentine legislation. Citi will appeal the court's decision."" Lawyers for holdout creditor Aurelius Capital Management wrote to Griesa on Friday, asking him to reject Citigroup's request to suspend his order while the bank appeals.Facing stagnant growth and high debt servicing costs, the cash-strapped government had hoped to issue dollar-denominated local law bonds to non-U.S. investors this year.Argentina tried in February to sell $2 billion of dollar-denominated bonds through Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The issuance was scrapped after Griesa ordered the banks hand over relevant documents. Griesa's latest ruling makes a new bond offering even less likely, determining that local law bonds offered abroad amounted to foreign debt and were therefore subject to his ruling, finance experts said.""Griesa doesn't want Argentina selling bonds to foreigners,"" said Siobhan Morden, emerging market debt strategist at Jefferies in New York. ""So the difficult part is, how do you sell bonds without international intermediaries?""Alejo Costa of Buenos Aires-based investment bank Puente said Argentina would struggle to raise significant amounts of dollar debt locally.Battling to shore up foreign reserves, Argentina could pursue less conventional financing channels including another currency swap loan with China to avoid an eventual cash crunch.

547,"   By Junko Fujita | TOKYO  TOKYO After building an artificial island off Osaka to host a gleaming, new airport in 1994, officials discovered it was sinking into the sea. More than 20 years later, the high-stakes deal to privatize Kansai International Airport could be at risk of a similar fate, an embarrassing setback in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's drive to attract investments and cut its massive debt.The problem: the government agency running the bid refuses to budge on an $18-billion price tag that makes Kansai six times as expensive as a comparable deal in 2013 for airports in Portugal, insiders told Reuters.""The government is trying to recover what it lost in Kansai. That is not going to work,"" said Sam Tabuchi, an expert in infrastructure investment at Toyo University.The sale of the right to operate Kansai and its Renzo Piano-designed terminal represents Japan’s first major attempt to auction the rights for cash-generating infrastructure and accounts for about a fifth of the funding the Abe administration expects to attract over the next decade with such projects.    Abe advisors have touted the Kansai deal, which will be followed by sales of rights to operate smaller airports, highways and water utilities in Japan, as crucial for creating a market for infrastructure and building a base of experience for Japanese companies to operate such projects overseas. But investors balked at the price for the Kansai concession, which includes the rights to the smaller Osaka airport nearby. That forced the state-owned company that runs the airport to extend by three months an initial bid deadline initially planned for February.Officials from Japan’s transport ministry and the finance ministry involved in the process told Reuters that lowering the price was not an option.In addition, the current bid terms would shift all of the nearly $10 billion debt run up by Kansai to a private investor. Much of that represents costs incurred when planners discovered in 2000 that landfill under the airport was sinking and needed to be shored up with a massive retaining wall.In December New Kansai, the company that currently runs the airport, named nine Japanese companies, including Orix Corp, Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui Fudosan Co, as qualified bidders. Foreign qualified bidders include Italian group Atlantia SpA, which controls Fiumicino Airport in Rome and Ferrovial, which has a stake in Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd.AMP Capital Investors and IFM Investors, two key investors in Melbourne Airport, are also on the list of potential bidders, while Citigroup Inc and SMBC Nikko Securities are advising New Kansai on the deal.""We are potentially interested in joining a consortium as a provider of subordinated debt,"" AMP Capital said in a statement to Reuters. ""We have held discussions with a number of parties and are currently monitoring developments."" Japanese officials defend the Kansai price based on the growing number of overseas visitors to Japan and the airport's capacity to add flights and operate around the clock. Last year Kansai International Airport and Osaka International Airport attracted 32 million passengers.But Hiroki Shibata, director at Standard and Poor’s, said Tokyo may need to abandon some debt if it wants to find a buyer and provide some backstop to investors against risks like the disruption from an epidemic or political turmoil.""Asking private companies to shoulder all of the current debt involves a very heavy burden on their creditworthiness,"" he said.

But investors balked at the price for the Kansai concession, which includes the rights to the smaller Osaka airport nearby. That forced the state-owned company that runs the airport to extend by three months an initial bid deadline initially planned for February.Officials from Japan's transport ministry and the finance ministry involved in the process told Reuters that lowering the price was not an option.In addition, the current bid terms would shift all of the nearly $10 billion debt run up by Kansai to a private investor. Much of that represents costs incurred when planners discovered in 2000 that landfill under the airport was sinking and needed to be shored up with a massive retaining wall. In December New Kansai, the company that currently runs the airport, named nine Japanese companies, including Orix Corp , Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui Fudosan Co , as qualified bidders.Foreign qualified bidders include Italian group Atlantia SpA , which controls Fiumicino Airport in Rome and Ferrovial , which has a stake in Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd.AMP Capital Investors and IFM Investors, two key investors in Melbourne Airport, are also on the list of potential bidders, while Citigroup Inc and SMBC Nikko Securities are advising New Kansai on the deal. ""We are potentially interested in joining a consortium as a provider of subordinated debt,"" AMP Capital said in a statement to Reuters. ""We have held discussions with a number of parties and are currently monitoring developments.""Japanese officials defend the Kansai price based on the growing number of overseas visitors to Japan and the airport's capacity to add flights and operate around the clock.Last year Kansai International Airport and Osaka International Airport attracted 32 million passengers.But Hiroki Shibata, director at Standard and Poor's, said Tokyo may need to abandon some debt if it wants to find a buyer and provide some backstop to investors against risks like the disruption from an epidemic or political turmoil.""Asking private companies to shoulder all of the current debt involves a very heavy burden on their creditworthiness,"" he said.

560,"   By Jorge Otaola and Nate Raymond | BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK  BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK Citigroup Inc (C.N) will not appeal a U.S. judge's ruling that it cannot process an Argentine sovereign debt payment if he helps the bank exit its custody business in the default-hit country as swiftly as possible, its lawyer said on Wednesday.Citigroup's stance paves the way for a showdown with leftist President Cristina Fernandez's government, which is demanding the bank handle a March 31 payment or else risk sanctions, including the possible loss of its operating license.Earlier on Wednesday, a senior source in Fernandez's government said she would not allow Citigroup to walk away from its custody business, in which it acts as custodian of some Argentine bonds and processes payment for the ultimate security holder.But Denis McInerney, a lawyer for Citigroup, urged U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in New York to suspend his order  blocking payments to enable the bank to fulfill its obligations in Argentina while it exited its custody business there.""Citibank wants to be completely out of this business and have nothing to do with processing payments on these bonds at any point ever again,"" he said during the court hearing, according to a transcript.He added he was ""not certain"" the bank could get out of it before a June 30 payment is due.Citigroup has found itself at the center of a bitter court battle between Argentina and a group of New York-based hedge funds that were awarded full payment on their defaulted sovereign bonds by Griesa.Griesa ruled Argentina must settle with the funds before it continue paying interest to the large majority of investors who accepted significant writedowns on the debt holdings after the country's record default on $100 billion in 2002.His ruling prompted Argentina to default on some of its restructured debt last July. Ranked one of the world's leading custodian banks, Citigroup on Wednesday portrayed itself as an innocent third party faced with the untenable choice of ignoring Griesa and being held in contempt of a federal U.S. court, or putting its license in jeopardy.Its decision to exit its custodial business in Argentina may hamper the government's efforts to pay bondholders and return to global markets.

561,"  (Recasts with transcript from U.S. court hearing)By Jorge Otaola and Nate RaymondBUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK, March 18 Citigroup Inc  will not appeal a U.S. judge's ruling that it cannot process an Argentine sovereign debt payment if he helps the bank exit its custody business in the default-hit country as swiftly as possible, its lawyer said on Wednesday.Citigroup's stance paves the way for a showdown with leftist President Cristina Fernandez's government, which is demanding the bank handle a March 31 payment or else risk sanctions, including the possible loss of its operating license.Earlier on Wednesday, a senior source in Fernandez's government said she would not allow Citigroup to walk away from its custody business, in which it acts as custodian of some Argentine bonds and processes payment for the ultimate security holder.But Denis McInerney, a lawyer for Citigroup, urged U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in New York to suspend his order  blocking payments to enable the bank to fulfill its obligations in Argentina while it exited its custody business there.""Citibank wants to be completely out of this business and have nothing to do with processing payments on these bonds at any point ever again,"" he said during the court hearing, according to a transcript.He added he was ""not certain"" the bank could get out of it before a June 30 payment is due.Citigroup has found itself at the center of a bitter court battle between Argentina and a group of New York-based hedge funds that were awarded full payment on their defaulted sovereign bonds by Griesa.Griesa ruled Argentina must settle with the funds before it continue paying interest to the large majority of investors who accepted significant writedowns on the debt holdings after the country's record default on $100 billion in 2002.His ruling prompted Argentina to default on some of its restructured debt last July. Ranked one of the world's leading custodian banks, Citigroup on Wednesday portrayed itself as an innocent third party faced with the untenable choice of ignoring Griesa and being held in contempt of a federal U.S. court, or putting its license in jeopardy.Its decision to exit its custodial business in Argentina may hamper the government's efforts to pay bondholders and return to global markets.Fernandez denigrates the holdout creditors as ""vultures"" bent on pursuing astronomical profits.

Corbat was paid $14.5 million in 2014, down from $17.6 million the year before, under a disclosure format prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Citi, like other big banks, has turned to cost cuts to boost profit, as low interest rates and new regulations have crimped revenue growth. But the efforts have been overshadowed by fines and higher costs for technology and compliance. The board said its scores for paying executives were lowered by high costs last year to reposition Citigroup businesses.The bank raised its quarterly dividend and announced plans to buy back $7.8 billion of stock over five quarters after it cleared the Federal Reserve's annual stress test last week.Citi failed the stress tests in 2012 and 2014. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach's total compensation for 2014 was unchanged at $7.5 million, according to the filing. Manuel Medina-Mora, who heads Citi's global consumer banking arm but will retire in June, received $9.5 million for 2014.The board faulted Gerspach for the 2014 stress test failure and cited Medina-Mora for control issues at Banamex, the company's unit in Mexico that last year lost more than $500 million to fraud involving a borrower.James Forese, chief executive of the Institutional Clients Group, was paid $13.5 million, which was down by $500,000, or 4 percent, from a year earlier. The board cited legal and regulatory issues with the foreign exchange business under his supervision.Risk and strategy chief Brian Leach was paid $8.1 million, down $900,000, or 10 percent, the proxy said. Leach was cited for his responsibility for the failed capital plan in 2014. year.

575,"   By Sarah Marsh and Richard Lough | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES A deal between Citigroup Inc (C.N) and a U.S. judge allowing the banking giant to process two Argentine debt payments and exit its custodian business in Argentina may violate the country's laws, Economy Minister Axel Kicillof said on Wednesday.Argentina is concerned Citigroup's departure may further hamper the chances of debt interest payments on local law debt restructured after its record 2002 default reaching bondholders.The bank, which acts as custodian of some Argentine bonds, had originally echoed Argentina's stance that the local law bonds should not be wrapped up in a U.S. court ruling barring Buenos Aires from meeting its restructured external debt dues.When District Judge Thomas Griesa this month held firm that local debt payments were also blocked, Citigroup, frustrated at finding itself front and center of Argentina's debt battle, said it wanted out of its Argentina custody business. The subsequent deal with Griesa to process two payments this month and in June makes this easier.""Reading the fine print of the deal, what we find is a trap possibly aimed at scamming the bondholders,"" Kicillof told a news conference. In a further blow to Argentina's hopes of completing payments to local law investors, Griesa on Wednesday barred Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear from passing on funds to bondholders pending any further ruling from his court. If some payments are allowed by the judge at a later date Euroclear will have to provide the litigating hedge funds with details on who will receive the coupon payments and when, the ruling stated. The move is likely to strengthen Argentina's view that the deal with Citigroup is designed to smooth the bank's exit from its Argentine custody business - something the leftist government has said it will not allow.It also means other international financial intermediaries which handle Argentine debt and have a U.S. footprint are unlikely to process payments for fear of running foul of the court's order.Argentina has long accused Griesa of working hand in hand with the funds, which President Cristina Fernandez and her ministers disparage as ""vultures"".

596,"  (Adds background on executives)NEW YORK, April 13 Citigroup Inc named Stephen Bird, its chief executive officer for Asia Pacific, as the new head of its global consumer bank, CEO Mike Corbat said on Monday in a memo seen by Reuters.Bird, 48, will replace Manuel Medina-Mora, who had said earlier this year that he would retire. Francisco Aristeguieta, 49, the CEO for Latin America, will fill Bird's job, the memo to employees said.Jane Fraser, 47, who heads the U.S. consumer bank, will take Aristeguieta's post and be based in Miami. Citigroup's CEO for Mexico, Ernesto Torres Cantu, will report to Fraser. Citigroup's subsidiary, Banamex, the second-largest bank in Mexico, had long been under Medina-Mora, its former CEO, who was with the bank when Citigroup bought it in 2001.The changes will take effect on June 1, the memo said. Citigroup has been trying to meld its consumer businesses around the world into one with a consistent set of products and back-office operations that will promote sales of credit cards and loans and reduce costs. Bird has been with Citigroup for 17 years. Corbat credited him with increasing revenue in the Asia Pacific region and said he was well-qualified to carry on the transformation from local businesses to a global consumer bank.Besides Bird, two other Citigroup executives whom insiders had considered obvious possible successors to Medina-Mora were Fraser and Jud Linville, head of Citigroup-branded credit cards, which account for a large portion of the consumer business.Aristeguieta has been with Citigroup for 21 years and has focused on emerging markets, Corbat said.

598,"   By Mike Stone  ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is preparing the sale of noncore oil and gas producing acreage in the United States, in the latest sign that oil majors are becoming more accepting of lower oil prices, according to people familiar with the matter.While the world's oil and gas companies have been looking to buy assets on the cheap since oil prices plummeted, epitomized by Royal Dutch Shell Plc's (RDSa.L) agreement earlier this month to buy BG Group Plc BG.L for $70 billion, they have been reluctant to sell assets in case oil prices recover and they can fetch more.ConocoPhillips has hired Wells Fargo (WFC.N) to sell some of its noncore U.S. assets, the people said on Monday. These assets include oil and gas properties in the Rockies, East Texas, South Texas and Northern Louisiana, according to one of the people. While the value of the assets up for sale could not be learned, industry sources said they expected ConocoPhillips to sell between $1 billion and $2.5 billion worth of noncore assets in the United States.The sources asked not to be named because the sale process is confidential. A representative of ConocoPhillips declined to comment on this specific asset sale but said: ""It is common in the energy business for companies to review, readjust and optimize their portfolio from time to time."" A Wells Fargo representative declined to comment.  ConocoPhillips' asset sale would be the largest U.S. acreage sale by a major U.S. oil and gas company so far this year. It follows a 50 percent drop in the price of oil since last June, which halted dozens of similar asset sales.This would be the second asset sale by ConocoPhillips launched this year. Earlier, it retained boutique investment bank Scotia Waterous (BNS.TO) for an asset sale in Canada, according to Scotia Waterous' website.  A couple of other big companies have also started to explore a sale. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) has put a few hundred million dollars worth of East Texas acreage up for sale with Citigroup Inc (C.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Anandarko and Citigroup representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

599,"  * FTSE 100 falls 0.3 pct, falling off Friday's record highs* Miners hit by weak Chinese data* Aviva boosted by upbeat broker notes* YouGov poll gives Labour lead before May 7 electionBy Sudip Kar-GuptaLONDON, April 13 Britain's top equity index slipped from record highs on Monday, as a pullback in mining stocks due to weak data from big metals consumer China weighed on the market.The blue-chip FTSE 100 index, which had risen to a record high of 7,095.36 points on Friday, retreated 0.3 percent to 7,070.09 points. The FTSE remains up around 8 percent since the start of 2015. Mining stocks such as BHP Billiton, Anglo American  and Rio Tinto were among the worst-performers on the FTSE.Insurer Aviva, on the other hand, rose 1.8 percent after both Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan reinstated their coverage of the stock with ""overweight"" ratings.China's export sales contracted 15 percent in March while import shipments fell at their sharpest rate since the 2009 global financial crisis, a shock outcome that deepens concern about sputtering Chinese economic growth.The Chinese stock market shrugged off the weak data, with Chinese shares rising on expectations that the poor trade figures would put more pressure on Beijing to launch new economic stimulus figures. However, investment bank Citigroup forecast that slowing demand from China would impact iron ore prices, which in turn would put pressure on UK mining stocks.""The data out of Asia has not been great, and that's caused a little bit of profit-taking after we'd hit the record highs last week,"" said Central Markets' trading analyst Joe Neighbour. LABOUR LEADS IN POLL Some traders were also starting to adopt a slightly more cautious approach ahead of the UK election on May 7.Britain's opposition Labour party has taken a 3 percentage point lead over Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives, according to a YouGov opinion poll published late on Sunday.Uncertainty ahead of the election has hit sterling  more than the FTSE, since a weak sterling could help British exporters sell their goods overseas.However, Logic Investments' senior investment manager Ryan Mitchell said he had a small ""short"" on the FTSE - namely betting on a minor pullback of 1-2 percent.""Personally, I don't think Labour will win, but if we see more polls in the coming weeks giving Labour the lead, then we will see more of a retracement in the FTSE,"" he said.

600,"   By Patrick Graham | LONDON  LONDON Citigroup Inc (C.N) is seeking a buyer for its retail forex brokerage CitiFX Pro as part of efforts to streamline the banking world's biggest currency trading operation, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday.Citi has cut staffing and computerized many elements of its currency business in recent years. Market sources say it has aggressively rationalized its institutional client base in the ""prime broking"" sector since the start of this year.But the sale, initially reported by industry website financemagnates.com, would come at a time when other banks are beginning to think about reinvesting in currency trading, drawn by an improvement in volumes and returns over the past year.CitiFX Pro is the bank's easily accessible online forex trading service, offering professional individual traders and smaller institutional players access to 130-plus currency pairs on several platforms backed up by Citi infrastructure.It is part of a sub-sector of the forex market whose reputation has taken a hammering since the collapse of a handful of businesses, and hefty losses for others, after the Swiss franc's surge in January.  New York-based Citi has pared back internationally in recent years, pulling out of retail banking in markets such as Japan. Industry surveys continue to rank it as the single biggest banking player in the $5 trillion a day forex market.THREATENED MODELS  It has been a tumultuous few years for banks' currency trading businesses, hit by a raft of scandals and regulatory inquiries which has seen dozens of the market's most senior traders leave their jobs or be suspended.Changes in the regulatory environment and capital requirements have also made it more costly to run trading operations like FX that provide huge leverage and conduits for trade to hedge funds and other big financial institutions.  But there has been a growing sense in recent months that banks are feeling their way to new business models that factor in all of the new rules and conditions they face. At the same time, everyday market volatility, which drives up volumes of trade and the amount bank dealing desks can make from trading, has surged threefold on major currencies.""You will see banks investing again in FX now. It has been one of the best performing segments over the past year and that has drawn attention,"" said the head of one London-based brokerage, previously a head of trading with one major European bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.""Like most parts of the business the model does not quite work, but it is very close to giving banks the return on equity they need. So the way to do that is to invest while continuing to automate aggressively.""

609,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived a lawsuit in which South Korea's Woori Bank  accused Citigroup Inc of defrauding it into buying risky mortgage securities that Citigroup was betting against, prior to the financial crisis.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge erred in finding that Woori waited too long to sue over its $25 million investment in 2007 in Armitage ABS CDO Ltd, a collateralized debt obligation that Citigroup sold.Citigroup declined to comment.Woori was the South Korean financial sector's biggest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, and wrote off much of a $1.5 billion stake in CDOs and credit default swaps. It later sued a few banks in the United States to recoup some losses. According to court papers, Woori invested in Armitage in March 2007, only to see the CDO default that December. Woori said it shed its ""worthless"" stake in Armitage in August 2008.But the Seoul-based bank did not sue until May 15, 2012, which Citigroup argued was too late under a three-year statute of limitations prescribed under South Korean law. Woori countered that it had lacked ""practical and specific awareness"" of its claims, which under South Korean law would start the clock, until 2011.In that year, the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission issued its report on the 2008 crisis, and Citigroup settled U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges including that it had shorted a CDO that was a component of the Armitage CDO. Last August, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York said 69 publicly available news articles, press releases, lawsuits and other documents that predated May 15, 2009 should have alerted Woori to its potential claims.But the 2nd Circuit said that apart from the lawsuits, there was ""nothing specific"" about Citigroup to let Woori properly plead fraud.It said that based on these and other documents, including ""pitch books"" that Citigroup had provided about Armitage, ""Woori has plausibly alleged claims that are not time barred."" The 2nd Circuit returned the case to Forrest for further proceedings.The case is Woori Bank v.

611,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, April 22  NEW YORK, April 22 A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived a lawsuit in which South Korea's Woori Bank  accused Citigroup Inc of defrauding it into buying risky mortgage securities that Citigroup was betting against, prior to the financial crisis.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge erred in finding that Woori waited too long to sue over its $25 million investment in 2007 in Armitage ABS CDO Ltd, a collateralized debt obligation that Citigroup sold.Citigroup declined to comment.Woori was the South Korean financial sector's biggest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, and wrote off much of a $1.5 billion stake in CDOs and credit default swaps. It later sued a few banks in the United States to recoup some losses. According to court papers, Woori invested in Armitage in March 2007, only to see the CDO default that December. Woori said it shed its ""worthless"" stake in Armitage in August 2008.But the Seoul-based bank did not sue until May 15, 2012, which Citigroup argued was too late under a three-year statute of limitations prescribed under South Korean law. Woori countered that it had lacked ""practical and specific awareness"" of its claims, which under South Korean law would start the clock, until 2011.In that year, the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission issued its report on the 2008 crisis, and Citigroup settled U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges including that it had shorted a CDO that was a component of the Armitage CDO. Last August, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York said 69 publicly available news articles, press releases, lawsuits and other documents that predated May 15, 2009 should have alerted Woori to its potential claims.But the 2nd Circuit said that apart from the lawsuits, there was ""nothing specific"" about Citigroup to let Woori properly plead fraud.It said that based on these and other documents, including ""pitch books"" that Citigroup had provided about Armitage, ""Woori has plausibly alleged claims that are not time barred."" The 2nd Circuit returned the case to Forrest for further proceedings.The case is Woori Bank v. Citigroup Global Markets Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-3329.

613,"  CARACAS, April 24 Venezuela's central bank has converted part of its gold reserves into at least $1 billion in cash through a swap with Citibank, local media reported on Friday.The deal will make more foreign currency available to President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government as the OPEC nation struggles with soaring consumer prices, chronic shortages and a shrinking economy worsened by low oil prices.Daily newspaper El Nacional said the deal was for $1 billion and was struck with Citibank, which is owned by Citigroup Co . Former central bank director Jose Guerra and economist Asdrubal Oliveros of Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica said in separate interviews that the operation had been carried out. The central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comments. A Citibank official said the company had no comment. A source at the central bank told Reuters last month it would provide 1.4 million troy ounces of gold in exchange for cash. Venezuela would have to pay interest on the funds, but the bank would most likely be able to maintain the gold as part of its foreign currency reserves.Most of Venezuela's foreign reserves are held in gold after late socialist leader Hugo Chavez began moving central bank assets away from the dollar in the wake of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.

623,"  * Tech, new hires, client push to deliver gains -Citi exec* More cross-selling, hiring opportunities -JPMorgan exec* Echoes optimism on trading desks after bumper Q1* Banks taking more targeted approach for top clients* Deutsche Bank also planning to invest in equities   (Adds JPMorgan banker comments)By Lionel LaurentLONDON, May 7 U.S. banks Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase expect to gain market share in equities this year, executives told Reuters, pointing to technology investment and new hires as financial-market trading picks up.The comments echo a more optimistic stance from trading desks at global investment banks after a bumper quarter boosted by the European Central Bank's announcement of a bond-buying scheme to spur growth.They also contrast with last year's more lacklustre picture of stock trading, particularly in Europe, with tepid volume growth and increased regulatory scrutiny squeezing commissions and stoking fears of more cutbacks. ""We are not pulling back in equities, quite the opposite,"" said Tim Gately, Citi's head of equities for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), in an interview. ""We continuously invest in technology, have made a number of senior hires and expect to grow our market and wallet share in 2015.""Citi, which said in the fourth quarter it would take actions to turn around its underperforming EMEA equities franchise, is making a push for a bigger share of spending from top clients and hedge funds, Gately added.The bank has named Murray Roos as London-based global head of sales for equities and prime finance and Emmanuel Girod as global head of exotics trading.Larger rival JPMorgan also expects to gain market share, according to Michael Wilson, head of EMEA equity sales at the bank, thanks to a dedicated hedge-fund sales team, better client targeting and new global equity products. MORE TARGETED At a time of tighter balance-sheet rules and cost cuts, banks in general are taking a more targeted approach to client lists when allocating resources.""We are targeting market-share gains primarily via cross-selling, and so prime brokerage (specialist services for hedge funds) is a big opportunity ... We are also ready to be there for clients should rivals pull back,"" said JPMorgan's Wilson. ""We are investing and hiring within specialist sales, execution and technology.""Growing in cash equities is a multi-year objective for JPMorgan but the bank is already reaping some success from client segments including hedge funds.Some have warned, however, that the optimism in equities may be more a case of market bullishness than a new dawn for highly automated, high-return but volume-dependent stock trading.Some banking sources said they still expected some smaller players to cut back or exit equities given competitive pressures.Yet first-quarter equities revenue grew at double-digit percentage rates for a number of U.S. banks including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, though Citi bucked the trend with a 1 percent decline.The pick-up was also broadly felt in Europe, with Germany's Deutsche Bank unveiling a plan to invest in its small but growing equities trading division.Trading conditions are set to stay positive, said Gately, thanks to near-zero yields in much of the bond market, which made equities more attractive. ""The first quarter was not just a blip (for the industry),"" he said.

628,"   By Sumeet Chatterjee | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Global investment banks are scrambling to get a piece of the action from India's booming technology start-ups, having missed out on the initial flurry of deal-making to their better-connected but much smaller domestic rivals.Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are looking to hire more bankers in India and are now regularly attending ""bake-offs"" to pitch for advisory roles on deals, according to several banking industry sources.   Foreign money has been pouring into India's fast-growing e-commerce sector, with investors ranging from Japan's Softbank Corp (9984.T) to Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] and GIC Private Ltd [GIC.UL] piling in. Many large global investment banks have stayed away from work in the emerging sector though due to the relatively small deal sizes. Now they are stepping up efforts to build relationships while the companies are still young - learning lessons from China where many of them are struggling to compete with small boutique banks as Internet deals pick up speed.   ""Several of these companies will be large IPO candidates in the next 12 to 24 months, so the big banks have to start positioning themselves for this,"" said Harish HV, a partner in India at advisory firm Grant Thornton.The number of venture funding deals for technology start-ups in India in the first quarter of 2015 was the highest in nine quarters and exceeded the number of such deals in China, according to data from CB Insights. The total value of investments in India topped $1 billion for the third straight quarter.LOCAL RIVALS  To compete with local rivals like Avendus Capital and Kotak Mahindra Capital, foreign banks are now pitching for relatively small deals at start-ups, hopeful they will eventually lead to more lucrative work, banking sources said.   Avendus, which focused on the tech sector before the deal momentum picked up, ranks fourth in the advisory league table for announced technology deals in India so far this year. That's ahead of bigger global rivals including Credit Suisse CSGN.VX, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N), according to Thomson Reuters data.While Credit Suisse CSGN.VX topped the fee income table with $7.7 million in India technology advisory fees in 2014, Avendus ranked second with $3.7 million from seven deals, according to data from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting Co. ""We first looked at the sector and said 'okay the sector is going to be sizeable. Who are the leading companies in this?,'"" said Aashish Bhinde, head of Avendus's digital and technology practice.  ""Global investment banks were completely missing from the scene.""Now foreign investment banks are starting to make in-roads. Jefferies' India arm advised home shopping firm Naaptol.com to raise about $20 million last month from Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd (8031.T) and some existing investors.Citigroup Inc (C.N), which advised Indian online payment services provider One97 Communications in raising funds from Alibaba Group (BABA.N) affiliate Ant Financial Services in February, is ""very focused"" on the internet space in India, said Madhur Deora, its managing director for investment banking in India.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comments on their work with Indian technology start-ups.  WESTERN STYLE FEE While India has fewer Internet users than China, online sales could rise to over $100 billion in 2020 from $2.9 billion in 2013, making it the fastest-growing market globally, according to a Morgan Stanley research report.This has led to global banks vying to offer services like loan financing to online retailers like Flipkart and Snapdeal, hoping this could help them secure mandates on any future IPOs, sources said.""Fees on these IPOs would be much more Western style than the commoditized deals in India,"" said an M&A banker with a large foreign bank, also one of the advisers on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding's (BABA.N) record $25 billion IPO last year.For large IPOs, Indian tech companies would need the marketing muscles of big foreign banks. But the local banks have likely cemented strong enough relationships that their foreign rivals can not push them out entirely.   ""I would be surprised if any investment bank out there is not rapidly building up their digital and tech practice given the pace and momentum with which the transactions are happening, which is good for the industry,"" said Bhinde of Avendus.

633,"   By Tom Arnold | DUBAI  DUBAI May 7 The number of banks in the running to buy Citigroup's consumer business in Egypt has fallen as the bidding process enters its final stages, banking sources said.Bids from at least three banks are believed to still be under consideration, the sources said.Two are from the United Arab Emirates: Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB) and Emirates NBD (ENBD). The third, Egypt's Commercial International Bank, said last month it had decided to submit a binding offer.It was not clear whether other bidders were still in contention, but the number has shrunk greatly since the start of the year, when as many as ten banks had been in the running, the sources said. Citi's net investment in Egypt was around $250 million as of mid-2013, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The business has eight branches and about 800 staff, serving about 100,000 customers, according to a bank spokesman.A final decision on a successful bidder is expected in coming weeks, one of the sources said. Bidders should have an existing presence in the Egyptian market. Citigroup and ENBD declined to comment. An ADIB spokeswoman told Reuters there was no update on its bid.The U.S. bank said last October that it was pulling out of consumer banking in 11 markets, including Egypt and Japan, to trim costs. Citigroup wants to complete sales in those markets by the end of 2015, it said at the time.

635,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citigroup Inc.'s (Citi)  Viability Rating (VR) and Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'a/A',  respectively. At the same time, Fitch has upgraded Citibank, N.A.'s Long-Term  IDR and and Long-Term Deposit ratings to 'A+/ AA-', respectively. The Outlooks  for the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the  end of this rating action commentary. Citi's Long-Term IDR is driven by its Viability Rating (VR), which has been  affirmed at 'a'. The upgrade of Citi's operating subsidiaries' IDRs to one notch  above their VRs reflects the expected implementation of total loss absorbing  capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks  (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the holding company. The rating actions are in conjunction with Fitch's review of sovereign support  for banks globally, which the agency announced in March 2014. In line with its  expectations announced in March last year and communicated regularly since then,  Fitch believes legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives have substantially  reduced the likelihood of sovereign support for U.S., Swiss and European Union  commercial banks. At the same time, Fitch has taken into account progress with  the U.S. single point of entry (SPE) resolution regime and TLAC implementation  for U.S. G-SIBs. Fitch believes that, in line with our Support Rating (SR) definition of '5',  extraordinary external support while possible can no longer be relied upon for  Citi or its certain subsidiaries. We have, therefore, downgraded their Support  Ratings (SR) to '5' from '1' and revised their Support Rating Floors (SRF) to  'No Floor' from 'A'. Fitch has maintained institutional support ratings for core  Citi subsidiaries.  The ratings actions are part of a periodic portfolio review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. A strong rebound in earnings from securities businesses in 1Q15  is a reminder of the upside potential banks with leading market shares can  enjoy. However, regulatory headwinds remain strong, with ever higher capital  requirements, costs of continuous infrastructure upgrades and a focus on conduct  risks.  As capital and leverage requirements evolve, GTUBs are reviewing the balance of  their securities operations with other businesses and adapting their business  models to provide the most capital platforms for the future. We expect the  GTUBs' other core businesses, including retail and corporate banking, wealth and  asset management, to perform well as economic growth, which we expect to be  strongest in the U.S. and UK, will underpin revenue. However, pressure on  revenue generation in a low-interest environment is likely to persist,  particularly in Europe, but low loan impairment charges in domestic markets  should help operating profitability. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of Citigroup's VR reflects its solid capital and liquidity  profiles. Citi has grown capital both through retained earnings, and balance  sheet deleveraging that has particularly aided risk-based measures. At March 31,  2015, Citi's fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity was an estimated 11%,  higher than most U.S.-based GTUBs. After a disappointing objection to last  year's capital plan for qualitative reasons, Citi performed well under this  year's stress tests, receiving no objection to increase the quarterly dividend  to $0.05 a share, and repurchase up to $7.8 billion of common shares. Citi's  estimated minimum tier 1 common ratio was the highest of the five U.S.-based  GTUBs that participated in the annual stress tests.  Citi's liquidity profile is a secondary key rating driver, underpinning its VR.  Citi has considerably bolstered its amount of liquid assets and reduced its  reliance on short-term borrowings over the last several years. The company's  liquidity profile remains strong, providing support to Citi's ratings. At March  31, 2015, Citi reported $401 billion in cash and unencumbered liquid securities,  or 22% of total assets. Citi also has access to $38 billion in borrowing  capacity from various Federal Home Loan banks, as well as access to borrowing  capacity at the discount window or international central banks at March 31,  2015. Citi is already in compliance with the final U.S. LCR rules, as well as  the Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio at both the holding company and bank  levels. Its estimated LCR was 111% (under U.S. rules), while the SLR was 6.4% at  March 31, 2015. Citi's earnings profile, complexity of operations, and asset quality somewhat  offset these ratings strengths. The company's earnings performance has lagged  peer averages, though the VR already incorporates a forward looking view and  Fitch expects that Citi will reach its targets over the near term. Citi is the  most global of the U.S. GTUBs, and while this creates a great deal of diversity,  it can entail risk with regard to geopolitical issues, as well as the need to  have a best in class risk management infrastructure. Lastly, Citi's asset  quality metrics have lagged peer averages as well, though somewhat to be  expected given its concentration to higher loss content credit cards. These  three drivers act as rating constraints to further upward movement to the VR.   Citi's earnings in 2014 were expected to be a year of recovery, which did not  materialize; however, earnings got off to a strong start with a first quarter  2015 ROA of 1.05%, well within the company's target of 90bps to 110bps. Fitch  notes that over the past couple years, Citi's earnings during the first half of  the year have started out favorably, only to be marred by material litigation  costs or lower capital markets revenues later on. Citi's ability to meet its  full-year earnings targets in 2015 may hinge on future legal-related charges,  which are very difficult to predict given limited visibility. Further, although  not currently assumed nor incorporated in Citi's ratings, Fitch is sensitive to  increased risk taking on the company's part to meet its 2015 financial targets.  As such, any perceived changes to the company's risk appetite would be assessed  for rating implications. Citigroup is one of the largest banking institutions in the world, with by far  the biggest international banking franchise among U.S. peers. Citi also has  material capital markets operations, comprising on average around 25% of  revenues. With a vast international franchise, Citi's revenue diversity in terms  of geography is greater than its peers, with sizable business operations in many  faster growing emerging markets, including China, India, and Mexico. However,  this increased revenue diversity also present potential issues with regard to  exposure to any political unrest in foreign countries, as well as the need for a  sophisticated risk management infrastructure to manage risk around the globe.  Fitch still views Citi's risk management infrastructure as enhanced since the  financial crisis, notwithstanding the risk management missteps last year. Fitch  views Citi's completed or pending strategic changes favorably as they reduce  future operational, compliance, and legal-related risk related to such an  expansive global franchise. Despite these enhancements, the complexity of global  operations and a reliance on more volatile capital markets revenues serve as  constraints to further upgrades to the VR.  Lastly, Citi loan losses are typically higher than peer averages. Fitch  attributes some of Citi's weaker relative asset quality profile to its high  balance of TDRs, which contributes to elevated NPAs. Given the company's  exposure to higher loss content credit card loans and Mexico, loan losses are  also higher than industry averages. Fitch expects that loan losses may increase  for the industry given the very benign credit environment, and unsustainably low  levels of credit losses.  The VRs remain equalized between Citi and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of Citi and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between the Citi and these subsidiaries. Fitch  takes a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the  IDR reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  Citi's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC) requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding  company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior  liabilities relative to holding company senior debt. In our view these buffers  would provide substantial protection to senior unsecured obligations in the  domestic operating entities in the event of group resolution, as they could be  used to absorb losses and recapitalize operating companies. Therefore,  substantial holding company debt reduces the likelihood of default on operating  company senior obligations. As at end-2014, Citi had hybrid and senior debt as a  percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA) of approximately 11%, exceeding the Pillar  1 capital requirement.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch sees limited near-term upward VR momentum given a relatively high and  absolute rating. The company's complex organizational structure and reliance on  more volatile capital markets revenues act as key constraints to further upward  movement to ratings. IDRs and senior debt are now sensitive to any changes in  the VR.  Any unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other legal-related charges could  have adverse rating implications for Citi. Fitch notes there is very little  visibility into ultimate legal-related risk for Citi or the industry, though  Fitch expects litigation costs will remain manageable relative to capital for  Citi. A fine that was to deplete capital in a material way may lead to negative  rating action. Fitch's rating action assumes that any potential criminal charges  as they relate to foreign exchange manipulations will not materially impact  ongoing business operations. Absent that, ratings may be adversely impacted,  though Fitch has limited visibility into this outcome. While there is no outsized reliance on a single market outside of the U.S.  (Mexico being the largest at 10% of Citicorp revenues), if there are issues  related to economic slowdowns or political unrest in a particular emerging  market, it is possible there may be effects for Citi. The secondary effects of a  slowdown in a particular country, for example, Russia, and those cascading  impacts to the global economy are much harder to quantify and assess for any  implications to Citi or its peers.  Fitch still views Citi's risk management infrastructure as enhanced since the  financial crisis. Citi's ratings could be vulnerable to a large operational loss  or if an operational event calls into question Fitch's assessment of Citi's risk  management function and its ability to accurately identify, monitor, and  mitigate risks throughout the organization.  Downward pressure on the VR may also result from a material deterioration in  capital or liquidity levels. It is the strength of the liquidity and capital  profiles that underpin Citi's ratings. Fitch's ratings action incorporates an  expectation that Citi will manage its capital and liquidity profiles relatively  conservatively, and although capital distributions will likely increase over  time, they will still be governed by regulatory stress testing and as such,  remain reasonable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that Citi  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Citi and by its  subsidiaries are all notched down from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's  assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss  severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. Subordinated debt issued by the  operating companies is rated at the same level as subordinated debt issued by  Citi reflecting the potential for subordinated creditors in the operating  companies to be exposed to loss ahead of senior creditors in Citi. This is also  supported by the FSB's proposal to have internal TLAC rank senior to regulatory  capital at the operating company. Their ratings are primarily sensitive to any  change in the common VR. They have, therefore, been affirmed due to the  affirmation of the common VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS The upgrade of Citibank, N.A.'s and Citibank Banamex USA's deposit ratings is  based on the upgrade of their IDRs. Deposit ratings are one notch higher than  senior debt reflecting the deposits' superior recovery prospects in case of  default given depositor preference in the U.S.  Citi's international subsidiary, Citibank Canada's deposit ratings are at the  same level as senior debt ratings because their preferential status is less  clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it difficult to  determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. SUBSIDIARY KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited,  Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Services LCC, Citibank  Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, CitiFinancial Europe plc, and Citibank International  Limited (formerly known as Citibank International PLC),  are wholly owned  subsidiaries of Citi or Citibank, N.A.  Their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with Citi or Citibank, N.A. reflecting  Fitch's view that these entities are core and integral to Citi's business  strategy and operations. Their IDRs and ratings would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in Citi's IDR. Fitch has revised the Rating Outlook for Citi's material international operating  companies' IDRs to Positive, including Citigroup Global Markets Limited,  Citibank Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, and Citibank International Limited. The  revision of the Outlook is in light of the internal pre-positioning required  under the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) TLAC proposal. The Positive Outlook  reflects the agency's belief that the internal TLAC of material international  operating companies will likely be large enough to meet Pillar 1 capital  requirements and will then be sufficient to recapitalize them. A one-notch  upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient clarity on additional disclosure on  the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its sufficiency in size to cover a  default of senior operating company liabilities. Sufficient clarity may,  however, take longer to come through than the typical Outlook horizon of one to  two years.  Domestic subsidiaries and international subsidiaries that have not been upgraded  or placed on Rating Outlook Positive are in Fitch's opinion not sufficiently  material to benefit from domestic support from Citi or are international  subsidiaries that would not benefit from internal TLAC. This includes Citigroup  Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Securities LLC, and  CitiFinancial Europe PLC.

638,"  * Citi, Barclays, JPMorgan and RBS plead guilty* UBS fine lower than expected, shares hit 6-1/2 yr high* Barclays fined $2.4 bln, fires 8 employeesBy Karen Freifeld, David Henry and Steve SlaterNEW YORK/LONDON, May 20 Four major banks pleaded guilty on Wednesday to trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates and, with two others, were fined nearly $6 billion in another settlement in a global probe into the $5 trillion-a-day market.Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Barclays Plc, UBS AG  and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc were accused by U.S. and UK officials of brazenly cheating clients to boost their own profits using invitation-only chat rooms and coded language to coordinate their trades.All but UBS pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate the price of U.S. dollars and euros exchanged in the FX spot market. UBS pleaded guilty to a different charge. Bank of America Corp  was fined but avoided a guilty plea over the actions of its traders in chatrooms.""The penalty all these banks will now pay is fitting, considering the long-running and egregious nature of their anticompetitive conduct,"" said U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a news conference in Washington.The misconduct occurred until 2013, after regulators  started punishing banks for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor), a global benchmark, and banks had pledged to overhaul their corporate culture and bolster compliance.In total, authorities in the United States and Europe have fined seven banks over $10 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates, which are used daily by millions of people from trillion-dollar investment houses to tourists buying foreign currencies on vacation.The investigations are far from over. Prosecutors could bring cases against individuals, using the banks' cooperation pledged as part of their agreements. Probes by federal and state authorities are ongoing over how banks used electronic forex trading to favor their own interests at the expense of clients.The settlements on Wednesday stood out in part because the U.S. Department of Justice forced Citigroup's main banking unit Citicorp, and the parents of JPMorgan, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland to plead guilty to U.S. criminal charges.It was the first time in decades that the parent or main banking unit of a major American financial institution pleaded guilty to criminal charges.Until recently, U.S. authorities rarely sought criminal convictions against the parents of global financial institutions, instead settling with smaller foreign subsidiaries. That made it easier for the government and the banks to control any fallout on the financial system and bank customers.Banks involved in the plea deals have been negotiating regulatory exemptions to avoid serious business disruptions that could be triggered by the pleas. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has granted waivers to JPMorgan and the other banks that pleaded guilty, allowing them to continue their usual securities business.With prosecutors and the banks working out ways for the institutions to keep doing business, analysts worried that convictions would become more routine and costly for banks.""The broader problem is that this now sets the stage for the Justice Department to try to criminally prosecute banks for all sorts of transgressions,"" said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities.Lawyers said the guilty pleas would make it easier for pension funds and investment managers who have regular currency dealings with banks to sue them for losses on those trades.""There is already a lot of work going on behind the scenes assessing how claims could be brought forward and those potential claimants will be looking to today's announcement for evidence to support their analysis,"" said Simon Hart, banking litigation partner at London law firm RPC.CITI BEHAVIOR ""EMBARRASSMENT"" - CEO  Citicorp will pay $925 million, the highest criminal fine, as well as $342 million to the U.S. Federal Reserve.Its traders participated in the conspiracy from as early as December 2007 until at least January 2013, according to the plea agreement.Traders at Citi, JPMorgan and other banks were part of a group known as ""The Cartel"" or ""The Mafia,"" participating in almost daily conversations in an exclusive chat room and coordinating trades and otherwise fixing rates.The bank's behavior was ""an embarrassment,"" Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat said in a memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters.Corbat said an internal investigation should conclude shortly. So far nine people have been fired.University of Virginia law school professor Brandon Garrett said the last case comparable to Citi or JPMorgan, involving a major U.S. financial institution pleading guilty to criminal charges in the United States was Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989.JPMorgan's share of the criminal fine was $550 million, based on its involved from July 2010 until January 2013. It also agreed to pay the Federal Reserve $342 million. JPMorgan Chase said the conduct underlying the antitrust charge was ""principally attributable to a single trader"" who has been fired.In New York, shares in JP Morgan and Citigroup were down 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.""IF YOU AIN'T CHEATING, YOU AIN'T TRYING"" Britain's Barclays was fined a record $2.4 billion. Its staff continued to engage in misleading sales practices despite a pledge by CEO Antony Jenkins to overhaul the bank's high-risk, high-reward culture.Barclays' sales staff would offer clients a different price to the one offered by the bank's traders, known as a ""mark-up"" to boost profits. Generating mark-ups was a high priority for sales managers, with one employee noting, ""If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.""Barclays fired four traders in the last month. New York state's banking regulator Benjamin Lawsky ordered the bank to fire another four who had been suspended or placed on paid leave.Barclays had set aside $3.2 billion to cover any forex-related settlement. Shares in the bank rose more than 3 percent to an 18-month high as investors welcomed the removal of uncertainty over the forex scandal.UBS was the first firm to report the misconduct to U.S. officials. It pleaded guilty and will pay a $203 million criminal penalty for breaching a non-prosecution agreement over manipulation of the Libor benchmark interest rate, in part based on its forex practices.UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, will also pay $342 million to the Federal Reserve over attempted manipulation of forex rates.The Royal Bank of Scotland will pay a criminal fine of $395 million, and a $274 million penalty to the Fed.The U.S. central bank fined six banks for unsafe and unsound practices in the foreign exchange markets, including a $205 million fine for Bank of America.UBS's penalty was lower than expected, and helped its shares rise to their highest in six-and-a-half years.The global investigation into manipulation of foreign exchange rates has put the largely unregulated forex market on a tighter leash and accelerated a push to automate trading. Authorities in South Africa announced this week they were opening their own probe.

644,"  * Web of legal actions resulting from suspected fraud in China* Citi, Mercuria caught in fallout from metals financing probe* Judge says Mercuria does not have to pay CitiBy Eric OnstadLONDON, May 22 U.S. bank Citigroup Inc  failed on Friday in a bid to win an order from a London court that would force trade house Mercuria to pay about $270 million in potential losses for metals financing deals in China hit by suspected fraud.The complex case is one of a web of legal actions filed in the wake of a probe launched in May 2014 by Chinese authorities of suspected fraud at China's Qingdao port, the world's seventh busiest, and nearby Penglai.The alleged fraud is estimated to have stung Western banks and trading houses as well as local Asian banks for more than $3 billion in total. Neither Citigroup nor Mercuria Energy Trading Ltd are accused of fraud, but have been caught in the fallout from the probe.""Citi's tender of endorsed warehouse receipts was not good delivery of metal to Mercuria,"" High Court Judge Mr. Justice Phillips said in the judgment.""Citi is therefore not entitled to judgment for the unpaid price of that metal."" China has been investigating whether private metals trading firm Decheng Mining and its related companies used fake warehouse receipts to obtain multiple loans secured against a single cargo of metal.Mercuria held copper and aluminium in Chinese warehouses and agreed a series of deals that were effective loans from Citi using the metal as collateral.Under the repurchasing agreements, or repos, Citi agreed to purchase metal from Mercuria before selling it back at a slightly higher price to include interest on the effective loans. The two groups were in the midst of several repo deals when the potential fraud in China was uncovered in warehouses in both Qingdao and Penglai. Citi demanded early repayment of the repos and Mercuria refused.Mercuria welcomed the judgment while Citi vowed to press on in its attempts to force payment from Mercuria.""Although the Court ruled Citi is not entitled to repayment now, Citi will vigorously pursue compensation from Mercuria for failure to deliver or safeguard the metal once further facts are established,"" the U.S. group said in a statement.The Chinese probe is ongoing and authorities have not allowed access to warehouses affected by the suspected fraud.Citi and Mercuria had a close business relationship but turned on each other during a frantic several weeks after the suspected fraud was uncovered, seeking to shift financial responsibility onto each other, the court heard during hearings in December.

646,"   By Freya Berry and Claire Ruckin | LONDON  LONDON Australian infrastructure investor Macquarie (MQG.AX) has tapped Citi (C.N) to work on a potential sale of service station provider Moto in a deal that could be worth more than 1.1 billion pounds ($1.68 billion), three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Moto, Britain's largest motorway services company, had 2014 core earnings (EBITDA) of around 91 million pounds. The asset could appeal to both private equity groups and infrastructure funds.UK peer Roadchef was sold in a 153 million pound deal last year. That sale valued the business at around 12.5 times its earnings, one of the sources said. A similar valuation would put Moto at about 1.1 billion pounds. Citi and Macquarie declined to comment. Macquarie's infrastructure arm purchased Moto from UK firm Compass as part of a consortium of investors in 2006. Compass also sold Upper Crust owner SSP (SSPG.L) at the same time. The travel food business was listed on the London Stock Exchange last year.  Moto, which hosts companies such as Burger King [BKCBK.UL], Costa and WH Smith (SMWH.L), has 45 locations across the UK and around 6,000 staff. It had turnover of 803.4 million pounds in 2014.  The firm raised a 445 million pound loan in March 2015 in conjunction with a 175 million pound high yield bond, to refinance existing debt, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. The loan, which comprises a 385 million pound term loan B, 50 million pound capital expenditure facility and 10 million pound revolving credit, was provided by Commerzbank, Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, ING, Investec, Lloyds, Scotia and Societe Generale.  The infrastructure-styled refinancing came with portability which means debt can remain in place under new ownership, one of the sources said. Usually when a business is sold, it triggers a change of control provision, which requires any existing debt to be repaid.  The ability to keep debt in place is likely to be attractive to potential buyers, unburdened with finding a debt financing to back any acquisition.         Service station assets can appeal both to buyout firms and to infrastructure funds, who are attracted by their relatively stable, cash-generative nature.      Roadchef was snapped up by European fund Antin Infrastrcutre partners in September last year.    And Guy Hands' buyout house Terra Firma [TERA.UL] this year put German motorway service station Tank & Rast up for sale, hoping for a valuation of up to 15 times core earnings, in a deal potentially worth between 3 and 3.5 billion euros ($3.83 billion).     First round bids for the asset have just gone in, with investors including Allianz, ADIA and PSP all expected to show interest.

Last month, Citigroup failed in a bid to win an order from a London court that would force trade house Mercuria to pay about $270 million in potential losses for metals financing deals in China hit by the suspected fraud.    ""There's no question that when we look at a situation like that, we do a lot of analysis about who we are doing business with, where we're doing business and what kind of transactions we do,"" Jim Cowles, chief executive of the bank for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) told Reuters. ""That has lead us to examine each one of those areas and we've made changes accordingly."" he told Reuters in an interview this week.Cowles did not give further details, but a spokesman said the bank no longer has any metals financing business in China and was reviewing its strategy.  The complex court case was one of a web of legal actions filed in the wake of a probe launched in May 2014 by Chinese authorities of suspected fraud at China's Qingdao port, the world's seventh busiest, and nearby Penglai. The alleged fraud is estimated to have stung Western banks and trading houses as well as local Asian banks for more than $3 billion in total, according to industry sources.Neither Citigroup or Mercuria Energy Trading Ltd is accused of fraud, but have been caught in the fallout from the probe. Citigroup has expanded in commodities, moving as some rivals withdrew due to higher capital requirements and tougher regulation in the wake of the global financial crisis.""If you look at what we had within the institutional business on commodities, we didn't have that much of a presence.  We decided that we wanted to build that business and we're doing it at the same time our competitors had historic businesses that they had to get out of,"" Cowles said.Citigroup's commodity revenue doubled last year after soaring 230 percent in 2013. It does not provide outright revenue figures for its commodities business. The bank moved up to fourth ranking for commodities revenues among top investment banks at the end of 2014 from ninth in 2012, according to financial sector consultancy Coalition.""Given our footprint across the region, particularly in emerging markets, I think there's a lot to be done with the public sector as well as corporations in terms of different types of commodity products,"" he said.""I think that's where we've got a particular advantage in terms of knowing the clients, having that geographic presence.""

Ltd to block the release of some iron ore stocks and has prompted checks by customers on the fate of their holdings of the commodity stored at the port. Oversight of China's ports has been under scrutiny since a  scandal last year at Qingdao port involving commodity financing where a private trading firm is alleged to have duplicated warehouse certificates to pledge a metal cargo multiple times as collateral for loans. Using commodities as collateral to raise money is common in China and not illegal, but duplicating receipts to repeatedly mortgage the full value of an asset is fraud and could leave more than one creditor holding claims to the same collateral.New examples of irregularities at ports will raise fresh concerns about the risks of storing commodities in China and commodity financing, traders say.Tianjin Port No. 5 Stevedoring Co., a unit of the listed port operator, Tianjin Port Holdings Co. Ltd, said in a memo sent to clients and dated May 29, 2015, that an unnamed logistics agent had acted with a trading firm, also not named, to release cargoes without authority or paying port fees. ""This matter was caused completely by the illegal operations of the agent and a related downstream trader and the port company did not itself sign...or participate in any unauthorized cargo release,"" Tianjin Port No. 5 said in the memo, seen by Reuters. ""Hence, the port company was not involved in any transgression. Furthermore, to protect its legal rights, the port company has already initiated legal proceedings,"" it said.An agent is normally required to obtain a certificate issued by the port, pay management fees and present paperwork issued by a shipping firm and customs to take away stocks, said the memo, whose contents were verified by the company's lawyer. The memo did not name any parties or the nature of the transgression. A manager at the trading firm identified by some traders as being involved declined to comment.  A call to the parent firm of the agent, which was also named by traders as being involved, was referred to a branch in Tianjin, where the manager was not available when a Reuters reporter visited. A spokesman for the main Tianjin port operator said the company was still looking into the matter and calls to the customs agency in the city were not answered. ACCESS TO IRON ORE  According to a source with knowledge of the situation, a unit of Zhejiang Materials Industry Group had imported iron ore on behalf of a small trading company after receiving a deposit, but the ore was then removed from the private warehouse without the state-owned firm's knowledge before a full payment was made. This means that the unit faces a potential loss because it paid in full for the iron ore it imported. The unit, Zhejiang Materials Industry International Co. Ltd, confirmed that it had imported the cargo and was still investigating its whereabouts.It was not clear the exact tonnage of iron ore involved, but a capsize vessel typically carries about 170,000 tonnes of iron ore currently worth nearly $11 million. Another state-owned trading firm, Tewoo Group Co. Ltd, said in an email that a subsidiary had not been able to access some of its iron ore stocks at the private warehouse in the port.The lawyer for Tianjin Port No. 5 said some stocks had been frozen but did not specify who the owners were and declined to comment further, referring to the information in the memo.

658,"  (Adds details)By Paul KilbyNEW YORK, June 11 (IFR) - Jamaica is readying investor meetings in Europe and the US through Citigroup, according to an investor.The Caribbean nation, rated Caa2/B/B-, will see accounts in Los Angeles on June 16, in New York on June 18, in Boston in June 19, in London on June 22, in Germany on June 23 and in Amsterdam on June 24.Meetings are being as described as a non-deal roadshow, but markets have been expecting the sovereign to raise funding to retire a PetroCaribe loan owed to Venezuela. The idea is to replicate a transaction earlier this year from the Dominican Republic, which used proceeds from a bond sale to pay just US$1.93bn on US$4bn of debt owed to Venezuela state-owned oil company PDVSA.For Jamaica, the success of a similar transaction will depend on the cost of bond financing and how much of a discount Venezuela is will to give. ""I suppose the roadshow is to figure out what kind of tenor and yield they can get,"" said the investor.The sovereign is seen as an improving credit story. S&P upgraded the sovereign to B from B- earlier this month. However, the government's choice of tenor may prove tricky should it decide to return to the international bond markets, given the number of maturities it has due between 2019 and 2025.It already has outstanding 10.625% 2017s, 8% 2019s, 8.5% 2021s, 11.625% 2022s, 7.625% 2025s and 9.25% 2025s. This doesn't include other state-controlled entities such as NROCC, which also has a 9.375% 2024.""They can't issue a 10-year, as they have so many maturities around then,"" the investor said.

661,"   By Eric Onstad and Anjuli Davies | LONDON  LONDON Citigroup Inc (C.N) and rivals in the commodity trade finance sector are facing headwinds of weak oil prices, sanctions on Russia and stiff competition, which have pressured fees.The U.S. bank, which launched its business in the sector three years ago, has shifted attention from China, where fees are weak, to Africa and Latin America, said Kris van Broekhoven, global head of commodity trade finance.""It's still a tough environment,"" he told Reuters.""China is not an easy market. It's very competitive and pricing is low. We want growth, but not at any cost."" Citi started off with oil, added metals last year and plans to include agricultural commodities by the end of 2015.The bulk of its business has come from financing deals with big trading houses and this is being expanded to include the next tier of mid-sized traders, Van Broekhoven said.But the sharp drop in oil prices means that the value of business in the sector available for financing has tumbled. ""For the same number of barrels, for the same cargos that move from one place to another, the value is half of what it was before,"" he added.""That means that banks have to fight to get their credit lines utilized, which drives pricing down.""RISING COSTS  At the same time, costs are rising due to a heavier burden of compliance and regulations.In certain cases, Citi has refrained from certain business when the returns were not enough.""When the costs are increasing, at a certain point it no longer makes sense to do something at the price the client is paying,"" he said. ""I do believe the moment will come when banks will reprice a bit upwards. That's one thing I would expect over the next 12 months.""    Citi, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, is pressing on with its expansion in commodity trade finance and is still growing its revenues in the sector every year despite the challenges, Van Broekhoven said.According to a report in the Financial Times in 2012, Citi aimed to make more than $200 million in net income from the business within three years. Van Broekhoven declined to give specific revenue figures or to comment on the reported target.Sanctions on Russia due to the Ukraine crisis have also had an impact on Citi's business since it has been a big player in the region, Van Broekhoven said.To help counter the challenges, the commodity trade finance business, which has a headcount of 14, plans to expand into Latin America this year.

662,"   By Tom Bergin and Simon Robinson | LONDON  LONDON Citigroup (C.N) is planning to shift the head office of its European retail banking operation to Dublin from London to benefit from lower costs and capital requirements.This week the bank wrote to clients to say the UK-based business, Citibank International Limited, which operates a small number of branches across some 20 European countries, would be taken over by Dublin-based Citibank Europe Plc.""From a strategic perspective for Citi, moving to a single pan-European bank is expected to reduce operational and regulatory complexity, capital requirements and cost,"" the company told clients.Analysts said UK rules that require banks to hold a higher level of cash in reserve than other European countries do was  likely to be a factor behind the move but that they did not expect to see a stream of other banks moving their headquarters from the UK.A spokeswoman for the bank said the change in the retail bank's legal domicile and principal regulatory base would not involve job cuts and that the leadership of the European retail operation would continue to be based in London.""The primary reason (for the move) is simplification, mirroring Citi’s strategy of creating a simpler, safer, stronger institution,"" she said.Citigroup has been scaling back its retail operations in recent years and remains a small player in Europe. Citibank International Ltd employed 4,600 people at the end of last year, filings show. Citibank Europe Plc employed 4,300 and currently focuses on providing transaction services to financial services and corporate clients.  The spokeswoman denied that the decision to rebase in Dublin was influenced by the possibility of the UK leaving the European Union following the referendum on EU membership which is due to be held in the next two years.Also, although Ireland has become a magnet for international financial institutions thanks to its low tax rate, the spokeswoman said the restructuring was not tax driven.REGULATORY CAPITAL  Since the financial crisis regulators have increased the amount of cash and government bonds banks must keep in reserve in case of financial storms.Higher capital requirements mean less money to lend out or invest and consequently lower returns for a bank.European Union countries apply the same international rules on capital requirements. However, on top of the basic reserve requirements, regulators require some banks to hold additional capital as a buffer. The amount depends on the regulator's perception of the bank's systemic or business risks.The UK's banking industry is much larger in terms of its assets as a percentage of national GDP than that of other countries in Europe, which means bank failures could cause bigger economic ripples than elsewhere. This has led the UK regulator to require banks to set aside more money than other European countries demand, analysts said.""The UK regulator has typically been at the conservative end in terms of capital requirements,"" said Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital.In future, Citigroup will have to set aside the same percentage of its UK assets as it currently does. However, it may no longer be required to set aside a similar percentage of total European assets if the Irish regulator takes a more lenient approach to its UK counterpart.The Citigroup spokeswoman declined to say how much any reduction in capital requirements might save the bank. Greenwood said that since most UK-headquartered retail banks are focused on the UK market, they would be unlikely to benefit much from shifting their principal regulatory base to Ireland.

663,"   By Kirstin Ridley | London  London A senior manager at Citigroup tried to persuade British brokers to ""talk down"" benchmark Libor interest rates in 2007, a London criminal court heard on Tuesday.Andrew Thursfield, head of Citigroup's European risk treasury business, told the jury in the trial of former trader Tom Hayes that the U.S.-based bank had been able to borrow at rates below those posted on trading screens by brokerages.Thursfield, appearing as a witness for the prosecution, said broker screens were showing Libor rates that the U.S. bank felt did not reflect the full range and width of the market.In an email exchange with U.S. colleague Scott Bere on Sept. 7 2007 that was shown to the court, Thursfield said: ""We will continue to pressure the brokers to talk it (Libor) down and generally press lower than all others..."".Thursfield is a Citigroup veteran who has spent more than 20 years in the bank's treasury department. Hayes, a former Tokyo-based yen derivatives trader, is charged by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud between 2006 and 2010.Hayes, who allegedly tried to rig rates to benefit his trading book, has pleaded not guilty and is expected to lay out his defense next month in a trial scheduled to last well into August. Hayes, a 35-year-old Briton, who worked for Citigroup in 2010, is accused of using a network of traders and London brokers to influence the yen denominated London interbank offered rate (Libor), used as a reference for around $450 trillion of financial contracts worldwide. Bere, head of Citigroup's North American risk treasury business, whose emails were also shown to the jury and read out in court, wrote to Thursfield on Sept. 13, 2007: ""Assuming you don't need a high setting for your book ...

664,"   By Kirstin Ridley | London, June 23  London, June 23 A senior manager at Citigroup  tried to persuade British brokers to ""talk down"" benchmark Libor interest rates in 2007, a London criminal court heard on Tuesday.Andrew Thursfield, head of Citigroup's European risk treasury business, told the jury in the trial of former trader Tom Hayes that the U.S.-based bank had been able to borrow at rates below those posted on trading screens by brokerages.Thursfield, appearing as a witness for the prosecution, said broker screens were showing Libor rates that the U.S. bank felt did not reflect the full range and width of the market.In an email exchange with U.S. colleague Scott Bere on Sept. 7 2007 that was shown to the court, Thursfield said: ""We will continue to pressure the brokers to talk it (Libor) down and generally press lower than all others..."". Thursfield is a Citigroup veteran who has spent more than 20 years in the bank's treasury department.Hayes, a former Tokyo-based yen derivatives trader, is charged by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud between 2006 and 2010.Hayes, who allegedly tried to rig rates to benefit his trading book, has pleaded not guilty and is expected to lay out his defence next month in a trial scheduled to last well into August. Hayes, a 35-year-old Briton, who worked for Citigroup in 2010, is accused of using a network of traders and London brokers to influence the yen denominated London interbank offered rate (Libor), used as a reference for around $450 trillion of financial contracts worldwide.Bere, head of Citigroup's North American risk treasury business, whose emails were also shown to the jury and read out in court, wrote to Thursfield on Sept. 13, 2007: ""Assuming you don't need a high setting for your book ... I would appreciate it if we could be aggressive with our setting (ie 60 or lower).""

665,"   By James Regan | SYDNEY  SYDNEY India's Adani Mining said on Wednesday it was rejigging the budget on the A$10 billion ($7.72 billion) Carmichael coal mine project in Australia as it faces delays in government approvals.Adani intends to ship most of the coal from the mine to India for use in generating household power in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal to connect all of India to the electricity grid during his tenure.In announcing the setback, Adani also confirmed a media report it had asked independent contracting firms employed on the project to halt work around the mine.A report in the Guardian Australia said it had asked its four engineering contractors to stop operating, raising speculation that the Indian company might scrap the project altogether. ""This is only temporary,"" an Adani spokeswoman, Kate Haddan said, adding a target to commence coal mining in 2017 stood for now.       Adani in a statement said the project's current budget based on previous anticipated approval timelines and milestones were no longer achievable due to delays in receiving various approvals from the Queensland state government. ""As a result of changes to a range of approvals over that time, it’s necessary to synchronize our budget, project timelines and spending to meet those changes,"" it said.Adani has signed up buyers for about 70 percent of the 40 million tonnes coal the Carmichael project is due to produce in its first phase.Adani's project mainly hinges on environmental approval to deepen a port on the fringe of Australia' Great Barrier Reef in order to ship the coal, a proposal generating opposition worldwide.  An earlier plan to dump 3 million cubic meters of soil dredged at the port of Abbot Point into the sea about 25 km (15 miles) from the Great Barrier Reef was rejected.The Australian federal government must approve the actual channel dredging and the state needs to clear Adani's solution for storing the spoil.A draft U.N. ruling has recommended against listing the Great Barrier Reef as ""in danger"" but indicated it remains on its watchlist ahead of a final ruling due by the end of this month as it monitors plans for dredging. Eleven of the world’s biggest private investment banks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase, have publicly ruled out providing financing to Adani, citing environmental concerns over the reef and fossil fuel development.The Queensland Department of State Development, which is charged with approving the storage procedure, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Australia's minister for industry and science, Ian Macfarlane, recently said he was confident Adani would build the  mine because India was looking for a stable supplier of coal.

Citi's Asian franchise now has 12 of the lender's 24 consumer banking markets globally, and contributes a fifth of global profits. ""Citi Asia is a sign of where Citigroup as a whole potentially can go,"" CLSA analyst Mike Mayo said in a research note prior to the announcements. The lender's strategy in the region has been to move from targeting the mass market to richer 'mass affluent' customers, Mayo wrote. The appointments this week of Larsen and Bird, who oversaw that push in Asia to trim low-profit customers and target wealthier clients, signals Citi's intention to pursue the strategy globally.In a separate memo also seen by Reuters on Thursday, Citi named Anand Selvakesari as head of consumer banking for Asia, a position Larsen has been holding since 2009.

The judge also ordered Citi to pay half of Mercuria's legal fees, including an immediate payment of roughly $500,000, the report said.The news comes after Citi in May lost its legal challenge in London to force Mercuria to pay about $270 million in potential losses for the metals financing deals in China.

The alleged fraud is estimated to have stung Western banks and trading houses as well as local Asian banks for more than $3 billion in total.

690,"   By Neha Dimri and David Henry  Citigroup Inc, the third biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported its highest quarterly profit since the financial crisis as Chief Executive Michael Corbat's restructuring and cost-cutting efforts paid off and the bank's legal expenses plunged.Under Corbat, who replaced Vikram Pandit as CEO in 2012, Citi has been selling retail operations in several countries, shrinking its U.S. branch network and disposing of non-core businesses.The bank's shares rose 3 percent to a six-and-a-half-year high of $58.18 on Thursday after its adjusted earnings handily beat analysts' estimates.Operating expenses in Citicorp, which holds the bank's core businesses, fell 6 percent to $9.8 billion in the second quarter.Citi shrank the assets of Citi Holdings, which houses businesses it plans to sell, by 22 percent compared with 19 percent in the first quarter. The unit posted earnings of $157 million.""Through active expense and balance sheet discipline, we are on track to reach our financial targets for the year,"" Corbat said in a statement.Corbat set out two years ago to increase Citi's return on assets and make it more efficient. He also aimed to raise the bank's return on equity, but faced hurdles when the U.S. Federal Reserve rejected his capital-return plan.  The Fed finally approved the bank's new buyback plan in March and allowed it to raise dividend for the first time since 2008.Citi's return on average assets was 1.06 percent in the quarter ended June 30, higher than Corbat's target of at least 0.9 percent for the year. Efficiency ratio in the Citicorp unit was 55 percent, the midpoint of Corbat's target of 53−57 percent.Revenue from Citi's fixed income business fell 1 percent to $3.06 billion, a much smaller decline than that reported by other Wall Street banks.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which reported a steep fall in profit earlier on Thursday, said net revenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity trading plunged 28 percent.Bank of America Corp's fixed income revenue fell 9.3 percent, while JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a 10 percent drop.Revenue in Citi's Institutional Clients Group, which includes its investment banking and fixed income and equities trading businesses, rose 2 percent to $8.58 billion.  The quarter included a charge of $175 million in Citi's equity trading business as collateral the bank held against client financing transactions was less liquid than it thought, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach told reporters on a conference call.Citi discovered the valuation error in a ""periodic review"" of collateral, he said. Without the charge, equity trading revenue would have risen 26 percent instead of falling 1 percent, Gerspach said.   Citi's net income rose to $4.85 billion, or $1.51 per share, from $181 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier, when the bank was hit by a $3.8 billion legal charge. Adjusting for legal costs and some accounting items, earnings rose 18 percent to $4.65 billion, or $1.45 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total adjusted revenue fell 1.5 percent to $19.16 billion, coming slightly above analysts' expectations of $19.11 billion.

691,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Citigroup Inc has unloaded the vast majority of its worst assets from the financial crisis, but may be saddled for a long time with a core of $85 billion in troubled loans and bonds, the bank's chief financial officer said.The No. 3 U.S. bank by assets has now winnowed its portfolio of undesirable loans down to $116 billion from $649 billion in 2009, Citigroup said on Thursday. It has signed contracts to sell another $32 billion by year-end, taking the total to about $85 billion, or less than 5 percent of total assets.""After that it is going to be a little more difficult to have significant reductions,"" Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in a conference call with reporters to discuss quarterly earnings.What is left in Citi Holdings, the ""bad bank"" that the lender split off from its core operations as part of a post financial crisis restructuring, has little to appeal to buyers. It is mostly home mortgage loans, many of which were made to U.S. subprime borrowers during the housing bubble.Some $23 billion of the loans are second mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Borrowers' required monthly payments are set to rise on about half of the loans between now and 2017, Gerspach said later on an analyst call. Defaults often spike around such resets.  The portfolio expected to remain at year-end will tie up roughly $10 billion of capital with little promise of profits. Gerspach said he thinks the portfolio will be ""no worse than break even on an annual basis.""The portfolio's more profitable assets are already gone or slated for sale. Citi Holdings earned $306 million in the first half of this year, a significant portion of which was from subprime lender OneMain Financial, the sale of which is expect to close by October.   What remains should not be a major drag on Citigroup profits assuming there is no new housing bust, said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Still, the loans remain a toxic legacy of the company's past. At $85 billion, the portfolio would represent roughly 40 percent of Citigroup's common equity, which is the cushion the bank has against losses on assets.Bank of America Corp,, which bought Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch as they were failing during the financial crisis, has retained a portfolio of troubled loans valued at less than half Citi's. Gerspach said he has hope borrowers will show in coming months that they can handle the payment resets and that more investors will then want Citigroup's remaining assets.""Perhaps a market for home equity loans will open up, if not later this year then perhaps early or mid-next,"" Gerspach said.

698,"   By Melanie Burton and James Regan | MELBOURNE/SYDNEY  MELBOURNE/SYDNEY A 30 percent slump in nickel prices this year has piled pressure on small Australian miners, forcing some of them to delay new projects and expansions as they wait for the market to recover.Poseidon Nickel became the latest miner to succumb when it said on Thursday it would put its Lake Johnston mine on care and maintenance - a sign casualties were mounting amid near record metal stockpiles and weak demand from key consumer China.Exchange stockpiles of the metal used to make stainless steel nearly doubled in the 18 months to June, pressuring benchmark prices to six-year lows of $10,430 per tonne last week, down 32 percent since the start 2015. ""When you've got 70 percent of an industry at break-even or loss making you're going to see people defer projects and shut down,"" said UBS analyst Daniel Morgan in Sydney.""I think you'll see a steady stream of these type of announcements for the next several months,"" he added.Panoramic Resources blamed the low metal prices for its decision this week to curtail development of its Jury-Metcalfe lode, saying ""significantly higher"" prices were needed for it to ramp up output as planned in December. It also warned of possible job losses. Mincor has said it could start cutting output by November unless nickel prices improved.Australian's Macquarie has slashed its nickel price view, cutting it by 13 percent for 2015, after similar moves by other investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, Citi, ANZ and JP Morgan.Macquarie, however, expects prices to recover later this year, a view echoed by UBS, as demand from China's mills picks up and exchange stocks extend a decline that began last month. ""With future deficits (and higher pricing) projected, producer optimism remains, but the question is whether balance sheets will force closure before the upside comes,"" Macquarie said in a research note.As of now, low prices have hit valuations for nickel mines.Global mining and commodity trader Glencore recently sold a nickel mine inherited through its Xstrata takeover to Australian nickel producer Western Areas. The Cosmos nickel mine in Western Australia was sold for A$24.5 million ($18.14 million), a fraction of the A$3.1 billion Xstrata had spent in 2008 to acquire the Cosmos and Sinclair mines as part of its takeover of Jubilee Mines. Nickel blunders run rampant in Australia.Back in 2007, BHP Billiton spent $6 billion building the Ravensthorpe mine, but within a year, nickel prices crashed, forcing the miner to shut Ravensthorpe and take a $5.16 billion bad investment impairment. It finally sold Ravensthorpe to Canada's First Quantum for $340 million in 2009.

699,"   By Lawrence White | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Citigroup Inc and Standard Chartered Plc are set to advise Myanmar on its first credit rating, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, paving the way for the country to issue its maiden international bond.After decades of isolation from international capital markets under military rule, Myanmar faces a widening current account deficit that could be bridged by borrowing once it has a credit rating from agencies such as Fitch, Moody's or Standard & Poor's.None of the big three agencies have currently assigned Myanmar a rating, which professional investors use as a benchmark of a country's ability to repay debt.""Getting a credit rating is of the first importance for Myanmar, helping it to clean up its public finances,"" said Sean Turnell, a professor at Macquarie University in Sydney who has advised the U.S. Congress on Myanmar's economy.""It's also important symbolically, sending the signal the country is...not the land of caprice it was so often in the past.""Citi and StanChart will this month be given a formal mandate to advise the Southeast Asian nation on the steps necessary to earn the credit rating, one of the sources said, declining to be identified because the matter was not yet public.An official from the Central Bank of Myanmar said he was aware of the credit rating mandate, but could not elaborate further. The process can take up to a year, the sources said, as the banks help a country with the technical steps necessary to meet the agencies' criteria for a given rating. Once the rating is assigned, the country can then use the benchmark to market bonds to international investors.Myanmar would, in common with other debut issuers, likely aim for a 'benchmark'-sized bond of around $1 billion once it has a rating, one of the sources said. BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE One rating advisor with a rival bank said Myanmar was in a similar stage of development to Vietnam in the 1990s, when it first got a rating, although he added there was more investor interest in resource-rich Myanmar's business potential than was the case with Vietnam at the time.""I would place the country in the high single B, low BB category given its strengths compared with Vietnam,"" he said. ""But ratings agencies may take a conservative stance and put them in the B category.""Myanmar had few companies or banks that were likely to use the sovereign rating as a benchmark for debt issuance, but the rating would provide guidance for FDI investors assessing their risk exposure, he said.A rating of ""B"" would put the country at least four notches below ""investment grade"" - the level considered a safe, rather than speculative, investment - according to the scales used by S&P and Fitch. By comparison, both agencies now rank Vietnam three notches below investment grade, at ""BB-"".""We have no comment to make about Myanmar specifically. But in general, getting a sovereign rating can be a big step in opening up a country's economy and financial markets to global business and investment,"" said Sing Chan Ng, head of Asia-Pacific business origination at Fitch Ratings. SANCTIONS, MISMANAGEMENT Myanmar's financial sector is severely underdeveloped after decades of isolation from the global financial system due to international sanctions and economic mismanagement under the military junta that ruled for 49 years until 2011. The credit rating mandate comes at a time when the country is preparing for a historic election on Nov. 8, seen as a test of its transition toward democracy after the junta's reign ended.There is no interbank market in Myanmar and lending is heavily restricted.  Growth has been rapid since the semi-civilian government of President Thein Sein took power in 2011 and began a series of economic, social and political reforms. But getting a measure of the country's economic health is tough - there are few official data sets compiled and released by the government.Governance lags international standards and is another challenge for foreign investors. Myanmar faces an infrastructure investment gap of up to $4.7 billion per year, according to an August 2014 study by the Asia Development Bank. The country faces widening current account deficits that need to be funded by foreign capital, the study said.Myanmar in 2013 cleared its arrears to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank and secured a huge debt write-off by creditor countries grouped in the Paris Club, clearing the way for aid donors to step up work to support the government's reforms.Those debts had prevented international financial institutions from offering new loans.(This story has been refiled to remove an extraneous letters from headline tag) (Additional reporting by Umesh Desai in Hong Kong, Aung Hla Tun in Yangon and Simon Webb in Bangkok; Editing by Alex Richardson)",2015-07-17,C,"Fri Jul 17, 2015 | 12:33am EDT",Citi and StanChart set to advise Myanmar on first credit rating,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-myanmar-rating-idUSKCN0PR01U20150717?type=companyNews

739,"  Sept 11 A Chicago convention center authority will sell $222 million of bonds in the U.S. municipal market next week, just over a month after its ratings plummeted due to Illinois' budget impasse.The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority will raise $153 million to help fund a new hotel at Chicago's McCormick Place convention center and refund about $69.7 million of outstanding debt.The ongoing budget battle between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and the Democrats who control the legislature stymied the authority's legal ability to transfer tax revenue to the bond trustee for required monthly debt service deposits.Because of the technical default, the authority's AAA rating with Standard & Poor's and AA-minus rating with Fitch Ratings were cut on Aug. 5 to BBB-plus, affecting more than $3 billion of bonds sold for the expansion of McCormick Place.Legislation appropriating the tax revenue for all of fiscal 2016 was passed later in August, ending the default. although the lower ratings remained in place. In a research note on Friday, Barclays analysts said that due to the legislation, the authority's bonds ""could outperform comparable indices over the medium term.""The deal, slated for pricing on Wednesday through Citigroup Inc and Cabrera Capital Markets, is structured with $133.7 million of current interest bonds due in 2053 and $19.3 million of capital appreciation bonds due in 2052, according to the preliminary official statement. The $69.7 million of refunding term bonds carry maturities in 2035, 2040, 2045 and 2052.Altogether, U.S. muni issuers will sell $4.8 billion of bonds and notes in negotiated and competitive offerings next week. The second-largest deal is also from Illinois, with the state Finance Authority's $368 million of revenue bonds for the OFS Healthcare System through lead manager Barclays Capital .Some proceeds will fund hospital construction and expansion, advance refundings and termination of interest rate swaps.As of June 30, the notional outstanding amount of the system's swaps was $549.8 million, with a net market valuation of negative $52 million, bond documents said.About $50 million of the proceeds will also help finance the corporation's pension liability, which rose because of a lowered discount rate and the use of new mortality tables to reflect longer life expectancy.

756,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 8 Los Angeles has dropped a lawsuit accusing Citigroup of discriminatory mortgage lending, marking the second time a major bank has escaped claims that it steered the city's minorities into high-cost loans and led to foreclosures and neighborhood blight.In a court filing on Wednesday, Los Angeles and the bank agreed to dismiss the case but did not indicate the reasons. Los Angeles dropped a similar lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase  last month. It still has cases pending against Bank of America  and Wells Fargo in a federal appeals court.The lawsuit said Citi engaged in ""red lining,"" or restricting credit in minority neighborhoods, and ""reverse red lining,"" or targeting minorities for high-cost loans that ended in default.Citigroup spokesman Mark Rodgers said the bank was pleased to put the matter behind it. A spokesman for Los Angeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cities and counties have filed over a dozen discrimination lawsuits against banks since 2012 trying to recover damages caused by the 2007 foreclosure crisis. The lawsuits, which allege violations of the U.S. Fair Housing Act, seek reimbursement for lost tax revenues and increased spending in neighborhoods with abandoned homes.The suits have had mixed success, although Miami scored a victory last month when a federal appeals court affirmed its right to sue Citi, Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America under the housing act.

763,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 15 (Fitch) Citigroup (Citi) reported a 0.91% return on assets  (ROA) in the third quarter of 2015 (3Q15). While this still falls within the  company's target of 90 basis points (bps) to 110 basis points, it represents a  stepdown from the prior quarter's ROA of 1.01%. Similar to the past few years,  the second half of the year has started off a bit weaker than the first half.  However, Fitch still expects that Citi will meet its full-year targets,  especially given the pending sale of OneMain Financial, with an associated  estimated $1 billion pre-tax gain. The company expects the transaction will  close next quarter.  Reported revenues declined across the board reflecting a challenging operating  environment that included slowing worldwide growth, the disruption of the  Chinese markets, and continued uncertainty regarding interest rates. The  strengthening U.S. dollar also had a relatively larger impact on earnings than  prior quarters.  Bright spots during the quarter included continued increases in capital ratios,  further stability in the margin, and still benign credit losses. The quarter's  results also benefitted from another profitable quarter in Citi Holdings, albeit  at lower levels than the prior quarter and a year ago. CVA/DVA gains were $196 million pre-tax in 3Q15, as compared to $312 million in  pre-tax gains last quarter. Excluding these gains, third quarter revenues  declined 3.5% on a sequential basis. As previously mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S.  dollars can impact financial reporting, and had a larger relative impact this  quarter than prior quarters. For example, revenues in 3Q15 declined 3.5% on a  sequential basis. However, excluding the impact of foreign exchange  translations, revenues actually declined 1.6% from the prior quarter for  Citigroup. Reported expenses also declined 2.4%, though fell just 0.5% on a  constant dollar linked-quarter basis.  Citi hedges its CET1 exposure to fluctuations in currencies; however, foreign  exchange translations still impacted the CET1 ratio by 9bps as compared to a  year ago. Reported revenues in were 2% lower in International Consumer Banking, while  North America Consumer banking revenues were flat. Third-quarter results  included $180 million in gains related to the sale of Citi's merchant acquiring  business in Mexico. Excluding this item, revenues in International Consumer  Banking declined 7% primarily reflecting regulatory impacts in Asia. Expenses  declined in the consumer segment on a linked-quarter basis, despite ongoing  higher regulatory and compliance costs, and continual technology investments.  This quarter's results benefitted from much lower legal and repositioning  charges.  In terms of the Institutional segment, fixed income markets revenues declined  16% sequentially and 16% from a year ago, while investment banking was also  notably lower from both last quarter and a year ago. The underwriting  environment for both equity and fixed issuance was particularly challenging in  September, and combined with the general market tone, contributed to the  quarter's lower results.  Citi reversed some valuation adjustments taken last quarter related to prime  brokerage financing transactions. Excluding this reversal this quarter and the  charge last quarter, Equity Markets revenues increased roughly 3% on a  linked-quarter basis, and 12% from a year ago.  Further, Citi disclosed that the impact of foreign exchange volatility also  masked otherwise solid performance in Treasury & Trade Solutions and Securities  Services.  In terms of credit quality, Citi reported a substantial 35% increase in  corporate non-accrual loans, primarily reflecting downgrades in the North  America energy portfolio. Citi's energy-funded exposure totaled approximately  $21 billion or roughly 3% of total loans at quarter-end, with two-thirds of that  exposure rated investment grade. As a result of the energy deterioration, Citi  increased loan loss reserves in ICG, as compared to releases in prior quarters.  However, net charge-offs remain low at just $34 million during the quarter for  the ICG segment. Conversely, asset quality in GCB demonstrated improvement, with nonaccrual  balances 8% lower and NCOs of 2.01% during 3Q15, as compared to 2.24% last  quarter. All three regions reported lower linked-quarter loan losses, with  relatively stable late-stage delinquency trends across the board. Given Citi's  higher loss content credit card book and emerging markets exposure, loan losses  tend to be higher than peer averages. Citi disclosed it built its loan loss  reserves in Brazil, though does not expect loan losses to have a material impact  to total NCOs going forward.  Citi continues to wind down its Citi Holding assets, and ended the quarter with  $110 billion in total assets or roughly 6% of consolidated assets. Citi has over  $31 billion of that total under contract for sale expected to close sometime in  the 4Q15, including OneMain and Citi's retail banking businesses in Japan. Citi  expects to sell another $6 billion in assets next year.  Citi's capital ratios continue to remain very good and generally above global  peers. The company's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully  phased-in basis increased to 11.6% at quarter-end. The approximate 30bps  improvement from last quarter was due primarily to retained earnings,  utilization of the DTA, and continual shrinkage in risk-weighted assets. The  G-SIB surcharge for Citi is estimated at 3.5%, based on year-end 2014 data,  translating into a fully phased-in requirement of 10.5% (absent the capital  conservation buffer). Citi continues to operate well above that limit.  Citi also reported that it would already be in compliance with the supplementary  leverage ratio at the holding company with a 6.8% ratio, up 10bps from the prior  quarter-end. Citi indicated that the relative strength of its SLR has allowed  the company to pursue growth in prime brokerage, which is seen as an avenue into  greater penetration into key client segments.

773,"   By Helene Durand and Chris Spink  LONDON, Nov 12 (IFR) - Citigroup has created a European cross border team to cover debt capital markets with the aim of ""bringing international issuers outside EMEA into European debt capital markets"" as it seeks to capitalise on a growing business pie.The group will be led by Alex Hayes-Griffin, who has just returned to London after five years heading the bank's Australia and New Zealand DCM team.""While issuance volumes in Europe for European borrowers have declined moderately, they have grown for our US and global clients,"" said William Weaver, head of EMEA DCM and syndicate. ""This is a big opportunity and one that we think will remain. As this market grows, it makes sense to invest in it more."" US names accounted for 35% of euro corporate volumes this year, a dramatic increase on the previous year. In 2010, they made up just 10% of volumes. The attractive cost of funding has been one of the lures for issuers and is likely to remain the case as the US and Europe rate cycles bifurcate. Furthermore, a lot of US companies are global and so are not only looking for funding arbitrage opportunities.""They have businesses and assets in Europe that they need to fund. They can also issue long dated debt and match that with their liabilities,"" said Weaver. Weaver said Citigroup also wanted to leverage its global client base outside the US.Hayes-Griffin will be supported by Bruno Saenz de Miera from the EMEA corporate DCM team and Xixi Sun from CEEMEA DCM. He will report to Weaver and Peter Aherne, head of North America DCM, syndicate and new products.

784,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The credit card industry won a big legal victory on Thursday as a federal appeals court rejected claims by a group of consumers that big issuers colluded to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than through class action lawsuits.By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court ruling that American Express Co , Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  did not violate the Sherman antitrust law in forcing cardholders to submit to arbitration.Consumers argued that card-issuing banks and their lawyers broke the law when they held 28 meetings from May 1999 to October 2003 to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements.In April 2014, U.S. District Judge William Pauley ruled after a five-week bench trial that consumers failed by only a ""slender reed"" to show collusion, despite ""conscious parallel action"" among banks to require arbitration clauses.The appeals court said Pauley's findings did not constitute ""clear error,"" and upheld them. ""The district court found that the 'final decision to adopt class-action-barring clauses was something the issuing banks hashed out individually and internally,'"" the appeals court wrote. ""That conclusion is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, and we cannot say that the district court was 'clearly erroneous' in reaching this conclusion.""Merrill Davidoff, a lawyer for the cardholders, said his clients disagree with the decision, and have not decided whether to appeal. Citigroup and American Express had no immediate comment. Discover did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Arbitration clauses have in recent years become more prevalent in consumer contracts, including for such things as cellphone, cable TV and Internet service.Companies often prefer them to class-action litigation, which lets consumers pool resources and potentially obtain greater recoveries. In contrast, many consumers may choose not to arbitrate because the chance of success is low, and the cost of pursuing individual claims can be prohibitive.Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years.In April 2010, Bank of America Corp, Capital One Financial Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co settled with the cardholders by agreeing to remove their arbitration clauses for 3-1/2 years.The case is Ross et al v.

786,"  * Disagreement over capital hike could end venture* Citigroup struggles with scale issues in Brazil* Rivals uninterested in Citigroup's venture stake   (Adds market share details, share performance)By Tatiana Bautzer and Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO, Nov 23 Citigroup Inc has put its stake in a Brazilian credit card processing joint venture with Elavon Inc up for sale, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan said, after a disagreement over additional funds for the loss-making unit.Relations between Elavon and Citigroup, partners for five years, have soured after Brazil's central bank said the joint venture needed more cash and the U.S. bank declined to come up with any additional funds, said the sources, who declined to be named because the talks were confidential.The joint venture, known as Elavon do Brasil, has failed to gain traction in a burgeoning payment processing market dominated by Cielo SA and Rede, a unit of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA. While Cielo, Rede and peer GetNet Serviços own a combined 98 percent of the market, Elavon has managed to capture a share of only 1 percent.One source said the Citi-Elavon venture needs about 200 million reais ($52 million) in new capital. But with Brazil mired in recession, Citigroup does not want to deploy more money in the country and is unwilling to reallocate capital from its other operations there, the source said.Over the past three years, Citigroup has tempered its ambitions in Brazil. Helio Magalhães, who became Citigroup's Brazil chief executive officer in 2012, reversed his predecessor's strategy of seeking to take market share from larger rivals, in order to focus on wealthy customers and corporate banking. The value of Citigroup's 49.9 percent stake has yet to be determined, one source said. The joint venture had negative equity of 195 million reais as of June, according to Citigroup's Brazil financial statements, meaning the bank could lose money if it tried to sell the stake.In a statement to Reuters, Citigroup said the joint venture remained ""an investment aligned with our strategy of offering a complete product platform to our corporate clients.""An Atlanta, Georgia-based spokeswoman for Elavon declined to comment. Elavon hired Greenhill & Co Inc as an adviser, the sources added. Citigroup's investment bank is also working on it.Citigroup's stake has been offered to Itaú, Banco Bradesco , state-controlled lenders Caixa Econômica  and Banco do Brasil SA as well as Banco Santander Brasil SA, one source said. Elavon already has a partnership with Caixa, with the latter distributing Elavon's card machines nationwide.The banks declined to comment. Citigroup shares were down 0.2 percent at $54.65 in New York on Monday morning. 'DIFFICULT TO COMPETE' Citigroup's lack of scale in Brazil is not new. Local lenders have gobbled up market share over the past three years and now control 90 percent of assets. Among the top six lenders, Banco Santander Brasil is the only foreign-owned one among them.Last year, Citigroup's Brazilian assets grew by 8.7 percent, compared with 14 percent growth for Banco Bradesco SA  and 24 percent for Caixa Econômica Federal, according to central bank data. Despite a push for high-end customers, including opening two flagship branches in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Citigroup's Brazilian retail banking unit has been losing money in recent years, according to two other sources, who are former executives who spoke on condition of anonymity.Citigroup declined to comment on the performance of the retail bank.Magalhães, Citigroup's Brazil CEO, has said the exit of HSBC Holdings Plc earlier this year from Brazil could help the bank win more wealthy clients but competition is escalating. Bradesco paid $5.2 billion for the HSBC unit this year, targeting that segment.""It's becoming difficult for global banks to compete with local banks in the retail banking segment because their franchise costs, such as global software and processing costs, have to be assumed by their subsidiaries, as well as the lag they have in terms of scale,"" said Alvaro Tayar, lead partner at PwC for financial services.Income from corporate and transaction banking have helped offset losses in the retail bank, mainly since Citigroup is Brazil's No. 1 custodian of foreign investments. Its large currency trading platform, coupled with increased transaction banking activity, propped up profit in Brazil during the first half, according to its financial statements.Efforts to grow in investment banking, however, have yielded mixed results.Citigroup poached dealmakers Andre Kok and David Panico from Itaú BBA and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, respectively, but the two men departed within two years as the bank lost ground on advisory rankings.In the first nine months of this year, Citigroup ranked sixth and 14th in inputted fees from M&A advisory and debt underwriting. In 2011, it ranked fourth and seventh, respectively.

790,"  WASHINGTON Nov 30 The Federal Reserve Board will consider on Monday a proposal to curb its emergency lending powers, a change demanded by Congress after the central bank's controversial decision to aid AIG, Citigroup and others in 2008.A proposed rule, to be considered by the Fed's Washington-based board in an open meeting, would require that any future emergency lending be only ""broad-based"" to address larger financial market problems, and not tailored to specific firms.The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law instructed the Fed to curtail emergency loans to individual banks and prohibited it from lending to companies considered insolvent.While some at the Fed worry the new rules will hamper the central bank's response in future crises, some politicians have said the proposed regulations are too imprecise, for example in defining insolvency, to prevent the types of deals done in 2008. As the financial crisis intensified in 2008, the Fed invoked its little-used emergency lending power to stave off the failure of AIG and Bear Stearns, and help other ""too big to fail"" companies including Citigroup and Bank of America.The Fed also enacted a series of more general emergency programs, in all providing $710 billion in loans and guarantees. Those programs were separate from the much larger Fed asset and bond purchases known as quantitative easing. The loans have been repaid and the guarantees ended, ultimately earning the Fed a net profit of $30 billion, according to a September Congressional Research Service review. However the effort was criticized as overreach, arguably important in limiting the crisis but also not clearly in line with the intended use of the Fed's emergency authority. The Fed routinely lends money to banks on a short-term basis to smooth the operations of the financial system. That is part of why it exists.But since the 1930s it has had the power to lend more broadly in a crisis.The Fed's support of major banks and nonfinancial firms highlighted the risks of having companies that are considered too big to fail, and of the implicit promise that they would be rescued. The Dodd-Frank reforms reined in those powers, and the rules to be considered on Monday put those Dodd-Frank provisions into effect.

Dell is also working with Citigroup Inc (C.N) on the sale of IT services company Perot Systems, which could be valued at between $5 billion and $6 billion, the people said. Dell is marketing Perot Systems to large companies in the business services industry in the United States and abroad, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Representatives from Vista Equity, Thoma Bravo and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dell, Citi and KKR declined to comment.  The asset sales would help reduce the $49.5 billion of debt Dell will assume once the merger with EMC is completed. It has said it will focus on reducing its debt during the first 18 to 24 months after the merger with EMC to achieve an investment-grade credit rating.Thoma Bravo took SonicWall private in a roughly $717 million deal in 2010 and sold it to Dell two years later.  Reuters reported last week that EMC, in a bid to boost shareholder support for its sale to Dell, will retain a majority stake in cloud services provider Virtustream and abandon a plan to place the money-losing company in a joint venture with VMware Inc (VMW.N).The change is aimed at lifting VMware's shares, whose decline in value puts the acquisition at risk because Dell was set to pay EMC shareholders $24.05 per share in cash and a special stock that tracks the common shares of VMware. VMware is a virtualization software maker majority-owned by EMC, and is seen as one of the company's most important assets.  (Reporting by Liana B.

799,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citigroup Inc.'s (Citi)  Viability Rating (VR) and Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'a/A',  respectively. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed Citibank, N.A.'s VR and IDR  at 'a/A+', respectively. The Outlooks for the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. A full  list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action commentary. Citi's Long-Term IDR is driven by its Viability Rating (VR), which has been  affirmed at 'a'. Citi's operating subsidiaries' IDRs are affirmed one notch  above their VRs reflecting the expected implementation of total loss absorbing  capacity (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks  (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the holding company. The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with Fitch's periodic review  of the Global Trading and Universal Banks (GTUB), which comprises 12 large and  globally active banking groups. Fitch's outlook for the GTUBs is stable as we  expect the stable outlook for the groups' commercial banking and wealth and  asset management businesses in 2016 to mitigate pressure on earnings from  capital markets activities, particularly in fixed income trading.  As globally active universal banks, the 12 GTUBs are among the most affected by  evolving regulation, which is bringing capital and resource constraints to some  businesses. This means that business models are being adjusted. Specific changes  and their timing vary by bank. In the medium term, we believe that the GTUBs  with the strongest franchises in their core businesses, sound business models  and clear strategies are best placed in this environment, and these company  profiles are an important rating factor for many of the GTUBs. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of Citigroup's VR reflects Citi's solid capital and liquidity  levels. Fitch also notes that Citi's earnings reflect an improving overall  trend. Citi's complexity of operations, and asset quality somewhat offset these  ratings strengths. Citi's capital ratios continue to remain very good and generally above global  peers. The company's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully  phased-in basis increased to 11.7% at Sept. 30, 2015. The approximate 100 bps  improvement from a year ago was due primarily to retained earnings, utilization  of the DTA, partially offset by share repurchases and to a lesser extent, the  impact of movement in foreign currencies.  Citi's liquidity profile is a secondary key rating driver, underpinning its VR.  Citi has considerably bolstered its amount of liquid assets and reduced its  reliance on short-term borrowings over the last several years. The company's  liquidity profile remains strong, providing support to Citi's ratings. At Sept.  30, 2015, Citi reported $399 billion in cash and unencumbered liquid securities,  or 22% of total assets. Citi is already in compliance with the final U.S. LCR rules, as well as the  Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio at both the holding company and bank  levels. Its estimated LCR was 112% (under U.S. rules), while the SLR was 6.85%  at September 30, 2015. Citi's earnings performance through the first nine months of 2015 reflects a  strong improvement from the same period a year ago. Citi is tracking within its  2015 financial targets, with an ROA of 99bps (excluding CVA/DVA), which is  within its target of between 90bps and 110bps. Earnings have improved from a  year ago mainly attributed to much lower legal and repositioning costs,  controlled noninterest expenses, still benign credit costs, a stable margin, and  a profitable Citi Holdings segment.  Fitch expects that Citi will meet its full-year financial targets, especially  given the pending sale of OneMain Financial, with an associated estimated  $billion pre-tax gain. The company expects the transaction will close in 4Q15.  Consolidated credit risk ratios for Citi remain higher than some peers despite  an improving overall trend over the past several years. Fitch attributes some of  Citi's weaker relative asset quality profile to its high balance of troubled  debt restructurings (TDRs), as well as its exposure to higher loss content  credit card loans and Mexico. Citi, along with many of its peers, remains  exposed to falling oil prices, though loan losses to date have been modest for  Citi.  Citi's energy-related exposure is slightly higher than its large bank peers,  with direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments totaling $60.5 billion  at Sept. 30, 2015. Funded loans comprise 3.4% of loans, with 79% rated  investment grade, down slightly from last quarter due to downgrades.  All three consumer geographic regions reported lower linked-quarter loan losses  in 3Q15, with relatively stable late stage delinquency trends across the board.  Given Citi's higher loss content credit card book and emerging markets exposure,  loan losses tend to be higher than peer averages. Citi disclosed it built its  loan loss reserves in Brazil, though does not expect loan losses to have a  material impact to total net charge-offs (NCOs) going forward. Fitch expects  that loan losses may increase for the industry given the very benign credit  environment, and unsustainably low levels of credit losses. Citigroup is one of the largest banking institutions in the world, with by far  the biggest international banking franchise among U.S. peers. With a vast  international franchise, Citi's revenue diversity in terms of geography is  greater than its peers, with sizable business operations in many faster growing  emerging markets, including China, India, and Mexico. However, this increased  revenue diversity also present potential issues with regard to exposure to any  political unrest in foreign countries, as well as direct exposure to economic  deterioration or slowed growth in any of these markets. This geographic reach  also necessitates the need for a sophisticated risk management infrastructure to  manage risk around the globe.  While there is no outsized reliance on a single market outside of the U.S.  (Mexico being the largest at around 10% of revenues), if there are issues  related to economic slowdowns or political unrest in a particular emerging  market, it is possible there may be effects for Citi. The secondary effects of a  slowdown in a particular country, for example, China, and those cascading  impacts to the global economy are much harder to quantify and assess for any  implications to Citi or its peers. However, relative to other large U.S. banks,  Citi is more exposed to slowdown in the emerging markets.  The complexity of global operations and a reliance on more volatile capital  markets revenues, which on average account for around 25% revenues, serve as  constraints to upwards movement in ratings.  The VRs remain equalized between Citi and its material operating subsidiaries,  including Citibank, N.A. The common VR of Citi and its operating companies  reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate between the Citi and these  subsidiaries. Fitch takes a group view on the credit profile from a failure  perspective, while the IDR reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk  on senior debt. Fitch believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly  equivalent, while the default risk given at the operating company would be lower  given total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). All U.S. bank subsidiaries carry a  common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are cross-guaranteed under the  Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  Citi's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of TLAC requirements for U.S.  G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default  risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities relative to holding  company senior debt. In our view these buffers would provide substantial  protection to senior unsecured obligations in the domestic operating entities in  the event of group resolution, as they could be used to absorb losses and  recapitalize operating companies. Therefore, substantial holding company debt  reduces the likelihood of default on operating company senior obligations.  KEY RATING DRIVERS- SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The support rating (SR) and support rating floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's view that  senior creditors can no longer rely on receiving full extraordinary support from  the sovereign in the event that Citi becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view,  implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation is  now sufficiently progressed to provide a framework for resolving banks that is  likely to require holding company senior creditors participating in losses, if  necessary, instead of or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Citi and its subsidiaries  are all notched down from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of  each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profiles, which vary considerably.  Subordinated debt issued by the operating companies is rated at the same level  as subordinated debt issued by Citi reflecting the potential for subordinated  creditors in the operating companies to be exposed to loss ahead of senior  creditors in Citi. Subordinated lower Tier 2 debt is rated one notch below the  VR for loss severity, reflecting below average recoveries.  Legacy Tier 1 securities are generally rated four notches below the VR, made up  of two notches for high loss severity relative to average recoveries, and two  further notches for non-performance risk, reflecting the fact that coupon  omission is not fully discretionary.  High and low trigger contingent capital Tier 1 instruments are rated five  notches below the VR. The issues are notched down twice for loss severity,  reflecting poor recoveries as the instruments can be converted to equity or  written down well ahead of resolution. In addition, they are also notched down  three times for very high non-performance risk, reflecting fully discretionary  coupon omission.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - DEPOSIT RATINGS Deposit ratings are one notch higher than senior debt reflecting the deposits'  superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor preference in the  U.S.  Citi's international subsidiary, Citibank Canada's deposit ratings are at the  same level as senior debt ratings because their preferential status is less  clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it difficult to  determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARIES Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited,  Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Services LCC, Citibank  Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, CitiFinancial Europe plc, and Citibank International  Limited (formerly known as Citibank International PLC), are wholly owned  subsidiaries of Citi or Citibank, N.A.  Their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with Citi or Citibank, N.A. reflecting  Fitch's view that these entities are integral to Citi's business strategy and  operations. Their IDRs and ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that  might drive a change in Citi's IDR. The Rating Outlook for Citi's material international operating companies' IDRs  is Positive, including Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Citibank Canada,  Citibank Japan Ltd, and Citibank International Limited.  Fitch's Positive Rating Outlook for Citi's material international operating  reflects the likelihood of internal TLAC as required by the Financial Stability  Board (FSB). The Positive Outlook reflects the agency's belief that the internal  TLAC of material international operating companies will likely be large enough  to meet and exceed Pillar 1 capital requirements and will then be sufficient to  recapitalize them. A one notch upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient  clarity on additional disclosure on the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its  sufficiency in size to cover a default of senior operating company liabilities.  Sufficient clarity may, however, take longer to come through than the typical  Outlook horizon of one to two years. Domestic subsidiaries and international subsidiaries that have not been upgraded  or placed on Rating Outlook Positive are in Fitch's opinion not sufficiently  material to benefit from domestic support from Citi or are international  subsidiaries that would not benefit from internal TLAC. This includes Citigroup  Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Securities LLC, and  CitiFinancial Europe PLC.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch sees limited near-term upward VR momentum given a relatively high and  absolute rating. The company's complex organizational structure and reliance on  more volatile capital markets revenues act as key constraints to further upward  movement to ratings. Citigroup's IDRs and senior debt are sensitive to any  changes in the VR, while Citibank's IDR and senior debt are sensitive to changes  in our view of the buffer created by the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the implementation of TLAC requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, and  the presence of substantial holding company debt, which serve to reduce the  default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities relative to  holding company senior debt.  Downward pressure on the VR could result from a material deterioration in  capital or liquidity levels. It is the strength of the liquidity and capital  profiles that underpin Citi's ratings. Fitch's ratings action incorporates an  expectation that Citi will manage its capital and liquidity profiles relatively  conservatively, and although capital distributions will likely increase over  time, they will still be governed by regulatory stress testing and as such,  remain reasonable. In addition, a CCAR objection due to qualitative reasons may  result in a downgrade of the VR as it represents a material shortcoming in the  company's risk management infrastructure.  While there is no outsized reliance on a single market outside of the U.S.  (Mexico being the largest at roughly 10% of Citicorp revenues), if there are  issues related to economic slowdowns or political unrest in a particular  emerging market, it is possible there may be effects for Citi. The secondary  effects of a slowdown in a particular country, and those cascading impacts to  the global economy are much harder to quantify and assess for any implications  to Citi or its peers.  Any unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other legal-related charges could  have adverse rating implications for Citi. Fitch notes there is very little  visibility into ultimate legal-related risk for Citi or the industry, though  Fitch expects litigation costs will remain manageable relative to capital for  Citi. A fine that was to deplete capital in a material way may lead to negative  rating action.  Citi's ratings could be vulnerable to a large operational loss or if an  operational event calls into question Fitch's assessment of Citi's risk  management function and its ability to accurately identify, monitor, and  mitigate risks throughout the organization.  SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that Citi  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES These ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VR. The securities'  ratings are also sensitive to a change in their notching, which could arise if  Fitch changes its assessment of the probability of their non-performance  relative to the risk captured in the issuers' VRs. This may reflect a change in  capital management in the group or an unexpected shift in regulatory buffer  requirements, for example. SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS Deposit ratings are sensitive to changes in senior debt ratings. SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARIES  The IDRs of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Global Markets  Limited, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Services LCC,  Citibank Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, CitiFinancial Europe plc, and Citibank  International Limited (formerly known as Citibank International PLC) are  sensitive to the same factors that might drive a change in Citi's IDR. Specific factors that Fitch seeks additional clarity on before resolving the  rating outlook and potentially upgrading the subsidiary ratings of Citigroup  Global Markets Limited, Citibank Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, and Citibank  International Limited will include host country clarification on internal TLAC,  the quantum of internal TLAC and whether it will be pre-positioned. The quantum  is relevant because per Fitch's criteria the agency will look to the sufficiency  of the amount of capital available to that subsidiary to recapitalize it. If the  amount of TLAC is sufficient for recapitalization in Fitch's opinion and is  pre-positioned, Fitch will likely upgrade the subsidiary ratings; further, if  home and host country regulators reach agreements where pre-positioning is not  required, the rating will not be upgraded and the Outlook revised to stable.  If clarity on host country internal TLAC proposals are further delayed beyond  the next six months, Fitch will likely revise the subsidiary Outlooks to Stable  until such clarity on these proposals is articulated. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Securities LLC,  and CitiFinancial Europe PLC are sensitive to changes in Citi's IDRs.

803,"   By Hillary Flynn  NEW YORK, Dec 22 (IFR) - Citigroup has reiterated its underweight recommendation on Chesapeake Energy, even after the oil and gas company pushed out some debt maturity through its current debt exchange offer.The US bank said that the exchange would provide little short-term relief to the beleaguered oil name, which potentially still faces US$3bn-plus in debt maturities through 2018.""We view the business as unsustainable in today's low commodity price environment,"" Citigroup  said.Chesapeake is offering unsecured note holders the chance to swap into a new US$3bn 8% second-lien note due in 2022, with a final deadline of December 31 on the tender. The company said on Monday that creditors had tendered about US$3.8bn of some US$9.31bn in outstanding principal amount by the early bird date of December 18.While that is the equivalent of around US$2.35bn in new 2022s, the vast majority of tenders came from holders of longer dated paper, the bank said. ""CHK still has a fairly sizable maturity wall over the next 2-3 years,"" it said.Chesapeake said on Monday that it had so far received tenders on US$769m in unsecured debt due through 2019. The exchange has nudged the company's interest payment down to around US$537m from US$562m. But the oil giant still has US$2.4bn of debt due in 2017 and US$3.3bn through 2018 if puts on convertible bonds are exercised, Citi said. Management is negotiating separately with holders of these instruments.Chesapeake has $1.2bn of 2.5% convertible notes that have a May 2017 put, and $347m of 2.25% convertible notes with a December 2018 put.Chesapeake's bonds had a mixed performance after the early results of the tender were announced.Its 7.25% Dec 2018s were trading at 37 on Monday, up from 34 on Friday, but its 6.875% Nov 2020s softened to about 24.4 from 26.8.

807,"  (Recasts with more details on settlement, background on claims)Jan 14 Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it would pay over $5 billion to settle claims it misled mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis, a move that will cut the firm's fourth quarter earnings by about $1.5 billion.Goldman Sachs said the settlement comprises a $2.385 billion civil penalty, a $875 million cash payment and $1.8 billion in relief for homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their property as well as distressed borrowers.The agreement resolves actual and potential claims from the U.S. Department of Justice, the New York and Illinois Attorneys General, the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Seattle. The hit to earnings comes after Goldman Sachs took a $1.45 billion provision in the second quarter in anticipation of a deal.The settlement underscores how Wall Street has yet to shake off the legacy of the U.S. subprime crisis, when mortgages were sold to people who could not afford them and then repackaged for investors without an adequate explanation of how risky they were. The agreement has been made in principle and has to be finalised with the regulators and other bodies involved. It was not clear how the civil penalty and cash payment would be divided among the different parties to the deal. (bit.ly/1SkSkoH)The agreement relates to mortgage bonds sold between 2005 and 2007. The U.S. Department of Justice and state officials have already extracted multi-billion dollar settlements from a number of large U.S. banks including JP Morgan, Bank of America  and Citigroup over the sale of mortgage-backed securities.The Goldman settlement is at the lower end of previous penalties. Bank of America reached a $16.65 billion settlement in 2014 while JP Morgan settled for $13 billion in 2013.Goldman Sachs will report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.

811,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings views Citigroup's (Citi) earnings  performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 (4Q'15) as disappointing, but the  full-year's results were in line with the agency's expectations. Citi reported a  0.77% return on assets (ROA) in the fourth quarter of 2015 (4Q'15) and 0.94% for  the full-year. Results for the full-year were within the company's target of  90bps to 110bps.  Performance in 4Q'15 fell considerably on a linked-quarter basis, declining  14bps primarily due to higher energy-related credit costs, challenging fixed  income markets, and higher linked-quarter repositioning costs. The quarter's  results also reflected the gain on the sale of OneMain Financial, as well as  sales of Japan's retail and card businesses, which were offset by a significant  amount of non-TLAC eligible debt buybacks.  Bottom line results in 2015 benefitted from much lower legal and repositioning  charges, which fell $4.8 billion for the year. Citi expects its ROA will remain  above 90bps in 2016.  CVA/DVA losses were $181 million pre-tax losses in 4Q'15, as compared to $196  million in pre-tax gains last quarter. Excluding these CVA/DVA, fourth quarter  revenues, increased 1% on a sequential basis, in constant dollars excluding the  impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars.  The impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars can impact  financial reporting and had a large impact again this quarter relative to a year  ago. Citi hedges its CET1 exposure to fluctuations in currencies; however,  foreign exchange translations still impacted the CET1 ratio by 8bps as compared  to a year ago. Results in International Consumer Banking were lower for the quarter and for the  year due to spread compression in cards, lower investment sales revenues, as  well as the ongoing challenge of regulatory changes in Asia and Mexico. In  addition to revenue challenges, Citi reported expense growth resulting in  negative operating leverage during the quarter from a year ago and last quarter.  North American Consumer Banking revenues were flat on a linked-quarter basis,  and fell 6% from a year ago reflecting a gain on a sale year ago, as well as  contra-revenues items related to new customer account acquisitions and card  rewards. Quarterly expenses ticked up 4% on a sequential basis, but declined 6%  from a year ago given lower repositioning expenses and efficiency initiatives.  Even with branch closures in selected markets across the U.S., Citi is retaining  50% of deposits, and is also supportive of an even greater push into digital and  mobile banking.  In terms of the Institutional segment, fixed income revenues declined 14%  sequentially but were up 7% from a year ago, which was a weak quarter.  Investment Banking was higher on both a linked-quarter and year ago basis, while  equity markets fell 39% sequentially given some reversals of valuation  adjustments related to prime brokerage financing transactions. Results were  stronger from a year ago given weak equity markets performance in 4Q'14.  Further, Citi disclosed that the impact of foreign exchange volatility also  masked otherwise solid performance in Treasury & Trade Solutions and Securities  Services as compared to a year ago.  In terms of credit quality, Citi reported flat corporate non-accrual balances,  following a substantial increase in non-accrual loans last quarter given  downgrades in its North America energy portfolio. Citi built loan loss reserves  on institutional side primarily reflecting deterioration in its energy  portfolio, with $75 million of NCOs in 4Q'15. The other half of the reserve  build was for macro concerns. Citi did not disclose its reserves to energy  loans.  Citi's energy funded exposure was $20.5 billion, representing around 3% of total  loans, with 68% investment grade. Citi expects that credit costs in ICG will be  around $600 million in the first half of 2016, based on a scenario in which oil  prices remain around $30 a barrel for a sustained period of time. If oil were to  drop to $25 a barrel for an extended period of time, then the cost of credit  would double in Citi's estimation.  Consumer nonaccrual balanced declined 24% on a linked-quarter basis.  Consolidated NCOs were ticked up 9bps to 2.10%. Loan losses in all three  geographic segments: North America, Latin America, and Asia (which now includes  EMEA's results) all reported increases, with the most notable deterioration in  Latin America.  Fitch expects that the level of consumer loan loss reserves has stabilized, and  earnings are likely not going to benefit from reserve releases going forward to  the same extent as they have in the recent past.  Following the sale of OneMain and the retail banking businesses in Japan, Citi  Holdings assets now comprise 4% of total assets at year-end 2015, and 11% of  risk-weighted assets. Citi expects Citi Holdings to break-even or remain  marginally profitable in 2016. This is aided by the 4Q'15 higher cost debt  repurchases.  Citi's capital ratios continue to remain very good and generally above global  peers. The company's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully  phased-in basis increased again to an estimated 12%. The approximate 30 bps  improvement from last quarter was due primarily to retained earnings, lower  risk-weighted assets, offset by share repurchases, a slight build in the DTA,  and unrealized losses. With respect to Citi's estimated 3.5% G-SIB capital  surcharge, Citi continues to work on making its balance sheet more efficient,  with an internal buffer above that of between 50bps and 100bps.  Citi also reported that it would already be in compliance with the supplementary  leverage ratio at the holding company with a 7.1% ratio, up 20bps from the prior  quarter-end. Citi had less than $100 billion of non-operating deposits at the  beginning of the year, and reduced this balance by $50 billion during the year.

819,"  NEW YORK Jan 21 Citigroup Inc could see $1 billion in expenses for loan losses in 2016 in its institutional business if the price of oil were $30 a barrel for a ""sustained period of time,"" Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on Thursday.The expense could be double that much if oil were $25 a barrel, Gerspach said during a conference call with bond investors.Last week Gerspach had estimated the possible costs only for the first half of 2016 when he spoke to stock analysts after Citigroup reported quarterly and full-year results. Gerspach's estimates show how Citigroup's results could be affected by lower oil prices for a second year. For all of 2015, credit costs in the company's Institutional Clients Group, which caters to corporations, governments and big investors, were $929 million, up from just $57 million in 2014.Much of the increase in credit expense was to cover additional reserves for possible loan losses. Citigroup earned $17.08 billion in 2015, the most since 2006. Reserves for losses on energy loans were 3.8 percent of the funded amounts of those loans at year-end, Citigroup Treasurer James von Moltke said on Thursday's call. Reserves were about 5 percent on riskier exploration and production loans, which account for 30 percent of funded energy loans, he said.Gerspach also said on Thursday that Citigroup estimates its regulatory capital surcharge for being a systemically important institution is down to 3 percent from 3.5 percent.

But curves are flattening - short-term yields are anchored by expectations policy rates are going nowhere fast and falling growth and inflation expectations are depressing longer-term yields.

830,"  Citigroup Inc (C.N) raised Chief Executive Michael Corbat's pay by an estimated 27 percent in 2015, a year in which the bank's profit more than doubled. Corbat earned an estimated $16.5 million in 2015, including deferred shares worth about $4.5 million. He earned $13 million in 2014.Deferred stock makes up about 30 percent of Corbat's bonus pay under Citi's executive compensation plan, which was overhauled three years ago amid shareholder pressure.Citi's net income more than doubled to $17.2 billion in 2015, its highest since 2006, as Corbat works through his plan to exit businesses where profits and prospects are not worthwhile. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach's total compensation for 2015 rose about 20 percent to $9 million, the disclosures indicate.James Forese, chief executive of Citi's Institutional Clients Group, was paid $16 million, up 18.5 percent from a year earlier.  Citigroup joined two of Wall Street's marquee investment banks in raising its chief executive's pay for the year Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) raised Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's pay by 23 percent in 2015. JPMorgan & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon earned $27 million in 2015, up 35   percent from a year earlier.

It is unclear if the company has retained an investment bank as financial advisor on the potential bid. Yahoo officially launched the sale of its core business on Friday.Time Inc could pursue a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Yahoo, a tax-free deal in which one company merges with a spun-off unit, Bloomberg reported earlier on Tuesday.

846,"  (Adds statement from economy minister and arbitrator)By Hugh Bronstein and Gabriel BurinBUENOS AIRES Feb 22 Argentina's Congress will likely repeal two laws blocking settlement of a court case that has hobbled Latin America's third-biggest economy by keeping it locked out of the global bond market, a key lawmaker and analysts said on Monday.A settlement would open financing options to Argentina's new president as he tries to straighten out the country's fiscal mess without imposing the kind of shock spending cuts that have gotten previous Argentine leaders thrown out of office.President Mauricio Macri was elected in November on an open-markets platform following eight years of protectionism under Cristina Fernandez, who refused to negotiate with hedge funds suing the country over its defaulted bonds.The judge hearing the case said on Friday he wants Congress to repeal laws that allow bond payments to be processed in Buenos Aires rather than New York and ban the government from offering better terms than those included in Argentina's 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings.""I think we are going to have the numbers we need (to repeal the laws),"" Nicolas Massot, the head of Macri's PRO party in the lower house, told local radio, echoing administration officials.FEB. 29 DEADLINE The country has been shunned by the international capital markets since it defaulted on about a billion dollars in  sovereign debt in 2002. About 93 percent of creditors accepted around 30 cents on the dollar in the two bond revamps. But a group of creditors went to court asking for full repayment, convincing the judge to prohibit Argentina from servicing its restructured bonds until they too were paid.U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan said on Friday it would serve the public interest to lift the  injunction of bond payments, provided Argentina repeals the  laws and pays creditors who agree by Feb. 29 to settle.The funds have been in negotiations with Macri's economic team in recent weeks in New York to resolve the years-long dispute. Friday's ruling robbed them of leverage in those talks.In a letter to a federal appeals court filed on Saturday, Elliott Management's NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management, both major holdout funds, called Griesa's ruling an ""abrupt judicial ultimatum.""""The message to non-settling plaintiffs, many of whom have had no opportunity to negotiate with anyone, is unmistakable: Settle by February 29, or else,"" their lawyers wrote. The New York arbiter on the case, Daniel Pollack, said on Monday that agreements in principle were reached between Argentina and five smaller creditors for about $250 million plus 185 million euros ($204.07 million), further pressuring the larger funds.Pollack said Monday's and any future deals would depend on Congress repealing the two laws and the judge lifting a stay on the ruling that has kept Argentina from honoring its restructured bonds.""Congress needs to argue this out,"" Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay told reporters on Monday.Meanwhile, he said: ""We are going to look for as many additional agreements as possible."" PERONIST POWER STRUGGLE Analysts agreed Macri can probably corral the votes needed to repeal both laws in the lower house by appealing to moderate members of the opposition Peronist party, leaderless since Fernandez turned the presidency over to Macri in December.Provincial governors are expected to lobby the Senate to repeal the two laws in order to improve the country's finances and free up money needed for roads and other local projects.""Factional struggles within Peronism and the provinces' critical financial situation should help Macri to get both laws repealed by Congress,"" said Ignacio Labaqui, who analyses Argentina for New York consultancy Medley Global Advisors.Congress is meanwhile set to reconvene March 1, with settlement of the bond case topping the president's legislative agenda.Jimena Blanco, an analyst with Verisk Maplecroft in the U.K., agreed that Macri should be able to cobble together the votes needed to clinch the repeals demanded by Griesa.""Settling with the holdouts is the only way the government can continue applying a gradual economic adjustment,"" Blanco added. ""Without external financing, the only option would be a shock treatment. Macri will try to avoid this by all means possible.""($1 = 0.9065 euros)   (Additional reporting by Nate Raymond and Daniel Bases in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2016-02-23,C,"Mon Feb 22, 2016 | 8:11pm EST",UPDATE 2-Argentine lawmakers seen favoring deal with holdout creditors,http://www.reuters.com//article/argentina-debt-idUSL2N1610U9?type=companyNews

865,"   By Steve Slater  LONDON, March 9 (IFR) - Citigroup has warned that revenues from trading and advisory are set to drop sharply in the first quarter from a year earlier, joining rivals in setting the scene for another grim quarter for the industry.Citigroup said its markets revenues are running 15% lower than the first quarter of 2015 and its advisory and investment banking revenues are off by 25%.""It has been a tough quarter,"" Citigroup chief financial officer John Gerspach said on Tuesday at an investor conference.January-March is typically the most important quarter for investment banks, often accounting for more than a third of annual income.As a result, the grim forecasts from Citigroup and some of its rivals have set off alarm bells that a weak second half of 2015 will continue and could prompt another bout of job losses as banks seek to cut costs. Gerspach said Citigroup expected to take a US$400m charge in the first quarter ""to resize both our infrastructure and capacity"" in response to the tough environment.Other banks have also warned of a slow start to the year. JP Morgan's investment banking fee revenues are down 25% in the quarter so far from a year earlier and its trading revenues are 20% lower, Daniel Pinto, head of its corporate and investment bank, said on February 23. He said some of the decline in trading was due to a strong year-earlier performance.Barclays said on March 1 that earnings at its investment bank in the first quarter are on track to drop from 2015. It said January and February were flat from a year earlier, but it does not expect to match the strong March it had last year. Gerspach provided the most detailed assessment to date on prospects, saying market volatility had hurt both trading and new issuance.""In fixed income, we see spread products continuing to have pressure,"" he said. ""In rates and currencies the bank was facing a tough comparison against a good year-ago quarter.""In equity markets, there it has been a tough market, obviously. There's been certainly a downturn as far as new issuance level and just overall lack of customer activity,"" he said. Gerspach said the fall in investment banking was largely due to a downturn in issuance in both debt and equity capital markets, while M&A activity had another tough comparison with the start of last year.""It's pretty much a global reduction as far as issuance at this point in time. There's been some pickup in the debt markets, maybe in the last week or so, but up until now it really has been pretty muted,"" Gerspach said.He said he was optimistic some of the first quarter decline could be recaptured during the rest of the year, citing a good pipeline for M&A deals.Kian Abouhossein, analyst at JP Morgan, last month estimated revenues across the industry could decline by 21% this year from 2015.Citing ""a challenging credit trading environment, low level of deal flow and lower equity markets,"" he predicted an 18% drop in fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues, a 16% fall in equities and a 29% slump in advisory and investment banking.

870,"   By David Henry  Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) will get to vote on whether their banks should consider breaking into smaller pieces.Citigroup included the question in a proxy statement it filed on Wednesday for its annual meeting next month, and the shareholder sponsoring that proposal said he has a similar one slated for the upcoming ballot for JPMorgan's annual meeting.The shareholder, Bart Naylor, said he hopes the proposals get more votes than the 4 percent he got for a measure last year that called for Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to break up.The Citigroup and JPMorgan proposals ""are more deferential to the boards in asking them to study the vicissitudes of a breakup,"" Naylor said in an interview. He hopes proxy advisory firms, which often sway one-third of votes with their recommendations to institutional investors, will back studies by directors even if they won't tell directors to break up the banks. ""These banks are too big to manage,"" Naylor said.Citigroup directors opposed Naylor's resolution in Wednesday's filing, noting that the company has undertaken a transformation on its own to become smaller and more efficient. Citigroup has shed more than $500 billion of assets since 2008.A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on Naylor's proposal. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said that JPMorgan is stronger because of its large and diverse businesses. Naylor said he failed to get a similar measure on the slate for the next Bank of America shareholders meeting because he made a mistake and did not properly certify that he owned shares.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Wednesday that Naylor's proposals would be on the ballots. The breakup of large banks into smaller ones has been an issue on the U.S. campaign trail. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has drawn the support of the Democratic Party's populist wing in his run for the party's presidential nomination, has said he would create a ""too-big-to-fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks, and insurance companies"" and break them up in the first year of his administration.

""We'll take a look at every unit they put up for sale"" excluding Brazil, Marino told reporters on the sidelines of an event in São Paulo.Itaú is aiming for its operations outside Brazil to account for almost 20 percent of its total revenue by the end of the decade, up from less than 15 percent now, as part of a strategy to diversify from the recession-stricken nation. Citigroup announced in February a plan to sell retail banking operations in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. Citigroup, which has been present in Brazil for over a century, is trimming banking operations globally that have underperformed because of mounting competition or onerous costs.A sale of Citigroup's Brazilian unit would come after HSBC Holdings Plc fetched $5.2 billion last year from a sale of its local operations to Itaú's arch-rival Banco Bradesco SA  . However, Marino said Itaú's main strategy in the region is to successfully complete the acquisition and integration of Chile's CorpBanca SA in Chile, Colombia and Perú. The deal received regulatory approval last week.Marino said that Itaú plans to set aside loan-loss provisions at CorpBanca for some loan transactions, including one with Canadian oil and gas company Pacific Exploration & Production Corp. Related charges from that specific transaction will be reflected in Itaú's second-quarter results.Itaú's non-voting shares rose 0.5 percent to 29.65 reais on Thursday.

The partnership between one of the biggest US banks and one of the most prolific originators of online personal loans soured just nine months after the first bond was sold, said the source.A Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment. But Prosper President Ron Suber told an industry conference on Monday that his company had been too quick to tie up with the securitization market. ""When we don't have alignment with our investors, when groups sell our loans into the market no matter what - if the market's not ready, it's not good,"" he said.""And we learned that at Prosper this year.""

895,"  TOKYO, April 14 (IFR) - David Haldane has been appointed global head of derivative trading at Citigroup following the resignation of James Boyle from his role as global head of equity derivatives, according to an internal bank memo. Haldane was previously Citi's head of EMEA equity derivatives. In his new role, he will work alongside Steve Roti, global head of structured equity solutions. Both report directly to global equity head Derek Bandeen, who will retire from his role once a replacement is found, according to a separate memo.  Haldane joined the bank in 2011 from JP Morgan, where he was head of US flow derivative trading. He joined Citi as head of equity trading for Australia and transferred to London in 2014. Boyle is due to join Deutsche Bank in July as head of equities for Asia Pacific, based in Hong Kong. He will also co-head Deutsche's global equity derivatives business and run global markets in the Hong Kong SAR. Citigroup recently hired Quentin Andre as head of global structured equity sales and Dirk Keijer as EMEA head of equity derivatives sales, both from Goldman Sachs, allowing Haldane to focus on trading. Sales and distribution functions continue to report to Murray Roos, global head of sales for the equity and prime services division. Boyle is the second equity derivatives head to leave the bank in the last two years. He was promoted to the global role in July 2014 following the departure of his predecessor, Simon Yates, who left to join buyside firm, Two Sigma Securities. Prior to taking the global role, Boyle headed Citi's Asian equity derivatives business. He joined the bank in 2012 from Citadel and previously led global equity derivatives trading at Merrill Lynch.

However, lower operating expenses helped the bank beat Wall Street's low expectations.Citi's share price was little changed by the close of trading, down 6 cents at $44.92. The shares are trading at a sharp discount to the value the bank places on its hard assets of $62.58 per share.Banks globally have had a tough start to the year amid near-zero interest rates and an economic slowdown in China. Their loans to energy companies have only made things worse, as a slump in oil prices has led to bankruptcies and financial stress for many oil and gas producers. The industry has been doing all it can to reduce costs in an effort to minimize the blow of lower revenue.Citigroup recorded $491 million in so-called ""repositioning"" charges as part of its cost-cutting effort. Those costs included severance payments for managers and trading staff, moving certain positions to lower-cost cities, and changing the way it uses real estate sometimes by exiting locations. Wall Street businesses are getting hit because revenue is hard to come by. Citigroup's trading revenue dropped 15 percent last quarter from the year-ago period, while revenue from deals and underwriting fell 27 percent.Citigroup is cutting back in areas where executives think revenue will not be coming back, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said. In fixed-income, he hinted that cuts are happening in businesses including one that sells products that trade on differences between yields on different bonds. In contrast, Citigroup's interest-rate trading is booming.""We are making selective reductions where we need to,"" Gerspach said, to reflect ""what we think the market reality is going forward."" ENERGY STRESS     Citigroup also had some troubles in its energy loan portfolio, like its peers JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which reported earnings earlier in the week.Nonetheless, Gerspach said the bank has ""a very good book of energy loans"" relative to competitors, and some analysts agreed. ""The market is acting as though there were a significant credit quality issue lurking, which we think is highly unlikely and Citi's numbers were once again outstanding on that front,"" Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski said in a note to clients, pointing out the stock's large discount to tangible book value.Still, the bank is facing the kind of profit pressure that has been plaguing the finance sector for some time. While its operating expenses declined 3.0 percent to $10.5 billion, revenue fell 11 percent. Repositioning costs are expected to be much lower through the rest of 2016, but Gerspach said weak business so far will likely result in a worse-than-expected ratio of costs to revenue for the full year of about 58 percent.It's ""tough to recover from the first quarter that we had,"" he said.Overall, Citigroup's net income fell to $3.5 billion, or $1.10 per share, during the first quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.03 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue, at $17.56 billion, topped the average estimate of $17.48 billion.

899,"   By Maximiliano Rizzi and Sarah Marsh | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES Moody's bumped up Argentina's credit rating one grade to ""B3"" on Friday due to ""economic policy improvements"" under a new, business-friendly government and expectations the country will finally settle a legal battle with creditors.The two other major ratings agencies, Fitch and Standard & Poor's, on Friday assigned ""B"" and ""B-"" ratings, respectively, to a historic bond issue next week. Both said they would assign a new rating to the sovereign issuer once Argentina had finally recovered from a 2014 default. Argentina is preparing to launch its first international bond issue in 15 years next week, seeking to raise up to $15 billion to firm up government financing and settle litigation that followed its record $100 billion default in 2002.President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December vowing to open up Latin America's third-largest economy, has made ending that legal battle and returning to global credit markets a priority during his first months in power. Moody's upgraded Argentina to ""B3"" with a stable outlook, six levels below investment grade. It has been at ""Caa1"" since March 2014.""The stable outlook ... balances our expectations for continued positive reform momentum and stabilization of reserve levels, with the still formidable macroeconomic challenges, particularly in reducing high fiscal deficits and inflation,"" the agency said.Macri says settling with holdouts is key to attracting new investment in order to reboot the economy. The former businessman and free-market reformer hopes investment-driven growth combined with public spending cuts will reduce a ballooning fiscal deficit and bring down double-digit inflation. He has his work cut out for him. In its ratings decision, S&P forecast inflation to slow toward 30 percent in 2017, nearly twice the government's target for next year.The country defaulted on its restructured bonds in July 2014 due to its legal battle with the creditors that rejected its 2005 and 2010 swaps. But a U.S. court ruling this week allowed Argentina to resume payments on those bonds, thereby exiting default, after paying the holdouts next Friday. Argentina on Friday confirmed the names of the seven banks managing its upcoming bond issue. Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Banco Santander SA were awarded the top role of global coordinators for the bond sale.BBVA, Citigroup Inc, and UBS Group AG will join as bookrunners. The banks will earn a commission of 0.18 percent of the funds raised.

Elavon ended last year with negative equity of 200 million reais ($56 million), leading regulators to press for a prompt capital injection.Relations between both partners soured, and a sale began to be negotiated late last year after Citigroup failed to come up with money to bolster the finances of Elavon, Brazil's No. 4 payment processor, Reuters reported in November.Elavon failed to gain traction in Brazil's burgeoning $250 billion payment processing market, which is dominated by Cielo SA and Rede, a unit of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA.

909,"  LONDON, April 22 (IFR) - David Basra, head of debt financing, Europe, Middle East and Africa at Citigroup is leaving the bank, according to sources.Basra is departing on good terms with the bank where he has worked for just shy of 20 years in a career that began in real estate finance before taking on a management role during the securitisation boom years. His exit is the latest ripple from Michael Lavelle's move last year to head investment banking for the UK and Ireland, after leading capital markets origination for EMEA. Basra missed out on the role when Citigroup promoted Philip Drury, formerly co-head of US equity capital markets, to replace Lavelle. Insiders believe that the bank will not replace Basra with a new head of the debt financing group - which contains leverage finance and high yield, structured finance, infrastructure and western and emerging markets loans.

924,"  (UPDATES throughout)By Paul Kilby and John BalassiNEW YORK, May 12 (IFR) - Citigroup revived a bond sale for Panama's Tocumen Airport on Thursday after pulling the deal in the wake of money-laundering allegations against the owners of its largest duty-free shops.In what has become a very complicated trade, the US bank has tweaked the bond's structure and is now marketing a US$500m-plus 2036 offering at a sweeter yield of 5.625%That is wide to the final yield of 5.375% on the larger US$625m bond that priced on May 4.That deal was pulled this week after the US Treasury named the owners of Grupo Wisa, the Waked family, as narcotics traffickers.Several investors then dropped out, forcing the bank to make the unusual move of cancelling the post-pricing settlement, which was due to take place on Wednesday. That Tocumen is returning so soon after the deal went south suggests that the lead underwriter is comfortable in generating sufficient demand under the new terms.The new bond, which has a 15.9-year weighted average life, is expected to price as soon as Friday.But amid the 'Lava Jato' investigation into corruption in Brazil, and other scandals in the region, the new accusations could give even more investors pause.""One thing that 'Lava Jato' has taught us is that you never know where these things will end up,"" said one investor. WIDE RANGE Indeed, the contractor on a Tocumen terminal is a subsidiary of Brazil's Odebrecht, whose former CEO was jailed earlier this year on bribery charges. Investors have been cutting exposure to Odebrecht risk after the company delayed the release of financial results earlier this month, raising the prospect of a debt acceleration.""I am concerned around this transaction, given the increased skepticism about other projects that Odebrecht is attached to,"" said Sean Newman, senior portfolio manager at Invesco.Citigroup itself recently dropped out of being a bookrunner on a US$1.225bn debt funding backing the construction of Line 2 on the Panama City metro - a project that had been co-contracted to Odebrecht.Fitch and S&P Global Ratings have maintained investment- grade ratings of BBB on the Tocumen offering, saying the allegations have not impacted the deal's credit quality.Tocumen is expected to terminate its operations with Wisa and find a replacement concessionaire within six months.While the state-owned airport has added new collateral pledges from advertising and car parking income, they represent just 2% of total revenues versus 7.7% from Wisa.

934,"   By Mike Kentz and Joy Wiltermuth  NEW YORK (IFR) - Citigroup told US regulators last week it was not willing to support troubled marketplace lender Lending Club after its CEO stepped down following a botched sale of loans.In a May 12 memo seen by IFR, Citigroup said it had declined a request from Jefferies, an investment bank, to back Lending Club after CEO Renaud Laplanche resigned three days earlier.""Jefferies has requested that Citi be supportive of Lending Club in order to calm the markets,"" said the memo, which further said the bank was temporarily freezing exposure to online lenders.""While Citi believes that overall due diligence and lending quality of Lending Club is good, it is ... investigating the situation and is not yet prepared to do this,"" it said.It was not specifically clear from the memo, which recorded the minutes of a call with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a US banking regulator, what kind of support Jefferies was seeking from Citigroup.According to the memo, Citigroup told the OCC that it believed Lending Club ""has sufficient liquidity to carry it through the next few weeks"".Calls and voicemail left by IFR for the Citigroup bankers were not answered. The OCC declined to comment on behalf of the OCC staff. Citigroup, Jefferies and the OCC declined to comment on the content of the memo. The SEC also declined to comment.In a statement to IFR, acting Lending Club CEO Scott Sanborn said the company was in a ""strong financial position"" with US$900m in cash and a US$120m line of credit.""Our platform continues to operate with existing investors and more returning each day,"" he said. Lending Club said in a quarterly SEC filing this week that a number of its large investors had halted investments in its loans in the wake of Laplanche's resignation, which could have a material effect on its performance.It said it did not know exactly what impact the slowdown in investment will have, or whether the investors will return.But three sources have told IFR that Lending Club is in talks with banks, hedge funds, money managers and mutual funds about possible financial support. TROUBLED WATERS Lending Club's CEO resigned after an internal company probe found that a US$22mn package of loans sold to Jefferies did not meet Jefferies' criteria, sources told IFR. Application dates on some of those loans had been falsified, the company said in a public filing.Lending Club repurchased those loans at par value, the sources said, but the incident put the spotlight on the relatively new business of peer-to-peer lending.""I recognize that events occurred on my watch where we failed to meet our high standards,"" Laplanche told the Wall Street Journal after stepping down.""While there are disagreements as to the characterization of facts, I accept that the board acted in good faith and did what it believed was right for the company."" Laplanche did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.Peer-to-peer or marketplace lenders bypass a traditional business of banks by connecting those seeking loans with retail investors willing to provide them.Companies like Lending Club then often sell packages of the loans to banks that securitize the loans into asset-backed bonds - something Jefferies had been planning to do. But Jefferies halted plans for a new securitization - a typical way that companies provide fresh capital for themselves - after the falsified loan sale emerged.Three sources have told IFR that one idea under discussion is for institutional investors to buy Lending Club loans in exchange for an equity stake in the company. Jefferies has even been engaged as an advisor to Lending Club specifically to seek third-party loan funding, according to another source familiar with the situation.

956,  June 14 Fitch: * Fitch affirms Citigroup's long-term IDR at 'A'; outlook stable  Source text for Eikon:  Further company coverage:  ,2016-06-14,C,"Tue Jun 14, 2016 | 4:40pm EDT",BRIEF-Fitch affirms Citigroup's long-term IDR at 'A',http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSFWN1960JN?type=companyNews
957,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Citigroup Inc.'s (Citi)  Viability Rating (VR) at 'a' and Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'.  Fitch has also affirmed Citibank, N.A.'s VR at 'a' and IDR at 'A+'. The Rating  Outlooks for the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. A full list of rating actions  follows at the end of this press release. Citi's Long-Term IDR is driven by its VR, which Fitch has affirmed at 'a'.  Fitch's affirmation of Citi's operating subsidiaries' IDRs at one notch above  their VRs reflects the expected implementation of total loss absorbing capacity  (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and  the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the holding company. Fitch affirmed Citi's ratings in conjunction with its periodic review of the  Global Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs). KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of Citigroup's VR reflects Citi's solid capital and liquidity  levels. Fitch views favorably Citi's successful execution of its strategy to  become a smaller, simpler and safer bank. Citi's earnings reflect an overall  improving trend over the past few years, despite a weak 1Q16. Citi's complexity  of operations, exposure to more volatile capital markets revenues, and weaker  relative asset quality offset these ratings strengths. Citi's capital ratios continue to remain very good and generally above global  peers. The company's Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully phased-in  basis increased again to an estimated 12.3% at March 31, 2016. The 124 bps  improvement from a year ago was due primarily to net income, a smaller balance  sheet, and utilization of the DTA, partially offset by share buybacks and  dividends. A large portion of Citi's sizeable DTA is excluded from regulatory  capital, impacting the CET1 ratio by roughly 135bps at quarter-end.  With respect to its estimated 3% G-SIB capital surcharge, Citi continues to work  on making its balance sheet more efficient, with an internal buffer above that  of between 50bps and 100bps. Citi has taken a fairly conservative stance towards  managing capital, and capital requests through the CCAR annual process have been  reasonable. This is viewed as prudent and also expected in light of Citi's past  experience with CCAR.  Citi's liquidity profile is a secondary key rating driver, underpinning its VR.  Citi has considerably bolstered its amount of liquid assets and reduced its  reliance on short-term borrowings over the last several years. The company's  liquidity profile remains strong, providing support to Citi's ratings. Citi  reported an average $400 billion in cash and unencumbered liquid securities in  1Q16, or 22% of total assets.  Fitch also views Citi's successful execution of its strategic plans favorably.  The company continues to make progress on the strategy that was originally laid  out in 2013 as the company focuses on being a smaller, simpler, and safer bank.  Fitch attributes the successful execution of its plan in part to Citi being the  only G-SIB to receive a non-objection on its resolution plan by both regulators,  notwithstanding some shortcomings that still need to be addressed.  In addition, Fitch acknowledges the proactive approach Citi has taken to  adopting various regulatory rules and has routinely met various thresholds and  ratios ahead of their requirements. Citi is in compliance with the final U.S.  LCR rules, as well as the Basel III Supplementary Leverage ratio at both the  holding company and bank levels. Its average LCR in 1Q16 was 120% (under U.S.  rules), while the SLR was 7.4% at March 31, 2016, on a fully implemented basis,  compared to 6.4% last year. Citi estimates that its estimated shortfall under  the proposed TLAC rules is approximately $11 billion, excluding the impact of  non-U.S. law debt, which could add approximately $10 billion to Citi's needs if  there are no changes to the final rule from the proposal. Fitch views this  shortfall as very manageable for Citi.  Citi successfully met its earnings ROA target in 2015, as results benefitted  from still benign credit costs, a stable margin, a profitable Citi Holdings  Segment, and lower legal and repositioning charges.  Citi Holdings remained profitable once again in 1Q16, and now accounts for just  4% of assets. Citi disclosed that beginning next year, Citi Holdings will no  longer be separately reported reflecting the company's view that the remaining  assets are not material enough to warrant separate reporting.  Fitch expects that full-year results may be more challenged given the  expectation of higher credit costs, market volatility, low interest rates, and  global uncertainty. Citi expects full-year 2016 operating efficiency ratio to be  higher than originally anticipated at around 58%. Citi no longer includes an ROA  target in its executive compensation guidelines, transitioning to relative total  shareholder returns over a three-year performance period. In 1Q'16, Citi reported a 0.79% return on assets for a return of equity of only  6.4%, which is below the company's assumed cost of capital. Fitch views Citi's  earnings performance in 1Q16 as disappointing and reflective of a difficult  operating environment with various revenue headwinds, energy-related costs, and  a still low rate environment. With regard to higher interest rates, Citi estimates that net interest income  would increase by nearly $2 billion under an instantaneous 100bps parallel  increase in interest rates. However, this would be offset by a roughly $5  billion decline to AOCI, offset over time through incremental spread income and  the expected recovery of AOCI. Together though, the estimated initial impact on  CET1 would be a negative 57bps. Fitch does not anticipate meaningful improvement  to earnings from potential interest rate hikes in Citi's earnings, but given  backlogs in investment banking, investment banking revenues may improve over the  course of the year. It is anticipated that the pending Costco acquisition will  be essentially neutral to earnings in 2016.  Offsetting these rating strengths, consolidated credit risk ratios for Citi  remain higher than some peers despite an improving overall trend over the past  several years. Fitch attributes some of Citi's weaker relative asset quality  profile to its high balance of troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), as well as  its exposure to higher loss content credit card loans and Mexico. Citi, along  with many of its peers, remains exposed to falling oil prices, though loan  losses to date have been modest for Citi.  Citi's energy-related exposure is higher than its large bank U.S. peers, with  direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments totaling $59.3 billion at  March 31, 2016. Funded loans comprise 3.8% of loans, with approximately 61%  rated investment grade, down from last quarter due to downgrades. Citi expects  that credit costs in ICG will be around $1.4 billion during the year, based on a  scenario in which oil prices remain around $30 a barrel for a sustained period  of time. This represents approximately 4% of 2015 pre-provision net revenues.  Fitch views lower oil prices as an earnings headwind for Citi and not a  significant capital event.  , Given Citi's higher loss content credit card book and emerging markets  exposure, loan losses tend to be higher than peer averages. Fitch expects loan  losses may increase for the industry given the very benign credit environment  and unsustainably low levels of credit losses. Citigroup is one of the largest banking institutions in the world, with by far  the biggest international banking franchise among U.S. peers. With a vast  international franchise, Citi's revenue diversity in terms of geography is  greater than its peers, with sizable business operations in many faster growing  emerging markets, including China, India, and Mexico. However, this increased  revenue diversity also present potential issues with regard to exposure to any  political unrest in foreign countries, as well as direct exposure to economic  deterioration or slowed growth in any of these markets. This geographic reach  also necessitates the need for a sophisticated risk management infrastructure to  manage risk around the globe.  While there is no outsized reliance on a single market outside of the U.S.  (Mexico being the largest at around 9% of revenues), if there are issues related  to economic slowdowns or political unrest in a particular emerging market, it is  possible there may be effects for Citi. The secondary effects of a slowdown in a  particular country, for example, China, and those cascading impacts to the  global economy are much harder to quantify and assess for any implications to  Citi or its peers. However, relative to other large U.S. banks, Citi is more  exposed to slowdown in the emerging markets.  The complexity of global operations and a reliance on more volatile capital  markets revenues, which on average account for around 25% revenues, serve as  constraints to upwards movement in ratings.  The VRs remain equalized between Citi and its material operating subsidiaries,  including Citibank, N.A. The common VR of Citi and its operating companies  reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate between the Citi and these  subsidiaries. Fitch takes a group view on the credit profile from a failure  perspective, while the IDR reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk  on senior debt. Fitch believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly  equivalent, while the default risk given at the operating company would be lower  given total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). All U.S. bank subsidiaries carry a  common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are cross-guaranteed under the  Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  Citi's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of TLAC requirements for U.S.  G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default  risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities relative to holding  company senior debt. In Fitch's view these buffers would provide substantial  protection to senior unsecured obligations in the domestic operating entities in  the event of group resolution, as they could be used to absorb losses and  recapitalize operating companies. Therefore, substantial holding company debt  reduces the likelihood of default on operating company senior obligations.  KEY RATING DRIVERS- SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The support rating (SR) and support rating floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's view that  senior creditors can no longer rely on receiving full extraordinary support from  the sovereign in the event that Citi becomes non-viable. Fitch believes  implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority legislation is  now sufficiently progressed to provide a framework for resolving banks that is  likely to require holding company senior creditors participating in losses, if  necessary, instead of or ahead of the company receiving sovereign support. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Citi and its subsidiaries  are all notched down from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of  each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profiles, which vary considerably.  Subordinated debt issued by the operating companies is rated at the same level  as subordinated debt issued by Citi reflecting the potential for subordinated  creditors in the operating companies to be exposed to loss ahead of senior  creditors in Citi. Subordinated lower Tier 2 debt is rated one notch below the  VR for loss severity, reflecting below average recoveries.  Legacy Tier 1 securities are generally rated four notches below the VR, made up  of two notches for high loss severity relative to average recoveries, and two  further notches for non-performance risk, reflecting the fact that coupon  omission is not fully discretionary.  High and low trigger contingent capital Tier 1 instruments are rated five  notches below the VR. The issues are notched down twice for loss severity,  reflecting poor recoveries as the instruments can be converted to equity or  written down well ahead of resolution. In addition, they are also notched down  three times for very high non-performance risk, reflecting fully discretionary  coupon omission.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - DEPOSIT RATINGS Deposit ratings are one notch higher than senior debt reflecting the deposits'  superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor preference in the  U.S.  Citi's international subsidiary, Citibank Canada's deposit ratings are at the  same level as senior debt ratings because their preferential status is less  clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it difficult to  determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARIES Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited,  Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Services LCC, Citibank  Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, CitiFinancial Europe plc, and Citibank Europe plc  are wholly owned subsidiaries of Citi or Citibank, N.A.  Their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with Citi or Citibank, N.A. reflecting  Fitch's view that these entities are integral to Citi's business strategy and  operations. Their IDRs and ratings would be sensitive to the same factors that  might drive a change in Citi's IDR. The Rating Outlook for Citi's material international operating companies' IDRs  is Positive, including Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Citibank Canada,  Citibank Japan Ltd, and Citibank Europe plc.  Fitch's Positive Rating Outlook for Citi's material international operations  reflects the likelihood of internal TLAC as required by the Financial Stability  Board (FSB). The Positive Outlook reflects the agency's belief that the internal  TLAC of material international operating companies will likely be large enough  to meet and exceed Pillar 1 capital requirements and will then be sufficient to  recapitalize them. A one notch upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient  clarity on additional disclosure on the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its  sufficiency in size to cover a default of senior operating company liabilities.  Sufficient clarity may, however, take longer to come through than the typical  Outlook horizon of one to two years. Domestic subsidiaries and international subsidiaries that have not been upgraded  or assigned a Positive Rating Outlook are, in Fitch's opinion, not sufficiently  material to benefit from domestic support from Citi or are international  subsidiaries that would not benefit from internal TLAC. This includes Citigroup  Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Securities LLC, and  CitiFinancial Europe PLC.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch sees limited near-term upward VR momentum given a relatively high and  absolute rating. The company's complex organizational structure and reliance on  more volatile capital markets revenues act as key constraints to further upward  movement of the ratings. Citigroup's IDRs and senior debt are sensitive to any  changes in the VR, while Citibank's IDR and senior debt are sensitive to changes  in our view of the buffer created by the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the implementation of TLAC requirements for  U.S. G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding company debt, which serve  to reduce the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior  liabilities relative to holding company senior debt.  Downward pressure on the VR could result from a material deterioration in  capital or liquidity levels. The strength of the liquidity and capital profiles  underpins Citi's ratings. Today's affirmations incorporate Fitch's expectation  that Citi will manage its capital and liquidity profiles relatively  conservatively, and although capital distributions will likely increase over  time, they will still be governed by regulatory stress testing and as such,  remain reasonable. In addition, a CCAR objection due to qualitative reasons may  result in a downgrade of the VR as it represents a material shortcoming in the  company's risk management infrastructure.  While there is no outsized reliance on a single market outside of the U.S.  (Mexico being the largest at roughly 10% of Citicorp revenues), if there are  issues related to economic slowdowns or political unrest in a particular  emerging market, it is possible there may be effects for Citi. The secondary  effects of a slowdown in a particular country, and those cascading impacts on  the global economy are much harder to quantify and assess for any implications  to Citi or its peers.  Any unforeseen outsized fines, settlements or other legal-related charges could  have adverse rating implications for Citi. There is very little visibility into  ultimate legal-related risk for Citi or the industry, though Fitch expects  litigation costs will remain manageable relative to capital for Citi. A fine  that was to deplete capital in a material way could lead to a negative rating  action.  Citi's ratings could be vulnerable to a large operational loss or if an  operational event calls into question Fitch's assessment of Citi's risk  management function and its ability to accurately identify, monitor, and  mitigate risks throughout the organization.  SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that Citi  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES These ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VR. The securities'  ratings are also sensitive to a change in their notching, which could arise if  Fitch changes its assessment of the probability of their non-performance  relative to the risk captured in the issuers' VRs. This may reflect a change in  capital management in the group or an unexpected shift in regulatory buffer  requirements, for example. SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS Deposit ratings are sensitive to changes in senior debt ratings. SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARIES  The IDRs of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Global Markets  Limited, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Services LCC,  Citibank Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, CitiFinancial Europe plc, and Citibank  Europe plc are sensitive to the same factors that might drive a change in Citi's  IDR. Specific factors that Fitch seeks additional clarity on before resolving the  Rating Outlook and potentially upgrading the subsidiary ratings of Citigroup  Global Markets Limited, Citibank Canada, Citibank Japan Ltd, and Citibank Europe  plc will include host country clarification on internal TLAC, the quantum of  internal TLAC and whether it will be pre-positioned. The quantum is relevant  because per Fitch's criteria the agency will look to the sufficiency of the  amount of capital available to that subsidiary to recapitalize it. If the amount  of TLAC is sufficient for recapitalization in Fitch's opinion and is  pre-positioned, Fitch will likely upgrade the subsidiary ratings; further, if  home and host country regulators reach agreements where pre-positioning is not  required, the rating will not be upgraded and the Outlook revised to Stable.  If clarity on host country internal TLAC proposals are further delayed beyond  the next six months, Fitch will likely revise the subsidiary Outlooks to Stable  until such clarity on these proposals is articulated. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., Citigroup Derivatives Securities LLC,  and CitiFinancial Europe PLC are sensitive to changes in Citi's IDRs.

958,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ride-hailing company Uber has hired a group of banks to help it raise debt on the leveraged loan market, according to sources familiar with the proposed transaction.While the final size has yet to be determined, the loan could reach at least $1 billion with an even larger size possible, but the deal is still in early stages and could change in size and structure, said a source.Startups like Uber rarely visit the leveraged loan market as investors generally prefer to lend to companies with long track records. Uber was created in 2009, according to the company.                                                            The bank group currently consists of four banks, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, according to sources. The other two banks include Morgan Stanley and Barclays, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The San Francisco-based company has yet to visit the loan market to raise term loan debt, but it did arrange a $1.9 billion five-year revolving credit facility in June 2015 that was increased to $2.27 billion in March 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.Morgan Stanley served as the administrative agent on the revolving credit facility and a bookrunner along with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. The revolving credit facility is priced at 100 basis points over Libor. The loan matures in June 2020.The company has previously favored the equity market over the debt market, as it did when it announced June 1 that it had sealed a deal to raise $3.5 billion from the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, putting the value of the company at $62.5 billion, according to Reuters. Uber’s balance sheet stood at more than $11 billion at that time, according to the company. Uber operates an app allowing users to hail different types of transportation directly to where they are.Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined comment.

959,"  (Fixes Eikon link to factbox on referendum results, paragraph 18)* Banks draft in traders for British EU referendum night* One fund prepares for 30 pct sterling fall if ""Out"" wins* Bank of England to staff through the nightBy William James, Freya Berry and Patrick GrahamLONDON, June 15 The world's biggest banks including Citi and Goldman Sachs will draft in senior traders to work through the night following Britain's referendum on EU membership, set to be among the most volatile 24 hours for markets in a quarter of a century.A vote to leave the European Union on June 23 would spook investors by undermining post-World War Two attempts at European integration and placing a question mark over the future of the United Kingdom and its $2.9 trillion economy.Citi, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are among those banks planning to have senior staff and traders working or on call in London as results start to dribble in after polls close at 2100 GMT, according to the sources.Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co, told employees on a visit to Britain this month that if the vote was to leave the EU, the bank would have to have ""teams of people thrown on what that means"".""We won't know what it means: there is a wide range of outcomes,"" Dimon, a supporter of Britain's membership who has warned of job cuts at JPMorgan in Britain if there is an Out vote, said in the broadcast speech.A vote to leave could unleash turmoil on foreign exchange, equity and bond markets, spoiling bets across asset classes and potentially testing the infrastructure of Western markets such as computer systems, stock exchanges and clearing houses.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has cautioned that a Brexit vote could shake financial markets and potentially push back the timing of the next rise in U.S. interest rates.Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said sterling could depreciate, ""perhaps sharply"" and some major banks have forecast an unprecedented fall to parity with the euro and as low as $1.20 in the days following any vote to leave the bloc.The Bank of England will be staffed overnight, with senior policymakers on call if markets go into meltdown. The finance ministry would not comment on its staffing plans.The official Vote Leave campaign argues there is no evidence that leaving the EU would weaken sterling long term, while Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party has said that even if the currency did fall, it would simply boost British exports. BREXIT NIGHT? Sterling - the world's fourth most traded currency - has moved sharply in recent weeks, often on the back of opinion polls.Depending on the results from across the United Kingdom, the night of June 23 and early morning of June 24 could rank as one of the most volatile nights in the history of the London market.""We've all seen U.S. elections, UK general elections, we've had the Scottish referendum, the collapse of Lehman and QE (Quantitative Easing) but this is by far and away the biggest risk event that has presented itself to the UK,"" said Chris Huddleston, head of money markets at specialist bank Investec.London accounts for 41 percent of global turnover in the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, more than double the turnover in the United States and far more than the 3 percent of its closest EU competitors, France and Switzerland.""All the traders are going to be in ...

The question is just when you try and get some sleep,"" said one senior foreign exchange trader. No exit polls are planned by British broadcasters so the first numbers from the counts will be turnout results from 382 different areas followed by totals for 'Remain' and 'Leave' in each area.STERLING Polls have given contradictory pictures of British public opinion, keeping markets guessing on the final outcome.That has left sterling, currently priced at $1.41, far away from either of its likely resting places after the final result is known - seen by banks as around $1.50 in the event of a remain vote, or $1.30 or lower if Britain votes to leave.That almost-certain rapid repricing could set the scene for one of the rockiest sessions since traders wrestled down the value of sterling on Black Wednesday, September 16, 1992, when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.""If it's Brexit, then we're looking at something that's at least on the scale of Black Wednesday,"" said Nick Parsons, global co-head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank and a veteran of the 1992 sterling crisis.Prices for derivatives used to mitigate the risk of sharp swings in sterling point to a period of intense volatility. Officials and bank managers planning for the event draw comparisons with the 40 percent surge in the Swiss franc in January 2015, which bankrupted dozens of small investment funds and cost banks including Citi hundreds of millions of dollars.Traders and analysts told Reuters they would expect a Brexit vote to cause sterling to 'gap', or plummet lower - as orders to sell the currency met an absence of willing buyers, leaving a blank spot on the price charts snaking across traders' screens.Gaps can inflict huge losses on banks and traders, forcing them to bail out of trades at prices far below the automatic sell orders, or 'stops' they normally use to limit losses.Currency market participants have urged the Bank of England to call on U.S. Federal Reserve if the turbulence gets really bad. The BoE could buy sterling with dollars borrowed directly from the U.S. central bank under arrangements first used in response to the global financial crisis in 2008.Carney has said the Bank would not stand in the way of any exchange rate adjustment but would take the necessary steps to ensure markets remained orderly.

965,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wall Street analysts who cover big banks will endure a long night on Thursday, when a barrage of data will show how well the largest U.S. financial institutions can stand up under stress.The crunch will start at 4:30 p.m. EDT when the U.S. Federal Reserve will release the first of two sets of results from the banks' annual stress tests. Minutes later, more numbers will rain down when banks disclose how they scored themselves.As the night drags on, the analysts will see vote counts from Britain's referendum on whether to leave the European Union. The referendum is important to banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which has significant staff in Britain to handle European transactions.""It is going to be all hands on deck,"" said Barclays bank analyst Jason Goldberg, who postponed his 11-year-old son's birthday dinner to focus on the stress test scores.Analysts like Goldberg will sort through the scores for clues about how much excess capital the banks have according to regulators, who have overseen the strengthening of lenders' balances sheets since the financial crisis.Test results are important to investors who want to see the banks return more capital. Goldberg expects the Fed to continue a trend of permitting gradual increases in payouts, with dividends and buybacks rising this time to 80 percent of profits from 75 percent last year. It is difficult enough to use the annual data dumps to figure out which banks will probably be allowed to use as much capital for payouts as the market expects. That will come after the second test, which banks can actually fail. This time the outcome of the British referendum may make their analyses moot as far as Friday's stock prices go.    Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts estimated last week that a decision to leave could reduce 2017 earnings per share by 6.7 percent for JPMorgan, 7.9 percent for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and 9 percent for Morgan Stanley (MS.N).The KBW Bank Index .BKX fell earlier this month as polls showed an increasing chance of a “Brexit."" As of Monday, it was still down nearly 6 percent since May despite surveys over the weekend that indicated a shift in support for remaining in the EU.""If they vote to remain, the stocks are going to rally,"" said Nomura analyst Steven Chubak. ""I am still going to be focused on (the stress test).""             SPREADSHEET WOES     The results on Thursday will be from DFAST, the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing exam required by the financial reform law from 2010. The scores for the 33 banks will give hypothetical levels of capital that would be left if they were subjected to certain economic and market stresses and did not take any funding actions. The Fed administers DFAST in conjunction with its own stress test, called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. The CCAR results will be released on June 29 and will feature pass or fail grades for the banks' capital management and payout proposals. This is the fifth year that bank analysts have geared up for the hypothetical DFAST findings, which come during anxiety over real stress. The Brexit vote, some traders have said, could make Friday the most volatile day in foreign exchange markets since the sterling crisis of 1992.    Barclays’ Goldberg said he and three associates would work the DFAST numbers to produce a clean report before dawn. Whether Brexit results come soon enough to influence his comments remains to be seen.    A hazard for analysts is that the Fed has failed at least one bank each year for “qualitative” flaws in capital management. For example, in 2014 the Fed rejected Citigroup Inc's bid (C.N) to pay out more because of deficiencies, including not being able to project losses under the scenarios for parts of its global operations.Analysts have found they cannot accurately predict Fed rejections over the quality of capital management.Goldberg said: ""You hold your breath on these qualitative fails.""

For example, in 2014 the Fed rejected Citigroup Inc's bid (C.N) to pay out more because of deficiencies, including not being able to project losses under the scenarios for parts of its global operations.Analysts have found they cannot accurately predict Fed rejections over the quality of capital management.Goldberg said: ""You hold your breath on these qualitative fails.""

967,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to decide whether Miami can pursue lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers resulting in loan defaults that drove down city tax revenues and property values.The justices will hear appeals filed by Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co of a lower court's decision to permit the lawsuits by the Florida city against the banks. They were filed under the Fair Housing Act, a federal law outlawing discrimination in housing.Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said that although the bank is committed to the aims of the Fair Housing Act, ""We believe that a municipality seeking purely monetary recovery is not covered by the statute, and we welcome the Supreme Court’s scrutiny and clarity.""Last September, the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss such lawsuits by the city against Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc. Citigroup decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Miami accused the banks of a decade of lending discrimination in its residential housing market. The city accused Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup of steering non-white borrowers into higher-cost loans they often could not afford, even if they had good credit.It said the banks' conduct caused Miami to lose property tax revenues, drove down property values and required the city to pay the costs of repairing and maintaining properties that went into foreclosure due to discriminatory lending.Several U.S. cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Memphis, have accused banks, with mixed success, of discriminatory mortgage lending that prolonged the nation's housing crisis. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender and includes the former Wachovia. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, includes the former Countrywide Financial.The Supreme Court ruled last year in a major Fair Housing Act case, upholding on a 5-4 vote a broad interpretation of discrimination claims allowed under the Fair Housing Act. That decision was in a Texas case and delivered a setback to lenders and insurers that sought to curtail such lawsuits.

980,"   By Sumeet Chatterjee | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Citigroup Inc looks to sharpen its focus on winning a bigger share of business from ""emerging market champions"" in Asia, including rapidly growing Internet firms, as part of its plans to boost corporate banking revenue.The U.S. bank, which counts Asia as its fastest growing region, employs more than 600 people in its corporate banking business in the region and would make select hirings to bolster its presence, Gerald Keefe, newly appointed head of Asia Pacific corporate banking, said.""These companies have achieved scale quickly and now increasingly are growing in developed markets,"" Keefe said, referring to what the bank calls emerging market champions in countries such as China and India.Citigroup announced the appointment of Keefe as Asia Pacific corporate banking head in April, a new role that brings together bankers working for clients from financial institutions, public sector entities, corporates and local units of global firms. ""One of the priorities in the new role is to deliver stable top-line growth for corporate banking in Asia in an efficient and responsible manner,"" Keefe, who was previously the bank's corporate banking head in Japan, told Reuters. Citigroup's enhanced focus on the corporate banking business in Asia comes against the backdrop of a drop in revenues from trading and deal advisory and underwriting in the first quarter that weighed on its earnings.Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat indicated last month that the bank's second-quarter net income will be roughly 25 percent lower than the same period a year earlier. The bank is due to report on Friday. Under the corporate banking business in Asia, its offerings include cash management, foreign exchange, trade finance, loans, and capital markets and structured products solutions. The unit will work closely with investment banking and markets teams.In a sign of its increasing focus on high-growth firms in the region, Citigroup was one of the lead arrangers in three separate loan deals of Chinese Internet giants Alibaba Group, Baidu and Tencent Holdings, which raised a combined $10.4 billion earlier this year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. ""We have leading corporate champions in China as our clients ... they are now in many ways global businesses,"" Keefe said. ""We are uniquely positioned to help them expand globally with our network in over 100 countries.""In Asia, the bank is also looking to grow its supply-chain financing business, in which target clients range from car component makers to telecoms equipment producers, as these firms look to expand their geographical footprints, Keefe said.

982,"   By David Henry and Sweta Singh  Citigroup is betting on U.S. consumers and multi-national corporate clients to navigate lower interest rates after a rebound in trading helped it beat Wall Street's subdued expectations for the second quarter.    A burst in client demand for currencies and bonds in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, along with a drop in the amount of money set aside to cover soured loans, meant Citi reported a 14 percent fall in net profit, far less than the 25 percent slide Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat had warned of in early June.The slip in earnings reflects U.S. banks' struggle with low U.S. interest rates, which hamper their ability to profit from lending.After raising rates in December for the first time in almost a decade, the U.S. Federal Reserve was widely expected to do so at least twice again this year. But Wall Street is now uncertain there will be any rate hikes in 2016, especially with a volatile race for the White House.""While the U.K. has a new leader, the US is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign,"" Corbat said on a call with analysts on Friday. ""And such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture of potential interest rate increases.""Citigroup's net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, shrank to 2.86 percent from 2.95 percent a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said it would only rebound to about 2.90 percent the rest of the year and be less beneficial than the company expected at the start of 2016.To navigate the lower interest rates, Corbat is banking on growth in its U.S. credit card business, where it launched a co-branded card with retailer Costco Wholesale Corp last month, as well as the marketing of its 2 percent cash-back card.The bank expects revenues in U.S. consumer banking to grow in this quarter from the second quarter and sees modest growth in international consumer revenues due to improvements in Asia and Mexico.Citigroup's business providing corporations with cash management and trade finance will deliver more revenue than a year earlier on new contracts, Gerspach said. Earnings per share slid to $1.24 from $1.45 but beat analysts' average estimate of $1.10, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The outperformance mirrored larger rival JPMorgan Chase & Co, which also beat forecasts with the help of more-robust trading in bonds and currencies.Citi's bad debt charges fell in the quarter, unlike rival Wells Fargo & Co, which reported a 3.5 percent dip in quarterly profit on Friday after it set aside more money to cover potential loan losses.Citi's shares were down 0.6 percent in afternoon trading after gaining 2.5 percent on JPMorgan's results on Thursday. NEW GOALS Corbat has worked hard to shed the reputational and operational damage from the financial crisis, when Citi had to tap taxpayers for more than $45 billion in bailouts.To raise shareholders' returns, he has narrowed the bank’s focus on profitable consumer markets, cutting in half the number of countries where Citi operates to 19 and overhauling its internal controls to appease regulators.Corbat said he would put out new performance goals for the bank later this year, updating targets he set in 2013 for efficiency and return on assets and capital.Citi investors got a boost this year when the bank passed the latest U.S. stress tests after failing twice, enabling Corbat to triple dividends and spend more capital on buybacks. Corbat pledged Friday to continue to boost payouts.  He has also managed to use $10 billion of deferred tax assets, one fifth of the peak level in 2012. The assets are tax breaks from losses Citi suffered in the crisis and the bank has to hold extra capital against them, making it more difficult to meet profitability targets.The bank earned a return on equity of 7 percent in the second quarter, below its theoretical cost of capital of 10 percent and behind rivals JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, which earned 10 percent and 11.7 percent respectively.The most international of the large U.S. banks, Citi's overseas consumer banking business held up well, with a 7 percent increase in net profit, adjusted for changes in exchange rates.Corbat reaffirmed Citi's commitment to Banamex, its consumer business in Mexico, which is often mentioned as a possible spin-off candidate to boost returns.But profit overall at its consumer bank fell 18 percent, with the biggest drop at its North American consumer business, where net income dropped 22 percent as revenue fell 3 percent and expenses rose.Overall, Citi's operating expenses declined 5 percent to $10.37 billion, helped by a change in foreign exchange rates, but revenue fell more, dropping 8 percent.The bank's institutional business, which includes the investment banking division, reported a 2 percent rise in net income, benefiting from a 14 percent increase in revenues from trading bonds, currencies and commodities.

994,"  (UPDATES throughout)By Paul KilbyNEW YORK, July 25 (IFR) - Ecuador launched a US$1bn five-year bond on Monday, taking advantage of a strong backdrop for LatAm credits to garner much-needed funding for the year.With books heard reaching US$2bn earlier in the day, the deal gained traction despite concerns about Ecuador's worsening economic conditions and the country's history of defaults.A rally in EM assets, fueled in part by the buyside's hunt for yield, set the stage nicely for the troubled Andean country, which has been struggling to source financing this year.""Many of us have been waiting for them to issue as Ecuador is loath to sign on to an IMF program with conditions,"" said Sarah Glendon, head of sovereign research at hedge fund Gramercy.Sole lead Citigroup squeezed pricing from talk of 11% area to 10.75% area (+/-1/8), but failed to grind lower amid pushback from accounts scared off by Ecuador's crumbling credit metrics.The oil exporting country's debt-to-GDP ratio now stands at 35%, close to the government's official debt ceiling of 40%, said Glendon.""If they get close to that, I am fairly confident that authorities will brush the debt limit by the wayside,"" she said.But the final yield of 10.75% was enough to get the deal past the finishing line. ""They are aware they have to be generous,"" said Glendon. ""They have a constrained liquidity position.""BETTER THAN BEFORE At 10.75%, the new bond offered a decent pick-up to Ecuador's existing curve, where the 2020s and 2024s were trading at around 9.9% and 10.25% on Friday. Those bonds have rallied considerably since mid-February, when yields respectively hit around 22% and 15.88% amid fears that rock-bottom crude prices could lead to another default.Under similar circumstances in June 2014, Ecuador returned to the international bond markets for the first time since President Rafael Correa selectively defaulted in 2008.At that time, a grab for yield allowed the country to price the 2024 bond at an extremely attractive level of 7.95%.""People have been looking at the recent performance of Ecuador, which has been very positive,"" a DCM banker away from the deal told IFR.""Last week was the first week the curve hasn't been inverted."" Citigroup had taken government officials on fixed-income investor meetings in April, but held back at a time when funding costs remained prohibitive.Even now, however, some accounts are unimpressed - even with a double-digit coupon.""At 11% we don't think the pricing adequately compensates investors the looming macro-economic risks,"" said Sean Newman, a senior portfolio manager at Invesco.""We estimate a funding shortfall of US$2.4bn, which will probably result in further indebtedness at the central bank - which creates additional risks.""Some investors are hoping that next year's presidential election will bring a change of government and more market-friendly economic policies.""Between 2020 and 2024 there will be significant spikes in bond maturities,"" said Glendon.""So whoever is in office will need to prioritize getting their fiscal house in order to maintain market access and be able to roll over maturities during that period.""Ratings of B/B are expected on the 144a/Reg S deal.

1000,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Paula Arend Laier | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Energisa SA priced an offering of new stock near the upper end of a suggested range on Tuesday, signaling an upbeat industry outlook and strong investor demand bolstered plans by Brazil's No. 6 power distributor to cut debt.According to data obtained from securities industry watchdog CVM, Energisa sold 61.5 million units, and placed 22.52 million units in supplementary and additional allotments at 18.50 reais. Energisa sought to price the units, comprised of one common share and four preferred shares, between 16 reais and 20 reais.The offering was the first for any Brazilian power firm in three years, underscoring the extent to which the image of a sector long marred by erratic policy moves and a deep recession has changed in recent weeks. Investors placed bids worth almost 8 times the amount of Energisa units on offer, three people familiar with the deal told Reuters earlier in the day.An index grouping power utilities trading in the São Paulo Stock Exchange has gained 69 percent over the past six months. Robust demand for the Energisa deal could open room for more similar transactions over the coming months, asset managers consulted by Reuters said on Tuesday. Taking advantage of the newfound interest in the sector, Energisa's controlling Botelho family envisioned the deal as a re-IPO, by which a company boosts trading volume by increasing shares outstanding, the people said. A recent wave of takeovers is fanning hopes that utilities will soon emerge stronger from Brazil's worst recession in eight decades.Energisa declined to comment, citing a quiet period related to the transaction. The company had hired the investment-banking units of Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp, Grupo BTG Pactual SA, Banco Bradesco SA and Banc Santander Brasil SA to advise on the transaction. Excluding the supplementary and additional allotments, Energisa raised 1.137 billion reais ($348 million) from the deal, according to Thomson Reuters calculations based on the watchdog's data. The company will use proceeds from the offering to cut debt, which totaled 7 billion reais in March.The offer is the largest for any Brazilian power firm since AES Eletropaulo SA fetched 1.345 billion reais in a so-called primary offering in Sept. 2006. A primary offering usually helps companies attract money that they can only use for their projects.  Energisa's units traded unchanged at 20 reais on Tuesday. The stock has jumped 37 percent over the past three months.

1005,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal appeals court rejected a one-time Florida billionaire's bid to revive his $800 million lawsuit accusing Citigroup Inc of fraudulently hiding its exposure to subprime and other toxic mortgages, inducing him to hold on to shares he otherwise would have sold.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Friday said Citigroup and former officials, including two chief executives Charles Prince and Vikram Pandit, were not liable to trusts and corporate entities overseen by Arthur Williams and his wife.""We respectfully disagree with the court's opinion, and are considering our appeal options,"" Jacob Zamansky, a lawyer for the Williamses, said in a phone interview.Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos said the bank was pleased with the decision.Williams, the founder of what became Primerica Financial Services, has said he had planned in May 2007 to sell his 17.6 million Citigroup share stake, but decided to sell just 1 million because the bank assured investors it was in good shape. It was not until March 2009, upon ""realizing that Citigroup likely was never going to recover,"" that he sold the rest of his stake at $3.09 per share, costing him ""the financial benefit of his life's work,"" court papers show.He sued for the difference between that price and the $51.59 per-share price prevailing in May 2007.But the appeals court called the damages ""too undeterminable and speculative,"" saying Williams could only hypothesize what the stock price might have been at a given time had New York-based Citigroup disclosed its exposure sooner. Citigroup ultimately lost $27.68 billion in 2008, and underwent a series of federal bailouts that have since been repaid.Pandit and the bank's current Chief Executive Michael Corbat have spent years shedding troubled assets. Citigroup, once the largest U.S. bank by assets, now ranks fourth.

1014,"  (Revises throughout with comment from JPMorgan memo)Aug 16 Citigroup Inc made another change among consumer banking tech executives on Tuesday and JPMorgan Chase & Co revealed a change of its own as the big banks try to find their way through the changing landscape of digital finance.Citigroup said it named Gavin Michael, who was JPMorgan's head of digital for consumer banking, to be head of technology for its Global Consumer Bank, replacing Mark Torkos, who retired in July.On Thursday afternoon JPMorgan said in an internal memo, which was reviewed by Reuters, that Michael ""will be looking for other opportunities"" and was being replaced by Bill Wallace, who has been at the bank 23 years, heads consumer bank operations and runs the Customer Experience Council.Michael had said he was interested in jobs outside of JPMorgan, according to the memo from Gordon Smith, the chief executive of JPMorgan's consumer bank. Citigroup had been speaking to Michael ""for some time"" as it looked to fill the job, said Citi spokeswoman Elizabeth Fogarty.Smith credited Michael, who was at JPMorgan for three years, with starting a mobile banking application and redesigning the online banking site. Michael was named 2016 digital banker of the year by American Banker, Citigroup said in a statement.At Citigroup, Michael will lead more than 4,000 employees and report to Stephen Bird, chief executive of the consumer bank, and work with Don Callahan, head of operations and technology for the entire company. The developments come after it was announced last week that Heather Cox, who Citigroup hired two years ago to spearhead innovations in digital consumer banking, was leaving the bank for financial services provider USAA. Cox was head of the Citi FinTech unit, which is within the consumer bank and supported by the technology group to be headed by Michael.Citigroup, the most geographically diverse of U.S. banks, has consumer banking operations in 19 countries globally.

But Citigroup may be the best example of how the Fed's efforts to make the banking system safer are tying management's hands and frustrating shareholders.Corbat is planning to set out new targets later this year, and people close to him say he knows the pressure is on. Yet he has little choice but to ask for more patience, analysts say. Corbat and his management team have been meeting with analysts and investors for months, explaining Citi's situation.    Citigroup needed more than $45 billion in bailouts during the 2007-2009 financial crisis – more than any other bank - and regulators have kept it on a tight leash. That left it lagging its peers in terms of capital returned to shareholders and its share performance. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1mZb4h8)As the 56-year-old former bond trader approaches his fourth anniversary as CEO, the bank is slipping further away from financial targets he set out in March 2013 and analysts' profit forecasts suggest the goals will remain elusive.""It is an adjustment that is taking longer than would have been expected,"" said Macrae Sykes, an analyst at money manager Gabelli & Co, which owns Citigroup shares.Returns on capital ""have been underwhelming the last couple of years,"" he added.

Last year, the gauge, which measures how well a bank uses shareholder capital to earn profits, only hit 9.2 percent and analyst estimates suggest it may slip to 7.5 percent this year.While low interest rates depress earnings, the Fed's requirement that Citigroup retain more and more capital make it harder to hit the earnings-to-capital ratio target.Analysts say the Fed would need to allow the bank to return as much as it earns to significantly improve shareholders' returns and the Fed now lets Citi distribute about 65 percent of its capital. Corbat reached that level in June when he won approval from the regulator to triple the bank's dividend and increase spending on its stock buybacks by more than a third. Previously, Citi had failed Fed tests of its capital plans twice.

On Monday, ValueAct Capital Management disclosed a 2 percent stake in Morgan Stanley, spurring chatter on Wall Street about who might be targeted next.Even without activists investors, investor patience is wearing thin.""Citi management owes investors an explanation as to how they are going to get capital out of the business,"" said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl.Corbat declined to be interviewed for this story, as did the bank's chairman, Mike O'Neill.

Corbat reached that level in June when he won approval from the regulator to triple the bank's dividend and increase spending on its stock buybacks by more than a third. Previously, Citi had failed Fed tests of its capital plans twice.While no activist investors have stepped forward with big stakes in Citigroup, they have been eyeing big bank stocks for some time.

But the stock has moved little since.As of Wednesday Citigroup shares had gained 27 percent during Corbat's tenure as CEO, compared with a 39 percent rise in the KBW bank stock index and gains of more than 50 percent for big bank rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp.To improve performance, some analysts and investors have called for Citi's break up, perhaps by separating its consumer and institutional businesses, or by selling big chunks, such as its Mexican bank, Banamex.As part of a broad retrenchment, Corbat has already shed consumer operations in 22 countries of more than 40 where Citigroup operated. He also closed a third of branch offices and 182 operations sites. Payroll is down by 43,000 jobs during his tenure.But some investors and analysts want more.

1019,"  (Corrects spelling of firm name Portales in third paragraph)By David HenryNEW YORK Aug 18 Earlier this year, an analyst asked Citigroup Inc Chief Executive Michael Corbat what he would do if activist investors tried to shake things up after what seems like eons of underperformance.Corbat's response? He would take the new shareholders down to the U.S. Federal Reserve so they could see the limitations he faces.""He was confident that they would not have any success with getting the regulators to look kindly on their plans,"" said Charles Peabody of Portales Partners, recounting his March meeting with Corbat.The Fed's tight control over capital distributions, business plans and interest rates is a challenge for all big U.S. banks today. But Citigroup may be the best example of how the Fed's efforts to make the banking system safer are tying management's hands and frustrating shareholders.Corbat is planning to set out new targets later this year, and people close to him say he knows the pressure is on. Yet he has little choice but to ask for more patience, analysts say. Corbat and his management team have been meeting with analysts and investors for months, explaining Citi's situation.Citigroup needed more than $45 billion in bailouts during the 2007-2009 financial crisis - more than any other bank - and regulators have kept it on a tight leash. That left it lagging its peers in terms of capital returned to shareholders and its share performance.

1032,"   By Ana Isabel Martinez and Corina Pons | MEXICO CITY/CARACAS  MEXICO CITY/CARACAS Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA on Tuesday proposed a bond swap for $7 billion in outstanding debt to lower the financial burden on the cash-strapped company, which is at the center of the OPEC nation's unraveling socialist economy. Reducing the hefty maturity payments due by the end of 2017 could help President Nicolas Maduro's government ease chronic shortages by making more dollars available to import goods ranging from rice to cancer medicine.But investors may remain skeptical that the proposal does not address underlying problems with Venezuela's state-led socialist economy, such as dysfunctional state-run companies, rigid price controls and corruption-riddled currency controls.""We had a peak of debt payments and we're kicking them forward,"" said PDVSA President Eulogio Del Pino in comments broadcast on state television. ""We are seeking financial relief from the payment of these bonds.""Venezuela is reeling under low oil prices and a steady decay of its economic system. Inflation is in the triple digits, the economy is in a deep recession, and citizens routinely spend hours in line search of basic staple products.Investors for months fretted that Venezuela was on its way to default, but have become more optimistic in recent weeks on signs the Maduro government will continue making payments despite adverse circumstances.The swap operation offers a new bond maturing in 2020 in exchange for bonds coming due before 2017, Del Pino said. It will include amortization payments in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. BONDS RISE He added that the bond will be backed by shares in PDVSA's refining unit Citgo, and that ratings agencies had given a ""positive"" evaluation of the new bond.PDVSA's $1 billion 2016 bond comes due in October. The company also faces the $3 billion maturity of the PDVSA 2017 bond in April and two amortization payments of $2 billion each on the PDVSA 2017N bond that must be made at the end of this year and the end of next year. The success of the operation will depend on participation of bondholders.PDVSA's bonds were up across the board, with the PDVSA 2017 up 3.50 points to a bid price of 71.50 and the 2017N bond up 1.55 points to 76.55.Investors consulted by Reuters in recent weeks said they had no formal conversations with PDVSA regarding the operation, which is a common way of gauging market conditions and ensuring bondholders are aware the operation is on its way. Analysts said it was still too early to evaluate the offer given that PDVSA had not provided the full details.Some are concerned about potential political opposition to using Citgo shares. Critics in the opposition, which now controls the National Assembly, argue involving Citgo would constitute a de facto privatization of a state asset that requires parliamentary approval. Del Pino said Citibank would serve as the paying agent on the new bond. Citibank earlier this year informed bondholders that it would not continue serving as paying agent on PDVSA's bonds but agreed to continue operations until the company found a new bank to fill that role.Del Pino said PDVSA struggled to find a trustee bank to coordinate the operation, without saying which bank would lead the swap. Sources in August told Reuters that Credit Suisse was in discussions with PDVSA for such an operation. Wall St. analysts believe Maduro's government is worried a default would leave it isolated from the global financial markets.

1035,"   By Alexander Winning and Katya Golubkova | MOSCOW  MOSCOW U.S. bank Citi (C.N) is seeing business pick up in Russia as the country's economic crisis abates and is staying as engaged as it can given Western sanctions, its Russia head said.Marc Luet, who is also Citi's head for Ukraine and Kazakhstan, said his bank has become busier with Russian mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and that there is growing interest in corporate debt issuance.""We're seeing a pick-up in debt capital markets (DCM). Part of it is liability management, part of it is new issuance,"" Luet said in an interview at the Reuters Russia Investment Summit. Russian debt issuance slowed to a trickle after the United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over the Ukraine conflict. The sanctions limited access to international capital for large Russian banks and certain other businesses, scaring away investors and spooking compliance departments at top banks.""I don't think we're going to quite return to the 2013 level, but we're going to see more issuance than this year. And this year was better than last year,"" Luet said, adding Citi had arranged Russian DCM deals worth more than $15 billion in 2013. Better pricing conditions, an economic stabilisation and the maturity profile of outstanding debt are all encouraging greater issuance, Luet said.A restraining factor is that many Russian companies have cut capital expenditure since the economy entered a deep slump when global oil prices tanked in 2014. A halting economic recovery this year has yet to spur any great increase in investment plans.Luet said that investors had become accustomed to the sanctions and that banks had established which deals they could handle and which they should leave alone.""We're going to stay as engaged as we can and take advantage of any opportunities that arise,"" he said. Like many other global banks, Citi did not help the Russian state with this year's privatization program, including a stake sale in diamond miner Alrosa (ALRS.MM). Alrosa is not under Western sanctions but the deal was handled by a Russian investment bank.""We didn't stay away from the Russian government's privatization program per se,"" Luet said. ""Every case is different, every transaction is different. It's not a blanket approach. We look at what's coming up.""Citi's Russian operation earned about 14.55 billion roubles ($225 million) in profit last year, roughly double what it made in 2014 and better than many domestic Russian banks. Luet said that Citi had stuck to its tactic of serving multinationals and large Russian blue-chip companies as well as affluent retail clients.""We haven't changed our strategy because of the crisis,"" he said.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits (Additional reporting by Kira Zavyalova, Christian Lowe and Dmitry Antonov; Editing by David Goodman)",2016-09-13,C,"Tue Sep 13, 2016 | 10:11am EDT",REUTERS SUMMIT-Citi sees Russia business pick up as crisis abates,http://www.reuters.com//article/russia-citigroup-idUSL8N1BP1OY?type=companyNews

1042,"   By Olivia Oran and David Henry  For Citigroup Inc (C.N) executives, being asked why they won't sell their Mexican bank subsidiary Banamex is as annoying as the yapping of a Chihuahua. But the question keeps coming up. In some of the first signs of how some investors in Corporate America are bracing for a President Donald Trump, several large investors have expressed concern to Citi management in recent private meetings about the impact a victory for the Republican might have on the Mexican unit, according to people who attended or were briefed on the meetings.Even if Trump did not follow through on his pledge to build a massive border wall, some investors voiced concern that his presidency would undermine cross-border trade and travel, and in turn hurt the Mexican economy and Banamex profits, the sources added, asking not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak with the media.Trump is not the main reason investors are asking about divesting Banamex, nor is the idea a new one. But his talk of building a wall has renewed questions at a time when Citigroup stock continues to trade at a 25 percent discount to its tangible net worth. The stock is so low because investors doubt Citigroup's ability to boost its returns on equity any time soon.Trump, who has reduced the lead held by Democrat Hillary Clinton in recent polls ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, has vowed to make Mexico fund the construction of a giant border wall to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S. He has also pledged to change North American trade agreements and impose higher tariffs on Mexican goods to bring jobs back.At an investor conference on Wednesday, Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach was asked why he was so positive on Banamex. The question was similar to one asked in July by CLSA analyst Mike Mayo, who has been urging Citigroup to sell Banamex for years.Mayo told Reuters his rationale is ""to unleash trapped value."" He wants Citigroup to use Banamex sale proceeds to buy back its cheap stock, which would make the remaining shares more valuable, and attract more interest from investors.""It would make crystal clear the absurdity of Citigroup stock trading at three-fourths of tangible book,"" Mayo said. He said Citi could see a gain of $5 billion to $10 billion through a sale.Regardless of Trump, Citi CEO Mike Corbat has more reasons now than even two years ago to keep Banamex, people familiar with his thinking say. For one, Banamex earns about 15 percent return on shareholder equity - significantly better than Corbat's goal of at least 10 percent.In addition, Banamex contributes about 15 percent of Citigroup's global consumer revenue, which makes Mexico second only to the United States in importance. It has the most branches, with about 1,500 compared with 700 locations in the U.S., where much of Citigroup consumer business is in cards. Corbat has overseen the disposal of half of Citigroup's country-based consumer franchises, bringing the total down to 19. Banamex was deemed the only one in Latin America strong enough to keep.Banamex is the second-biggest bank in Mexico, which Corbat expects will grow with the U.S. economy. He expects trade with Mexico to continue to be robust regardless of whether Trump wins. IMPROVEMENTS SEEN Citigroup is starting to see improvements at Banamex following management changes in 2014 and Corbat's commitment then to invest $1.5 billion in its operations. Corbat announced the investment on a podium with the president of Mexico.The management changes followed discovery of more than $500 million of fraudulent loans that Banamex made to a Mexican oilfield services company, as well as U.S. government investigations of money laundering at Banamex offices in the U.S. Citigroup paid $140 million to settle federal regulators' probes into the money laundering matter, but a criminal investigation has yet to be publicly resolved.Corbat has since won approval from U.S. regulators for two capital plans and an endorsement of its so-called ""living will,"" showing how the company could be wound down without taking other banks with it. The approvals imply that regulators have found Citigroup's risk management of Banamex acceptable. ""It's accretive to our shareholders, the returns are solid,"" Corbat said in July. ""So right now I really don't see it's an area where we would contemplate selling.""Corbat doubts that Citigroup could quickly gather proceeds from selling Banamex and then win permission from the U.S. Federal Reserve to use the money to buy back stock, said a person familiar with his thinking.Even without a Banamex sale, Citigroup has been building up excess capital that it expects the Fed will allow it to use for additional buybacks.In a March report, KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl argued that Citi should divest Banamex's consumer and small business franchise. It does not fit into Citi's consumer strategy in other emerging markets where it focuses on customers in high-growth metropolitan areas, he said.An outright sale, Kleinhanzl wrote, could be difficult because the pool of potential buyers is small. But Citigroup could sell that portion of Banamex to investors through an IPO, commanding an $11.8 billion price tag, resulting in a $5.9 billion pre-tax gain for Citi, he estimated.The Fed, in Mayo's view, set a precedent for Corbat to distribute Banamex proceeds, when it approved buybacks by KeyCorp (KEY.N) following the sale of an asset management business.

1045,"  VENICE, Italy Mediobanca, JP Morgan and Citi are arranging a bridge loan needed for a 28 billion euro ($31 billion) bad loan sale which is part of an emergency rescue plan at Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), the chief executive of Quaestio Asset Management said.Quaestio runs Atlante, the bank rescue fund that has agreed to buy the so-called mezzanine tranche in Monte dei Paschi's bad loan securitization -- a transaction in which loans are repackaged as debt securities.The senior tranche in the deal will be initially financed by a bridge loan until the notes - which carry a state guarantee that takes some time to arrange - are sold to investors. The loan will allow the securitization vehicle to buy the loans from Monte dei Paschi before that.

TUI has asked Citigroup (C.N) to find a buyer for Travelopia, which comprises over 50 brands offering specialist luxury, adventure and education holidays, people close to the matter told Reuters. TUI confirmed the mandate, while Citi declined to comment. The auction, in which the business will be marketed to private equity groups as well as some other specialist travel groups, is set to start in the coming weeks, the people added. TUI previously said it planned to start marketing Travelopia in the autumn and the unit's head was quoted last week by Travel Weekly as saying he hoped to close a deal in early 2017. The unit has annual revenue of 1.5 billion euros and earnings before interest, tax and amortization of 48 million euros. TUI is expected to ask for bids valuing the business at 10-12 times forecast core earnings of about 50 million euros, the people said. The sale of luxury travel specialist Scott Dunn to private equity company Inflexion in 2015 reportedly achieved a price multiple of 12.5 to 13 times.  Travelopia contains brands such as Hayes & Jarvis, which focuses on luxury holidays, adventure company Exodus and polar expeditions company Quark.TUI Group CEO Fritz Joussen has said the group is selling because the specialist brands don't use the TUI brand, IT, hotels, cruise ships or planes, meaning the opportunities for mutual savings and benefits are limited. However, TUI will keep hold of the Crystal Ski and Thomson Lakes & Mountains brands, which help to fill its planes in the winter season.  Earlier this year, TUI agreed to sell its Hotelbeds unit, which sells hotels rooms to wholesale customers such as travel agencies and tour operators, to private equity group Cinven [CINV.UL] and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) in a deal worth 1.17 billion euros.

1052,"   By Julie  Zhu and Elzio Barreto | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Lufax, China's biggest peer-to-peer lending platform backed by Ping An Insurance (2318.HK)(601318.SS), is in talks with four investment banks about taking leading roles in its planned Hong Kong IPO, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The initial public offering could raise $5 billion, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported previously .CITIC Securities (600030.SS) (6030.HK), Citigroup (C.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have started preparatory work, although no formal mandate has been awarded, the people said.The timing and size of the IPO are still undetermined, but the four banks are likely to land the key sponsor roles for the deal, they said, declining to be identified as the information has not been officially disclosed.Lufax, valued at $18.5 billion in a January fundraising, would be the first peer-to-peer (P2P) platform to list in Hong Kong. The IPO comes at a time of surging growth in P2P lending  and will test investor appetite for a new breed of companies that threaten to disrupt the traditional financial industry.Lufax and Ping An declined to comment. CITIC CLSA, the Hong Kong investment banking unit of CITIC Securities, Citigroup and JPMorgan also declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not offer an immediate response.Peer-to-peer platforms help link up individual or institutional investors looking to invest their cash with borrowers including small- and medium-enterprises, students and other individuals that need funding.Those companies are part of a booming financial technology (fintech) industry in China that hopes to offer a young and increasingly affluent population speedy and easy-to-use services on their mobile phones. The volume of Chinese P2P loans stood at 680.3 billion yuan ($102 billion) at the end of August, more than 20 times levels seen in January 2014, according to industry data provider Wangdaizhijia.That could swell to 880 billion yuan by the end of 2016 and to 1.5 trillion yuan by the end of 2018, according to estimates from Nomura.But P2P lending has also drawn much scrutiny from regulators. Seeking to head off rising risks in the market, Chinese authorities implemented aggressive steps including requiring borrowing limits and the use of third-party banks as custodians of investor funds in P2P platforms.The measures will probably leave China with 200-300 P2P players by this time next year from more than 4,000 now, Lufax CFO James Zheng said in late August.Lufax had over 23.3 million users at end-June, Ping An said in its first-half earnings report, more than double a year earlier. Trading volumes totalled 3.2 trillion yuan ($480 billion) over the same period, compared with 512 million yuan in the first half of 2015.($1 = 6.6693 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Julie Zhu and Elzio Barreto; Editing by Denny Thomas and Edwina Gibbs)",2016-09-23,C,"Fri Sep 23, 2016 | 5:08am EDT",China's largest P2P lender Lufax taps four banks for Hong Kong IPO: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ping-an-ins-lufax-ipo-idUSKCN11T0TB?type=companyNews

1061,"  * Caprotti in talks with private equity funds over possible sale* Group valued at up to 6 billion euros* Ill health, dispute with two children could complicate saleBy Silvia Aloisi, Claudia Cristoferi and Elisa AnzolinMILAN, Sept 30 Having worked all his life to build Italy's fourth biggest supermarket chain and protect it from rivals, 90-year-old Bernardo Caprotti spent the past few months fighting to make sure his brand will thrive without him.The billionaire, working from his three-storey, heavily guarded home in central Milan, has been in talks with private equity funds to sell his Esselunga chain for as much as 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion), people close to the matter said.Wary of selling out to rivals or handing the business down to his squabbling children, Caprotti wants the private equity bidders to give a rare promise: keep the Esselunga brand and the business for the long term, up to 10 years, the sources said.""Any deal would have to guarantee the continuity of the business and avoid a break-up,"" said one source. ""All he cares about is the good of the company.""An Esselunga spokesman declined to comment on the status of any sale talks, which sources say include CVC Capital Partners, Blackstone and BC Partners. Spokesmen for the three declined to comment.Caprotti founded the company in 1957 with his brothers and U.S. businessman Nelson Rockefeller, developing the first U.S.-style supermarket chain in Italy, before becoming its sole owner. It now employs 22,000 people and last year had sales topping 7 billion euros.Over the years, Caprotti spurned approaches from several competitors including U.S. giant Wal Mart and Belgium's Delhaize, so it came as a surprise for the Italian business community when it emerged this month that he had hired an adviser, Citigroup, to look at potential bids.As often happens in a country where a fifth of major family-owned firms are run by someone in their 70s, events can conspire quickly against elderly entrepreneurs struggling in the twilight of life to pull off a deal that will safeguard their legacy. In the case of Caprotti, a sharp-tongued workaholic who sports a reinforced Esselunga yellow plastic bag as his briefcase, ill health could complicate matters.In recent days, Caprotti has taken gravely ill, said two people close to the situation. Until then, he had been actively working from his home, close to Milan's La Scala opera house.""Caprotti has personally followed the negotiations up until now, even though his health is not good,"" another source said.FAMILY FALLOUT Caprotti stepped down as Esselunga chairman in 2011, left all executive roles in 2013 and has not been seen at Esselunga's headquarters on the outskirts of Milan for the past year. But he has remained involved in day-to-day management and     no major decision is taken without his blessing, sources said.""If you send him an sms, he will reply in a nanosecond,"" said a person who works with him.A deal is uncertain, complicated not only by Caprotti's poor health but also by a bitter legal dispute between him and two of his three children over ownership of the group.A person familiar with Caprotti's thinking said he wanted to ensure the Esselunga business, Italy's most profitable supermarket chain, did not become the battleground of potentially squabbling heirs.His 55-year-old son Giuseppe, who climbed the ranks to become chief executive in 2002, was stripped of his powers in 2004 and left the group in 2005. He and his sister Violetta later took legal action against their father, alleging he had illegally taken shares from a trust in their name in 2011.So far the courts have sided with the father, though a final appeal is pending. Caprotti's other daughter from his second marriage, Marina, sits on the board of Esselunga.Giuseppe Caprotti told Reuters he has always opposed a sale of Esselunga but did not want to comment further on the issue.  Under Italian law, he and Violetta could claim around 33 percent of their father's estate upon his death. By law, the father cannot disinherit them.DOOR CLOSED TO RIVALS Bernardo Caprotti refuses to sell out to rivals, fearing the chain would vanish overnight.He has long accused its Coop rivals of blocking his group's expansion out of its northern stronghold, thanks to their links to centre-left politicians, a charge the Coop businesses firmly reject. Esselunga has only just set up its first superstore in the capital, Rome, expected to open next month.Caprotti is viscerally attached to the company, having built it from scratch to post sales of 7.3 billion euros in 2015, a rise of 4.3 percent, a growth rate nearly double the sector average.According to a study by Mediobanca, Esselunga's revenue per square metre is more than three times that of rivals Carrefour and Auchan in Italy, and more than twice that of the dominant player in the country - the ""Coop"" or cooperative supermarkets.However Caprotti has his critics.He runs the group like a family patriarch and has not groomed a successor among its managers, according to three former senior company officials who say they quit out of frustration that they could only do things his way.""It's a cultural problem. In Italy a company is seen as an extension of its founder, not as a separate entity,"" said Guido Corbetta, a professor at Milan's Bocconi University and an expert on family owned businesses.

1066,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Supreme Court is set to consider this week a closely watched insider trading case that could limit the ability of prosecutors to pursue such charges against hedge fund managers and other traders.The eight justices, who open their 2016-17 term on Monday, will hear arguments on Wednesday in the case of an Illinois man, Bassam Salman, who prosecutors said made nearly $1.2 million trading on inside information about mergers involving clients of Citigroup Inc(C.N), where his brother-in-law worked.It is the first time in two decades that the Supreme Court has taken up a case involving insider trading, a crime that the U.S. Congress has never defined and has left the courts and the Securities and Exchange Commission to shape.Salman was convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud charges arising from insider trading and sentenced in 2014 to three years in prison.At issue in Salman's appeal is whether the government in insider trading cases must prove that an alleged source of corporate secrets like the brother-in-law received a tangible benefit like cash in exchange for any tips.Lawyers and prosecutors say that requiring such proof would make it harder for authorities to pursue insider trading cases, potentially preventing prosecutions in which corporate executives tip friends or relatives without any tangible quid pro quo.""This will be a court decision that could have significant  ramifications on if tipping cases can continue to be brought with the fervor they have been brought in the last decade,"" said David Miller, a defense lawyer at the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.The appeal follows ramped-up efforts by U.S. authorities to crack down on insider trading, with the SEC announcing charges against more than 550 people in the past six years. A wave of insider trading cases brought by Manhattan federal prosecutors, meanwhile, resulted in Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam's conviction in 2011 and a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP.But in December 2014, a federal appeals court in New York dealt prosecutors a major blow by overturning the conviction of two hedge fund managers, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, and narrowing authorities' ability to pursue such cases.The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that to be convicted, a trader must know that the source received a benefit in exchange, and that such a benefit was ""at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature."" DROPPING CHARGES The ruling forced prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to drop charges against 12 other defendants, out of 107 people charged under his watch since 2009.While the Supreme Court in October 2015 declined to review the case, the justices in January agreed to review a similar one, Salman's case, in which a federal appeals court in California had issued a potentially conflicting ruling.Salman argued that his trading was not illegal as no proof existed that his brother-in-law, in tipping a family member who in turn tipped Salman, received anything beneficial in exchange. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument, saying that requiring a tangible benefit in such a circumstance would allow insiders to tip their relatives so long as they got nothing in exchange.Prosecutors are hoping the Supreme Court adopts the 9th Circuit's view and rejects the 2nd Circuit's narrow interpretation, which authorities said could result in some people avoiding charges and could affect investigations.For example, hedge fund investor Leon Cooperman, who the SEC sued last month for insider trading, has said that federal prosecutors in New Jersey have informed him that they are holding off on pursuing criminal charges until the Supreme Court rules.Many defense lawyers say that what Wall Street is looking for is a ruling clearly defining what conduct violates the law.""I do think clarity is particularly important in this context, and right now there is a lack of clarity,"" said Stephen Ascher, a lawyer at Jenner & Block who backs a broad definition. ""The Supreme Court has the opportunity now to clean that up.""

1070,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Supreme Court is set to consider this week a closely watched insider trading case that could limit the ability of prosecutors to pursue such charges against hedge fund managers and other traders.The eight justices, who open their 2016-17 term on Monday, will hear arguments on Wednesday in the case of an Illinois man, Bassam Salman, who prosecutors said made nearly $1.2 million trading on inside information about mergers involving clients of Citigroup Inc, where his brother-in-law worked.It is the first time in two decades that the Supreme Court has taken up a case involving insider trading, a crime that the U.S. Congress has never defined and has left the courts and the Securities and Exchange Commission to shape.Salman was convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud charges arising from insider trading and sentenced in 2014 to three years in prison.At issue in Salman's appeal is whether the government in insider trading cases must prove that an alleged source of corporate secrets like the brother-in-law received a tangible benefit like cash in exchange for any tips.Lawyers and prosecutors say that requiring such proof would make it harder for authorities to pursue insider trading cases, potentially preventing prosecutions in which corporate executives tip friends or relatives without any tangible quid pro quo.""This will be a court decision that could have significant  ramifications on if tipping cases can continue to be brought with the fervor they have been brought in the last decade,"" said David Miller, a defense lawyer at the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.The appeal follows ramped-up efforts by U.S. authorities to crack down on insider trading, with the SEC announcing charges against more than 550 people in the past six years. A wave of insider trading cases brought by Manhattan federal prosecutors, meanwhile, resulted in Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam's conviction in 2011 and a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP.But in December 2014, a federal appeals court in New York dealt prosecutors a major blow by overturning the conviction of two hedge fund managers, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, and narrowing authorities' ability to pursue such cases.The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that to be convicted, a trader must know that the source received a benefit in exchange, and that such a benefit was ""at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature."" DROPPING CHARGES The ruling forced prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to drop charges against 12 other defendants, out of 107 people charged under his watch since 2009.While the Supreme Court in October 2015 declined to review the case, the justices in January agreed to review a similar one, Salman's case, in which a federal appeals court in California had issued a potentially conflicting ruling.Salman argued that his trading was not illegal as no proof existed that his brother-in-law, in tipping a family member who in turn tipped Salman, received anything beneficial in exchange. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument, saying that requiring a tangible benefit in such a circumstance would allow insiders to tip their relatives so long as they got nothing in exchange.Prosecutors are hoping the Supreme Court adopts the 9th Circuit's view and rejects the 2nd Circuit's narrow interpretation, which authorities said could result in some people avoiding charges and could affect investigations.For example, hedge fund investor Leon Cooperman, who the SEC sued last month for insider trading, has said that federal prosecutors in New Jersey have informed him that they are holding off on pursuing criminal charges until the Supreme Court rules.Many defense lawyers say that what Wall Street is looking for is a ruling clearly defining what conduct violates the law.""I do think clarity is particularly important in this context, and right now there is a lack of clarity,"" said Stephen Ascher, a lawyer at Jenner & Block who backs a broad definition. ""The Supreme Court has the opportunity now to clean that up.""",2016-10-03,C,"Mon Oct 3, 2016 | 7:27am EDT",U.S. Supreme Court to weigh reach of insider trading law,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-court-insidertrading-idUSL2N1C90DS?type=companyNews
1071,"   By David Henry  Citigroup Inc (C.N) is investing another $1 billion in its Mexican bank and renaming it Citibanamex in the strongest signal from management that the business is worth keeping for the long run.New York-based Citigroup said on Tuesday that the investments will be completed by 2020 and will improve digital tools, ATMs and branches.The new funds come in addition to Citi's 2014 commitment to invest $1.5 billion in the business, formerly known as Banco Nacional De México, or Banamex.""These investments in Citibanamex reaffirm our commitment to Mexico and our confidence in its prospects,"" Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat said in the announcement.Corbat's decision is a rebuttal to calls by some investors and stock analysts for Citigroup to consider selling Banamex. Some large Citigroup investors have privately questioned the wisdom of keeping Banamex after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has roused sentiment for restrictions on trade and travel with Mexico that could hurt the economy there. Banamex contributes about 15 percent of Citigroup's global consumer revenue, which makes Mexico second only to the United States in importance. It also earns about 15 percent return on shareholder equity, significantly better than Corbat's goal of at least 10 percent for the whole bank.Citigroup said the investments will be directed to five areas: digital banking, information technology, branches and ATMs. It will add 2,500 new ATMs to the 7,500 it has now.The bank has more branch offices in Mexico than in any other country, with 1,500, compared with 700 locations in the U.S. Citigroup shares were up 2.4 percent at $48.17 in early afternoon trading.Corbat has made allegiance to Banamex a hallmark of this four-year tenure as chief executive. In 2014 he went to Mexico City to pledge support for the unit to the president of the country. He also oversaw executive changes and new controls following the discovery of more than $500 million of fraudulent loans to an oilfield services company.Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has long urged Citigroup to sell Mexico, said a sale is now off the table, at least for the short-term.The new investment will add value, Mayo said. ""The question is whether a sale and redeployment of the proceeds into stock buybacks and having a more simple structure would be even better,"" he said.

1072,"   By Jillian Harding  Over the last six years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged over 550 people with insider trading, including high profile fund managers such as Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam, SAC Capital’s Steve Cohen, and recently Omega Adviser’s Leon Cooperman.For most of the 52 percent of Americans who invest in the stock market, it probably seems obvious how to avoid being charged for illegal insider trading: Don’t trade on non-public information passed to you by someone inside or close to the company.It may also seem equally obvious on how the connect the dots to find the bad guys. Not quite. It turns out there’s a gray area when it comes to ""tippees"" — those people who use information passed to them in what amounts to a high stakes game of telephone.      In the case currently in front of the Supreme Court, that is exactly the issue at hand. Prosecutors say Bassam Salman made nearly $1.2 million trading on inside information about mergers involving clients of Citigroup. He then compensated his brother-in-law, a Citi employee, for passing along the secrets that led to the profits.Like Salman’s case, many insider trading charges revolve around merger and acquisition announcements. It is during those times when a company’s stock is likely to rise more than usual and offer enormous gains to investors who buy or sell at the right time.  That said, the benefit to the sources of this info, is still up for debate. In late September, Cooperman sent his clients a letter, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, which said prosecutors halted their investigation pending a decision in the Salman case.  For this decision, however, Wall Street will have to wait. The Court is not likely to announce a decision until next year.",2016-10-04,C,"Tue Oct 4, 2016 | 11:26am EDT",Data Dive: Who are the insiders in insider trading?,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-datadive-insidertrading-idUSKCN1241QT?type=companyNews

1079,"   By Barani Krishnan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK OPEC is back in the business of influencing oil prices as Saudi Arabia works with Russia and Iran to limit output, and only ""a brave person"" would bet against this, oil bull Andy Hall said in his latest investor letter.The hedge fund manager is up nearly 18 percent for the year at his $2.5 billion Astenbeck Capital Management in Southport, Connecticut, after his fund rose 6 percent in September as oil rallied.With the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries now looking to limit output for the first time since 2008, the cartel can no longer be ignored, he said in Astenbeck's October investor letter, seen by Reuters on Friday.OPEC declined to cut output two years ago after oil breached $100 a barrel, instead letting the biggest oil market collapse in a generation happen as the price plunged. ""Now Saudi Arabia has declared it wants higher prices and is working with the rest of OPEC - and quite possibly Russia - to achieve them by curbing production,"" he said, adding that this included Saudi arch rival Iran. ""It's a brave person who bets against this combination of factors."" Hall's remarks come as OPEC officials embark on an unusual flurry of meetings in the next six weeks to nail down details of the Algiers deal.Oil prices settled down 1 percent on Friday after hitting June highs above $50 this week. Prior to that, they jumped as much as 15 percent over a week after OPEC announced its planned cuts on Sept. 28. [O/R]Still, the market is trading at just half of the mid-2014 high above $100. Astenbeck did not return an email seeking comment.OPEC hopes to bring its output to 32.5 million to 33 million barrels per day, cutting about 700,000 bpd from a global glut estimated by analysts at 1.0 million to 1.5 million bpd. The amount that each member cuts would be decided at the group's policy meeting in Vienna in Nov. 30, it said.Many analysts are skeptical of OPEC's pledge as it has been maxing out production whenever possible. ""Quibbling over whether Angola will honor a commitment to cut its production by a few tens of thousands of barrels per day is really not the issue,"" Hall wrote, adding that the output of most OPEC members has possibly peaked in recent years.What mattered was the cartel saying it ""was back in business ... planning to once again control its collective production, which still accounts for a third of global oil production and the majority of oil exports,"" he said.Hall is best known for earning a $100 million trading bonus from Citigroup by correctly calling oil's first move above $100 before the financial crisis. He has not done as well at Astenbeck, which he officially launched in 2009. He posted a 36 percent loss last year, his worst, by underestimating the potent supply from U.S. shale oil.

1080,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Bruno Federowski | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Itaú Unibanco Holding SA agreed on Saturday to pay 710 million reais ($220 million) for the retail banking assets of Citigroup Inc (C.N) in Brazil, further cementing the leadership of Latin America's No. 1 bank by market value among wealthy clients in the country.In a securities filing, Itaú (ITUB4.SA) said the deal included 100 percent of Banco Citibank SA's retail banking and insurance assets, and Citigroup's stakes in automated teller machine operator TecBan Tecnologia Bancaria SA and Cia Brasileira de Securitização SA, a consumer structured finance firm.The transaction requires regulatory approval, the filing said. According to the filing, the transaction will also involve the restructuring of some unnamed Banco Citibank units that will be eventually spun off and integrated into Itaú's platform.Citigroup struggled in Brazil as local lenders gobbled up market share over the past decade and now control 90 percent of the country's banking assets. For lenders like Itaú, tapping wealthy retail banking clients is key as they seek to increase the share of fee-related income and money management activities on profit.Two people with knowledge of the deal told Reuters recently that Itaú could pay as much as $300 million for the money-losing unit. The people said Itaú trumped Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA) in the race for Banco Citibank, whose parent is also in the process of exiting Argentina and Colombia. Press representatives for Itaú, Santander Brasil and Citigroup could not be immediately reached for comment. Citigroup had previously announced that it will maintain a corporate and investment banking unit in the country.Citigroup struggled in Brazil as Itaú and large local rivals gobbled up market share over the past decade - currently, six banks control 90 percent of the country's banking assets. For Itaú, tapping wealthy retail banking clients is key to enhancing the share of fee-related income on profit.According to the filing, the acquisition of Banco Citibank and the 5.64 percent and 3.6 percent stakes in TecBan and Cibrasec, respectively, will not impact financial results this year. The deal allows Itaú to increase assets to 1.404 trillion reais, making it Brazil's second-largest lender. Minimum capital regulatory ratio readings at Itaú will fall by 0.4 percentage points, the filing said.Banco Citibank has about 71 branches across some of Brazil's largest cities, 315,000 clients and 35 billion reais in deposits and assets under management.The U.S. bank, built with a series of acquisitions dating back to the 1980s, has been trying to slim down since the financial crisis to be as profitable as its rivals. Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat counted at least 21 markets with exceptionally low returns on assets and substandard operating efficiency as candidates for restructuring. Citigroup has had to resort to aggressive cost controls as near-zero interest rates, a slump in oil prices and slowing global growth have hurt business.($1 = 3.2210 reais) (Additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer in São Paulo; Editing by Mark Heinrich)",2016-10-08,C,"Sat Oct 8, 2016 | 8:47am EDT",UPDATE 1-Itaú to pay $220 mln for Citigroup's Brazil assets,http://www.reuters.com//article/citibank-brasil-ma-itau-unibco-hldg-idUSL2N1CE09H?type=companyNews

His co-head will be Bill Young, who has been with Credit Suisse since 2005 and is based in New York, the memo said.

1089,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK/SANTIAGO, October 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings sees no impact on  Argentina's Banco Santander Rio's (Santander Rio) ratings after it announced on  Oct. 10, 2016 an agreement to acquire Citibank Argentina's consumer finance  business. With this acquisition, Santander Rio will consolidate its position as the  largest private sector bank in Argentina. The acquired operations include  roughly ARS10.600 million in loans, ARS16.200 in deposits, 500.000 retail  clients and 70 branches. At June 30, 2016, Santander Rio had ARS94,015 million  in total gross loans, ARS118,437 million in customer deposits, 2.7 million  clients and 401 branches. Once the transaction is approved by the relevant regulators and is closed,  Santander Rio will assume control of Citi's retail portfolio. While the details  of the transaction have not been made public, based on Santander Rio and  internal calculations, Fitch estimates that the impact of this transaction on  the bank's capital will be manageable, and overall profitability should not be  overly affected.  Assuming the bank maintains its loan growth and good earnings generation, the  bank estimates an overall impact on its Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio of around  150bp at the time of the approval of the deal, assuming this takes place in  1H2017. Given the bank's current FCC of 12.1% at June 30, 2016, in Fitch's  opinion, the bank's capitalization will still be adequate for its rating level.  The transaction and should therefore not affect the bank's ratings. Fitch will  nevertheless continue to monitor the bank and its performance to verify that it  continues to evolve within the agency's base case scenario. Fitch currently rates Santander Rio as follows: -- Long-Term Local Currency Issuer Default Rating 'B'; Outlook Stable; --Viability Rating 'b'; --Support Rating '5'.

1090,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 14 (Fitch) Citigroup (Citi) has reported a 0.83% return on  assets (ROA) in the third quarter of 2016 (3Q'16), results which are lower on a  sequential basis and from those reported a year ago, according to Fitch Ratings.  Quarterly earnings included higher provision expenses on both a linked-quarter  and year-ago basis and lower reported revenues from a year ago, which was  partially offset by higher core revenues and well-controlled operating expenses. The year-ago comparisons included two non-recurring items, a gain on a sale of  merchant acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of prime brokerage  valuation adjustment. Excluding these two items, Citicorp revenues improved 2.4%  from a year ago. Quarterly revenue comparisons were not impacted by any one-time  gains and improved 1% on a linked-quarter basis in Citicorp.  Citi recently announced the sales of its retail operations in Argentina and  Brazil reflecting the company's ongoing strategy of shifting resources to higher  returning areas. During the quarter, Citi announced it plans to invest more than  $1 billion in its Mexican business, which was rebranded as Citibanamex.  In terms of North America Consumer Banking, net income declined on both a  linked-quarter and year-ago basis. While the quarter's results reflected a full  quarter's impact of the Costco portfolio, which was acquired on June 17, it also  included higher provision and operating expenses, partially offset by higher  revenues. Citi noted that the Costco loan portfolio had grown to over $14  billion at quarter-end, up from approximately $10.6 billion at acquisition.  A third of the loan loss reserve build was attributed to Costco given that the  loans came over with no loan loss reserves, while another third reflected CFPB  guidance on third party collections. The remaining reserve build was attributed  to portfolio growth. While provision expenses increased 32% on a sequential  basis, net charge-offs improved 3% in nominal terms.  In Branded Cards, net credit losses declined to 225bps. However, excluding  Costco, which did not incur any losses in 3Q16, the NCO rate in Branded was  approximately 280bps year-to-date. Citi expects this to be the run-rate for NCOs  in 2017. For Retail Services, loan losses tend to be higher and were 410bps  year-to-date. Citi expects them to modestly deteriorate in 2017, up to 435bps  for the year, primarily reflecting seasoning and the aforementioned regulatory  guidance.  Citi also disclosed that higher operating expenses were primarily driven by the  addition of Costco, volume growth, and continued marketing investments.  Citi continues to reshape its retail banking footprint, focusing on its core six  urban markets. The bank has begun to invest in additional growth, with improving  digital and mobile capabilities, and additional dedicated CitiGold centers.  With regard to International Global Consumer Banking, net income improved 1% on  a linked-quarter basis, but fell 15% from the prior year, in constant dollars.  Year-ago comparisons include the aforementioned impact of the sale of Citi's  merchant acquiring business. Excluding this, revenues would have improved both  from a year ago and a quarter ago. Similar to North America Consumer Banking,  Citi reported loan loss reserve building Latin America.  In terms of the Institutional segment, fixed income revenues improved 35% from a  year ago reflecting strength in both rates and currencies and spread products.  This was partially offset by a decline of 34% from a year ago in Equity Markets  (down 23% when excluding a prime finance adjustment reversal last year) due to  lower client activity and by strong performance in Asia last year. Citi also  reported continued progress in Banking, with solid performance in Investment  Banking and Treasury & Trade Solutions.  With regard to credit, non-accrual balances declined 3% on a linked-quarter  basis with improvements in both consumer and commercial. Early stage and late  stage day delinquencies increased in nominal and percentage terms on a  linked-quarter basis.  In terms of Citi's exposure to energy in ICG, Citi reported a reduction in both  funded and total exposure, with a still relatively high 74% of exposures rated  investment grade.  Citi's capital ratios continue to remain very good and generally above global  peers. The company's estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III on a fully  phased-in basis increased again to an estimated 12.6%. The approximate 10 bps  improvement from last quarter was due primarily to net income.

1091,"   By David Henry and Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank.Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm.""We're prepared for things to get worse before they get better,"" Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank's veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal.Revelations that Wells' branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank's folksy image.Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply.New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month.Wells Fargo's staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan's presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future."" The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders.On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio's decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers' attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight.JPMORGAN MOMENTUM CONTINUES While Wells Fargo's overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms.Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations.JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs.""The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far,"" she told journalists.JPMorgan's after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts' estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent.While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion.The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week. Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P financial index .SPSY gained 0.85 percent.The British government's tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe.""As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe,"" JPMorgan's Lake said.

Bank of America  was the top influence on the S&P, while Goldman Sachs  had a similar impact on the Dow.The two banks are scheduled to report results along with Morgan Stanley next week. While earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 0.7 percent, marking the fifth straight quarter of decline, some investors hope that enough companies will beat analysts' expectations for the index to end the season with a slight gain.The early part of the earnings season is dominated by financials and the positives from the sector set the tone for the rest of the period, said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group of U.S. Bank.The KBW Bank index rose 0.6 percent, snapping a three-day losing streak.Investors are also awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at noon in Boston, where she is likely to offer more insight into the growing sentiment among policymakers to raise interest rates relatively soon. Sustained growth in the labor market and improving inflation have encouraged Fed officials such as Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, who told CNBC on Friday that the ""very high"" odds for a rate increase in December was appropriate.""We don't expect a departure from the script which was laid out at the minutes of the September meeting and expect the Fed to continue moving on a path towards a December rate hike,"" Northey said.At 11:05 a.m. ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 114.88 points, or 0.63 percent, at 18,213.82.

1093,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Long- and Short-Term  Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'A'/'F1' to Citigroup Global Markets Funding  Luxembourg (CGMFL) reflecting Citigroup Inc.'s ability and propensity to support  CGMFL.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs CGMFL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Limited (CGML),  rated 'A'/'F1' by Fitch. CGML is Citigroup's primary international broker-dealer  in the UK, headquartered in London. CGML operates globally, generating the  majority of its business in the EMEA region, with the remainder coming from Asia  and the Americas. CGML is designated a Material Legal Entity in the Citigroup's  Resolution Plan.  CGMFL is primarily a funding vehicle for CGML, issuing only structured notes and  warrants to non-U.S. investors. CGFML's notes and warrants, which may be  principal or non-principal-protected, are guaranteed by CGML. These securities  cannot be sold to U.S. persons in the U.S.  Given the parent's ability and propensity to support CGMFL, Fitch has equalized  the ratings with the parent. Fitch views any required support that may be needed  would be immaterial relative to the ability of the parent to provide it. CGMFL  is the only structured note issuer of CGML, and accounts for only approximately  1.5% of total funding for Citigroup. Further, Fitch believes that a potential  default by this entity would constitute huge reputational risk to the parent.  Lastly, Fitch believes there is a high level of management and operational  integration that provides support for equalizing the rating with CGML.  CGMFL's Positive Rating Outlook is in line with its parent's Rating Outlook. The  Outlook on CGML, a Material Legal Entity under Citigroup's Resolution Plan,  reflects the likelihood of internal total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) as  required by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The Positive Outlook reflects  the agency's belief that the internal TLAC of material international operating  companies will likely be large enough to meet and exceed Pillar 1 capital  requirements and will then be sufficient to recapitalize them. A one notch  upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient clarity on additional disclosure on  the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its sufficiency in size to cover a  default of senior operating company liabilities. Sufficient clarity may,  however, take longer to come through than the typical outlook horizon of one to  two years. SENIOR DEBT The market-linked debt rating is driven by the guarantee from CGML, and  therefore equalized with CGML's IDR.  Fitch only rates principal-protected notes, which solely addresses the credit  risk of the issuer or guarantor, in this case, CGML. Fitch appends a subscript  (emr) to its market-linked note ratings to highlight the variability of the  coupon created by the embedded market risk and is excluded from the rating  assigned to the note.  Fitch would not assign ratings to non-principal protected notes that are issued  out of CGMFL. Non-principal protected notes are subject to the lack of repayment  of principal at maturity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs CGMFL's ratings would be sensitive to changes in Fitch's view of the relative  importance of this entity to CGML or Citigroup, Inc. The ratings may also be  impacted by changes in the IDRs of CGML. Further, if CGMFL were to issue any  non-guaranteed securities, Fitch may consider notching the rating down from  CGML.  If CGML's Rating Outlook is revised to Stable, there would be no impact to  CGMFL's IDRs; however, its Rating Outlook would also be similarly revised to  Stable.  SENIOR DEBT The market-linked senior debt rating would be sensitive to any changes in CGML's  ratings and/or any changes in the Deed of Guarantee provided by the parent.  Further, if debt is issued by CGMFL, and is not covered by the Deed of Guarantee  from the parent, its ratings would be notched down from its parent.  Fitch has assigned the following rating: Citigroup Global Markets Funding Luxembourg  --Long-Term IDR 'A'; Outlook Positive; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'. Fitch has affirmed the following rating:  Citigroup Global Markets Funding Luxembourg  --Senior unsecured at 'A' (emr).

1094,"   By Sweta Singh and David Henry  Citigroup Inc, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit on Friday after trading revenue surged 35 percent.The resurgence, which was echoed at rival JPMorgan, is a boost for Chief Executive Michael Corbat, who has stuck with the bank's trading business while shrinking large parts of its consumer banking business in overseas markets.  While net income fell 11 percent to $3.84 billion, or $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, again beating the average estimate of $17.36 billion. Citigroup's shares rose 2.2 percent to $49.58 in early trading, similar to gains at rivals JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as investors lauded a solid start to the U.S. bank earnings season. Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit forecasts on Friday. Bank of America reports results on Monday, followed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley later next week. CONSUMER BANKING Revenue at Citi's institutional clients group, which includes trading and investment banking, rose 13 percent, boosted by volatility in fixed income markets. That volatility and greater activity were spurred by Britain's June vote to leave the European Union, changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, and money market reforms.  However, equity market revenue fell about 34 percent as political uncertainty discouraged companies from initial public offerings and share offers. JPMorgan reported a 1 percent increase.Citi's global consumer banking division had a less stellar performance. Net income fell by nearly a quarter due to a higher cost of credit and higher operating expenses.Part of those expenses were due to the cost of becoming the lender behind retailer Costco Wholesale Corp.’s co-branded credit cards this year from American Express Co.Citigroup said revenue from its North American branded card business grew 15 percent to $2.2 billion, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth driven by higher volumes.The business accounts for about a quarter of its total net income and a third of profit from its global consumer franchises. Citigroup executives have said the branded card business is expected to generate a 2.3 percent return on assets, more than double the profitability of the entire company.Overall operating expenses fell 2.5 percent to $10.40 billion.PROFIT TARGETS Despite the solid performance in investment banking, Corbat fell further behind in his quest to reach a 10 percent return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability. It    fell to 7.8 percent from 8.9 percent a year earlier. Corbat had set the target of reaching a 10 percent return on equity by 2015 shortly after taking the reins in 2012. But the bank has found it hard to hit the target as its earnings are squeezed by low interest rates and the U.S. Federal Reserve's requirement that banks retain more capital.Analysts say the Fed would need to allow the bank to return as much as it earns to significantly improve shareholders' returns and the Fed now lets Citi distribute about 65 percent of its capital. Corbat reached that level in June when he won approval from the regulator to triple the bank's dividend and increase spending on its stock buybacks by more than a third.Previously, Citi had failed Fed tests of its capital plans twice.The bank's common equity Tier 1 capital rose to 12.6 percent from 12.5 percent in the second quarter even as Citigroup returned capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.The stock had lost 6.3 percent this year as of Thursday's closing price of $48.47.Citigroup's stock has languished at a steep discount to its tangible book value, which was $64.71 at the end of September.

1100,"   By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell.Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan.Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments.On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share.Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts.Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent.  Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi.Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent.Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders.""Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry,"" said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt ""comfortable"" with the bank's current governance.  Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits.To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015.In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent.Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide.Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations.   Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters.Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter.Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain.Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent.The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

1103,"  LAGOS Oct 20 Nigeria's central bank has sold around $313 million in a two-month forward auction to clear backlog dollar demand, Citibank wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Last week, the central bank held a two-month dollar forward auction to clear a backlog of demand from airlines, manufacturers and other companies, as a currency crisis deepened.

1106,"  * New CEO Rob Shuter to start March 13 instead of July* MTN gives no reason for advanced appointment* MTN says to strongly defend itself against Nigeria allegations* Citi denies involvement in any unlawful currency transfer   (Adds details, Citi comments, MTN comment)By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Camillus EbohJOHANNESBURG/ABUJA, Oct 24 MTN Group's  next chief executive will take over three months early, the South African telecoms company said on Monday, boosting a share price hit by allegations it illegally moved $14 billion out of Nigeria.Rob Shuter, European boss of Vodafone, was due to start at MTN in July but will now start on March 13 and have to tackle the latest problem to face the company in its most lucrative but increasingly problematic market.MTN agreed to pay a fine of 330 billion naira ($1.1 billion), reduced from $5.2 billion after a prolonged legal battle, in June to end a dispute in Nigeria over unregistered SIM cards. The fine prompted the departure in November 2015 of former CEO Sifiso Dabengwa.MTN gave no reason for Shuter's early move and did not say if it had reached any agreement with Vodafone to facilitate it.Shuter, a South African-born banker with a background in risk management, will join a company widely seen in South African business circles as a post-apartheid corporate success story. Yet MTN has attracted controversy over its ventures in some frontier markets, such as a decision a decade ago to enter Afghanistan, Syria and Iran. Now the firm is the subject of a parliamentary investigation in Nigeria on whether it unlawfully repatriated $13.9 billion between 2006 and 2016, allegations which MTN denies. MTN runs the largest wireless phone network in Nigeria, where it generates a third of group sales.""It wasn't spectacular that the CEO is going to join three months sooner, but the share price has fallen so much that some kind of good news would cause this kind of a recovery,"" said Wayne McCurrie, a fund manager at Ashburton Investments.MTN, which also reported a slight fall in user numbers on Monday, said it would strongly defend itself against the Nigerian investigation. Its shares, which had fallen on Friday to their lowest in more than six years, were up 3.1 percent at 110.31 rand by 1409 GMT. FOREIGN CURRENCY The crux of the latest Nigerian allegations is that MTN did not obtain certificates declaring it had invested foreign currency in Nigeria within a 24-hour deadline stipulated in a 1995 law, and therefore the repatriation of returns on those investments was deemed illegal.A motion proposed by Nigerian Senator Dino Melaye alleged that banks that include Citigroup subsequently issued certificates of capital importation so MTN could repatriate the hard currency.Citigroup's Nigeria unit denied being involved in any unlawful transfer of foreign currency on behalf of MTN or any other customer, in a copy of a presentation to the Nigerian parliament last week.It is unclear what penalty Nigeria would impose if MTN is found guilty of any wrongdoing in the investigation, which began last week and is expected to run for two weeks.A senate source told Reuters that if MTN were to be found guilty, the company and individuals involved would face criminal prosecution for false declaration.MTN said the Nigerian central bank had instructed the company to halt dividend payouts until further notice, although it has not been paying dividends on its earnings in Nigeria due to the fine for missing the deadline on SIM card registrations.

1116,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO E-commerce menswear company Bonobos is speaking to investors about raising $100 million in a new round of funding that would value the company roughly at half a billion dollars, according to people familiar with the matter.Bonobos is using the new funds to expand its retail footprint, highlighting the crossover that e-commerce companies  are making into traditional brick and mortar retail as they push for growth, the sources said on Friday.Bonobos, which is profitable, generates around $150 million in sales and is working with Citigroup Inc (C.N) to assist with the fundraising, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. Citi and Bonobos declined to comment. New York-based Bonobos was founded in 2007 by Stanford business school graduates who wanted to create better fitting chinos. The company sells pants with a ""signature curved waistband,"" that creates a more flattering fit. Bonobos has since expanded beyond khakis, and now sells golf apparel, outerwear, shoes and accessories. In 2013, it launched a female-focused website, Ayr.com, before announcing it will spin off the website late last year. Bonobos was one of the first e-retailers to move into traditional brick and mortar in 2012, but made its biggest retail push over the last two years. Bonobos has said it is looking to reach customers who prefer to touch and see products before purchase. Bonobos offers ""guideshops"" which have no inventory, but allow customers to try on clothes before having them shipped to their home. Eyewear company Warby Parker and clothing rental service Rent the Runway have similar retail concepts.  Bonobos has roughly 28 of these shops in states that include Atlanta, Texas, New York and California. It also sells clothing at retailers such as Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Belk.Internet giant Amazon.com (AMZN.O) has also moved further into brick and mortar and has said it will build out bookstores and food retail shops, looking to gobble up an even greater share of the respective markets. Many of the online platforms that sprouted up over the last 20 years have since sold to larger companies, who have sought to improve their direct-to-consumer reach. Earlier this year, Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) bought online razor retailer Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) bought internet retailer Jet.com for $3 billion. Trunk Club, a personalized online retailer that was founded by one of Bonobos' founders Brian Spaly, sold to Nordstrom in 2014 for $350 million.Bonobos has raised about $127 million to date with backers that include Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N).

1118,"  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether big banks have been mishandling securities in the American Depositary Receipt (ADR) market, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.The SEC has sent subpoenas to four banks over the issue - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) (DB.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the Journal reported, citing people close to the matter. (on.wsj.com/2eFTBJ4)The probe, which is looking at whether the banks have broken controls designed to prevent market abuse and tax fraud, will not necessarily result in enforcement action, the report said.A major focus of the SEC inquiry is the ""pre-release"" of ADRs, where banks issue depositary receipts to investors without first having the underlying shares in their custody, the Journal reported. That means the shares could be sold short without actually having them - a practice known as ""naked short selling"", which is illegal. ADRs represent shares of foreign companies that are held in custody by U.S. banks. Trading in ADRs rather than the underlying shares reduces administration and trading costs, both for companies and for investors.Deutsche Bank and Citigroup declined to comment on the report, while the other two banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1119,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday indicated it could allow Miami to pursue lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic home buyers resulting in loan defaults that drove down city tax revenues and property values.The eight justices heard arguments in appeals filed by Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co challenging a lower court's decision to permit the lawsuits by the Florida city against the banks. The cases were filed under the Fair Housing Act, a federal law outlawing discrimination in housing. In September 2015, the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss such lawsuits by the city against Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc. Citigroup decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court. If the court splits 4-4, the 11th Circuit ruling would stand and Miami would prevail, but no national precedent would be set.Based on the questions asked by the justices, it appeared unlikely the banks would gain the five votes needed to win the case outright. But it was possible that a ruling for Miami could allow the lawsuits to move forward while narrowing the scope of the cases and potentially lowering the amount of damages the city could win.Chief Justice John Roberts seemed most skeptical of the city's lawsuit, at one point questioning whether a loss of property taxes could count as a direct injury that could give rise to a lawsuit. Roberts said the city's alleged injuries are ""derivative of the injury to the homeowners who had the subprime mortgages and who suffered the foreclosure and so on."" Fellow conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could cast the key vote to avoid a 4-4 split, seemed somewhat sympathetic to the banks, particularly over the amount of damages they could face. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan was among those who seemed open to the case moving forward, saying the Fair Housing Act was designed to address harms to communities, not just individuals. ""Who better than the city to recognize that interest and assert it?"" Kagan said. The banks have said a ruling favoring Miami would lead to a surge of similar suits.The court is due to rule by the end of June. Miami accused Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup of steering non-white borrowers into higher-cost loans they often could not afford, even if they had good credit.The city said the banks' conduct caused Miami to lose property tax revenues, drove down property values and required the city to pay the costs of repairing and maintaining properties that went into foreclosure due to discriminatory lending.Several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Oakland, have launched similar lawsuits.

1128,"  DUBLIN Nov 14 Ireland's Central Bank on Monday added domestic lender permanent tsb and subsidiaries of Royal Bank of Scotland, Citigroup and UniCredit  to its list of systemically important banks that have to hold extra capital.Like other European banks, Irish lenders identified as systemically important to the domestic economy due to their size and market share have to hold the additional capital, known as Core Tier 1, to increase defences against future shocks.The Central Bank last year set the amount of extra capital for Ireland's two largest banks, Allied Irish Banks (ALBK.I) and Bank of Ireland (BKIR.I), at 1.5 percent of risk-weighted assets to be phased in at a rate of 0.5 percent from July 2019. After its first review of the so-called Other Systemically Important Institutions (O-SIIs) buffers, it set the mark for permanent tsb, RBS' Irish unit Ulster Bank and Citigroup at 0.25 percent in 2019, rising to 0.5 percent a year later. Citigroup shifted the head office of its European retail banking operation to Dublin from London last year. UniCredit, whose unit is based in Ireland's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) and is primarily involved in structured finance and treasury activities, will have to just hold an additional 0.25 percent of capital by July 2019.The O-SIIs can be set between 0 and 2.5 percent and aim to protect lenders from potential losses related to excessive credit growth, a measure of particular resonance in Ireland where the banking sector required the euro zone's costliest state bailout following a 2008 property crash.

1129,"   By Laura Benitez  LONDON, Nov 14 (IFR) - US pharmaceuticals AbbVie and Mylan have set their sights on Europe's bond market to sell debut euro bonds, taking advantage of positive sentiment for the sector after last week's unexpected Donald Trump victory in the US election.Bonds in that space were among the biggest gainers last Wednesday as investors looked to pick potential beneficiaries of the policies of a Trump presidency and his more lenient views on drugs pricing.However, the two issuers will have to contend with a volatile market backdrop, where government bonds have brutally sold off as investors fear that monetary easing may come to an end.After meeting investors last week, AbbVie is selling a triple-tranche euro deal today, expected to total around 3bn in size, while Mylan is planning its return to the market after withdrawing its potential debut euro in September.TRICKY TIMING These trades - and euro-denominated bond issuance in general - are expected to come at a price this week, due to increased European rates volatility. The 10-year German Bund yield rose to its highest level since January. It has jumped from 0.15% to 0.37% in the last week alone.""It's a very tough market and the AbbVie deal is looking very cheap for investors right now,"" one banker said. ""The huge moves in rates are worrying investors and making them defensive,"" one banker said.AbbVie started marketing a three-year tranche at 70bp area, a long seven-year at 110bp area and a 12-year at 135bp area, all over mid-swaps. This was revised to 55bp-70bp, 100bp area and 125bp-130bp,  respectively.Higher Bund yields and the approaching year-end are also forcing investors to reduce risk at the long end of the curve.""We like the credit but the volatility in rates leaves us on the sidelines in the near term,"" said one UK based portfolio manager.""There is a rush to get many of these deals done by year-end, and ahead of Thanksgiving, but [I'm] not sure there will be huge appetite from investors until the Bund curve stabilises."" Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan are bookrunners on the deal, with Morgan Stanley also acting as global coordinator.The deal follows European fixed income investor meetings that were held from November 9.SECOND TIME LUCKY?  Mylan is also trying to cash in on the post-election pharmaceutical rally to return to the European market for a debut euro.The US company met investors from September 7-9 for a potential benchmark multi-tranche debut offering, rumoured to be around 3bn in size.It decided not to proceed with its euro bond plans after it came under intense scrutiny for sharply raising the price of its EpiPen allergy auto-injector.The company has continued to court controversy with the US Senate Judiciary Committee urging federal antitrust regulators to launch a probe into whether it broke the law by preventing schools from purchasing competing allergy treatments .""This could be a tough one, given DoJ investigation headlines regarding potential collusion in generic drug pricing,"" another investor said.""It's very difficult to prejudge the outcome but our concern is this has the potential to threaten its investment-grade ratings.""The borrower has indicated its intention to sell a multi-tranche benchmark transaction, comprising a two-year FRN and four, eight and/or 12-year fixed-rate notes.Rated Baa3/BBB-/BBB-, Mylan has mandated Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, ING and JP Morgan for the upcoming deal.

1133,"  NEW YORK If federal corporate tax rates decline 20 percent under President-elect Donald Trump, Citigroup Inc (C.N) may have to take a $4 billion charge to profits to reflect lower values for its deferred tax assets, the bank's chief financial officer said on Wednesday.However, a charge of that size and nature would not hurt the amount of capital that Citigroup reports to regulators under rules designed to ensure the soundness of banks, CFO John Gerspach said at an investor conference that was webcast.After the U.S. election results last week were viewed by Wall Street as increasing the chances of lower tax rates, the KBW bank stock index .BKX climbed 13.6 percent through Tuesday while Citigroup shares rose 11.1 percent.  Analysts have said that Citigroup has lagged other bank stocks partly because of the chance that tax reform would reduce the value of the company's deferred tax assets.A corporate tax rate of 28 percent would amount to a 20 percent reduction from current rates, Gerspach said. Citigroup has $45 billion of deferred tax assets, far more than any other U.S. bank. They are largely left over from the tax treatment of losses during the financial crisis. The bank had used up about $10 billion in the last four years.Gerspach called the estimated $4 billion charge part of a ""rough, top-level assessment"" of consequences of possible tax reforms. If tax reforms were to make a big change in the treatment of liabilities outside of the United States, the bank might have to take a charge of as much as $12 billion and report a $4 billion reduction in regulatory capital, he said.""There are a lot of moving pieces,"" Gerspach said.

1141,"   By Francesco Canepa | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT The U.S. bank Citi (C.N) on Monday became the first global lender to come under European Central Bank supervision since Britain's vote to leave the European Union - an option several UK-based companies are exploring to keep their access to the single market.Banks are looking for ways to ensure they can easily sell their services into the EU, a market of 450 million people, after Britain leaves. One option is to shift enough assets to a euro zone country to qualify for ECB supervision.Citi's Irish unit, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was added to a list of large banks directly supervised by the ECB on Monday, after it expanded its balance sheet through last year's merger with UK-based Citibank International.The merger predates the June 23 Brexit referendum, but Citi's move will still be closely watched by competitors weighing a move to the euro zone.Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt and ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said last week several banks are talking to the central bank about similar moves.Citi itself has said it might have to re-allocate certain businesses to the EU, but it would not ""hot foot"" it out of Britain. The Irish subsidiary houses Citi's retail banking operation in Europe and has around 46 billion euros ($48.93 billion) in assets. But it could not accommodate Citi's brokerage or trading businesses.Under U.S. regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi's brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London.""This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),"" Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month. MEDIOLANUM Euro zone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country. The total number of ""significant"" banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings. Italy's Banca Mediolanum (BMED.MI), which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia's Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters.The ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi's owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company.($1 = 0.9401 euros) (Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies and Rachel Armstrong in London, and Maria Pia Quaglia in Milan, editing by Larry King)",2016-11-21,C,"Mon Nov 21, 2016 | 8:25am EST",Citi becomes first U.S. bank supervised by ECB since Brexit vote,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ecb-banks-banca-mediolanum-idUSKBN13G1DM?type=companyNews
1142,"   By Huw Jones | LONDON  LONDON Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability.The group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present.Members of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis.In the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top ""bucket"" facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements.The measure announced by the FSB does not have an impact on any of Citi's binding regulatory metrics, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.No lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year.Lenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience.HSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. Bank of America rose a category to join them. Barclays dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank.Morgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group.The FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. The ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world. The FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio ""surcharge"" or whether it too should adopt a ""bucket"" approach.    The watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.Insurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher ""loss absorbency"" requirements from January 2019.The list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential. The FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion.Global insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach.MetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, was also designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators.The insurer successfully challenged the U.S. designation in court, but the U.S. government has appealed with the outcome generally expected sometime in the next few months.""MetLife is no longer designated as a systemically important financial institution in the United States, and believe we should not be designated as a global systemically important insurer, either,"" MetLife said on Monday.

But it could not accommodate Citi's brokerage or trading businesses.Under U.S. regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi's brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London.""This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),"" Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month. MEDIOLANUM Euro zone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country. The total number of ""significant"" banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings. Italy's Banca Mediolanum (BMED.MI), which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia's Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters.The ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi's owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company.($1 = 0.9401 euros) (Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies and Rachel Armstrong in London, and Maria Pia Quaglia in Milan, editing by Larry King)",2016-11-21,C,"Mon Nov 21, 2016 | 8:25am EST",UPDATE 1-Citi becomes first U.S. bank supervised by ECB since Brexit vote,http://www.reuters.com//article/ecb-banks-banca-mediolanum-idUSL8N1DM1X6?type=companyNews

In the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top ""bucket"" of a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of the global minimum requirements. HSBC joins Bank of America, BNP Paribas  and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. The FSB, a G20 regulatory task force, also updated its list of 9 globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.

1147,"   By Tracy Rucinski | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. coal producer Peabody Energy Corp (BTUUQ.PK) said on Wednesday it is closer to exiting bankruptcy, with a debt dispute between creditors fizzling as a recent increase in coal prices boosts their chances for recovery.Peabody filed for Chapter 11 protection in April, after a sharp decline in coal prices left it unable to service $10 billion of debt. A creditor fight launched by some of Wall Street's most litigious investment funds, Aurelius Capital Management and Elliott Management, put the reorganization on hold.Seven months later, prices for coal used to generate power and make steel have surged, particularly in Australia, where Peabody expanded with the $5.1 billion acquisition of Australia's Macarthur Coal in 2011. The surge means that secured lenders such as Citibank are now likely to recoup their investment, making a legal battle over how to treat long-term debt in calculating Peabody's assets largely irrelevant. This brings Peabody one step closer to reaching a consensual bankruptcy reorganization. On Wednesday, Peabody said the company was working to resolve the dispute that pitted its secured lenders against unsecured creditors, including distressed debt hedge funds Aurelius and Elliott, who were seeking a larger share of Peabody's assets in the reorganization.  ""The parties are working to settle the (debt) issue as part of broader negotiations regarding the plan of reorganization,"" Peabody spokesman Vic Svec said in an emailed statement.  Peabody expects to file its reorganization plan by mid-December and hopes to exit bankruptcy within a year of its April 2016 filing, Svec said. Peabody's shares, which fell to a record low of $0.55 after its Chapter 11 filing in April, reached $10.70 in over-the-counter trading on Wednesday.

1150,"   By Sudip Roy  LONDON, Nov 29 (IFR) - Kenya has sent a request for proposals for a bond and loan, according to sources.The sovereign wants to consider both options, according to one source, who said that the eventual mandate may be a combination of the two products or one only. Kenya undertook a non-deal roadshow in April through Barclays, Citigroup and Standard Chartered. The sovereign made its debut in the international bond market in 2014, when it raised US$1.5bn through a 10-year bond, which was subsequently tapped for US$500m, and US$500m through a five-year note which was later raised by US$250m. The deal hit controversy in December 2015 after the opposition party questioned where some of the proceeds had gone. The finance minister rejected the claims and detailed how the money had been channelled to other ministries.(Reporting by Sudip Roy, editing by Julian Baker)",2016-11-29,C,"Tue Nov 29, 2016 | 6:03am EST",Kenya sends request for proposals for bond and loan,http://www.reuters.com//article/kenya-bonds-idUSL8N1DU2VS?type=companyNews

1153,"  NEW YORK Citigroup Inc fourth-quarter markets revenue is running about 20 percent higher than last year, chief financial officer John Gerspach said on Wednesday.Increased client demand for trades in fixed income and currencies that began with the Brexit vote in June has continued through the U.S. election, Gerspach said at an investor conference. The demand is coming from institutional investors and corporate clients, he said.Chief executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp said on Tuesday at the same conference that fourth-quarter trading revenue at their companies was up about 15 percent from a year earlier.Gerspach, who spoke about a variety of topics in a question and answer format, said that compared with a year ago Citigroup was now more concerned about threats to the European economy and less concerned about emerging markets, particularly Brazil and Russia. Citigroup is the most international of big U.S. banks. As the new United States government looks at possible changes in bank regulations, Gerspach said Citigroup most wants to see no new rules. The bank would like to see changes in two sets of liquidity rules, which Gerspach said have set requirements too high. While the bank does not want to do the proprietary trading prohibited by the so-called Volcker rule, it does find record-keeping requirements for the rule burdensome, he said.Citigroup shares have climbed 16 percent since the November election, but Gerspach said the company still tends to favor stock buybacks over dividends because the share price remains below book value.

1154,"   By Beth Pinsker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Want to save a few quick bucks on your holiday shopping? Your credit card may offer some little-known perks that could save you money both upfront and after the purchase.Of the 100 most popular credit cards, 81 offered some kind of extended warranty, according to a study released on Wednesday from Creditcards.com, a card rating website run by Bankrate.com (RATE.N).Just over half had purchase security, useful if your item is lost or stolen and the retailer or shipping company does not make good on the loss. Forty-seven cards had price protection, meaning the credit card issuer will match the price if it drops within a certain amount of time, and 26 guaranteed returns even when the merchant does not.Of the cards studied, 17 offered all four of these protections.To take advantage, you first have to know what is available on your card. Then you have to jump through the many required hoops.“These perks can really help in certain circumstances, but most people don’t know that they are there to be taken,” said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at creditcards.com. He added that the credit card issuers declined to provide usage numbers for his study.One quick way to check if your card has hearty protections is to look at the bottom right-hand corner, said Sean McQuay, credit card expert at Nerdwallet.com. A Visa card with the “Signature” or “Infinite” tag will likely have the best protections. For MasterCard, look for “World Elite.”American Express and Discover offer the same protections at all levels, McQuay said.  THE FINE PRINT Extended warranty coverage, while the most common type of protection offered, is probably used sparingly by consumers because few know about it, said Schulz.But this is the perk that could save consumers real money, because they can decline the extended warranty offered by retailers. It is akin to knowing that if your credit card offers insurance protection for rental cars, you can decline expensive add-on coverage. AJ Saleem, who works for a tutoring company in Houston, did not find it too daunting to use his extended warranty coverage to get $60 to fix a broken iPhone speaker three months after the manufacturer’s one-year warranty ended. He sent his card company a copy of the warranty document, the repair quote and the original purchase statement and it sent him a check.The other credit card protections require more documentation. Refunds for stolen items may require police reports, for instance, said McQuay.“These perks are best applied to big-ticket items,” said Schulz. “They'll be worth the time and effort to find the paperwork and make the phone calls, because the money you get back is real and impactful.”Curtis Arnold, editor in chief of Cardratings.com, used one of his cards for reimbursement for a stolen lawn mower after his shed was burglarized. ""It really soothed my despair,"" he said. Card issuers are moving to an easier system that will require less legwork, at least for price matching, said Schulz.Citigroup Inc (C.N) already has its Citi Rewind feature, which enables users to register a purchase; the system will then check automatically for price drops. Citi keeps a running tally of savings on its promotional page, which claims that so far, more than 200,000 payments have been issued to the tune of almost $5.5 million.Schulz said Capital One(COF.N) just acquired a company that could allow it to offer something similar, and he thinks more will follow.For now, the savvy consumer has to learn a few tricks in order to save. Justin Chidester, a financial planner in Logan, Utah, did not have much luck at first with the price matching. When he tried to use it to get money back on some chairs he bought, the card company wanted not just the original receipt and proof of the new lower price offer, but also a screen shot of the original price he paid for the items. “I got tripped up,” said Chidester.Wiser on his second attempt, he bought a new TV for $450 and saved a screen shot of the original offer. When the price dropped shortly afterward to $300, he was prepared and quickly got a $150 statement credit for his effort.  (Editing by Dan Grebler)",2016-12-07,C,"Wed Dec 7, 2016 | 12:17am EST",Hidden credit card perks can save shoppers,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-money-credit-perks-idUSKBN13W0CR?type=companyNews
