20,"  By Soyoung Kim and Olivia OranNEW YORK, March 17 When Barington Capital Group in October reported a stake of more than 2 percent in Darden Restaurants Inc with a vow to shake up the company, another investment firm was caught off guard.Starboard Value LP, which takes stakes in companies that it perceives to be undervalued with the hopes of making changes, had studied the restaurant chain for six months as a potential target and was waiting for the right moment to pounce.But news of Barington's investment sent stocks sharply higher that month, forcing Starboard to wait another two months until shares fell back. In December, it went public with its 5.6 percent position just after Darden reported weak earnings.A few months prior to that, an activist fund was preparing to go public with proposals to shake up Aeropostale Inc  and was amassing a stake, only to learn that Sycamore Partners had taken an 8 percent stake in the teen clothing retailer.Sycamore's disclosure sent stocks surging nearly 20 percent on the day of the announcement, making it expensive for the activist fund to buy more shares. The fund, which asked not to be identified for this article, passed on a campaign.The examples show how investors are increasingly bumping into one another in corporate campaigns, as more funds are starting to follow the playbook of aggressive shareholders such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, who use their stock positions to urge companies to sell, break up, buy back shares or oust management.Investors and their lawyers say that it's getting tougher to find easy targets as investors are chasing the same ""low-hanging fruit"" - companies that have poor corporate governance or performance and are vulnerable to calls for change.""There's only so many companies that are undervalued and a lot of people are looking at the same screen and the same performance criteria,"" said Steve Wolosky, a partner at law firm Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP.John Studzinski, who leads the advisory arm of Blackstone Group LP, estimates that almost 20 percent of the S&P 500 companies have already had some type of activist involvement.The strength of stock markets -- the S&P rose 30 percent in 2013 -- means there are fewer cheap stocks to buy. Moreover, companies, realizing that it's too late when activists show up on their doorsteps, are proactively taking steps such as breaking up the company or boosting buybacks. That removes some potential for activist intervention, lawyers and bankers say.They say that with fewer obvious targets where activists can get in and out for a quick fix, activists will inevitably go after some of the better-performing companies in order to deploy capital. Activist returns, which handily outperformed those of traditional hedge funds in recent years, may take a hit if complicated corporate attacks start to produce mixed results. For the companies themselves, the consequence of multiple agitators could mean a more costly and time-consuming battle, a distraction from running day-to-day operations, as well as greater fees for legal and defense advisors.""It's a tough message for a board of a management team to deny something when multiple sophisticated investors are saying 'this is what the problem is and this is why the market is valuing you incorrectly',"" said Philip Larrieu, a senior investment officer at the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS).MULTIPLE AGITATORS In addition to Darden, others who have fended off at least two activist investors in the stock include Juniper Networks Inc , where both Elliott Management Corp and Jana Partners LLC reported stakes, and Sotheby's, which is under the scrutiny of Third Point LLC and Marcato Capital Management LP.Emulex Corp and Compuware Corp have three activist funds involved in the stock. In the last two weeks alone, at least three U.S. companies -- Aarons Inc, BJ's Restaurants Inc and ALCO Stores Inc -- saw two different investor groups nominate competing slates to their boards.Competition for the same targets is spurred in large part by the sheer number of investors increasingly willing to use activism and the ever-growing warchest that activist funds can tap into. In 2013, activist hedge funds added nearly $5.3 billion in net asset inflows, up sharply from $2.9 billion in the previous year and the most since 2006, according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research.Total assets in activist funds - a small slice of all hedge-funds assets - stood at $93 billion at the end of 2013, an all-time high and up 42 percent from the prior year, the data show.Some of that rush of money is performance chasing. On average, the roughly 60 funds tracked by HFR that specialize in activist investing returned 16.6 percent in 2013. While that is still less than the Standard & Poor's jump of roughly 30 percent, it is far better than the average hedge fund, which returned 9.3 percent, HFR data showed.These trends have supported a new crop of investors who left funds like Icahn Enterprises LP and Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management to set up their own shops in recent years.Further crowding the field, funds that have historically preferred to stay under the radar are choosing to go public with their campaigns.Last year, hedge fund TPG-Axon Capital led a successful proxy fight against SandRidge Energy Corp, its only second such public fight in its 8-year history, and First Manhattan Co won a proxy battle at drugmaker Vivus Inc, which marked one of its only two forays into activism in nearly 50 years. Rishi Bajaj, managing principal at activist investment firm Altai Capital, thinks having multiple funds with similar perspectives involved in the same company can sometimes help because that gives them a larger percentage of shareholder base that has an agenda of change.But other times, investors are fighting it out to the detriment of one another. In February, investment firm Voce Capital Management LLC, which was seeking to nominate four directors to ConMed Corp, lambasted the surgical device maker for giving two board seats to another activist investor, Coppersmith Capital, instead.Voce went as far as questioning the qualification of the Coopersmith directors. It pointed to the directors' track record including their unsuccessful attempt at gaining board seats at Alere Inc  last year, saying ""serious and troubling"" questions were raised about each candidate.""Now companies have two different activists potentially to try to satisfy, and those two activists may have different or even competing objectives. If you satisfy one activist and settle, the other one could keep coming at you,"" said Marc Weingarten, head of the activism practice at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP.Blackstone's Studzinski said that if activists position their campaign in a way where they will not step on each other's toes, ""one plus one could equal three.""When Keith Meister, Carl Icahn's one time right hand man, set his sights on shaking up CommonWealth REIT a year ago, he didn't know that he would soon have company in the form of other hedge funds who were equally ready to fight over the real estate investment trust's structure and high fees being paid to its controlling family.Meister's Corvex Management, working with Related Fund Management, laid out its requests and a threat to remove the board in a regulatory filing on Feb. 26, 2013.

23,"  (Adds context, Darden comment)March 19 Darden Restaurants Inc on Wednesday urged shareholders not to support activist investor Starboard Value LP's proposal for a special meeting to vote on the company's plan to divest its Red Lobster chain.Darden on Dec. 19 announced plans to spin off or sell its 705-restaurant Red Lobster chain. The company said the transaction would not require a shareholder vote and could close in the fiscal year beginning May 26.Starboard, which owns about 5.5 percent of Darden shares, said in late February that the plan to spin off Red Lobster should be delayed and put to a shareholder vote.Last week Starboard approached shareholders to suggest a special meeting about Red Lobster. It must deliver written requests from the holders of at least half of Darden's shares to hold the meeting. Starboard and fellow activist Barington Capital Group are lobbying Darden to take bolder steps to improve performance at the company, the biggest U.S. operator of full-service restaurants.Their calls took on more urgency after Darden warned earlier this month that closely watched same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster and Olive Garden, its marquee chains, had fallen sharply in the latest quarter due in part to severe winter weather.""Darden strongly believes that Starboard's special meeting is an unsatisfactory alternative to direct, ongoing engagement between the Company and its shareholders,"" Darden said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. ""Darden strongly urges shareholders to communicate their views directly to the company and consider carefully the risks, costs and alternatives to a special meeting,"" the company said.Darden said on March 5 that it had canceled its analyst and investor meeting scheduled for March 28. The company said it would instead meet individually with analysts and investors. Starboard told investors that a special meeting would give them a public forum to weigh in on the Red Lobster proposal and said the deal could close before Darden's annual meeting, which is usually in September.""We believe it is critical for shareholders in this case to have the right to review and approve any transaction involving Red Lobster that takes place prior to the 2014 annual meeting, at which time shareholders will have an opportunity to elect directors whom they believe represent their best interests,"" Starboard said in a filing.Neither the calling of the special meeting nor the approval of a nonbinding resolution by shareholders at a special meeting would prohibit Darden's directors from going ahead with a Red Lobster deal, Starboard said.Shares of Darden were down 0.5 percent at $49.23 in midday trading.

Stroud, Starboard said, had told a group of investors last week that the company was on a timetable to complete a sale or spinoff of Red Lobster in June or July.Starboard also alleged that Stroud had told the group that Darden could delay calling the requested special meeting by as much as 60 days from the date of certification of the written requests, and that it was not required to hold the special meeting thereafter for an additional 60 days. Starboard argued Stroud's statements were inconsistent with Florida law, which states that the initial 60 days to call the special meeting starts when the written requests are delivered, not certified. ""Mr. Stroud's statements have heightened Starboard's concerns that the company may now be seeking to hurry through a sale of Red Lobster before holding the special meeting,"" Starboard said in a statement on Wednesday.Darden spokesman Rich Jeffers said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that the company would announce additional details regarding the special meeting as appropriate.Darden shares were down 1 percent at $50.35 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Darden Restaurants, Inc.'s  (Darden; NYSE:DRI) ratings and removed the ratings from Rating Watch Negative.  Ratings are as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'; --Bank credit facilities at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial Paper (CP) at 'F3'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. At Feb. 23, 2014, Darden had approximately $2.7  billion of total debt.  The action follows Darden's announcement that it has signed a definitive  agreement to sell Red Lobster for $2.1 billion or about 9x the brand's latest  12-month (LTM) EBITDA at April 27, 2014. At Nov. 24, 2013, Red Lobster had 705  units that generated roughly $2.6 billion of sales.  Darden expects net after-tax and transaction cost proceeds to be an estimated  $1.6 billion, of which approximately $1 billion will be used for debt reduction  and the remainder for share repurchases. Fitch views the probability of  completion as high because the transaction has been approved by Darden's Board  of Directors and the buyer has committed financing. The transaction is expected  to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 or by the end of August 2014.    KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage and FCF The affirmation and Stable Outlook reflect reduced uncertainty regarding the  separation of Red Lobster and the significant amount of targeted debt reduction  while considering negative same-restaurant sales (SRS) trends at Olive Garden.  Should SRS not improve meaningfully by the second half of fiscal 2015, or the  end of calendar 2014, the Ratings Outlook will be revised to Negative. The  rating action also incorporates Fitch's expectation that total adjusted  debt-to-operating EBITDAR (rent-adjusted leverage) will be in the low-3.0x range  and that free cash flow (FCF) will approximate $100 million within one year of  the transaction.  For the LTM period ended Feb. 23, 2014, rent-adjusted leverage  was 3.5x and FCF was negative $26 million.  Pro forma total debt and EBITDA, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense  and one-time charges, are approximately $1.7 billion and more than $750 million,  respectively. Pro forma rent-adjusted leverage is in the low 3.0x range, after  excluding roughly $35 million of rent expense associated with Red Lobster's  operating leases. Pro forma leverage does not incorporate the full $60 million  or more of annualized general and administrative related cost savings Darden is  on track to realize by the end of 2015.   Darden's FCF will continue to be pressured by the firm's aggressive dividend  policy unless operating earnings growth resumes. However, capex will be  meaningfully lower absent Red Lobster and Darden plans to curtail new unit  development at Olive Garden and slow expansion at Long Horn Steakhouse  (LongHorn). Fitch also views plans to align executive compensation to SRS and  FCF favorably.   Performance at Olive Garden Fitch expects the separation of Red Lobster to lessen the volatility in Darden's  SRS performance and operating cash flow. Darden will also continue to benefit  from a portfolio of brands with Olive Garden representing about 60% of the  firm's roughly $6.2 billion of annual sales and nearly 1,500 restaurants.  At  Feb. 23, 2014, Darden's unit count included 836 Olive Gardens, 453 LongHorns,  and 189 restaurants in its Specialty Restaurant Group (SRG). SRG brands include  The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, Eddie V's, and Yard House.  SRS at Olive Garden have been weak for three consecutive fiscal years. SRS  declined 1.2% in 2012, 1.5% in 2013, and are projected by Darden to decline  4%-4.5% in the fiscal year ended May 2014 inclusive of the negative impact of  severe winter weather. In March 2014, Darden announced a new plan to restore SRS  growth at Olive Garden which Fitch views as comprehensive. The six-point Brand Renaissance Plan includes: 1)a focus on food quality and the  dining experience, 2) more efficient restaurant operations, 3) a core menu plan  incorporating value, variety, and convenience, 4) using a variety of media and  targeted promotions when advertising, 5) better restaurant service, and 6)  reimaging. Should SRS not meaningfully improve by the end of calendar 2014 (as  mentioned previously), progress on cost savings initiatives stall, and margins  continue to contract, Darden's Ratings Outlook will be revised to Negative.  Liquidity, Maturities and Debt Terms  At Feb. 23, 2014, Darden had $127 million of cash and $569 million of  availability under its undrawn $750 million revolver. The facility, which  expires Oct. 3, 2016, serves as backup to Darden's commercial paper program  (CP). CP totaled $182 million at Feb. 23, 2014.  Significant near-term maturities are limited to $100 million of 7.125% senior  unsecured notes due Feb. 1, 2016.  Darden's $300 million term loan amortizes  annually at 5% of principal or $15 million beginning in August 2014 until  maturity on Aug. 22, 2017. Darden has not indicated which tranches of debt it  will redeem but Fitch anticipates that the firm might tender for its highest  cost debt first. Tranches with the highest coupons include $100 million 7.125%  2016 notes, $300 million 6.8% 2037 bonds, $500 million 6.2% 2017 notes, and $150  million 6% 2035 bonds. Coupons on Darden's other issuances range from 3.35% to  4.52%.     Darden's revolver, term loan, 3.79% senior notes due Aug. 28, 2019, and 4.52%  senior notes due Aug. 28, 2024 subject the firm to a maximum consolidated lease  adjusted total debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.75 to 1.00. Darden has remained  in compliance with this covenant. At Feb 23, 2014 the ratio was approximately  65%.  All of Darden's publicly traded notes, excluding the 7.125% 2016 and 6% 2035  notes, include change of control provisions and sales-leaseback limitations. The  firm's 6.2% senior notes due Oct. 15, 2017 and 6.8% notes due Oct. 15, 2037 are  subject to coupon step-ups if ratings fall below investment grade.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may individually or collectively lead to a negative  rating action include: --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained near or above 3.5x due to  materially lower than expected operating income or unexpected debt-financed  acquisitions or share repurchases; --Continued SRS weakness at Olive Garden, such that trends do not turn positive  or show meaningful sustainable improvement by the end of calendar 2014 or the  second half of fiscal 2015;  --Material continued margin deterioration due to SRS weakness at Olive Garden,  traffic declines, and/or stalled progress with G&A cost reductions;  --Negligible or negative FCF in fiscal 2015 due to weaker than expected  operating performance and/or an aggressive financial strategy related to both  dividends and capex.  Future developments that may individually or collectively lead to a positive  rating action, although not anticipated in the near term, include: --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR maintained below 3.0x due to  operating income growth and/or debt reduction; --Consistently positive SRS performance and traffic gains, particularly at Olive  Garden; --Sustained annual FCF of more than $100 million with FCF margin to sales in the  low- to mid-single-digit range.

43,"  Starboard Value LP launched a fight to take over Darden Restaurants Inc's (DRI.N) board, saying the planned sale of Darden's struggling Red Lobster chain was a ""destructive transaction"" that ignored the rights of shareholders.Darden said last week it would sell the seafood chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital for $2.1 billion, defying Starboard and another activist investor Barington Capital.Darden is under pressure from investors because of flagging sales at Red Lobster in the face of competition from cheaper chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N).Darden reported a 1.1 percent fall in third-quarter revenue in March, with sales at established Red Lobster restaurants falling 8.8 percent.The company rejected Starboard's push for a new board, saying the investor was seeking control of Darden despite owning only 6.2 percent. But Barington, which represents shareholders owning more than 2 percent of Darden, backed Starboard.""It's time for a change in the Darden boardroom,"" Barington Chief Executive James Mitarotonda said in an email. ""Darden desperately needs directors that will represent the interests of the owners of the company and not just the CEO and themselves.""Starboard, which said on Thursday that it had raised its stake in Darden from 5.5 percent, has been pushing Darden for a shareholder vote on the proposed sale. Darden has said the deal is expected to close by August and is not subject to shareholder approval.Starboard said it would nominate a full slate of 12 board candidates for election at Darden's annual meeting, the date of which has not been announced.Nominees include Brad Blum, who Starboard said had turned around Olive Garden when he headed the chain between 1994 and 2002. ""By attempting to replace all 12 members of the board with its own preferred nominees, Starboard is seeking effective control of the company - representation which is disproportionate to Starboard's recently acquired ... stake,"" Darden said in a statement.Starboard said it believed ""wholesale board change is required to reverse the years of poor performance, poor governance and shareholder value destruction.""The investor also said it had identified ways to save costs and boost revenue. A Darden spokesman said in an email that the board would consider the Starboard nominations ""in due course.""Darden, which also operates the fast-growing LongHorn Steakhouse and Capital Grille restaurants, has said it will file a preliminary proxy statement this month for the requested meeting and convene it ""as promptly as practicable.""In a letter to shareholders on Thursday, Starboard said that because of the tax-inefficient way the deal was structured, Darden would net only $100 million from the sale of Red Lobster after taking into account $1.5 billion it believed could have been realized from its alternative plan to sell the chain's real estate.Darden's shares were up 2 percent at $49.68 in noon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Arnab Sen, Aurindom Mukherjee and Maria Ajit Thomas in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr and Kirti Pandey)",2014-05-22,DRI,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 12:17pm EDT",Starboard launches fight to take over Darden board,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-darden-starboard-idUSBREA4L0T920140522?type=companyNews

""The fact that the company would refer to this deal as being done at 9x EBITDA demonstrates management and the board's fundamental lack of understanding of the assets they sold and a predilection for misleading shareholders,"" Starboard said.The investor said it had identified significant cost-saving opportunities and ways to improve revenue through improved food quality, speed of service and sales of higher-margin fare.""Taken together, we believe all of these initiatives, if executed successfully, could yield substantial improvements in earnings, cash flow and shareholder value."" Starboard said it would nominate a full slate of 12 board candidates for election at Darden's annual meeting, the date of which has not been announced.Nominees include Brad Blum, who Starboard said had turned around Olive Garden when he headed the chain between 1994 and 2002.Another activist investor, Barington Capital, which represents shareholders holding more than 2 percent of Darden, has been pressing Darden to combine Red Lobster and Olive Garden into one company, and its higher-growth LongHorn and Capital Grille operations into another.Darden's shares have fallen about 4 percent since the Red Lobster deal was announced.(Reporting by Arnab Sen and Aurindom Mukherjee in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr)",2014-05-22,DRI,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 9:19am EDT",Starboard launches fight to take over Darden board,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-darden-starboard-idUSBREA4L0JJ20140522?type=companyNews

52,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, July 10  NEW YORK, July 10 Darden Restaurants Inc , the parent of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, won the dismissal of a New York lawsuit accusing it of illegally adding an automatic 18 percent tip to diners' bills and failing to list beverage prices on its menus.In a decision made public on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla in Manhattan rejected claims by plaintiff Ted Dimond, who sought to represent diners in a class-action, that Darden's practices violated state consumer protection laws.Dimond claimed it was deceptive for Darden to refer to the  mandatory tip it imposed in some restaurants as a ""gratuity,"" which he called a ""voluntary act."" But the judge said Darden ""conspicuously"" showed the tip on its menus before diners placed their orders, and that diners were free to leave if they disapproved.She also said New Yorkers often leave tips of 18 percent to 20 percent, undercutting the argument they might feel ""tricked"" into having to fork over tips at the low end of that range. While New York City has its own laws on menu surcharges, private diners cannot use them as a basis to sue, Failla said.The judge also said failing to list beer and soft drink prices by itself caused no harm, and was not misleading because reasonable customers could get those prices by asking. Failla's 34-page decision is dated July 9.Jeffrey Smith, a lawyer for Dimond, said he was disappointed with the decision, and that his client would review his options.The case is Dimond v.

58,"  (Recasts first graph with context)By Lisa BaertleinJuly 28 Darden Restaurants Inc's food fight with activist investors Barington Capital Group LP and Starboard Value LP entered a new phase on Monday, when the company said Clarence Otis would step down as chairman and chief executive officer.In further concessions, Orlando-based Darden said it would separate the chairman and chief executive roles, and clear the way for some of Starboard's proposed directors to be elected at its annual meeting.Barington and Starboard said the moves from the company did not come fast enough, nor go as far as needed, and both called for a major overhaul of Darden's board.Shares of Darden, which just closed the sale of its struggling Red Lobster chain and is working to boost business at its flagship Olive Garden restaurants, were up almost 4 percent in extended trading.Starboard launched a fight to take over Darden's board in May, saying the then-pending Red Lobster sale was a ""destructive transaction"" that ignored the rights of shareholders. Darden's board expects to nominate nine directors for the 12 available seats at the Sept. 30 shareholder meeting. Doing so, would ensure that at least three of the nominees proposed by Starboard would be elected, the company said.""While a leadership change at Darden and the appointment of an independent chairman are positive steps that are long overdue, we view the board's 11th hour gesture to concede three board seats to Starboard as 'too little, too late',"" Barington  CEO James Mitarotonda said in a statement.

60,"  * Darden nominating 9 of 12 directors* Starboard seeks major change with slate of 12 directors* Election at Sept. 30 annual meeting* Directors vulnerable but full board turnover unlikelyBy Lisa BaertleinAug 12 Darden Restaurants Inc's board looks vulnerable to a key activist shareholder's push for a shakeup that could pave the way for broader changes at the underperforming owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse.Although the company recently conceded three board seats to Starboard Value LP, a few more of the remaining nine members could be voted out at Darden's Sept. 30 annual meeting if a settlement is not reached before that time, a half dozen analysts said.Starboard and other investors remain particularly frustrated by the company's rebuff of a recent shareholder vote calling for a special meeting to debate the merits of Darden's then-pending sale of Red Lobster. ""It looks pretty good at this point for the dissidents,""  Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance in Newark, Delaware, said of the brewing proxy contest at Darden.Darden's decision to leave three open board spots for Starboard suggests the company believed the activist had a reasonable chance of success, Elson said.Darden said in a statement that distractions and costs associated with Starboard's proxy contest are not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. The Orlando, Florida-based company added that it has attempted on numerous occasions to reach an agreement with Starboard and that it remains ""ready to engage"" with the activist to resolve the proxy contest.Replacing the entire Darden board ""could be significantly destabilizing to the company, disruptive to the progress being made at Olive Garden and Darden's other brands"" and put its $2.20 per share annual dividend in jeopardy, the company said. Starboard, one of Darden's biggest investors with an 8.8 percent stake, in May launched its bid to replace all of Darden's directors. Its nominees include Brad Blum, who is credited with reviving Darden's flagship Olive Garden chain during his stint as president of that brand from 1994 to 2002.Darden shares are down 4.9 percent over the past year compared with a 15 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's index  over the same period.Starboard and fellow activist Barington Capital Group LP are pushing for Darden to sell its real estate and split its mature chains such as Olive Garden from its newer, more vibrant brands like Yard House. They say those moves would boost shareholder returns. Starboard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Darden announced on July 28 that Clarence Otis, its embattled chief executive and chairman, would step down as CEO at year end. He immediately resigned as chairman and is not running for re-election to the board.The company also separated the chairman and CEO roles and said it would clear the way for a trio of Starboard's directors to be elected at its annual meeting.That announcement came the same day that Darden closed its $2.1 billion sale of Red Lobster, a deal opposed by both Starboard and Barington.Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith responded in a statement, saying Darden's changes did not go far enough. He called for ""a majority change to the board as soon as possible to jumpstart and complete the process of recruiting a truly great leader.""While Starboard's stake in Darden is not enough to achieve a coup d'etat of the board, Scott DeRue, professor of management, at University of Michigan's Ross School of Business in Ann Arbor, said it is easy to imagine that Starboard could win six or seven seats.""I have a hard time seeing it with 12. But you only need seven"" for a majority, DeRue said.

70,"   By Ramkumar Iyer  Darden Restaurants Inc posted a quarterly loss a day after the Olive Garden chain owner received an action plan from activist investor Starboard Value LP to boost its share value.Darden, however, posted a profit on an adjusted basis, sending its shares up about 2 percent in premarket trading. Customer visits to Olive Garden restaurants fell in every month of the quarter ended Aug. 24 as competition remained intense. Same-restaurant sales at the Olive Garden chain, which accounts for more than half of Darden's revenue, fell 1.3 percent. Starboard, the company's second-largest shareholder with an 8.03 percent stake, said its plan could boost Darden's stock price by $19-$38. Starboard suggested Darden enhance the image of Olive Garden as an Italian restaurant, improve its food quality and alcohol sales, and introduce technology to reduce waiting periods at restaurants, among other measures.The 300-slide plan also included tips on cooking pasta and breadsticks, which the hedge fund said were not prepared properly by Olive Garden. Darden said it would review Starboard's plan, but added that it was already implementing many of the suggestions at Olive Garden and the efforts were showing results. ""We remain open minded toward all ideas that support long-term value creation for our shareholders,"" Darden's Chief Operating Officer Gene Lee said in a statement. Starboard launched a fight to take over Darden's board in May, saying the then-pending sale of Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain was a ""destructive transaction"" that ignored the rights of shareholders. Darden announced earlier this month a revised slate of director nominees that include four new candidates, four incumbents and four open spots for Starboard picks.Analysts are divided on whether the move would satisfy Starboard and prevent it from seizing control of the entire 12-member board. Darden reported a net loss of $19.3 million, or 14 cents per share, from continuing operations for the first quarter compared with a profit of $42.2 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent to $1.59 billion.  Excluding items, the company earned 32 cents per share.Analysts on average expected a profit of 31 cents per share and revenue of $1.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Same-restaurant sales rose 2.8 percent at the LongHorn Steakhouse chain.Darden's shares closed at $48.29 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Egan-Jones re-released the information after responding to a request to review a potential material error.Darden, best known for its Italian-themed Olive Garden chain, repeatedly has said a complete turnover of the board is risky and would hand too much control of the company to Starboard. Darden's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for Oct. 10. Starboard, Darden's second-largest investor with an 8.8 percent stake, wants to improve results at the company by selling real estate, franchising restaurants and spinning off Capital Grille, Yard House and other chains.Starboard's recipe for boosting Olive Garden's limp results include salting the pasta water, giving away fewer breadsticks and selling more wine.

Starboard is Darden's second-largest shareholder with beneficial ownership of more than 11.6 million shares, which works out to a roughly 8.8 percent stake. Friday's planned vote follows a long and dramatic standoff between Darden and activists Starboard and Barington Capital Group LP, which are seeking sweeping changes at the underperforming restaurant group that also owns LongHorn Steakhouse and Capital Grille.

It was a stinging defeat for Darden, which this year alienated investors by brushing off their vote requesting a  special meeting to debate the company's then-proposed sale of its struggling Red Lobster chain.

94,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 21 (Fitch) Recent managerial changes at Darden Restaurants  have sent the company's credit default swap (CDS) spreads to levels not seen in  over a year, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest CDS case study snapshot. Five-year CDS on Darden have widened 47% over the past month.  After pricing  historically at 'BB+' levels, credit protection on Darden's debt is now pricing  a notch lower in 'BB' territory.  Increased market scrutiny for Darden is likely  attributed at least partly to senior management turnover, according to Director  Diana Allmendinger. 'Darden's replacement of its CEO and entire Board of  Directors, driven by the company's shareholders, seems to be the primary  catalyst behind the recent CDS widening,' said Allmendinger. In terms of credit quality, the verdict is still out given the tendency for  activists to increase leverage and seek short-term gains over long-term value. Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

95,"  Nov 13 Darden Restaurants Inc said it would revise management pay, ditch its poison pill and make it easier for shareholders to call special meetings as activist investor Starboard Value LP puts its stamp on the owner of the Olive Garden restaurant chain.Starboard, which owns 8.8 percent of Darden, took control of the company's board last month by winning 12 of the 13 seats and put in place its own chief executive officer and chairman.The latest changes were what Starboard had campaigned for in its months-long battle with the underperforming company, especially to block Darden from selling its struggling Red Lobster chain.Darden on Thursday said its poison pill would expire on Nov. 28 instead of May 25, removing a tactic the company had used to keep Starboard and Barington Capital Group, another activist investor, from blocking the sale of Red Lobster. The company had also brushed off Starboard's demand to call a special shareholder meeting to vote on the sale and ultimately sold the chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital for about $2.1 billion in May.Darden, whose shares were flat in late morning trade on Thursday, said a special meeting could now be called by shareholders controlling 10 percent of voting shares. The company, which also owns the Yard House, LongHorn Steakhouse and Capital Grille chains, also said it would revise the peer group against which it benchmarked management pay to better match the company's size and profile. The changes also included adopting a majority voting standard to elect directors and being more transparent on political contributions and lobbying efforts, Darden said.The company said a few of the changes would be put up for shareholder approval at its 2015 annual meeting.Darden shares, which are hovering at two-year highs, were trading flat at $56.34 at 11:20 a.m. ET.

The company has suffered more than a year of traffic declines at Olive Garden, which accounts for more than half of Darden's overall revenue and about two-thirds of its profit.The company spun off its Red Lobster unit earlier this year, to focus more on the Olive Garden brand.Darden said, in a post-earnings call on Tuesday, it has been trying to cut costs at its restaurants and implement some of the Starboard-specified changes, such as boosting alcohol sales and using technology to eliminate ""false waits"" for tables. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden rose 0.5 percent in the quarter, compared with a 0.4 percent fall expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix.Sales were also helped by a steady rise in online ordering and take-out sales, the company said on the call.LongHorn Steakhouse, Darden's second-largest restaurant chain, also recorded higher-than-expected comparable sales growth of 2.6 percent growth.

106,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON May 22 Barington Capital Group won its proxy contest by scoring two board seats at Eastern Co  this week as shareholders widely backed the activist hedge fund's call to add new blood at the industrial hardware maker.Shareholders elected Barington Chief Executive Officer James Mitarotonda and Michael McManus, CEO of medical device manufacturer Misonix Inc, to the board, the hedge fund said on Friday, citing numbers from its proxy solicitor, MacKenzie Partners.Eastern was not immediately available for comment. Barington, which owns a 5.2 percent stake in Eastern, is one of a number of investors challenging various corporations' performance and campaigning for board seats to play a bigger role in plotting a company's future.While these activist investors are gaining new clout, a proxy contest's outcome is often uncertain, as seen when Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management failed to win board seats at DuPont this month. Mitarotonda and McManus will be the first new board members at Naugatuck, Connecticut-based Eastern since 1993. Mitarotonda has already put the 157-year old company on notice for being too stuck in old-fashioned ways.""After years of seeing no significant new initiatives being introduced by management that we believe are likely to meaningfully improve long-term shareholder value, we can wait no longer - it is time for decisive action and change at Eastern,"" Mitarotonda wrote to Eastern CEO Leonard Leganza earlier in the year. Mitarotonda has also publicly pushed Eastern to improve its financial performance and share price, which has climbed 11.8 percent since January to trade at $19.09 on Friday. Barington made its campaign public in early February.Barington, which holds stakes in Darden Restaurants Inc  and software and e-commerce company Ebix Inc, has posted a return of more than 15 percent so far this year, an investor said.

The investor's efforts eventually resulted in a revamp of the company's board and management.Darden said on Tuesday said it would transfer about 430 restaurants, mostly Olive Garden properties, to the REIT this year and lease back most of the properties.Darden also listed 75 properties for individual sale-lease backs, with most of these deals expected to close by the end of August.The company, which has more than 1,500 restaurants, said it would use the proceeds from the transactions to pay down about $1 billion of debt. After completing the conversion, the REIT will distribute profit for the year ending Dec. 31 as dividend, with about 20 percent in cash and the rest in shares of the REIT, Darden said.Darden's announcement follows retailer Sears Holdings Corp's (SHLD.O) decision in April to raise more than $2.5 billion by forming a REIT with 254 of its stores.Department store operator Macy's Inc (M.N) is also being pushed by several hedge funds to consider options for its real estate, including selling and leasing back some major sites. The company did not say how much it plans to raise from the REIT and leaseback transactions.Darden is also looking to sell and lease back its headquarters in Orlando, Florida. Traffic at Olive Garden rose in March, the first increase since October, but fell again in April and May. Sales, however, rose 14 percent in the fourth quarter ended May 31, partly helped by higher pricing.The company also forecast a better-than-expected full-year adjusted profit, and said it expected same-restaurant sales to grow 2-2.5 percent.JP Morgan and Moelis & Co advised Darden on financial matters for the transaction, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was legal advisers.

109,"  * To move 430 restaurants to REIT* Lists another 75 properties for sale-lease backs* Shares hit record high of $73.40   (Adds details from conference call, updates shares)June 23 Darden Restaurants Inc said it plans to separate some of its restaurants into a publicly traded real estate investment trust as part of changes engineered by activist investor Starboard Value LP.Shares of Darden, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, rose almost 6 percent to a record high of $73.40 on Tuesday.Starboard, while agitating for change at the restaurant operator last year, had called for transferring some of Darden's restaurants into a REIT. The investor's efforts eventually resulted in a revamp of the company's board and management. Darden said on Tuesday said it would transfer about 430 restaurants, mostly Olive Garden properties, to the REIT this year and lease back most of the properties.Darden also listed 75 properties for individual sale-lease backs, with most of these deals expected to close by the end of August.The company, which has more than 1,500 restaurants, said it would use the proceeds from the transactions to pay down about $1 billion of debt. After completing the conversion, the REIT will distribute profit for the year ending Dec. 31 as dividend, with about 20 percent in cash and the rest in shares of the REIT, Darden said.Darden's announcement follows retailer Sears Holdings Corp's  decision in April to raise more than $2.5 billion by forming a REIT with 254 of its stores.Department store operator Macy's Inc is also being pushed by several hedge funds to consider options for its real estate, including selling and leasing back some major sites. The company did not say how much it plans to raise from the REIT and leaseback transactions.Darden is also looking to sell and lease back its headquarters in Orlando, Florida.Traffic at Olive Garden rose in March, the first increase since October, but fell again in April and May. Sales, however, rose 14 percent in the fourth quarter ended May 31, partly helped by higher pricing.The company also forecast a better-than-expected full-year adjusted profit, and said it expected same-restaurant sales to grow 2-2.5 percent.JP Morgan and Moelis & Co advised Darden on financial matters for the transaction, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was legal advisers.

111,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Darden Restaurant Inc's plans unveiled this week to spin off some of its holdings into a real estate investment trust points to a gold mine others can tap, but a recent statement by the U.S. tax authority raises cautionary flags.Darden on Tuesday said it would place 430 of its restaurants into a REIT to extract unrealized value from its properties in  a tax-free spin-off, similar to a move announced in April that could raise $2.5 billion for struggling retailer Sears Holdings Corp.Several hedge funds also have asked U.S. department store company Macy's Inc to explore options for its real estate, Reuters reported earlier in June.But the Internal Revenue Service in May said it is reviewing the U.S. tax code that allows companies to spin off assets tax free. The IRS was responding to inquiries about whether it would change its review practices when the operation being spun off is small relative to other assets.A so-called ""active trade or business"" at one time was needed to represent at least 5 percent of the company, but it was revoked, said Christopher Mangin, a partner at Hunton & Williams in Richmond, Virginia who has worked on REIT spin-offs. ""Now there's sort of a no-man's land,"" he said. ""People don't really know if that still applies or the fact that they revoked it means that they don't really think about it that way anymore.""Time will tell whether the IRS's statement has a detrimental effect on corporate spin-off plans, Mangin said.IRS lawyer Isaac Zimbalist read a statement to an American Bar Association meeting in Washington on May 19 that the spin-off provision had attracted public attention, and ""we are thinking about it,"" he said. ""But we have made no decisions as to the current ruling practice, as to whether to issue guidance regarding this aspect and related aspects of spin-offs, or as to what the substance of any guidance might be,"" Zimbalist said.Gene Lee, Darden's chief executive, told analysts on Tuesday that the company believed the operating business it plans to spin-off meets all applicable laws. ""We have been watching developments closely and recognize that the IRS is reviewing its ruling practice in this area,"" he said. Shares in Yahoo Inc fell 7.6 percent the day of the IRS statement on worries that a change in U.S. tax regulations would affect Yahoo's expected spin-off of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Yahoo said it understood the IRS  statement was not specific to its planned spin-off.  Nick Gruidl, a partner at tax consultants McGladrey LLP in Washington, said renting real estate back to the business that just spun it off generally will not qualify for an exemption of Section 355 of the tax code, and can lead to double taxation.""The big issue is, does this real estate activity qualify, and in many cases it will not,"" Gruidl said. ""So because of the potential downside with a taxable 355, they'll make sure to transfer a small active trade or business,"" he said, referring to Darden.

112,"  (Adds details on the REIT, analyst comment)Sept 22 Darden Restaurants Inc reported quarterly profit that topped Wall Street estimates as menu changes and improved service at its Olive Garden restaurants helped lure more diners through its doors.Shares in the company, which has been restructuring under its largest investor Starboard Value LP, fell 1.2 percent to $69.42 amid a broader market decline blamed on continued anxiety over a possible U.S. interest rate increase. Some analysts said Darden's results were only roughly inline with some lofty investor expectations.Darden's sales at established Olive Garden restaurants were up 2.7 percent in the first quarter, helped by a long hoped-for increase in traffic.The company, whose other chains include LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille, Yard House and Seasons 52, raised its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings from continuing operations to a range of $3.15 to $3.30 per share from $3.05 to $3.20 previously. That increase was less than the magnitude of the profit beat for the first quarter, Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said in a client note. Excluding items, Darden earned 68 cents per share from continuing operations. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 58 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Darden sold its Red Lobster chain of seafood restaurants last year to focus on Olive Garden, its biggest chain by sales. It has raised some prices, while focusing on value lunch offerings at Olive Garden. It also has worked to improve service and ambience at its restaurants after Starboard ousted Darden's board in October.Darden executives said they are moving forward with plans to spin off 488 restaurants. That includes the sale-leaseback of 64 units and a real estate investment trust (REIT), called Four Corners Property Trust Inc, that will include 424 restaurants. Activist investors have been pushing Darden, McDonald's Corp  and other companies to form REITs to ""unlock"" the value in their buildings and land.The Internal Revenue Service recently said it would no longer sign off on any tax-exempt status for such transactions in advance, stirring uncertainty.Darden Treasurer Bill White said the company does not believe the new IRS guidance will affect its plans. He said that Darden intends to complete the deals by the end of the calendar year.

114,"   By Michael Flaherty and Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Early in August, a call came into Sysco Corp from Trian Fund Management LP, warning the food distributor that the activist hedge fund was about to disclose a large stake in the company.Trian, run by veteran investor Nelson Peltz, unveiled its 7.1 stake in Sysco on Aug. 14, and asked for board representation and for the Houston-based company to improve its profitability and return money to shareholders.Six days later, Sysco awarded two board seats to Trian.For Sysco, it was better to reach a quick agreement than risk a drawn-out battle, a sentiment increasingly felt across Corporate America.""That's a significant amount of shares (owned by Trian), and we're at a key point in the business right now, and really, they have a history of bringing value to corporations,"" said Sysco Chief Executive Bill DeLaney in an interview, recounting the Trian approach to Reuters. ""We didn't want to have a lot of disruption and a lot of uncertainty in the business.""In the case of Cheniere Energy Inc, Carl Icahn needed just 18 days to clinch a deal for two board seats after the activist bought 8.2 percent of the liquefied natural gas company in August. ConAgra Foods Inc agreed to a board settlement with Jana Partners in July, three weeks after the activist investor scooped up shares of the processed food company.While not all companies are as quick to cut a deal as Sysco and Cheniere, data reviewed by Reuters shows that corporate management teams are reaching agreements with activists at the fastest pace since the financial crisis.The average number of days it takes companies to reach a settlement with activists threatening a proxy contest from the time of disclosure is 56, according to media and research firm Activist Insight, down from 83 days in 2010 - the furthest back the firm's data on the subject goes.The quickening pace of activist settlements shows how dissident shareholders are reshaping the way chief executives manage their businesses and their boardrooms. Backed by powerful institutional investors, activists are moving from outside agitators to influential insiders.Some investors worry that companies are bowing to activists' demands too easily, to the detriment of their long-term shareholders' interests.""Boards have become quick on the trigger to grant seats to activist investors just to avoid a proxy fight,"" said Scott Stringer, New York City's Comptroller, who called the trend ""disturbing."" When decisions are made before shareowners can weigh in with a vote, ""companies run the risk of prioritizing short-term expediency at the expense of long-term value,"" said Stringer, who runs the $165.5 billion New York City Employees' Retirement System.SELF-EXAMINATION Activists typically acquire chunks of companies, and then push the company's management team to make changes to boost shares, such as buying back stock, selling poorly performing units, or restructuring the business. The most effective way for an activist to effect change is by being on the board of directors.Companies previously could depend on large institutional investors, such as pension and mutual funds, to back their management teams in the event of a proxy fight. That guarantee has steadily faded. According to Proxy Insight, the percentage of dissident proxy cards that BlackRock, T.Rowe Price and Vanguard have voted to support - meaning they supported at least one dissident board candidate - has increased every year since 2011. For T. Rowe Price, the percentage has doubled to 50 percent, the Proxy Insight data show.Last October, activist Starboard Value LP won an standoff with Darden Restaurants Inc, convincing shareholders to replace the entire board of the Olive Garden parent - with BlackRock and State Street voting in support of the dissident slate. Darden shares have jumped 36 percent since the board's ouster.Advisors to companies on activist situations say that, while some settlements may look fast based on when activists go public with their stake, some occur after lengthy, behind-the-scenes discussions with companies and their other shareholders. These advisors also concede that executives will still fight if necessary, especially against smaller upstart funds that have less clout.In the case of Sysco, the company was up against a board nomination deadline and one of its industry's most venerable investors. Peltz has agitated at several food and beverage companies. He was instrumental, for example, in carving out snacks maker Mondelez International Inc from Kraft Foods Inc in 2011.Sysco unveiled last week a three-year plan to achieve at least $400 million in annual operating income growth through efficiencies and cost cuts. It said it was working on the plan before Trian showed up.""I think companies are starting to conduct a type of self-examination when they receive a phone call or letter from an activist,"" said Francis Byrd, an independent corporate governance consultant in New York. ""Where companies are doing their homework, they will say, 'maybe these folks might have a point'"". DISRUPTIVE BATTLES When chemical conglomerate DuPont won its proxy fight against Trian in May, its victory was seen as a potential blow to activists that could embolden more boards to fight dissidents to the bitter end. But 2015 has been marked more by truces than battles.One reason is the increasing aversion toward a proxy fight.A study published last month by professors at the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs Business School referred to research that said the average cost of a proxy fight for both sides is around $10.7 million. DuPont, which spent $15 million to fight Trian, has seen its stock drop 33 percent since the May win, shedding almost $21 billion in market value.For furniture company Ethan Allen, which is under siege by Sandell Asset Management, such a proxy cost is more significant. If the $824 million company spends the average amount of money to fight Sandell, it would equal about one-third of Ethan Allen's free cash flow, according to Thomson Reuters data. Beyond the price tag, companies are seeking to avoid the distraction of an activist campaign that gets nasty.Activists are also becoming more successful in winning the support of other shareholders, such as mutual, index and pension funds, which in turn are putting pressure on companies to settle. For their part, companies no longer see giving one or two seats to an activist as particularly dilutive to their board.Peltz, for example, is known for his food industry expertise and for working closely with management teams rather than against them.While every proxy fight is different, the overall odds are not favorable to companies itching to fight, and this can also make them reluctant to participate in a protracted dispute. In proxy fights where board seats were sought at U.S. corporations, the dissident shareholders' success rate rose to 73.1 percent last year, compared to less than half in 2012, according to data from research firm FactSet.""What would happen in the past, the board would say, 'thanks-but-no-thank you,'"" said Byrd.

Beyond the price tag, companies are seeking to avoid the distraction of an activist campaign that gets nasty.Activists are also becoming more successful in winning the support of other shareholders, such as mutual, index and pension funds, which in turn are putting pressure on companies to settle. For their part, companies no longer see giving one or two seats to an activist as particularly dilutive to their board.Peltz, for example, is known for his food industry expertise and for working closely with management teams rather than against them.While every proxy fight is different, the overall odds are not favorable to companies itching to fight, and this can also make them reluctant to participate in a protracted dispute. In proxy fights where board seats were sought at U.S. corporations, the dissident shareholders' success rate rose to 73.1 percent last year, compared to less than half in 2012, according to data from research firm FactSet.""What would happen in the past, the board would say, 'thanks-but-no-thank you,'"" said Byrd.

124,"   By Michael Flaherty and Liana B. Baker  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Wednesday agreed to add four new independent directors to its board, bowing to pressure from activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP and averting a proxy fight ahead of its upcoming annual meeting.The agreement shows Yahoo's board and management team were under pressure from major shareholders to settle the battle, and that Starboard was willing to set aside its plan for board control in favor of immediate director seats inside the struggling Internet company.A truce with its most vocal activist investor helps Yahoo clear the way for the auction of its core businesses, which is underway.Yahoo said Starboard Chief Executive Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him will join the board immediately. Yahoo's four new directors were on Starboard's slate that the hedge fund proposed last month to overthrow Yahoo's entire board.The two sides spoke frequently about ways to avoid putting the fate of the board in the hands of shareholders, according to people involved with the negotiations, but it was not until recently that a deal came into focus. Starboard and Yahoo executives were set to meet in March to discuss ways to avoid a proxy fight, but those talks broke down after Yahoo appointed two new board members, said the people, who did not want to be named.Key to the agreement is that Smith is also joining Yahoo's strategic review committee, which is overseeing the company's sale of its core business - a process Smith has aggressively pushed. For Starboard's Smith, the concession is being part of that key committee even though the deal does not give him board control, said Eric Jackson, managing director at SpringOwl Asset Management, a fund that owns Yahoo shares.""The decision point for Smith was, 'Do we want to be inside the tent when a deal goes down or do we want to be sitting on the outside hoping the board does the right thing?'"" Jackson said.Separately, Starboard struck an agreement with Marvell Technology Group (MRVL.O) on Wednesday. Yahoo said in a statement that two incumbent directors, Lee Scott and Sue James, would step down at the annual meeting. With the addition of the four new directors, Yahoo's board will have 11 members. Yahoo has not set a formal date for its annual meeting, but historically it is held in late June. Yahoo's agreement with Starboard means the company can now put the prospect of a costly and distracting proxy fight behind it, and focus on the sale of its core search business, which is fielding bids from potential buyers such as Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N).The company also faces the complication of sorting out its connection to Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), which owns 43 percent of Yahoo Japan Corp, and China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), in which Yahoo holds a 15.5 percent stake. CORE SALE Starboard, which owns about 1.7 percent of Yahoo, has been pushing for changes at the company since 2014. The activist hedge fund took aim at Yahoo's leadership in a January letter, implying that Mayer and top officials needed to go. Yahoo was started by Jerry Yang and David Filo in a Stanford University dorm room, and the search company quickly became a tech-boom darling in the late 1990s. But starting from just before the 2008 financial crisis, the company has constantly been under threat from activist shareholders unhappy with its performance, including hedge fund heavyweights Carl Icahn and Daniel Loeb of Third Point. Starboard ramped up its pressure late last year, culminating in a filing in March when it proposed to replace all of Yahoo's board, a rare move in activist investing.Yahoo's new directors aside from Smith will be tech and media industry veterans Tor Braham, Eddy Hartenstein and Richard Hill, who were part of Starboard's proposed slate.Yahoo's stock dipped 1 percent to $36.73 per share on Wednesday. ""While Starboard settled for less than control of the board ... we think the firm would only do so if it felt comfortable that other independent directors supported their publicly expressed opinion that the core should be sold,"" said SunTrust analyst Robert Peck, who rates the stock a ""buy.""

125,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Dozens of activist groups, emboldened by recent policy shifts at major U.S. restaurants, are demanding that Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants Inc change its food and labor practices.Their sweeping agenda, part of a campaign called ""Good Food Now,"" includes calls for the nation's largest full-service restaurant operator to strengthen its antibiotics policy and boost pay for employees.McDonald's USA last year committed to a timeline for moving to chicken raised without antibiotics vital to fighting human infections and to boosting average hourly pay for about 90,000 workers in its company-owned restaurants.Darden has vowed to phase out meat from farm animals that are fattened up with antibiotics that are important to human medicine by the end of this year. All of its suppliers will use human and animal antibiotics only to treat, prevent and control animal illness under the supervision of a veterinarian.McDonald's has gone further by promising to end the routine use of medically important antibiotics for disease prevention in chicken production, said Kari Hamerschlag, deputy director of Friends of the Earth's food and technology program. That is key to preventing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or superbugs, she said.  The bacteria are linked to an estimated 23,000 human deaths and 2 million illnesses every year in the United States. International alarm about the superbug threat is rising after the discovery in China of a gene called mcr-1, which makes bacteria resistant to all known antibiotics. McDonald's already is influencing the way food is produced in the United States and ""it's important that Darden also exerts that kind of pressure on the supply chain,"" Hamerschlag said. Darden operates seven different brands - including LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Eddie V's and Seasons 52. Customers of those chains have vastly different preferences, said Darden spokesman Rich Jeffers.Its upscale Seasons 52 restaurants already serve no-antibiotics-ever poultry and further changes will come at ""a pace that's right for our business,"" Jeffers said.

127,"   By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. authorities on Thursday charged a former chairman of Dean Foods Co and a professional Las Vegas gambler with engaging in an insider trading scheme that netted more than $40 million and included a tip that benefited professional golfer Phil Mickelson.William ""Billy"" Walters, who has built a multimillion-dollar fortune as a famed Las Vegas sports bettor, was accused in an indictment filed in Manhattan federal court of trading on tips from Thomas Davis, Dean Foods' former chairman.""These bets were no gamble at all,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. ""They were sure things.""Mickelson, who has won three Masters golf titles, was not criminally charged.But in a civil lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he was named as a relief defendant, not accused of wrongdoing but of receiving ill-gotten gains as a result of others' illegal acts. Mickelson agreed to pay back $1.03 million, including profit and interest, to resolve claims from his role in the scheme. The SEC said Mickelson, 45, owed Walters money after placing bets with him. It said that at that time, Walters, aware of a Dean Foods corporate spin-off, urged Mickelson to trade in the company's stock, enabling the golfer to earn $931,000 of profit.""Simply put, Mickelson made money that wasn't his to make,"" said Andrew Ceresney, the SEC's director of enforcement.Walters, 69, was arrested in Las Vegas on Wednesday night on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. He was released on Thursday on a $1 million bond following a court appearance there.Barry Berke, Walters' lawyer, said the allegations were ""based on erroneous assumptions, speculative theories and false finger-pointing.""Davis, 67, who resigned from Dean Foods' board in August, pleaded guilty on Monday.Thomas Melsheimer, Davis' lawyer, said his client was cooperating in the probe. APPELLATE RULING The charges marked the most significant insider trading case that Bharara's office has pursued since a 2014 appellate ruling limited the scope of the applicable laws, a major setback for a high-profile crackdown that began in 2009.That ruling limited authorities' ability to pursue charges against a defendant who heard a stock tip second- or third-hand that originated with a corporate insider. It made prosecuting someone like Mickelson more difficult.At a news conference, Bharara declined to say if that ruling was the reason Mickelson was not charged.But he said the decision ""has had an impact on our investigations,"" allowing some ""nefarious conduct"" to go unprosecuted.He called the ruling ""wrongly decided,"" and noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review what constitutes insider trading. Gregory Craig, Mickelson's lawyer, did not address the ruling in a statement but said the golfer felt ""vindicated"" the SEC concluded he did not engage in wrongdoing.""At the same time, however, Phil has no desire to benefit from any transaction that the SEC sees as questionable,"" Craig said.'DALLAS COWBOYS' TRADES Walters has long faced various state and federal probes in his career as one of the most successful sports bettors in the United States. In 1992, a federal jury acquitted him of charges related to illegal bookmaking.According to Thursday's indictment, from 2008 to 2014 Walters obtained inside information about Dean Foods from Davis and used it to make $32 million in profits and avoid another $11 million in trading losses.According to the indictment, Davis disclosed information to Walters about Dean Foods' financial outlook, earnings and its spin-off of WhiteWaves Food Co. The company's shares soared after the deal was announced on Aug. 8, 2012. Walters gave Davis a prepaid cellular phone for passing along inside information secretly, and instructed him to use code words, including referring to Dean Foods as the ""Dallas Cowboys,"" prosecutors said.Walters earned another $1 million trading on insider information about Darden Restaurants Inc from Davis, who was sought by an investment firm in New York as an investor or director, the indictment said.The two men have been friends since the mid-1990s, based on shared interests in sports, golf, gambling and business, according to court papers.In exchange for his tips, the indictment said Davis received significant benefits, including about $1 million in loans that largely were never repaid.The probe, conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and SEC, became public in 2014 amid news reports also linking the investigation to billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn.Investigators had examined whether Icahn passed inside information about Clorox Co to Walters, sources have told Reuters. Bharara declined to say if that aspect of the probe remained open.Icahn acknowledged last year he had a business relationship with Walters, but maintained that he has never provided inside information to anyone. ""Mr. Icahn has never been accused of any wrongdoing, and as he has said before any suggestion he engaged in improper trading is inflammatory,"" a lawyer for Icahn said on Thursday.The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v. Walters, No. 16-cr-338, U.S. v. Davis, No. 16-cr-338, and Securities and Exchange Commission v. Walters, No. 16-cv-03772.(This story corrects paragraph 9 to say Walters was arrested on Wednesday, not Tuesday, and to say he was released on Thursday, not Wednesday) (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Nate Raymond in New York; Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by David Gregorio and Cynthia Osterman)",2016-05-20,DRI,"Thu May 19, 2016 | 9:01pm EDT","CORRECTED-UPDATE 5-Ex-Dean Foods chairman, gambler charged for insider trading; Mickelson settles",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-insidertrading-idUSL2N18G0I7?type=companyNews

137,"   By Michael Flaherty  Starboard Value LP's quarterly filing on Monday showed more companies in its portfolio under takeover pressure from other activist investors. The New York hedge fund, led by Jeffrey Smith, is known for shaking up boards and pushing companies into mergers and acquisitions, as it did with Internet pioneer Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) earlier this year.Starboard's regulatory filing showed that it's also willing to let other activists do the agitating.Four of Starboard's new investments in the third quarter - all small positions ranging from $8 million to $16 million - were targets of other activist investors pushing the companies into a sale. One was outdoor retailer Cabelas Inc (CAB.N), which put itself on the auction block last year after pressure from Elliott Associates. Last month, Cabelas agreed to be bought by Bass Pro Shops.  Starboard also bought shares last quarter in another Elliott target, cyber security company Imperva Inc. (IMPV.N). Imperva sought to hire an investment bank to seek a sale earlier this year, Reuters previously reported, though no deal has surfaced yet..  Starboard is also a new investor in Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc. (FRGI.O), which is under pressure to sell itself from activist JCP Investment Management. ""They have the expertise and believe in the strategy, so it makes sense that Starboard would invest in other activist engagements,"" said Ken Squire, founder of 13D Monitor and the 13D Activist fund, which tracks activist investors.  Investing in companies under pressure from activists or acquirers is not new to Smith. Before Starboard agitated at Yahoo, for example, activists Third Point and Carl Icahn had taken a crack at the company.Starboard's latest uptick in so-called ""event driven"" stocks comes after Starboard's hiring of William Wyatt in March 2015. Wyatt came from hedge fund Empyrean Capital and joined Starboard with the remit of allocating more money toward event driven situations such as mergers, according to people familiar with the matter. Starboard declined to comment for the story. Another activist target that Starboard bought into during the quarter was Tronc Inc. (TRNC.O), the media company that successfully fended off a hostile takeover from newspaper group Gannett Co Inc. (GCI.N). The activist publicly pushing Tronc to seal the deal was not Smith but HG Vora Capital Management. Starboard's largest new position during the quarter was a $124.7 million stake in software company Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), according to the filing.
