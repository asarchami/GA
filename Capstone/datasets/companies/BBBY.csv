0,"  Jan 7 Storage products retailer Container Store Group Inc reported a third-quarter loss, hurt by costs associated with its initial public offering, sending its shares down 9 percent after the bell.Container Store, whose shares doubled in its market debut in November, reported a net loss of $9.5 million, or $1.39 per share, compared with a profit of $6.9 million, or $5.32 per share, a year earlier.The company said its net loss included $14.6 million of IPO-related stock-based compensation expense.However, on an adjusted basis, Container Store reported a profit of 11 cents per share in the quarter ended Nov. 30. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 8 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Container Store, established in Dallas in 1978, operates 62 stores in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Its rivals include Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  and privately owned Crate & Barrel. Container Store forecast full-year revenue of $754 million, below the average analyst estimate of $756.2 million.The company said it expects adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 38 cents per share. Third-quarter sales rose 7.3 percent to $188.3 million. Analysts on average had expected sales of $188.9 million. Comparable-store sales were up 4.7 percent.Coppell, Texas-based Container Store's shares were at $41.99 after the bell, down from the closing price of $45.79 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.",2014-01-07,BBBY,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 5:51pm EST","Container Store posts quarterly loss, shares fall",http://www.reuters.com//article/containerstore-results-idUSL3N0KH4BX20140107?type=companyNews
1,"  Home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) cut its full-year earnings forecast due to a lowered sales expectation and weakening margins, sending its shares down 9 percent after the bell.Bed Bath & Beyond said it now expects full-year earnings of about $4.79-$4.86 per share, down from the $4.88-$5.01 it had forecast in September.The company said it now expects fourth-quarter comparable-store sales to rise by about 2-4 percent, a reduced range compared with its previous model of a 3.5-5.5 percent increase.Net income rose to $237.2 million, or $1.12 per share, in the third quarter ended November 30, from $232.8 million, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Third-quarter gross margin fell to 39.2 percent from 39.8 percent, mainly due to higher inventory acquisition costs, an increase in promotional coupons, as well as a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower-margin categories, Chief Executive Steven Temares said in a post-earnings conference call. ""... Clearly the implication is that they sent out more coupons in order to drive the business,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Joan Storms said.Sales rose 6 percent to $2.87 billion in the third quarter, but fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2.89 billion. Comparable-store sales increased 1.3 percent in the period.Bed Bath & Beyond shares were trading at $73.16 after the bell.

The discount retailer also said it would cut jobs, shut about 370 underperforming stores and lower prices on about 1,000 basic items.* The lackluster earnings overshadowed optimistic data on the labor front, as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 300,000 last week, the lowest level in almost seven years and well below the 320,000 estimate.* Financials JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co will close out the week with results on Friday. * The S&P 500 scored its biggest gain since March 4 after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting showed a more supportive central bank than investors had previously expected.* In minutes of the Federal Reserve meeting published on Wednesday, several participants said forecasts ""overstated the shift in the projections,"" suggesting the Fed is not as eager to tighten policy as the rate forecasts had seemed to suggest.* S&P 500 e-mini futures shed 2.25 points and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures  declined 19 points and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 5.25 points. *  U.S. import prices increased 0.6 percent in March, their largest jump in three years, after an unrevised 0.9 percent increase in February, but there was little sign of a broader pickup in imported inflation.* Earlier, data in China showed exports unexpectedly fell for the second straight month in March and import growth dropped sharply, intensifying concerns about weak manufacturing and slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy.* EBay Inc and Carl Icahn ended their proxy fight, with the activist investor dropping his proposal for the e-commerce company to split off its PayPal payments unit and withdrawing two nominees for the eBay board. EBay shares dipped 1.3 percent to $55.15 in premarket.* Imperva Inc plunged 34.1 percent to $32.75 in premarket trade after the data center security company reported preliminary fist-quarter results. Rival FireEye Inc  lost 3.2 percent to $54.60 before the opening bell.* But Rite Aid Corp was a bright spot as shares jumped 9.5 percent to $7.01 premarket after the drugstore chain posted fourth-quarter earnings and provided its full-year outlook.

Expectations call for claims to fall to 320,000 versus the 326,000 reported in the prior week.* The S&P 500 scored its biggest gain since March 4 after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting showed a more supportive central bank than investors had previously expected. * In minutes of the Federal Reserve meeting published on Wednesday, several participants said forecasts ""overstated the shift in the projections,"" suggesting the Fed is not as eager to tighten policy as the rate forecasts had seemed to suggest.* S&P 500 e-mini futures shed 0.25 point and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.

Bed, Bath & Beyond shares were trading up 5.4 percent to $66.05 in premarket trading after the home furnishings retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue as increased discounting and promotions helped attract more shoppers to its stores.Should the gains hold throughout the session, it would mark the biggest percentage jump for the stock since April 2012.U.S. stock index futures were trading modestly higher on Wednesday, putting the S&P 500 on track to snap a three-session losing skid, ahead of data on the housing market. Providing support was a renewed pledge by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to keep monetary policy loose for an extended period to push inflation in the euro zone closer to the two percent level.New home sales data for August is due at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT).

""There was this tale of two cities, with very strong job gains but on the flip side a continued real moderation in wage growth. I think the market looked at that and was sort of confused about what that means,"" said Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial in Boston.""I actually think it's the best-case scenario. It showcases the U.S. economy is continuing to grow and repair the labor market, but at the same time, the muted wage growth means the Fed's going to stay lower for longer.""Fourth-quarter results from S&P 500 companies pick up next week, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo . Both were among the biggest drags Friday, with JPMorgan down 1.7 percent at $59.34 and Wells Fargo down 1.6 percent at $52.68.

Friday's decline followed two days of more than 1 percent gains for the market, a rally fueled in part by minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, which reassured investors the central bank was in no hurry to start raising interest rates.For the week, the Dow and Nasdaq were down 0.5 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.6 percent.Oil prices resumed their slide after two days of relative calm, with Brent and U.S. crude lowest since April 2009 on persistent worry over a supply glut.

The market extended its gains in afternoon trading, putting the S&P 500 about 1.3 percent away from its record close. Equities have struggled for direction of late, with investors seeing limited upside potential in equities, but also few alternatives for yield. Many investors are looking ahead to the first-quarter earnings season for market guidance.Earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen falling 2.8 percent in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with the rise of 5.3 percent that had been forecast on Jan. 1.The drop in profits, especially for companies with multi-national exposure, is partially attributable to strength in the U.S. dollar. However, analysts said the currency impact would not necessarily be a long-term detriment to stock prices.""To the extent the dollar means companies are losing business, it's a problem, but if earnings are just being translated into a stronger dollar, that's less of a problem,"" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust Asset Management in Chicago.

Markets have struggled for direction of late, with investors seeing limited upside potential in equities, but also few alternatives for yield.Recent economic data has been mixed, with the stronger numbers backing the idea that the Federal Reserve should begin raising interest rates and weak data possibly indicating less economic readiness for a rate hike.

33,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) was sued on Tuesday on behalf of consumers who said the world's largest retailer sold products falsely labeled ""100 % Egyptian Cotton"" from an Indian textile company for many years after it first became suspicious of their origin.According to the complaint, Wal-Mart questioned the fiber content of Welspun India Ltd's (WLSP.NS) products as early as 2008, but waited until two months ago to halt sales of its mislabeled Egyptian cotton bed linens, following a similar halt by Target Corp (TGT.N).The plaintiff, Dorothy Monahan of Michigan, said she overpaid at a Wal-Mart for Better Homes and Gardens bed linens made by Welspun that she thought were made of Egyptian cotton, and therefore higher quality than cheaper bed linens.She accused Wal-Mart of violating U.S. laws governing textile fiber labeling and advertising, and is seeking damages for everyone who has bought bed linens at Wal-Mart made by Welspun and labeled ""100% Egyptian Cotton.""""We plan to vigorously defend the company,"" a Wal-Mart spokesman said. He said the retailer removed such products after conducting a comprehensive review nearly two months ago and since then has offered customers a full refund.

34,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) was sued on Tuesday on behalf of consumers who said the world's largest retailer sold products falsely labeled ""100 % Egyptian Cotton"" from an Indian textile company for many years after it first became suspicious of their origin.According to the complaint, Wal-Mart questioned the fiber content of Welspun India Ltd's (WLSP.NS) products as early as 2008, but waited until two months ago to halt sales of its mislabeled Egyptian cotton bed linens, following a similar halt by Target Corp (TGT.N).The plaintiff, Dorothy Monahan of Michigan, said she overpaid at a Wal-Mart for Better Homes and Gardens bed linens made by Welspun that she thought were made of Egyptian cotton, and therefore higher quality than cheaper bed linens.She accused Wal-Mart of violating U.S. laws governing textile fiber labeling and advertising, and is seeking damages for everyone who has bought bed linens at Wal-Mart made by Welspun and labeled ""100% Egyptian Cotton.""""We plan to vigorously defend the company,"" a Wal-Mart spokesman said. He said the retailer removed such products after conducting a comprehensive review nearly two months ago and since then has offered customers a full refund.
