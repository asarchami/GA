0,"  By Phil WahbaNEW YORK Jan 9 Many large U.S. retailers slashed their earnings forecasts on Thursday because of steep discounts they offered during the holidays to persuade reluctant consumers.The discounts boosted overall industry sales but hurt profits at many chains, including L Brands Inc, Family Dollar Stores Inc and teen retailer Zumiez Inc. Even retailers that reported big sales gains, like Kay Jewelers parent Signet Jewelers Ltd, were not spared.Fewer store visits and aggressive pricing at the start of the season by big retailers like Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc left many chains with little choice but to offer sweeter deals. Many also had too much holiday merchandise, which was ordered in late spring when retail executives were feeling upbeat.""The discounts needed to be deeper, and they needed to be longer,"" said Joel Bines, managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners.The discounts did result in a stronger-than-expected 2.4 percent increase in December sales at nine retailers tracked by the Thomson Reuters Same-Store Sales Index.Still, L Brands cut its holiday-quarter profit forecast on disappointing December sales at its Victoria Secret and La Senza chains.While L Brands' sales at stores open at least year rose 2 percent last month, Wall Street had been expecting a gain of 3.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's shares fell more than 4 percent. Zumiez reported an unexpected drop in same-store sales.Shares of Signet, which is not part of the same-store sales index, were down more than 6 percent even though it reported a 5 percent increase in U.S. same-store sales for the November-December holiday season.Gap Inc reported a lower-than-expected 1 percent increase in comparable sales, hurt by weak business at its Old Navy chain, but the retailer said it was ""comfortable"" its full-year profit would come in at the high end of its own forecast range. Shares rose 2 percent in after hours trading.Sears Holdings, which is not in the same-store sales index, reported dismal holiday results at its namesake and KMart stores. Its shares tumbled after hours. Toys R Us, also not in the index, said same-store sales were up 1.8 percent at its U.S. stores.DEALS, AND MORE DEALS Between Nov. 3 and Jan. 4, eight retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Macy's Inc , increased the number of circulars published by 6 percent and sent 57 percent more promotional e-mails, according to data prepared for Reuters by MarketTrack. Retailers also had to deal with shoppers who were less willing to go into stores: Data firm ShopperTrak this week said foot traffic had dropped 14.6 percent this holiday season.Walgreen Co, whose comparable sales of general merchandise rose 2.5 percent in December, said fewer shoppers had come to its drugstores.Small clothing chain Cato Corp also slashed its profit forecast after reporting poor December sales.Still, some retailers offering staples at low prices fared well. Warehouse club chain Costco Wholesale Corp  reported a 5 percent gain in U.S. same-store sales for December, while Wall Street was expecting only 1 percent.American Eagle Outfitters Inc said comparable sales for November and December fell 7 percent and that it expected its quarterly profit to come in at the bottom of its earlier forecast range of 26 cents to 30 cents per share.Family Dollar's same-store sales fell 3 percent last month.American Eagle and Family Dollar are not part of the same-store sales index.",2014-01-09,LB,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 5:18pm EST",UPDATE 3-Discounts slam U.S. retailers' holiday season profits,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-retail-december-idUSL2N0KJ18A20140109?type=companyNews
1,"   By Phil Wahba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 9 Many U.S. retailers had to ramp up promotions last month as shoppers continued to watch their spending during the holiday season, hitting profits at several chains.L Brands cut its earnings forecast for the holiday quarter on Thursday after reporting disappointing December sales at its Victoria Secret and La Senza chains. The company said it had to offer more deals than expected, the second month in a row it has had to do so.Family Dollar Stores Inc and teen retailer Zumiez Inc, which both reported sales declines for December, also slashed their profit forecasts. Even retailers that saw big sales gains, like Kay Jewelers parent Signet Jewelers Ltd , were not spared.""Additional discounting was necessary in a highly promotional retail environment,"" Signet Chief Executive Officer Mike Barnes said in a statement.A group of nine U.S. retailers in the Thomson Reuters same-store sales index are expected on Thursday to report a sales rise of 1.9 percent in December at stores open at least a year, well below the 7.2 percent increase of a year earlier.Including drugstore chains Walgreen Co and Rite Aid Corp, analysts estimate the rise at 2.7 percent. Gap Inc will report after the markets close on Thursday.Faced with reticent shoppers worried about their job prospects and modest economic growth, retailers offered more discounts during the holiday season than a year earlier.Between Nov. 3 and Jan. 4, eight retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Macy's Inc , increased the number of circulars published by 6 percent and sent 57 percent more promotional e-mails, according to data prepared for Reuters by MarketTrack. Retailers also had to deal with shoppers who were less willing to go into stores: Data firm ShopperTrak this week said foot traffic had dropped 14.6 percent this holiday season.Walgreen, whose comparable sales of general merchandise rose 2.5 percent in December, said fewer shoppers had come to its stores. Signet's Barnes said more enticing deals were needed to attract customers.L Brands' sales at stores open at least year rose 2 percent last month, less than the 3.7 percent Wall Street expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Zumiez reported an unexpected drop in same-store sales. Small clothing chain Cato Corp also slashed its profit forecast after reporting poor December sales.Still, some chains offering staples at low prices fared well: Costco Wholesale Corp, which draws shoppers with low prices for its members, reported a 5 percent same-store U.S. sales gain for December, while Wall Street was expecting only 1 percent.American Eagle Outfitters Inc said comparable sales for November and December fell 7 percent and that it expected its quarterly profit to come in at the bottom of its earlier forecast range of 26 cents to 30 cents per share.Signet's U.S. comparable sales rose 5 percent for the combined November-December period. Family Dollar's same-store sales fell 3 percent last month.American Eagle, Signet and Family Dollar are not part of the same-store sales index.

5,"  * Strong sales for JCP despite unusually warm weather* Company's shares up 4 pct* Shares of Kohl's, Wal-Mart, Target also up   (Adds details, shares)Jan 7 Department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc said same-store sales surged during the holiday shopping months of November and December, spurring shares of retailers on a day global stock markets dropped on concerns over the Chinese economy.Same-store sales rose 3.9 percent in the last two months of the year due to higher online sales and strong demand for the company's private-label offerings and gift products, J.C. Penney said on Thursday.The company's strong performance came despite unusually warm weather during the year's winter months, which hurt sales of apparel such as sweaters, coats and gloves. It was also in stark contrast to rival Macy's Inc, which on Wednesday said 80 percent of its 4.7 percent drop in same-store sales was due to the warmer-than-usual winter.Investors, however, pushed shares of Macy's higher on Thursday after the company also said it would cut thousands of jobs and shut stores in a bid to boost profits. Several apparel retailers, including Victoria's Secret owner L Brands Inc and sportswear maker Zumiez Inc, also reported on Thursday better-than-expected comparable sales.The results cheered investors of consumer discretionary stocks on a day market volatility in China and a relentless slide in oil prices sparked a selloff in global markets.J.C. Penney's shares rose 4 percent to $7.28 in afternoon trading, while Kohl's Corp was up 2.4 percent at $51.29. Stocks of big box retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp were also up more than a percent. ""Despite unprecedented warm weather that significantly affected apparel sales across the company, our focus on private brands, enhanced omnichannel execution and compelling gift giving selection resulted in strong holiday sales,"" J.C. Penney Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said in a statement.Ellison also attributed the strong sales to its online business, which posted record sales during the holiday season.J.C. Penney also reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings target of $645 million before taxes and the company said it planned to generate positive free cash flow in fiscal 2015.Up to Wednesday's close of $7.00, J.C. Penney's shares had risen 7 percent in 12 months, compared with a nearly 1 percent drop in the S&P 500 index.

17,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for L  Brands, Inc. (L Brands), including the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at  'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end  of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect L Brands' strong brand recognition and dominant market  positions in intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, and strong  operating results, all of which are characteristic of an investment-grade  profile. While credit metrics have been reasonable, with leverage at or slightly  below 3.5x since 2010, the 'BB+' rating considers the company's track record of  shareholder-friendly activities which could push leverage above this range.  L Brands' strong business profile is anchored by its two flagship brands,  Victoria's Secret (approximately 63% of sales and operating income including the  Victoria's Secret direct business) and Bath & Body Works (approximately 30% of  sales and 36% of operating income); a strong direct business (16% of total  revenue); and a growing international footprint.  The company's strong comparable store sales (comps) trends since the recession  have been driven by relevant and attractive product offerings and a loyal  customer base. Comps increased 5% in 2015, following a 2% increase in 2013 and  4% in 2014. In addition to positive operating leverage from strong comps growth,  the company has driven margin growth through efficient inventory and expense  management. EBITDA margins in the 20%+ range compare favorably to the broader  retail average in the low teens. The years 2016 and 2017 are expected to be affected negatively by the company's  recent actions at Victoria's Secret to streamline operations as well as  investments related to grow Victoria's Secret in North America and transition  China to a company-operated market (previously franchised). Notably, the company  is eliminating certain merchandise categories such as swimwear and certain  apparel categories representing a total of $525 million in volume (4% of total  sales) beginning mid-2016. Factoring in the swimwear/apparel volume loss, Fitch expects 2016 revenue growth  to be up modestly on flattish comps and 4% square-footage growth, while 2017  revenue is expected to be up in the 4% range on comps of 1%-2% and 2%-3%  square-footage growth. The combination of flattish comps, margin degradation on  inventory clearance activity and price investments to drive sales in key  categories, and investments in the China rollout is projected to yield a 3%-5%  decline in EBITDA in 2016 to the $2.6 billion range. However, EBITDA margin is  expected to remain in excess of 20% in 2016 and 2017.  The growth of PINK in the U.S., which could be a $3 billion business over the  next few years from our estimate of $2.5 billion currently, and the inclusion of  the full lingerie lines in expanded Victoria's Secret stores have led to  increased productivity per square foot over the past few years. PINK, a  collegiate-focused brand which offers intimate apparel, loungewear and related  products in vibrant colors and patterns, has expanded Victoria Secret's  demographic base by appealing to younger consumers. International expansion  provides a strong top-line and profit opportunity by allowing the company to  diversify outside of mall-based locations and reduce operational and execution  risks through its substantially franchised model (outside of the UK and Canadian  markets). KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects L Brands to produce flattish comps (excluding its direct  business) in 2016, improving to the 1%-2% range in 2017, factoring in the loss  of apparel/swimwear business; --Square footage expansion, if executed successfully, could drive overall  top-line growth to modestly positive in 2016 and in the 3%-5% range thereafter; --Free cash flow (FCF) after regular dividends of negative $100 million to  breakeven after regular dividends over the next two to three years given  increased capex spend;  --Capex is expected to increase to approximately $950 million in 2016 from $727  million in 2015 reflecting new store constructions and square footage expansion  and stay in that range thereafter; --Leverage is expected to be in the mid-3x range with future debt-funded special  dividends or share buybacks potentially pushing leverage higher than 3.3x in  2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would require both the continuation of positive  operating trends and a public commitment to maintain financial leverage in the  low 3x range. A negative rating action could be driven by a trend of negative comps and/or  margin compression from fashion misses, execution missteps or loss of  competitive traction. A larger than expected debt-financed share repurchase or  special dividend and/or leverage rising to 4x would be negative for the rating. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Liquidity is strong, supported by a cash balance of $1.3 billion as of July 30,  2016 and the company's $1 billion revolving credit facility. The company has a  comfortable maturity profile and Fitch considers refinancing risk low given L  Brands' strong business profile, favorable operating trends, and reasonable  leverage. Fitch expects FCF after regular dividends of negative $100 million to breakeven  after regular dividends over the next two to three years given increased capex  spend. Fitch assumes regular dividends will be increased by approximately 10%,  compared with the 10%-25% increase over the last few years. Capex is expected to  increase to $950 million in 2016 from the $700 million range annually in  2014-2015, reflecting new store constructions and square footage expansion to  primarily support PINK and international growth (square footage to grow by  approximately 4% in 2016). Lease-adjusted leverage stood at 3.3x as of Jan. 30, 2016. Fitch expects the  company to maintain a leverage profile in the mid-3x range, and fund dividends  and share repurchases with FCF and potential debt issuances. The company's  shareholder-friendly posture is a key constraint to the rating. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed L Brands' ratings as follows:  --Long-term IDR at 'BB+'; --Secured bank credit facility at 'BBB-/RR1'; --Senior guaranteed unsecured notes at 'BB+/RR4'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BB/RR5'.
