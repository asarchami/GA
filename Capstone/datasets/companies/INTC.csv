A years-long project to provide consumer TV services was shelved last year with its technology put up for sale and the company's mobile processors have barely made a dent in the global smartphone market even after major improvements to them.After replacing former CEO Paul Otellini in May, Krzanich, a chip manufacturing and operations guru, created a new division focused on identifying future technology trends and making sure Intel is not caught off-guard again. In his keynote presentation at the technology show, Krzanich introduced some of that group's early results, including sample gadgets that Intel is promoting to consumer device manufacturers.""We're looking at a broad ecosystem of wearables, not just the device or the silicon,"" he said.The company unveiled a tiny computer built with Intel's low-power Quark technology and packaged in an SD-card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products. Luxury department store Barneys New York is collaborating with Intel to develop smart bracelets that look like they were created by a fashion designer and not by an engineer.At the event, Krzanich also showed off Intel's take on stereo earbuds for exercise enthusiasts that - as well as playing music - measure the wearer's heartbeat through their ears.While other companies have launched similar pulse-taking audiophones, Intel's are powered through a microphone jack that connects to the user's smartphone, instead of a separate power source. In addition, integrated software can automatically change the music being played in order to encourage the wearer to speed up or slow down their workout depending on their heart rate.Intel also showed off a Bluetooth earpiece and microphone that the chipmaker says improves the responsiveness of personal assistant smartphone software like Apple's Siri.

5,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp (INTC.O), hit by slumping personal computer sales, has put off opening a major chip factory that President Barack Obama once held up as an example of U.S. manufacturing potential.The ""Fab 42"" facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel's most advanced chips, will remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy.Intel's decision not to open the chip plant was first reported by the Arizona Republic on Tuesday.""The new construction is going to be left vacant for now and it will be targeted at future technologies,"" Mulloy told Reuters.Despite not opening the new factory, or fab, Intel has exceeded a target to hire over 1,000 employees since construction started in 2011, Mulloy said. Intel received state tax benefits for hiring those people.Obama, while campaigning for re-election in 2012, made a stop at the factory's construction site, where he called for government incentives to attract manufacturing lost to Asia in recent years back to the United States. Intel is the world's top chipmaker but it was caught off guard by smartphones and tablets, a computing revolution that has cut into demand for PCs, the company's core business.Global PC shipments fell 10 percent in 2013, the worst year since market research firm Gartner began tracking those products.""The newer fab has not been equipped with the capital equipment. It has heating and air conditioning but the actual tools, the expensive stuff, are not in there,"" Mulloy said. Much of Intel's strength has historically come from its chip manufacturing technology, which is the most advanced in the world and is ahead of rivals by around two years. Intel originally meant to install its most advanced manufacturing technology at the plant and make 14 nanometer microchips with transistors so tiny that over 100 million of them could fit on the head of a pin.Existing factories at the Chandler site using Intel's previous generation of manufacturing, 22 nm, are being converted to also make chips at 14 nm and many of Intel's new employees are working there, Mulloy said.""It boils down to better capital utilization,"" Mulloy said. The Santa Clara, California-based company says it makes around two thirds of its microprocessors in the United States, with others produced in Ireland, Israel and China.It is currently expanding a plant in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450 millimeters - about the size of a large pizza. The largest wafers currently used in the chip industry measure 300 mm across.Plans by Intel and big rivals like Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) to eventually expand to 450 mm will allow them to save manufacturing costs by squeezing more chips on each wafer.Intel, which on Thursday is due to report is fourth-quarter earnings, said in November it expects its revenue to be flat in 2014 compared to last year.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Bernard Orr and Alden Bentley)",2014-01-14,INTC,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 5:25pm EST",Intel shelves cutting-edge Arizona chip factory,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-intel-arizona-idUSBREA0D1F920140114?type=companyNews

13,"  (Adds detail on results, analyst's comment, background)By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO Jan 16 Intel Corp's  earnings missed expectations by a penny in the fourth quarter due to weak spending on servers and the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry.Intel said on Thursday it overestimated the extent of a recovery in spending among its data center customers and also pointed to political controversy in Washington, DC.In the December quarter, Intel's PC revenue stayed flat, which it said was slightly better than the company expected.Microsoft Corp's plan to stop supporting its Windows XP operating system in April had spurred hopes that some corporations will replace employees' PCs. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the Windows refresh had a minor impact on the quarter.Personal computer sales are losing ground to tablets and smartphones - a market Intel has been slow to enter - but some analysts believe the industry's decline is tapering, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile gadgets.The company has also bet that sales of high-end server chips will help offset lower revenue from PCs this year, as the proliferation of smartphones creates demand for data centers to provide Internet-based services like video and social media.But the 8 percent increase in server revenue in the fourth quarter was less than Intel and some analysts expected.""The incremental nugget we got from Q4 earnings was that datacenter group disappointed again,"" said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. ""Investors were anticipating a fairly healthy beat and raise."" Intel forecast revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the first quarter, which ends in March. Analysts had expected $12.79 billion on average.Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc   and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL Smith partly blamed Intel's miss in fourth-quarter server chip sales on quarreling over U.S. fiscal policy.""We saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter and we think that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,"" he told analysts.But the CFO pointed to new computing devices, such as PCs with detachable screens and other new designs, as potential growth drivers. ""The PC market was a little stronger than we thought,"" Smith told Reuters. ""What's driving PCs right now are the innovative form factors we've been working on.""At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich showed off a handful of wearable computing devices including prototype earbuds with a built-in heart rate monitor.But industry-watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a splash with consumers anytime soon and is unlikely to make up for much of the business Intel has lost due to a shrinking PC industry.Intel posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $2.6 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as the chipmaker grapples with a shrinking PC industry and finds support from demand for more servers.Wall Street had expected 52 cents a share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Fourth-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $12.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, it said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts had expected $13.72 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Intel were down 3.5 percent in extended trade on Thursday after closing 0.5 percent lower at $25.61 on the Nasdaq.One analyst pointed to heightened spending in the first quarter as potentially worrisome.""You're getting quite a bit less earnings in the first quarter than the Street may have been looking for,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman.

17,"  * Q1 slowdown seen ahead of new product launches by clients* Smartphones, wearables, Internet of Things will drive growth* Co-CEO says technology better than claimed by rival IntelBy Clare Jim and Michael GoldTAIPEI, Jan 16 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd  painted a bright outlook for its 2014 business, driven by mobile devices and improved margins from its more advanced chips.The one cloud on the horizon for the company, which beat expectations with a 7.7 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, is a forecast sales slowdown in the first quarter due to a pull-back of purchases ahead of new product launches by smartphone and tablet manufacturers.TSMC said it still expects double-digit growth in sales and profit for 2014. The company is confident that its cutting-edge technologies will help fend off competition from global rivals such as Intel Corp.TSMC is betting on a protracted boom in the mobile devices segment, which includes smartphones and wearable devices, and is investing billions of dollars to pack more processing power in ever shrinking chips.At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, ""we saw wearable devices emerging in all different kinds of forms,"" Mark Liu, one of TSMC's new co-chief executives told reporters on Thursday. ""This will serve as a new driver going forward"". He said the more complex devices will allow TSMC chips to integrate more features like fingerprint sensors, resulting in TSMC earning more dollars per smartphone sold.Liu and the other co-chief executive C.C. Wei, who joined chairman Morris Chang on stage for the first time, took issue with Intel's assertion that the U.S. company's latest technology was much more advanced.Liu told an investor conference that what Intel has shown investors was ""erroneous and based on outdated data"".""(Our latest generation process) scaling is much better than what Intel said, though still a little bit behind,"" Liu said, adding that TSMC has a ""far superior"" ability to execute a short time to market for customers than Intel and Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.Earlier this week, Intel said it has delayed opening a major factory in Arizona that was originally planned to start producing chips made from the most advanced 14 nanometer process after it was hit by slumping personal computer sales. SMALLER CHIPS This year, TSMC is speeding up its technology development to build the tiniest and most powerful chips for smartphones and tablets.TSMC, after dominating the 28-nanometer technology for several quarters, is moving to a more advanced 20-nanometer process with mass production expected this quarter. The smaller the process means more transistors can be added on to a chip, making it more powerful and efficient.It plans to start mass production using a 16 nanometer FinFET process in 2015.TSMC kept its 2014 capital spending plan at around $9.5 billion to $10 billion, the same level as last year.The plan came in below market expectations that it would target another record year of spending after laying out $9.7 billion in 2013.The Taiwanese semiconductor maker had the third-largest capital spending in the chip industry last year, trailing Samsung Electronics, which spent around $22 billion, and Intel which spent around $11 billion.On Thursday, TSMC said it posted a net profit in the fourth quarter of T$44.81 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $42 billion.The company also said it expects first-quarter revenue to fall as much as 6.7 percent from the previous quarter to between T$136 billion and T$138 billion ($4.52 billion to $4.59 billion), down from T$145.81 billion in the fourth quarter and below market forecasts of T$140.56 billion.The company blamed the projected fall on an industry undergoing an inventory correction in the supply chain due to a pull-back of component purchases ahead of new product launches by mobile gadget companies in a new year.",2014-01-16,INTC,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 5:32am EST",RPT-UPDATE 2-TSMC forecasts upbeat 2014 on mobiles and margins,http://www.reuters.com//article/tsmc-outlook-idUSL3N0KK2U620140116?type=companyNews

Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.""If they've got a bunch or resources in a market that may not be dead but is not growing a ton, it probably makes sense to reprioritize those investments in areas where there are fast-growing markets,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.Intel has both added and shed significant numbers of jobs over the past decade. Struggling to fend off a challenge by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc in 2006, Intel announced it would reduce its workforce by over 10,000 positions, but its overall number of employees has grown since then. The chipmaker is also not the only tech company to trim its workforce because of slowing demand for PCs since Apple's iPad started to cut into demand for laptops in 2010.Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a years-long internal restructuring that would ultimately see it shed 34,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce, through fiscal 2014.Dell succeeded last year in taking itself off public markets, allowing CEO and founder Michael Dell to restructure away from Wall Street's scrutiny. That overhaul is expected to encompass layoffs. Earlier this week, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel's most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded.In its report on Thursday, Intel forecast March-quarter restructuring charges of $200 million, a portion of which could be earmarked for severance pay.Last September, Intel said it would close an old factory in Massachusetts, eliminating about 700 jobs.Intel has said it plans to quadruple tablet chip volume this year to 40 million units and aggressively stake out market share ahead of future mobile chip launches. Essentially buying its way into tablets, Intel plans to subsidize its customers' engineering and manufacturing expenses, effectively reducing its gross margins in 2014 by 1.5 percentage points.Shares of Intel closed 2.6 percent lower at $25.85 on the Nasdaq on Friday.

27,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp's earnings missed expectations by a penny in the fourth quarter due to weak spending on servers, and the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry.Intel said on Thursday it overestimated the extent of a recovery in spending among its enterprise customers, sending its stock lower, and pointed to political controversy in Washington, D.C.In the December quarter, Intel's PC revenue stayed flat, which it said was slightly better than the company expected.Microsoft Corp's plan to stop supporting its Windows XP operating system in April had spurred hopes that some corporations will replace employees' PCs. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the Windows refresh had a minor impact on the quarter.Personal computer sales are losing ground to tablets and smartphones - a market Intel has been slow to enter - but some analysts believe the industry's decline is tapering, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile gadgets.The company has also bet that sales of high-end server chips will help offset lower revenue from PCs this year, as the proliferation of smartphones creates demand for data centers to provide Internet-based services like video and social media.But Smith said Intel's data center group revenues in 2014 would probably come in toward the bottom of his previous growth estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent.The 8 percent increase in server revenue in the fourth quarter was less than Intel and some analysts expected.""The incremental nugget we got from Q4 earnings was that datacenter group disappointed again,"" Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. ""Investors were anticipating a fairly healthy beat and raise."" Intel forecast revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the first quarter, which ends in March. Analysts had expected $12.79 billion on average.Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them.HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL Smith partly blamed Intel's miss in fourth-quarter server chip sales on quarreling over U.S. fiscal policy. ""We saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter, and we think that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,"" he told analysts.But the CFO pointed to new computing devices, such as PCs with detachable screens and other new designs, as potential growth drivers.""The PC market was a little stronger than we thought,"" Smith told Reuters. ""What's driving PCs right now are the innovative form factors we've been working on.""At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich showed off a handful of wearable computing devices, including prototype earbuds with a built-in heart rate monitor. But industry watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a splash with consumers any time soon and is unlikely to make up for much of the business that Intel has lost due to a shrinking PC industry.Intel posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $2.6 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as the chipmaker grapples with a shrinking PC industry and finds support from demand for more servers.Wall Street had expected 52 cents a share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Fourth-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $13.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, it said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts had expected $13.72 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Intel slid 4.8 percent in extended-hours trading on Thursday after ending the regular session down 0.49 percent at $26.54 on the Nasdaq.One analyst pointed to heightened spending in the first quarter as potentially worrisome.""You're getting quite a bit less earnings in the first quarter than the Street may have been looking for,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman.

29,"   By Liana B. Baker and Ronald Grover  Verizon Communications Inc's acquisition of Intel Corp's venture to create a web-based TV service may be the catalyst that pushes U.S. cable players to start similar products to fend off fast-growing video rivals such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.The deal, announced on Tuesday, came two weeks after Sony Corp revealed it was working on its own cable-like video service and makes it likely that Internet-delivered TV services may be getting closer after attempts from Apple Inc and other technology companies.Amazon has also considering an online TV service, and has been talking with content owners about licensing TV networks, according to the Wall Street Journal.Verizon said it acquired Intel Corp's OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with its FiOS product, the fiber-based Internet and TV offering that has 5.3 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households.In a more ambitious move, Verizon also says it intends to deliver ""over the top to any device,"" which almost certainly would kick off a race to capture eyeballs that will force cable operators to offer standalone services outside their service territories.""For Verizon this could be an opportunity for them to offer a triple play to subscribers in the rest of the country,"" said Blair Westlake, who until recently headed Microsoft Corp's media and entertainment group. ""If you're a Comcast that may get you thinking that it's time to start offering video in other markets as well.""Verizon has the brand, marketing dollars and customer relationships to make it a viable threat to cable operators, said UBS analyst John Hodulik.There is a likely market waiting for it as well. North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC's annual entertainment and media forecast. Cable TV operators, meanwhile, are losing video subscribers to satellite and telecom operators, according to SNL Kagan, putting pressure on their operating margins due to rising programming costs.CABLE WARS If Verizon's move prompts a similar bid from cable companies, it would upset a decades-long balance in the cable TV industry, which operates in near monopoly status with markets carefully carved up by local governments. Customers could choose between Comcast and Time Warner Cable for their video service, or Verizon for that matter.Comcast may be furthest along with a potential over-the-top service with its Xfinity X1 platform, which allows a subscriber to its traditional video service to toggle between live and on-demand programming with a slick interface. A Comcast spokeswoman said the company is focused on getting that product released across its markets and not on an ""over-the-top"" service.""If Comcast really launches one, it starts a war between all the different cable companies that are already incumbents,"" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. ""That probably means they fight over price, service and features that are great for the consumer.""It won't be easy for a new entrant to get started, however. Content owners so far have not granted cable operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside their markets.That has not stopped both cable and satellite companies from eyeing the opportunity. Both Time Warner Cable Inc and satellite operator DirecTV bid on Hulu - the video streaming site owned by Walt Disney Co's ABC network, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Fox parent Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu's owners, the major content companies, decided instead to invest in it rather than sell it. Charter, which has made a bid to buy No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, has openly floated the idea. ""We may sell subscriptions everywhere,"" Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge said in an November conference call, responding to a question about Charter's streaming TV application.Cable's competitors aren't sitting idle. DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an ""over-the-top"" video package to suit niche audiences, such as Hispanic or kids programming. DirecTV's rival Dish Network Corp is also eyeing the online opportunity.""We're thinking of over the top too,"" Dish CEO Joe Clayton said on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, is skeptical that online video newcomers such as Sony can be profitable enough to take on the incumbents. When folks start using huge amounts of bandwidth for TV viewing, he predicts Internet bills will jump as providers start charging by usage.""A virtual provider like Sony could be left with a me-too service,"" Moffett says, ""and an even higher total cost to the end user than the Pay TV subscription they would be hoping to replace.""For some cable operators, this could mean opportunity emerging from the chaos. Cablevision Systems Corp CEO James Dolan, for one, has said he sees a future in which cable operators no longer use their wires to offer video service and instead just offer broadband Internet, which makes more money.(Reporting by Liana B.

30,"  (Adds analysts' comments, estimates; share movement)Jan 21 Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc  forecast a steeper-than-expected fall in current quarter revenue, signaling that sales of gaming consoles were not growing fast enough to offset slowing PC sales.Shares of the company, whose processors are used in Microsoft Corp's and Sony Corp's   latest game consoles, were down about 11 percent after the bell. The stock has risen 15 percent in the past month.""When you look at the stock action going into earnings, there was some expectation that consoles would drive better growth in the first quarter,"" Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang said.AMD has long competed against larger rival Intel Corp  to supply chips for PCs, but as consumers buy fewer laptops and desktops, the company is looking at gaming consoles to drive revenue growth. Microsoft sold more than three million Xbox Ones, while Sony said PlayStation 4 sales reached 4.2 million from their launch in November to the end of the year.AMD on Tuesday said it expects revenue to decrease 16 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter ended Dec. 28.This translates to revenue of about $1.34 billion, plus or minus 3 percent. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $1.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of AMD's chips used in PCs, its core business, fell 13 percent in the fourth quarter. The business accounted for over 45 percent of total revenue in the quarter. Total revenue rose 37 percent to $1.59 billion.Last week Intel gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. AMD's net profit was $89 million, or 12 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $473 million, or 63 cents per share a year earlier.Excluding items, AMD earned 6 cents per share.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 5 cents per share on revenue of $1.54 billion.Shares of the company were trading at $3.77 after the bell.

Jan 28 Facebook Inc's  executive in charge of revolutionizing data centers on Tuesday lauded low-energy server technology that is expected to compete against heavyweight Intel Corp.The social networking firm's three-year push to help companies design better data center gear is gaining momentum and paying off with a range of cost-saving improvements, Open Compute Project head Frank Frankovsky told an industry conference here.He pointed to plans by some companies to launch server chips based on low-power technology licensed from ARM Holdings , whose technology is widely used in smartphones.""It might be coming to fruition about six months after the most optimistic among us thought, but we are absolutely going to see a much more rich ecosystem in CPU choice as we move through 2014 and into 2015,"" said Frankovsky. Servers are the brains and guts of online networks, handling computations and managing tasks.Intel dominates the server market with its powerful Xeon processors and stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on. It has launched its own low-power chips in anticipation of a move toward microservers by major Internet players like Facebook and Google.For some kinds of data-center workloads, several chips drawing minimal amounts of electricity and working together can work more efficiently than one of Intel's brawny server chips, proponents of microservers say. Struggling with a shrinking PC industry, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices has been developing and testing ARM-based chips for servers. Sunnyvale, California-based Applied Micro Circuits is also launching its own ARM-based server processors. Both companies said they would soon start sampling their chips with customers.With off-the-shelf data center products falling behind Facebook's growing technical requirements, the world's top social media network in 2011 launched the Open Compute Project to push major technology companies to design and build hardware better-suited to running its massive Internet services.Over the past three years, efforts by Facebook to make its infrastructure more efficient have saved the company over $1.2 billion, said Jay Parikh, vice president of infrastructure.

36,"  STMicroelectronics NV (STM.PA) posted lower quarterly revenue and a narrow loss on Monday underscoring how the European chipmaker is losing ground to rivals as orders from its key customer Nokia NOK1V.HE shrink.The company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, reported an operating loss of $11 million on fourth-quarter revenue of $2.01 billion. The revenue was lower than the $2.1 billion logged a year ago but largely unchanged from the previous quarter.Analysts had forecast revenues of $2.03 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company had earlier predicted that fourth-quarter sales would be unchanged from the prior three months, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. After a loss-making third quarter, STMicro pushed back a key profit margin target by six months, blaming higher sales of chips for low-end mobile phones that are not as profitable as chips for high-end phones like Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy line.Last year, STMicro and telecom network gear maker Ericsson ended their joint venture to make chips for mobile phones. Since then, STMicro has refocused on product lines for automobiles, video game consoles, and high-end smartphones, but that move has yet to pay off in terms of higher profits. Franco-Italian STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales, but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent years because of its higher cost base and the decline of Nokia.Worldwide semiconductor revenue rose 5.2 percent last year to $315.4 billion from $299.9 billion in 2012, according to market research group Gartner. Intel kept the leading spot by sales, despite lower demand for computers that caused its chip sales to fall 2.2 percent, while Samsung and Qualcomm both notched up growth, according to Gartner. STMicroelectronics shares climbed 8.8 percent last year, while Europe's Stoxx 600 technology index .SX8P rose 27 percent.(This story fixes headline, 1st and 3rd paragraphs because firm did not miss target, and also correct analysts' average forecast to $2.03 billion, from $2.01 billion)(Reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",2014-01-28,INTC,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 8:42am EST",STMicro's fourth-quarter revenue stagnates,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-stmicro-results-idUSBREA0R0ZK20140128?type=companyNews
37,"  By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO Jan 29 Leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc posted higher fiscal first-quarter revenue that slightly missed estimates as smartphone growth shifted to China, but it bumped up its full-year earnings outlook and said 2014 was playing out as expected.With growth in the smartphone industry moving away from wealthy markets such as the United States and toward China and other emerging economies, where consumers favor less expensive devices, Qualcomm has been focusing on costs to preserve its profitability.The San Diego, California company said on Wednesday it sold more mobile chips than it expected in the December quarter and that it was making progress in trimming its operating expenses. It expects demand for its chips to grow later this year as leading mobile carrier China Mobile rolls out cellphone services using the advanced LTE technology Qualcomm dominates.Wednesday's was the first quarterly report since Qualcomm announced in December that Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf would take over from Paul Jacobs as CEO starting in March.""Our business is getting at the forefront of a technology migration that is occurring in China,"" Mollenkopf told Reuters. ""For us now, there's the opening up of the largest carrier there.""Qualcomm slightly increased its full-year forecast for earnings per share to a range of $5.00 to $5.20, from $4.95 to $5.15, essentially adjusting for first-quarter earnings that came in above the company's own previous estimate.""We raised the full-year EPS guidance but really just to reflect the positive results of Q1. We see the rest of the year playing out pretty much in line with our original expectations,"" Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview. Qualcomm had first-quarter net income of $1.88 billion, down 2 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.09. Its non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.26, above its previous forecast of between $1.10 and $1.20.On Monday, lower-than-expected holiday iPhone sales and a weak revenue forecast by Apple Inc, a major Qualcomm customer, renewed fears on Wall Street about Chinese demand and a tepid global market.""It could have been worse, given how sentiment has gotten in the last couple of days,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said of Qualcomm's quarterly results.While the majority of Qualcomm's revenue comes from selling baseband chips that let phones communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its ubiquitous CDMA cellphone technology. As phone prices edge lower, Qualcomm receives less royalty revenue. Average prices for cellphones in the September quarter, used to calculate licensing revenue for Qualcomm in the December quarter, were between $219 and $225, the company said. That was less than the $223 to $229 range that Qualcomm estimated for the June quarter in its previous earnings statement.CHINA PROBE Mollenkopf said Chinese authorities had told Qualcomm that the substance of an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker, launched in November, were confidential. He said Qualcomm was cooperating but declined to comment further on the investigation, which could potentially lead to a record fine exceeding $1 billion. Qualcomm, founded in 1985, has become the top chip supplier for smartphones and its stock value has surpassed that of Intel Corp. Intel is still the world's largest chipmaker by revenue but is struggling to gain a foothold in mobile.Qualcomm shares are up about 12 percent over the past 12 months, lower than the S&P 500's gain of roughly 18 percent. The chipmaker's shares trade at about 14 times expected earnings, on par with Intel.Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue of $6.62 billion, up 10 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected first-quarter revenue of $6.665 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.It said revenue in the fiscal second quarter, which ends in March, would range from $6.1 billion to $6.7 billion. Analysts on average expect second-quarter revenue of $6.723 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Qualcomm maintained its forecast for 2014 fiscal revenue between $26 billion and $27.5 billion.Its adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter included a 25-cent gain from the sale of its Omnitracs logistics business as well as a 20-cent impairment charge. The company said that those and other smaller items added a net 4 cents per share to adjusted earnings.Qualcomm shares were up 2.8 percent in extended trading after closing down 1.21 percent at $71.12 on Nasdaq.",2014-01-30,INTC,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 7:05pm EST","UPDATE 3-Qualcomm says year on track, focuses on China",http://www.reuters.com//article/qualcomm-results-idUSL2N0L329F20140130?type=companyNews

40,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Feb 18 Intel Corp  unveiled a new high-end processor aimed at boosting lackluster demand from corporate customers like banks and retailers.With Intel's core market of personal computers shrinking, the chipmaker's server business is becoming increasingly important. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations.Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, told reporters on Tuesday the new Xeon chip is aimed at customers like retailers, airlines, stock exchanges and credit card companies keen to instantly crunch growing troves of data. The new Xeon chip is twice as efficient as its previous generation and allows more data to be held in memory instead of on hard drives so that it can be quickly analyzed.""The Xeon E7 v2 will give a highly anticipated boost to enterprise IT, giving them the ability to deploy new capabilities that were previously impossible,"" Bryant said. In the quarter ended in December, the Data Center Group's sales grew 7 percent, below the company's expectations due to slow spending by enterprise, a category that includes corporations and governments. However, demand from Web-based companies was robust.Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said in January that weak demand from enterprise customers meant the Data Center Group's revenues this year would probably come in toward the bottom of his previous growth estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent. While Intel's laptop and desktop chips typically sell for prices in the low hundreds of dollars, its top-of-the-line server processors may sell for thousands of dollars each, boosting the company's profit margins.Bryant said the new Xeon server chips will make it easier for credit card companies to instantly analyze past transactions and send useful data to retailers looking to sell products to customers in their stores.As another example of a growing field known as Big Data, Bryant said airlines have begun to use predictive analytics to head off unscheduled maintenance needs and reduce the number of flight cancellations.",2014-02-18,INTC,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 3:25pm EST",Intel aims to boost corporate demand with high-end server chip,http://www.reuters.com//article/intel-servers-idUSL2N0LN1EA20140218?type=companyNews

43,"  March 10 A Chinese state-owned company offered to buy Montage Technology Group, a Shanghai-based chipmaker, in a deal valued at about $600 million, roughly four months after failing to buy rival RDA Microelectronics Inc .Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology Investment Co Ltd offered $21.50 per Montage share in cash, a 25 percent premium to the company's closing price on Friday.Shares of Montage, which counts Intel Corp among its top shareholders, were up 19.5 percent at $20.51 in early trading on the Nasdaq.The fabless chipmaker, which went public at $10 per share in September, makes analog and mixed-signal chips for set-top boxes and servers for cloud computing, and counts the world's four largest DRAM chipmakers as its customers. Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji De Silva said it was difficult to predict if there would be rival offers since Montage was not a cellphone-focused chipmaker, unlike RDA and Spreadtrum Communications Inc.""But the price seems low, so there could be chance of topping up,"" De Silva said. China, home to the largest number of mobile phone users in the world, is investing heavily to improve its broadband infrastructure.That was one reason Shanghai Pudong Science, owned by the Pudong New Area government of Shanghai, offered to buy RDA in September. But its offer was topped by Tsinghua University-funded Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd with a bid of $910 million. Tsinghua also said in July it would buy Spreadtrum for a raised offer of about $1.78 billion.Montage last month came under fire from short-seller Gravity Research which said the company's revenue was ""significantly lower"" than reported, and that one of its largest distributors was ""nothing more than a shell company.""

They argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals in January that it is impractical, too costly, and would force them to make political statements about the content of their products, in violation of their First Amendment freedom of speech rights.At the heart of their arguments is that business should not be dragged into fundamentally political issues and that they should not be held responsible for righting the wrongs of the world. Strategically their lawsuit is a pushback against the trend for global corporations to take more responsibility for labor conditions, environment, corruption and human rights - issues that traditionally were the realm of the state.Over the past two decades, transnational corporations have grown bigger and more powerful than many states where they operate, and their global supply chains have turned them into empires affecting broad swathes of people. With that power have come new responsibilities. At first corporations embraced voluntary accords to address human rights concerns, starting with audits of fair labor standards after child labour scandals in the garment industry in the 1990s. But the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in April 2013, which killed more than 1,000 workers, exposed the limitations of corporate compacts and audits of their supply chain.Voluntary accords have succeeded in setting a commonly agreed set of global standards, said Arvind Ganesan, director of the business and human rights division of Human Rights Watch. The technology industry has agreed on privacy standards; security standards have been negotiated.The United Nations has formed the Global Compact for business members who sign up to a common framework for human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011 lay out responsibilities.

Certainly they can carry sizable costs. The Securities and Exchange Commission estimates that about 6,000 companies are affected by the conflict minerals rule and it will cost them between $3 billion and $6 billion to check their supply chain, with ongoing annual costs of $207 million to $609 million.This is where Intel comes in.

47,"  (Recasts, adds company comment, industry context)* Growth in wearable smart devices to drive server push* Aims to grab market share from industry leader Intel* Sees value of ARM-based wearables, related devices at $20 bln by 2018By Michael GoldTAIPEI, March 20 Britain's ARM Holdings PLC , whose chip designs feature in most smartphones, has started designing chips for servers with a market share goal of 10 percent in three years, to capitalise on the growing data demands of wearable smart devices. Technology companies from Google Inc to HTC Corp  are investing heavily in wearables such as watches and spectacles, which add to the strain on servers when sending and receiving real-time data.The value of wearables and other everyday products equipped with ARM-based embedded connectivity is likely to reach $20 billion in 2018 from $14 billion last year, said Vice-Director of Investor Relations Ian Thornton.In light of that, ARM has started designing chips for servers, and the first chips are scheduled be shipped this year, Thornton said at a news conference in Taipei on Thursday. ARM aims to control 10 percent of the server chip design market by 2017, Thornton said, taking share from rivals such as industry-leader Intel Corp in the process.The company is working with Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc to put ARM-designed chips into the servers of two of the leading manufacturers, Thornton said. ARM licences its designs to chip manufacturers, and chip buyers pay ARM royalties. Thornton said the royalties from server chips could be as much as $10 million by 2017.""This is a useful extra layer of royalties,"" Thornton said. ""It's a nice adjacent market for us to win share in.""That figure pales in comparison with ARM's royalties from smartphones such as the iPhone and Galaxy ranges from ARM customers Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd .ARM earns just under half its royalties from smartphones, and last month said falling demand for high-end models led to royalties of $130.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year, slightly below analyst estimates.Nevertheless, ARM sees robust growth in the overall smartphone and mobile-computing market, with the value of such ARM-based devices growing to $20 billion by 2018 from $13 billion in 2013, Thornton said.

""We're partnering to bring those technologies together in a single-package solution,"" Howe said. Multi-die packaging is aimed at efficiently connecting separately made components as one device. Many of those components could be manufactured together on one silicon die, but in some cases the complexity of doing so can mean higher costs and lower yields of successfully produced components.Connecting discrete components in sophisticated ways can also lead to smaller-form devices that use less energy and let chipmakers more easily mix and match components to produce different variations of chips.Altera is betting that paying for access to Intel's factories equipped with new 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology will give it an edge over rival programmable chipmaker Xilinx Inc.

68,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON, April 10  BOSTON, April 10 Hackers could crack email systems, security firewalls and possibly mobile phones through the ""Heartbleed"" computer bug, according to security experts who warned on Thursday that the risks extended beyond just Internet Web servers.The widespread bug surfaced late on Monday, when it was disclosed that a pernicious flaw in a widely used Web encryption program known as OpenSSL opened hundreds of thousands of websites to data theft. Developers rushed out patches to fix affected web servers when they disclosed the problem, which affected companies from Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc  to Yahoo Inc.Yet pieces of vulnerable OpenSSL code can be found inside plenty of other places, including email servers, ordinary PCs, phones and even security products such as firewalls. Developers of those products are scrambling to figure out whether they are vulnerable and patch them to keep their users safe.""I am waiting for a patch,"" said Jeff Moss, a security adviser to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and founder of the Def Con hacking conference. Def Con's network uses an  enterprise firewall from McAfee, which is owned by Intel Corp's  security division.He said he was frustrated because people had figured out that his email and Web traffic is vulnerable and posted about it on the Internet - but he can't take steps to remedy the problem until Intel releases a patch.""Everybody is going through the exact same thing I'm going through, if you are going through a vendor fix,"" he said. An Intel spokesman declined comment, referring Reuters to a company blog that said: ""We understand this is a difficult time for businesses as they scramble to update multiple products from multiple vendors in the coming weeks. The McAfee products that use affected versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable and need to be updated.""It did not say when they would be released.The Heartbleed vulnerability went undetected for about two years and can be exploited without leaving a trace, so experts and consumers fear attackers may have compromised large numbers of networks without their knowledge. Companies and government agencies are now rushing to understand which products are vulnerable, then set priorities for fixing them. They are anxious because researchers have observed sophisticated hacking groups conducting scans of the Internet this week in search of vulnerable servers .""Every security person is talking about this,"" said Chris Morales, practice manager with the cybersecurity services firm NSS Labs.Cisco Systems Inc, the world's biggest telecommunications equipment provider, said on its website that it is reviewing dozens of products to see if they are safe. It uncovered about a dozen that are vulnerable, including a TelePresence video conferencing server, a version of the IOS software for managing routers. A company spokesman declined to comment on how those issues might affect users, saying Cisco would provide more information as it became available. Oracle Corp has not posted such an advisory on its support site. Company spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment on Heartbleed.Microsoft Corp, which runs a cloud computing and storage service, the Xbox platform and has hundreds of millions of Windows and Officer users, said in a statement that ""a few services continue to be reviewed and updated with further protections."" It did not identify them.Officials with technology giants IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co could not be reached. EMC Corp  and Dell said they had no immediate comment.Security experts said the vulnerable code is also found in some widely used email server software, the online browser anonymizing tool Tor and OpenVPN, as well as some online games and software that runs Internet-connected devices such as webcams and mobile phones.Jeff Forristal, chief technology officer of Bluebox Security, said that version 4.1.1 of Google's Android operating system, known as Jelly Bean, is also vulnerable. Google officials declined comment on his finding.Other security experts said that they would avoid using any device with the vulnerable software in it, but that it would take a lot of effort for a hacker to extract useful data from a vulnerable Android phone.

69,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Patent buyer Intellectual Ventures has persuaded Microsoft and Sony to invest in its latest acquisition fund while Apple and Intel, which invested with IV previously, declined to participate, according to people briefed on the fundraising.The investment decisions by four technology companies come in the midst of a heated debate over whether it is too easy for patent owners to extract large royalty payments, and whether patent buying firms spur or stifle innovation.Last year IV curtailed patent acquisitions as it sought new investors, and IV now is ramping up, say three sources familiar with IV's activity in the patent market.""Microsoft and Sony's investments give IV a fresh war chest to buy new patents,"" said Kevin Jakel, chief executive of Unified Patents, which advises tech companies on alternatives to patent aggregators like IV.But Apple and Intel's decision is significant because the biggest tech companies have supported IV in the past. ""This would be a dramatic departure,"" Jakel said.Intellectual Ventures declined to discuss investments. Microsoft, Sony, Intel and Apple also would not comment. It is unclear whether Intel and Apple could still opt to invest in IV's vehicle at a later time.Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets. The company is seeking to raise $3 billion more, a 2013 investor presentation reviewed by Reuters shows. Over the years IV and other firms like it have faced criticism from some in the technology industry, who argue that firms like IV, which do not primarily make products, exploit the patent system by demanding royalties and threatening litigation.IV argues that by buying patents from inventors, it creates a mechanism for them to capitalize on their ideas. Several large tech companies previously invested in IV, which gave them low-cost licenses to IV's vast patent portfolios as well as a portion of royalties IV collected.Microsoft Corp, Sony Corp, Apple and Intel all invested in IV's previous funds, court filings show. Prior to co-founding IV, Nathan Myhrvold was chief technology officer at Microsoft working closely with Bill Gates. Another IV co-founder, Peter Detkin, was previously an Intel in-house lawyer. IV's fundraising comes as a proposal to make it easier to fight patent lawsuits passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee.Some companies like Google Inc publicly supported the bill, which included a provision to make it easier for the winner of a patent lawsuit to recover legal fees. Google invested in IV's first fund in 2003 but has said it declined to participate in subsequent ventures. IV sued Google's Motorola Mobility unit in 2011, and that litigation is ongoing.Microsoft and Apple were among seven major corporations which warned last week against weakening the patent system and hurting innovative companies. Still, Microsoft reiterated on Friday that it ""applauds"" the pending bill.Amy Landers, an intellectual property professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, said Apple and Intel's decision on IV's latest fund was probably unrelated to the political debate on patent reform. ""The companies that are not investing in the fund have probably just found better uses for their money,"" Landers said.At the end of 2012 the average rate of return for IV's 2003 fund was 16.2 percent, while the 2008 fund stood at 2.5 percent, according to the 2013 investor presentation. In a court filing last year, Intellectual Ventures said it has earned more than $3 billion to date in licensing fees.Patent buyers also are facing some competition from companies like Unified Patents, which argue that tech companies should try to invalidate threatening patents instead of just financing aggregators like IV to acquire them.""I think there's a recognition by a lot of companies that simply trying to buy your way out of the problem is like bailing water from a sinking ship,"" Jakel said.Jakel declined to disclose whether any of the tech companies in this report are clients.(Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Reiji Murai in Tokyo, editing by Peter Henderson, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-11,INTC,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 2:27pm EDT","Exclusive: Microsoft, Apple diverge on bankrolling big patent buyer",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-apple-patents-idUSBREA3A0R020140411?type=companyNews

It is widely believed that Intel's investment is aimed at shifting to new 10 nanometre technology. A company spokesman declined to comment but Intel in January had said it would decide on the location of a 10 nanometre plant this year. Israel was one of a number of countries competing to host the new plant.Intel Israel's exports, mainly from its Fab 28 plant in Kiryat Gat, amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before.

The Commission said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips. The Luxembourg-based General Court will rule on the case on June 12, a court official said.

CEO Brian Krzanich said during an online Reddit discussion in February that Intel needed to revamp its marketing to get back some of its ""coolness.""Morale among many on the marketing team is at an ""all-time low"" and contributed to some employees' decisions to leave, one of the sources told Reuters. The chipmaker's marketing department has struggled over the past year or two to captivate consumers with new ultrathin laptops and two-in-one tablets. ""We all know there's a problem. If you look at the Interbrand numbers you can see it,"" said a third person familiar with Intel's marketing department. ""It was smart to go external, bring in someone with fresh thinking.""Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy declined to confirm how many people had left, but he said they fall within a previously announced plan to trim the chipmaker's workforce by 5 percent this year.But he said they were not leaving as a reaction to specific problems in the marketing department. Intel's marketing department had more than 300 employees spread around different business units and offices prior to the cuts, one of the sources estimated.BRAND EROSION  Last week, Intel announced it had hired senior Staples executive Fund as its new chief marketing officer, and that he would report directly to Krzanich when he starts in June.

The timing of new chip rollouts is important to Intel and manufacturers looking to sell new PCs with better battery life and higher speeds.""I can guarantee for holiday, and not at the last second of holiday,"" Krzanich said in an interview.

On that call, he said he expected Intel's customers to launch Broadwell-based products in the second half of 2014.

88,"  * U.S. bosses have dropped out of upcoming Russia forum* Chill in Russia-West relations could impact major state projects-analysts* Skolkovo, Moscow financial center, could risk being sidelined-analysts* London City Lord Mayor's expected June trip to Moscow undecidedBy Megan DaviesSKOLKOVO, Russia, May 22 Students at Moscow's new science-focused university crowded into a lecture theatre outside the capital earlier this month to hear Canadian-born Nobel prizewinning molecular biologist Sidney Altman speak.The students at Skoltech are yet to have their own campus because it is still under construction, so the lecture was held at the Moscow School of Management, a long dreary journey from Moscow city centre by metro and then bus up a traffic-clogged road.""By the spring of 2015 we will have some major laboratories working here at Skolkovo in all of our disciplinary areas,"" said Skoltech President Edward Crawley, who is leading efforts to develop a university at Skolkovo, Russia's answer to Silicon Valley, with partners such as U.S. college Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials point to projects like Skolkovo as an example of how Russia is diversifying its economy away from energy. Other projects include Russia's effort to develop Moscow as an international financial center and to launch a state-backed private equity fund.But at the start of Russia's annual investment forum in St Petersburg, from May 22-24, the environment for projects such as the Skolkovo tech park is deteriorating. Western sanctions over Ukraine are exacerbating Russia's economic slowdown and giving foreign investors pause for thought.For decades Russia has failed to deliver on promises to modernise an economy that is focused on extracting and exporting oil, metals and other commodities.The chill in relations with the West following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula make a difficult task even harder.""All these institutions and initiatives could only work as part of the broader Russian effort to become more integrated with the West,"" said Steven Dashevsky, founder of hedge fund Dashevsky & Partners in London. ""We've seen that movement grind to a halt effectively now."" BIG DREAMS For Skoltech students, the university is a gateway to the world, offering the chance to do placements with MIT and other colleges.""Even a month at MIT is enough to open your eyes,"" said Jelena Nadj, an IT masters student from Serbia speaking at Skolkovo's Hypercube by the campus construction site, where tractors heave mounds of earth. ""You change your attitude.""The collaboration with MIT was launched in 2011. The U.S. university is helping Skoltech to conceive and launch its graduate research university, which now has 63 masters students.MIT said the Ukraine crisis had not affected the alliance.""When diplomatic and political dialog becomes difficult, the importance of educational and academic research collaborations becomes even greater,"" said Professor Bruce Tidor, Faculty Lead at MIT Skoltech Initiative, in an emailed statement.That view is echoed by other Skoltech and Skolkovo partners contacted by Reuters. The risk for Russia is that attracting new money becomes difficult, however. The Russian government has pledged 170 billion roubles ($4.9 billion) to Skolkovo, its press office said. The project has also attracted commercial partners including U.S. chip maker Intel, which said Skolkovo remains an important strategic partner.Skoltech's international partnerships, which alongside MIT include London's Imperial College, Zurich's ETH and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, are a major draw for students.""The international experience is one of the biggest achievements of this place,"" said Skoltech energy masters student Dmitry Smirnov, from Rybinsk, Russia. ""Russia really needs international experience and to build to Europe and the Western world.""Analysts say that Russia's increasingly difficult relations with the West could result in reduced access to Western technology for projects such as Skolkovo.""The chill between Russia and Western countries will undoubtedly diminish further the viability of the Skolkovo project,"" said MIT Professor of the History of Science, Loren Graham.In emailed remarks Graham also identified the typically Russian 'top-down government-controlled' nature of the project as an obstacle to progress.""The real problem with Skolkovo is not based on Western connections but with the nature of the enterprise from the beginning,"" Graham said. SANCTIONS BACKLASH The deterioration of relations with the West has led to predictions that Russia may increase business with Asia or become more isolationist. China and Russia on Wednesday signed a $400-billion gas supply deal, opening up a new market for Moscow as it risks losing European customers.In response to the West's outcry over Ukraine, Russia has shown it is prepared to go it alone. It plans to set up a credit card payment system to rival Visa and Mastercard  and is threatening to close U.S. GPS satellite navigation system sites.""The worst case is we end up with isolationism and these organisations become sidelined and irrelevant and have a less clear future,"" said Chris Weafer, senior partner with Moscow-based Macro-Advisory.""You can get plenty of money in the Middle East and Asia but Russia needs partnerships with established companies with expertise and technology and those are mainly Western companies.""The bulk of foreign funds to state-backed private equity fund the Russian Direct Investment Fund comes from the Middle East and Asia.The U.S. government is asking U.S. firms to steer clear of Russia. Washington has told executives it is inappropriate to visit the St Petersburg forum this week. The event is closely associated with Putin, who usually delivers a keynote speech promoting Russia as a place to invest.One U.S. executive whose firm is involved in major Russian state projects said his company was ""caught between a rock and a hard place"" and ""laying low until the situation becomes clearer.""Several Russian state-backed schemes have international ties. London has partnered in a project aimed at turning Moscow into an international financial centre.An annual trip to Moscow associated with the project and scheduled for June by the Lord Mayor of London is now uncertain to go ahead, said one financial source. The City of London's press office said no final decision had been made on the trip.""It is a sign of the times that even at this late juncture, clarity is not available,"" said the source.TheCityUK, an organisation working on the project, said it would continue to review its activity in the light of ""the evolving circumstances in the relationship between the UK and Russia and assess how these might impact on the project.""

89,"  (Adds comment from plaintiffs' lawyer, details about plaintiffs)By Jonathan StempelMay 23 Four major Silicon Valley companies have formally agreed to pay $324.5 million to settle claims brought by employees who accused them of limiting competition by colluding not to poach each other's talent.The settlement, between Apple Inc, Google Inc , Intel Corp, Adobe Systems Inc and roughly 64,000 workers, was disclosed in papers filed late on Thursday with a federal court in San Jose, California.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has been asked to preliminarily approve the accord at a June 19 hearing, over an objection by one of the four named plaintiffs, Michael Devine, who says the settlement let the companies off too easily.The payout was originally reported by Reuters but not officially confirmed.Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 25 percent of the settlement amount in legal fees. Filed in 2011, the lawsuit accused Silicon Valley companies of conspiring to limit competition and keep wages down for engineers, programmers and other technical staff.The case has been closely watched because of the potential $9 billion of damages sought, and its occasional embarrassing revelations into how Silicon Valley operates.Among the communications that became public were pointed emails from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs that at times admonished then-Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt to stop raiding his company. Thursday's settlement gives workers only a few thousand dollars each on average.The companies' combined profit in their latest fiscal years was about $60 billion, with three-fifths coming from Apple.In court papers, two law firms representing the plaintiffs said Devine's objection should not doom what they consider a fair and reasonable settlement for an antitrust case, and which serves the best interests of the class. They pointed to a July 2012 jury verdict in the same court that found Toshiba Corp conspired to fix prices in the liquid crystal display market but awarded just $87 million of damages, one-tenth of what was sought.""The amount of the settlement does not relate to the size or profitability of the companies we sued,"" Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. ""It relates to the claims we made, the law that applies to them, and the facts that we could prove at trial. Based on that, I think the settlement is a significant achievement.""Devine did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment.Koh on May 16 approved separate settlements totaling $20 million over alleged poaching by Walt Disney Co's  Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and by Intuit Inc.The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 11-02509.

This represents a major move for the Santa Clara, California company that has struggled to gain traction in smartphones and tablets.The collaboration is unlikely to drastically increase Intel's overall mobile chip business, but it shows the chipmaker's determination to be successful in the mobile arena at nearly any cost, said FBR analyst Chris Rolland.""It speaks to (CEO Brian Krzanich) being willing to think somewhat out of the box and be a little more flexible in his approach,"" Rolland said. Intel gains access to Rockchip's ability to quickly launch inexpensive mobile chips as well as access to the company's strong relationships with local Chinese manufacturers focused on the country's fast-growing consumer market.""They're absolutely bringing us speed and execution and proliferation for us that would not otherwise get done,"" Krzanich said on a conference call. ""They also bring these relationships and partnerships that go well beyond what ours are.""With sales of high-end mobile devices losing steam in North America, manufacturers have been turning their attention to lower-end tablets and smartphones designed for consumers in China. Under the agreement, Rockchip and Intel will make a quad-core mobile chip using Intel's architecture and branding, Intel said.While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing ""system on chips,"" or SoCs, that combine features like modems, wifi and memory. Fuzhou, China-based Rockchip and other mobile chipmakers focus on making SoCs for smartphones and tablets. Those chips typically include ARM processor technology that competes against Intel's technology.""It's to some degree an acknowledgement of Intel's limited capability in SoCs and very limited presence in China, particularly as you get cheaper and cheaper tablets,"" Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree said of the agreement with Rockchip.Intel said the agreement with Rockchip does not include an investment between the two companies.Intel said the chip will include 3G connectivity and be available in the first half of 2015.Shares of Intel were up 1.22 percent at $26.60, in line with trading levels ahead of the announcement.

94,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO New Intel-based tablets from major brands will start hitting store shelves in June, and senior executives at the chipmaker hope the offerings will move it closer to an aggressive sales goal.Far behind rival Qualcomm (QCOM.O) in mobile devices, the upcoming tablets are the result of Intel Corp's (INTC.O) strategy to sell chips this year at a loss in a bid to stake out badly needed market share. Intel is betting that in the future, its customers will keep using Intel chips without the discounts.Toshiba (6502.T) this week announced six tablets and PCs with detachable screens made with Intel chips, one of which runs the Android operating system and the rest Windows. More Intel-based tablets will start hitting U.S. store shelves in June and July for back-to-school shoppers, Erik Reid, general manager of Intel's Mobile Client Platforms unit, told Reuters in a recent interview.""It will be a new high-water mark, to be eclipsed by another high-water mark at the holidays,"" said Reid, who is managing Intel's tablet push. With the PC industry shrinking, mobile devices and other new markets have become a top priority for Intel. Most tablets are made with chips from Samsung (005930.KS), Qualcomm and other companies that use low-power technology from ARM Holdings ARM.L. Earlier in May, CEO Brian Krzanich told Reuters that Intel was well on its way to reaching his goal for the company to increase its sales of tablet chips this year to 40 million units.After shipping 5 million tablet chips in the first quarter, Intel is on track to meet a target of 7.5 million such chips for the June quarter, Krzanich said.""We're on schedule to hit that number and we'll see if we can do better than that,"" he said. Global tablet shipments from all manufacturers in 2014 will grow 12 percent to 245 million, less than a previous forecast of 261 million devices, because people are keeping their devices longer, market research firm IDC said on Thursday. Intel sold around 10 million tablet chips last year.Manufacturers have launched a handful of Windows tablets running on Intel's newest Bay Trail chips, but those chips have been slow to appear in devices running the popular Android platform.On Tuesday, Intel announced a deal with Chinese chipmaker Rockchip to make components for entry-level Android devices aimed at local consumers in China.  Partly reflecting the financial incentives Intel is offering manufacturers to use its tablet chips, the company's mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $929 million in the April quarter on revenue of only $156 million.As well as big PC brands increasingly making tablets, Intel expects small manufacturers making devices for China's domestic market to play a major part in reaching its 40 million chip goal this year, Reid said.

97,"   By Noel Randewich and Liana B. Baker | SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK Erik Huggers is leaving Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) just five months after joining the company via the acquisition of the Intel Corp (INTC.O) “OnCue” streaming service he developed, signaling the communications giant’s waning interest in providing an Internet-delivered TV service.The former BBC executive, who told Reuters on Friday he is departing the company, had worked on OnCue for Intel for more than two years before Verizon bought it in January to accelerate a push into video services, including TV channels delivered over the Internet, known as an ""over the top"", or OTT, service.While other companies have been talking up their plans to deliver such a service, a source familiar with the matter said that Verizon was now moving away from the OTT strategy and that the departure of Huggers, who was a proponent of an Internet-only service, reflected that.A Verizon spokesman confirmed Huggers' departure and in regards to its strategy said, “We obtained a strong combination of technological and personnel assets from Intel Media. We intend to strategically utilize the OnCue technology and talent going forward to grow our business. That has not changed.""Verizon had previously said OnCue would help it offer video over its Fios fiber-optic infrastructure as well.  Seen by some as a bold attempt to revolutionize TV and others as a distraction from Intel's chip business, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich pulled the plug and put the unit up for sale before it was launched. Intel's retreat from streaming TV was a disappointment to people in Silicon Valley who hoped the technology company could break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable and entertainment conglomerates. With the acquisition, Huggers and many of his employees moved over to Verizon, where he hoped to launch the service to consumers. But he told Reuters he advised his staff on Thursday that he was leaving the company.Huggers said in an interview he had worked well with his immediate boss at Verizon, Marni Walden, recently appointed to head product development, as well as Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam. ""There were no conflicts at all. The technology is great, the team is great, the future is secure, the dream lives on. It's time to hand the baby over to someone else,” he said. Verizon's rivals are working on their own Internet TV services. AT&T Inc (T.N), which made an offer to buy DirecTV last week in a $45.5 billion deal, has said it would take 12 to 18 months for the combined companies to come up with an over-the-top service. Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) has said it expects to launch its personalized streaming product by year-end, having already struck a deal for programming from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).

Park officials said previously there was no certainty a recovery was possible given the location.

115,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Thursday raised its outlook for the second quarter and the full year, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers used by businesses.Shares of Intel jumped more than 4 percent in extended trade as the chipmaker's improved forecast lifted hopes for a PC industry that been shrinking due to consumers' preferences for tablets and smartphones. Intel said it now expects second-quarter revenue of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Intel had previously forecast revenue of $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million.The chipmaker said it expects ""some"" revenue growth for the full year, compared with its previous forecast of flat revenue.The Santa Clara, California company also raised the mid-point of its gross margin forecast range for the second quarter, which ends at the end of June, by 1 point to 64 percent. With personal computer shipments falling for eight straight quarters through March, some analysts have suggested the industry's decline is close to hitting bottom, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile and wearable devices.    Demand from companies for PCs likely received a boost recently due to Microsoft's (MSFT.O) winding down of support in April for its Windows XP operating system, analysts say.     ""PCs have been getting less bad for a while,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. ""But if it's all business PCs then the question is going to be sustainability.""Intel's revised revenue and gross margin forecasts for the June quarter could translate to earnings per share of 52 cents, RBC analyst Doug Freedman said in a note to clients.    For the second quarter, analysts on average had expected EPS of 47 cents and revenue of $13.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel is expected to report its second-quarter results on July 15.Shares of Intel jumped 4.97 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.11 percent at $27.96 on Nasdaq.

118,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp is taking a new approach to the powerful server chips it sells to Internet heavyweights like Facebook and Google.The Santa Clara, California company is integrating its Xeon processors with programmable chips that will give customers with unique technical requirements more flexibility to optimize their servers.With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones and tablets, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits for Intel.Most servers are made with off-the-shelf Intel Xeon chips, but last year Intel manufactured about 15 customized versions of those processors to meet the particular needs of high-end customers like eBay and Facebook. It plans to manufacture over 30 customized chips this year, Diane Bryant, who leads Intel's data center division, told reporters at a briefing this week. The technology Bryant announced at an event Wednesday goes a step further, letting data center operators customize the chips themselves, as often as they want. Intel dominates the server market but it faces a new source of competition as rivals prepare low-power processors based on technology from ARM Holdings. The new component integrates a standard Xeon processor and a  chip known as a field-programmable gate array, or FPGA. Customers can configure the chips as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. ""If they have an application that spends a lot of time on a particular algorithm, they can take that algorithm, take the soft (intellectual property), and load it into the FPGA and accelerate that workload,"" Bryant said.Intel already sells server products that combine Xeon chips and programmable chips but on the new component they will be much more closely integrated, resulting in up to double the performance, Bryant said.She declined to say when Intel would sell the new product, how much they would cost or what company would supply the programmable chip, a technology distinct from Intel's focus on processors. Programmable chips are typically used by manufacturers making small quantities of products or prototypes that do not warrant the expense of designing a new chip from the ground up. On Wall Street they are used to run complex financial simulations.Microsoft has already been experimenting with using programmable chips to help power its Bing web search engine.Intel announced in March it was expanding its existing contract manufacturing relationship with programmable chipmaker Altera to develop future components that combine different kinds of chips. Bryant said that arrangement was unrelated to the upcoming Xeon offering.

130,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Samsung Electronics, Intel Corp and Dell have joined to establish standard ways for household gadgets like thermostats and light bulbs to talk to each other, at odds with a framework backed by Qualcomm, LG Electronics and other companies.The new Open Interconnect Consortium, like the Qualcomm-supported AllSeen Alliance, aims to establish how smart devices work together in a trend increasingly called the Internet of Things.Manufacturers are rolling out growing numbers of Internet-connected burglar alarms, televisions and light switches. But like the early days of video cassette recorders, current smart home products are often incompatible with each other.The new consortium, which also includes chipmakers Broadcom and Atmel, was announced in a news release late on Monday. Doug Fisher, general manager of Intel's Software and Services Group, told Reuters that the framework to be developed by the new consortium would address security and other issues not adequately handled by the AllSeen group. The potential emergence of smart household products made by manufacturers using two sets of incompatible standards would be incidental, he said.""We're not out to create that. We just think the industry has spoken and there's this approach that's needed,"" Fisher said. ""We're certainly welcoming others to participate."" Last week, Microsoft became the 51st member of the AllSeen Alliance, which also includes Sharp Corp and other consumer electronics manufacturers. Rob Chandhok, senior vice president of Qualcomm Technologies Inc, compared the two competing standards groups to walled-off online services in the early 1990s before widespread Internet use.""It's better for us to have an industry-wide shared platform than to be divided,"" Chandhok said. ""I don't want to get to a 'Prodigy and CompuServe' of the Internet of Things."" Technology heavyweights Apple and Google are also pursuing their own ways of interconnecting household devices.Apple, known for strictly controlling how other companies' products interact with its own, in June announced HomeKit, which will integrate control of devices like lights and thermostats.

131,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO, July 7  SAN FRANCISCO, July 7 Samsung Electronics , Intel Corp and Dell have joined to establish standard ways for household gadgets like thermostats and light bulbs to talk to each other, at odds with a framework backed by Qualcomm, LG Electronics and other companies.The new Open Interconnect Consortium, like the Qualcomm-supported AllSeen Alliance, aims to establish how smart devices work together in a trend increasingly called the Internet of Things.Manufacturers are rolling out growing numbers of Internet-connected burglar alarms, televisions and light switches. But like the early days of video cassette recorders, current smart home products are often incompatible with each other.The new consortium, which also includes chipmakers Broadcom  and Atmel, was announced in a news release late on Monday. Doug Fisher, general manager of Intel's Software and Services Group, told Reuters that the framework to be developed by the new consortium would address security and other issues not adequately handled by the AllSeen group.The potential emergence of smart household products made by manufacturers using two sets of incompatible standards would be incidental, he said.""We're not out to create that. We just think the industry has spoken and there's this approach that's needed,"" Fisher said. ""We're certainly welcoming others to participate."" Last week, Microsoft became the 51st member of the AllSeen Alliance, which also includes Sharp Corp and other consumer electronics manufacturers.Rob Chandhok, senior vice president of Qualcomm Technologies Inc, compared the two competing standards groups to walled-off online services in the early 1990s before widespread Internet use. ""It's better for us to have an industry-wide shared platform than to be divided,"" Chandhok said. ""I don't want to get to a 'Prodigy and CompuServe' of the Internet of Things.""Technology heavyweights Apple and Google are also pursuing their own ways of interconnecting household devices.Apple, known for strictly controlling how other companies' products interact with its own, in June announced HomeKit, which will integrate control of devices like lights and thermostats.Google's Nest has also partnered with companies including Whirlpool Corp and light bulb maker LIFX to integrate their products with its thermostats and smoke detectors.

132,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp (INTC.O) believes the worst is over for a personal computer industry hammered by the mobile revolution.The Santa Clara, California chipmaker forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street's expectations on Tuesday, sending its stock 4 percent higher in extended trade. Investors have pushed shares of PC mainstays Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Intel to decade-highs, partly on bets that the global slump in PC demand that began with Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) launch of the iPad four years ago is hitting bottom.  ""PCs have stabilized,"" Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters after Intel's report. He said he expects shrinking demand from consumers in China and other developing countries to rebound, just as it recently has in the United States. From the end of 2010, the year the iPad was launched, to the end of 2013, annual global PC shipments shrank a total of 12 percent, according to IDC. Intel now expects the market's recovery to help it grow its full-year revenue about 5 percent, slightly higher than prior expectations.Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call that improved demand from companies replacing old PCs would last at least through the end of 2014.Also on Tuesday, Intel increased its share buyback program by $20 billion. It plans to repurchase about $4 billion of stock in the current quarter, underscoring its confidence in a turnaround and a growing crop of ""two in one"" devices with detachable keyboards and screens. ""My presumption would be that if they’re confident enough to boost it that they see this (PC market) upside maintaining,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""God help them if they’re wrong."" Intel said in a statement it expects third-quarter revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts had expected $14 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Revenue from Intel's PC group rose 6 percent in the quarter while its data center group, a big contributor to gross margins, had revenue jump 19 percent. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and tablets. For the second quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group's revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million and had an operating loss of $1.12 billion.Intel's second-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $12.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. In June, Intel revised increased its second-quarter revenue outlook to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, citing stronger-than-expected demand for PCs used by businesses. Intel posted second-quarter net income of $2.8 billion, or 55 cents a share, compared with $2.0 billion, or 39  cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.

Retail sales and industrial output were either in line with forecasts or slightly higher.The data confirmed the Asian giant had stabilised after a shaky start to the year but still left the global outlook cloudy, particularly given recent weakness in the euro zone.""The GDP figure is in line with our expectation, but the underlying momentum and recovery is still at a fragile state, especially given the property market correction,"" said Chang Jian, an analyst at Barclays based in Hong Kong.""The recovery is quite dependent on the government support.""MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  was down 0.2 percent while Japan's Nikkei  eased 0.1 percent. Markets in China managed only a muted cheer and the Shanghai index dipped 0.29 percent.European investors seemed more impressed, with financial spreadbetters expecting the FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 to open 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent firmer.Wall Street had provided scant direction after investors gave a muddled reaction to testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.Yellen reiterated that the U.S. labour market was far from healthy and signalled the Fed would keep monetary policy loose until hiring and wage data show the effects of the financial crisis are ""completely gone"".Yet bond investors fixed on a comment that rates could rise more quickly should the labour market continue to improve at a rapid pace, and drove up short-term Treasury yields. The latest U.S. economic news was generally upbeat as a solid rise in core retail sales in June combining with upward revisions to past months led analysts to nudge up estimates for economic growth in the second quarter.The Dow ended up a bare 0.03 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.19 percent and the Nasdaq 0.54 percent. High-flying social media and biotechnology shares took a hit after the Fed singled out the valuation of the sector as ""substantially stretched.""But there was some brighter news for the tech sector as chipmaker Intel jumped more than 4 percent after beating estimates. <ID:nL2N0PQ2A3>EURO BLUES  JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs  outperformed after reporting strong results.

The U.S. currency still managed to gain elsewhere and its index edged up to a three-week high at 80.453.A big mover in Asia was the New Zealand dollar, which slid to $0.8700 after the country reported softer-than-expected inflation.In commodity markets, gold fell back to $1,298.50 an ounce and further away from last week's peak at $1,345.Oil prices managed a small bounce on Wednesday having struck a three-month trough the day before.

150,"  (Adds Intel comment, more details from ruling)By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO Aug 8 Four Silicon Valley companies including Apple and Google failed to persuade a U.S. judge to sign off on a $324.5 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit by tech workers, who accused the firms of conspiring to avoid poaching each other's employees.In a ruling on Friday, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said the class action settlement was too low, given the strength of the case against the companies. Intel  and Adobe were also part of the proposed deal.There is ""substantial and compelling evidence"" that late Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs ""was a, if not the, central figure in the alleged conspiracy,"" Koh wrote. The judge provided details in evidence of anecdotes involving Jobs and other Valley executives to show why she thought the workers deserved more.Representatives for Apple and Google Inc declined to comment. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the company is disappointed Koh rejected an agreement ""that was negotiated at arm's length over many months,"" but appreciates that Koh provided additional information on her views.Lawyers for the workers, along with an Adobe representative, were not immediately available to comment.In their 2011 lawsuit, the tech employees said the conspiracy had limited their job mobility and, as a result, kept a lid on salaries. The case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity to peek into the world of some of America's elite tech firms. The case was based largely on emails in which Apple's Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt and some of their rivals hatched plans to avoid poaching each other's prized engineers.PARIS BLUES Koh referred to one email exchange which occurred after a Google recruiter solicited an Apple employee. Schmidt told Jobs that the recruiter would be fired. Jobs then forwarded Schmidt's note to a top Apple human resources executive with a smiley face. Koh also disclosed a 2006 exchange over Google's plans to open an engineering center in Paris. Google sought to hire three former Apple engineers for the project, but Jobs objected. Jobs wrote that his company would ""strongly prefer that you not hire these guys."" Google then told Jobs it had scrapped plans for the Paris center, ""based on your strong preference.""The four companies agreed to settle with the workers in April shortly before trial. The plaintiffs had planned to ask for about $3 billion in damages at trial, which could have tripled to $9 billion under antitrust law.Plaintiff attorneys argued Koh should approve the deal because the workers faced serious risks on appeal had the case gone forward. Some tech workers filed objections to the settlement, however, saying both sides should go back to the negotiating table in the hopes of obtaining a larger amount. Daniel Girard, a lawyer for one of the objectors, said he is ""very pleased that the court agreed with his position."" It is unclear whether objectors would be included in any future settlement negotiations.In her ruling, Koh repeatedly referred to a related settlement last year involving Disney and Intuit. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less in the latest deal compared to the one involving Disney, Koh wrote, even though plaintiff lawyers have ""much more leverage"" now than they did a year ago.To match the earlier settlement, the latest deal ""would need to total at least $380 million,"" Koh wrote.The judge also said the plaintiffs had strong evidence to prove how the no-poaching deals impacted wages. In response to hiring pressure from Facebook, Google co-founder Sergey Brin announced a policy in 2007 of making counteroffers ""within one hour"" to any Google employee approached by the social networking company.Google then tried to entice Facebook into a no-poaching deal, Koh wrote, but Facebook refused. The Facebook threat eventually led Google to alter its salary structure and increase all salaries by 10 percent, Koh wrote.A further hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 10.The case is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation,  U.S. District Court, Northern District of California 11-cv-2509.

153,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp plans to use wearable gadgets such as smart watches to monitor patients with Parkinson's disease and collect data that can be shared with researchers.On Wednesday, the chip maker said it is teaming up with the Michael J. Fox Foundation, established by the actor and Parkinson's sufferer in 2000, to conduct a multi-phase research study of the neurodegenerative brain disease. An estimated five million people globally have been diagnosed with Parkinson's, the second-most-common neurudegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. The initial goal is to determine the feasibility of using wearable devices to monitor patients remotely and store that data in an open system that can be accessed by scientists. In the next phase of the study, which will likely kick off in the fall, the foundation will set aside funds to explore how patients are responding to medication. Participants will be monitored via an array of wearable devices. ""As more of these devices hit the market, we can collect objective measurements and determine the efficacy of new therapeutics,"" Sohini Chowdhury, a senior vice president for research partnerships at the foundation, told Reuters.  Clinical trials have been far too ""subjective"" in the past, she said. For instance, a patient might inform her doctor that she felt a tremor for several minutes, when it actually lasted a matter of seconds. In the future, Chowdhury hopes patients and their doctors will have more precise measurements via wearable devices about the ""frequency and severity"" of symptoms. Chowdhury said the foundation will continue to raise funding to cover the costs of providing wearable devices to patients.By using such devices, the foundation and other research groups can tap into a broader pool of patients for clinical trials, Chowdhury said. Today, many people with Parkinson's disease are unable to participate in clinical trials because they do not live near a research facility. But wearable devices offer a convenient way to track patients from their work or homes, allowing people in the most rural parts of the country to participate. As it expands beyond the PC arena, Intel hopes to capture a share of the growing market for big data analytics and wearable devices in the health sector. Ron Kasabian, general manager of Intel's Big Data Solutions group, said the data center and ""Internet of Things"" business units are exploring the sector.

154,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Aug 13 Intel Corp plans to use wearable gadgets such as smart watches to monitor patients with Parkinson's disease and collect data that can be shared with researchers.On Wednesday, the chip maker said it is teaming up with the Michael J. Fox Foundation, established by the actor and Parkinson's sufferer in 2000, to conduct a multi-phase research study of the neurodegenerative brain disease. An estimated five million people globally have been diagnosed with Parkinson's, the second-most-common neurudegenerative disease after Alzheimer's.The initial goal is to determine the feasibility of using wearable devices to monitor patients remotely and store that data in an open system that can be accessed by scientists.In the next phase of the study, which will likely kick off in the fall, the foundation will set aside funds to explore how patients are responding to medication. Participants will be monitored via an array of wearable devices. ""As more of these devices hit the market, we can collect objective measurements and determine the efficacy of new therapeutics,"" Sohini Chowdhury, a senior vice president for research partnerships at the foundation, told Reuters.Clinical trials have been far too ""subjective"" in the past, she said. For instance, a patient might inform her doctor that she felt a tremor for several minutes, when it actually lasted a matter of seconds. In the future, Chowdhury hopes patients and their doctors will have more precise measurements via wearable devices about the ""frequency and severity"" of symptoms.Chowdhury said the foundation will continue to raise funding to cover the costs of providing wearable devices to patients. By using such devices, the foundation and other research groups can tap into a broader pool of patients for clinical trials, Chowdhury said. Today, many people with Parkinson's disease are unable to participate in clinical trials because they do not live near a research facility.But wearable devices offer a convenient way to track patients from their work or homes, allowing people in the most rural parts of the country to participate. As it expands beyond the PC arena, Intel hopes to capture a share of the growing market for big data analytics and wearable devices in the health sector. Ron Kasabian, general manager of Intel's Big Data Solutions group, said the data center and ""Internet of Things"" business units are exploring the sector.""We're exploring how to pull data out of devices in real-time,"" he said. ""We can mine data to improve research, and better understand the behaviors and progression of the disease.""While Intel boasts its own wearable technologies, Kasabian stressed that the Parkinson's study is device agnostic, meaning patients can test a variety of wearable gadgets.

155,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) has hired Amir Faintuch, a senior executive at rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), to step up efforts in mobile and Internet-connected gadgets.Hiring a senior executive from a major competitor is rare for Intel, which is known in Silicon Valley for its insular culture, and it reflects the eagerness of the Santa Clara, California, chipmaker to improve its struggling mobile business.Faintuch, who previously oversaw Qualcomm's networking and connectivity businesses as president of Qualcomm Atheros, is joining Intel as a senior vice president and co-general manager of the Platform Engineering Group, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said on Friday. He will be among Intel's dozen or so most senior executives and will co-manage the Platform Engineering Group with Josh Walden, a manufacturing technology expert who previously led the group.Mulloy told Reuters that in addition to strong network skills, Faintuch brings experience designing ""system on chips,"" or SoCs, which combine features like modems, Wi-Fi and memory.  While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing SoCs, which are widely used in smartphones and tablets.“We want to accelerate our success rate with SoCs and get the designs aligned and the roadmaps aligned to do that,"" Mulloy said. ""We’ve made good progress but there’s more to be done. Amir has extensive management experience and a strong resume.""A Qualcomm spokesman had no comment beyond confirming Faintuch's departure. Bringing in Faintuch, which was announced in an email to Intel employees on Friday, is the latest move by the company to accelerate progress in mobile gadgets, where it trails Qualcomm.Since taking over in 2013, CEO Brian Krzanich has made a number of sweeping changes designed to counteract a slump in PC sales, including opening Intel's cutting-edge factories to other chipmakers willing to pay for access to them. In May, Intel reached an agreement with Chinese SoC specialist Rockchip to make chips for inexpensive tablets running Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android platform.As Intel struggles with declining PC sales and slow progress in mobile, Qualcomm, whose smartphone chips lead the industry, has been viewed by many engineers in recent years as a potentially more attractive place to work. In 2012, senior executive Anand Chandrasekher, a 25-year Intel veteran, jumped over to Qualcomm to become the San Diego company's chief marketing officer.

160,"   By Alina Selyukh | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Regulating internet providers more like public utility companies could hurt the Internet and the U.S. economy, more than two dozen network technology and equipment makers have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.Thirty-three companies including Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp joined the chorus of citizens, activists, lawmakers and companies debating how the U.S. government should regulate Internet service providers (ISPs).Other companies signing a letter to Pritzker published on Tuesday included Alcatel Lucent SA, Ericsson, Nokia Oyj's network arm NSN, Panasonic Corp of North America and CommScope Holding Co Inc.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering so-called ""net neutrality"" rules that would determine how ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc manage web traffic on their networks.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed rules that would allow ISPs to charge content companies to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly, as long as such deals are deemed ""commercially reasonable."" Critics, including popular video streaming service Netflix Corp and numerous advocacy groups, argue the plan would threaten less deep-pocketed content providers by potentially relegating them to ""slow lanes"" on the web. MORE POWER  Instead, they call on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service rather than the less-regulated information service it is now, saying the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality. ISPs and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, have rejected the idea. On Tuesday, 33 telecom network and tech makers, who are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and who depend on ISPs for business, spoke out against the reclassification idea as well.""A sudden shift from the existing light-touch approach – which has been an unqualified success and the basis for billions of dollars in investments – to the prescriptive regime of Title II would be extremely disruptive to the broadband marketplace,"" they wrote, referring to the legal authority the FCC would use to reclassify ISPs. Experts have disagreed on whether or how reclassification would adequately prevent pay-for-priority deals. Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option.FCC is collecting public comment on the tentatively proposed rules until Sept. 15 and will hold several public workshops on various aspects of the regulations in the following weeks.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy will hold a hearing on the issue of net neutrality on Sept. 17.

161,"   By Paul Carsten | TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12  TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12 The sheer size of the Chinese market is so alluring to Western companies that even pro-internet freedom firms like CloudFlare may have to put moral outrage to the side in their pursuit of new business.San Francisco-based CloudFlare has a policy of providing cyber-defence services for all, based on a belief that the internet should be free, decentralised and open.Its clients have included groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorist organisations. Those values may now have to be shelved when it comes to entering China, where state control of the internet is among the world's tightest.CloudFlare is looking for a Chinese partner and aims to be in the country by 2015, said co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern city of Tianjin this week. ""As we think about international expansion it's vital that we get China,"" said Zatlyn of CloudFlare's second-largest market by user traffic. ""There are rules and regulation which operate within the country. As a U.S. company we absolutely have to follow those, and we're okay with that.""The operating environment in China may be even tougher now. U.S. businesses have complained about Chinese protectionism, and American tech firms have repeatedly come under fire from the state since last year's U.S. National Security Agency cyber espionage revelations. Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc are being investigated for anti-trust violations, while IBM Corp, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen sales in China plummet in recent quarters.CloudFlare is joining a long list of companies, from firms that have seen little or no success in China like Yahoo Inc , eBay Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to recent entrants like LinkedIn Corp, for whom China's pull as the world's largest internet market by population has been too strong to resist. CloudFlare is hoping to learn from the lessons of the U.S. tech sector's fallen soldiers in China. One of these came at the World Economic Forum, where Lu Wei, the director of China's State Internet Information Office, said Facebook will be unable to access China any time soon, according to state media.""You have to play a slightly long game if you're a Western multi-national company in China,"" said Mark Spelman, a managing director at Accenture PLC.""It's very important to think about which Chinese partners you should be working with, and organisations need to think very  carefully about what business model you need in China - it might not be the same as in other countries,"" he cautioned.

179,"  (Updates with closing levels, adds details)By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK Oct 10 Volatility has suddenly returned to U.S. stocks, and for the first time all year it doesn't appear that the weakness in equities will go away quietly in the span of a few days.While the S&P 500 is still up 3.1 percent for the year, the index is off about 5 percent from its record high reached in mid-September, and closed out this week at the lowest level since May 23.""We're still in a bull market, but in the near term things are a little bit dicey, and I don't think the decline is over with yet,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly declines since May 2012, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended Friday in negative territory for the year.The S&P also posted back-to-back intraday moves of more than 40 points this week for the first time in three years. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, ended at 21.24 on Friday, its highest level since early February.Investors said they were concerned about the eventual end of Federal Reserve stimulus, as well as weak growth overseas and its potential effect on U.S. earnings. The slide in oil prices has also served as a harbinger for poor demand, and investors in general got caught betting heavily on further market gains at a time when this stew boiled over. The volatility recalls the last major period of big market gyrations in the second half of 2011, when the first-ever credit downgrade of the United States and the threat of a debt default kept investors on their toes for several months. It is unclear whether the current turmoil will last as long.""What is interesting about what is going on is that you have several themes all feeding into the same action, and that action is to mitigate risk,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist of Clearpool Group in New York. DEFENSIVE PLAYS The only S&P 500 sectors to gain since the market's Sept. 18 high are defensive - utilities and consumer staples. This week also saw the biggest weekly inflow on record to U.S. taxable bond funds, while nearly $7 billion left stock funds.One sign that investors anticipate more volatility has been in the options market, where volumes have increased sharply.  Friday marked the busiest day in the options market since June 2013, with options volume totaling 27.2 million contracts, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.In addition, the CBOE Volatility Index is trading higher than monthly VIX futures contracts between now and May 2015, a sign of worry about near-term ups and downs in the market. ""Just look at options volume versus stocks volume over the past three to six months,"" said Tim Biggam, lead option strategist at online brokerage TradingBlock.""Options volume has been nothing but growing and stock volume has been sort of petering out. A lot of the big players are pre-positioning with options.""Growing worry over Europe and other overseas economies has money managers concerned about earnings season. The next two weeks bring a slew of U.S. corporate results, including from S&P 500 companies with some of the highest levels of sales abroad, such as chip maker Intel Corp.A disappointing outlook from Microchip Technology  late Thursday has put a negative spin on the chip sector's outlook. The PHLX semiconductor index saw its largest daily percentage decline since January 2009, ending down 6.9 percent on Friday. It lost as much as 15 percent since hitting a 13-year high less than a month ago.Should U.S. results prove strong, however, it may stem the recent selling.""The earnings reports from the U.S. should help put a bottom in the market and lead to some regained strength. We think we remain in good shape,"" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Asset Management, which has about $924 billion in assets.

180,"   By Gerry Shih, Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO  BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO Intel's investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung.For more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals.""We've entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it's started to help the local semiconductor industry,"" said Nomura analyst Leping Huang.The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel's beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company's years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal.The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips.China is the world's largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co, or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan.China's ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance program PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry.For Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world's biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets. Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment.NATIONAL TARGETS The China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China's chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption. Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People's Congress, said in March that China's $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country's entire yearly petroleum imports.In June, the State Council offered the country's most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020.An important part of Beijing's effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq.The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing.As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA.Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan's MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup.TRUE PARTNERS  Since taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker.A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek.Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. In May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel's architecture.""With China, what they want is for you to be a true partner,"" Krzanich told reporters in September.

181,"   By Gerry Shih, Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO  BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO Oct 14 Intel's investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung.For more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals.""We've entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it's started to help the local semiconductor industry,"" said Nomura analyst Leping Huang.The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel's beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company's years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal.The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips.China is the world's largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co , or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan.China's ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance programme PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry.For Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world's biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets.Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment.NATIONAL TARGETS  The China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China's chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption.Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People's Congress, said in March that China's $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country's entire yearly petroleum imports.In June, the State Council offered the country's most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020.An important part of Beijing's effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq.The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing.As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA. Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan's MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup.TRUE PARTNERS Since taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker.A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek.Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. In May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel's architecture.""With China, what they want is for you to be a true partner,"" Krzanich told reporters in September. ""We go in and we partner, we build factories, we build R&D and we help local companies.""Intel's deal with Tsinghua Unigroup comes three months after Qualcomm agreed to partner with Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest foundry, to produce some of Qualcomm's smartphone chips.As part of the agreement, Qualcomm will help SMIC implement its first high-end 28 nanometre manufacturing technology.It also coincides with a year-long Chinese anti-monopoly investigation into Qualcomm.

183,"  (Adds Intel and Apple declined to comment, additional background)By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO Oct 14 Employees suing Apple , Google and two other tech companies over hiring practices said an appeals court should not approve a $324.5 million settlement in the case, according to a court filing on Tuesday.Plaintiff workers accused Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe in a 2011 lawsuit of conspiring to avoid poaching each other's employees. The companies agreed to a $324.5 million settlement earlier this year.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California then rejected the proposed class action settlement, saying the amount was too low. The companies appealed last month, saying she committed ""clear legal error."" In the filing on Tuesday, the workers said that although they believed the $324.5 million deal originally warranted approval, the judge had the proper authority to reject it and they would ""defer to (Koh's) sound judgment about how best to oversee this litigation.""An Intel spokesman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman. Representatives for Google and Adobe could not immediately be reached.Tech employees alleged that the conspiracy limited their job mobility and, as a result, kept a lid on salaries. The case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity of a glimpse into the world of some of the United States' elite tech firms.Plaintiffs based their allegations of conspiracy largely on emails circulated among Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt, and some of their rivals. In rejecting the proposed settlement, Koh repeatedly referred to a related deal last year involving Disney  and Intuit. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less in the latest agreement compared with the one involving Disney, Koh wrote.To match the earlier settlement, the latest deal ""would need to total at least $380 million,"" Koh wrote.In the filing on Tuesday, the plaintiffs argued that the $324.5 million deal ""ceased to exist"" the moment Koh rejected it, by virtue of the settlement terms negotiated by both sides. The companies ""should not complain about this state of affairs, given that it is their own doing,"" attorneys for the employees wrote.The case is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California 11-cv-2509.

For a factbox on the market's selloff, see ""Today's action is typical of a market that hasn't completed its downward course,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.""In order for this market to escape further declines, we would have to see the market begin to stabilize and not slip in and out of the plus and minus column consistently.""The selloff has been driven by a host of negative influences including the potential spread of Ebola, the effect of global economic weakness on U.S. earnings and plunging oil prices. The S&P energy index fell with oil prices, dragging down equities late in the session. The index, which ended 1.2 percent lower for the session, is now down 20.1 percent from its June high, putting it in bear market territory.Despite some early upbeat corporate results, concerns remain about the effect of a stronger dollar on global demand and U.S. earnings, Cardillo said.Citigroup, up 3.1 percent at $51.47, was among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P index after the bank posted better-than-expected quarterly results and said it would pull out of consumer banking in 11 markets.After the close, shares of Intel gained 1.4 percent to $32.60 following its results and outlook, which included a rosy fourth-quarter forecast. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.88 points, or 0.04 percent, to 16,315.19, the S&P 500 gained 2.96 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,877.7 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.52 points, or 0.32 percent, to 4,227.17.Volume has picked up with the volatility in the markets in recent days. About 9.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 8.4 billion average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Delta Air Lines, up 6.1 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Newfield Exploration, down 5.7 percent.The largest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was NXP Semiconductor, which rose 5.0 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Gilead, down 4.2 percent.Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Brazil's Petrobras, down 0.98 percent to $17.10. Intel was among the most actively traded on the Nasdaq.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,873 to 1,196, for a 1.57-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,689 issues rose and 1,027 fell.

Progress in Intel's smartphone and tablet strategy was less clear. The mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $1.04 billion for the September quarter, worse than a $810 million loss the year before. The company in recent years was slow to recognize the significance of the smartphone revolution, and CEO Brain Krzanich, who took over in 2012, has accelerated efforts to catch up by subsidizing costs for tablet manufacturers that use its chips.Smartphones and tablets account for a tiny fraction of Intel's business, but the company sees staking out territory in mobile as key to emerging markets such as  wearable computing products.  Intel is using its deep pockets to help it reach its goal to see its chips used in at least 40 million tablets this year, up from 10 million in 2013. The vast majority of smartphones and tablets are made with processors based on rival technology from Britain's ARM Holdings Plc Britain's ARM Holdings ARM.L.Intel's subsidies are meant to reduce the burden to manufacturers of designing tablets with Intel's current chips, which require more expensive memory and other components that it says drive up costs.Intel says its future chips will be more cost-effective for manufacturers and will not need subsidies in order to sell.  “The strategy is that over time, we think we can give better performance, more features in that segment of the market and so we wanted to start the work of building our footprint,” Intel CFO Stacy Smith said in a phone interview.Besides tablet subsidies, Intel's mobile and communications group is feeling the pinch from slower sales of 2G and 3G chips as cellphone makers move to more advanced 4G technology. Qualcomm (QCOM.O) has a major lead in 4G technology over rivals including Intel.     Intel's subsidies have made it the largest maker of tablet chips after Apple (AAPL.O), which uses its own chips in its iPads, according to market research firm StrategyAnalytics. On a conference call with analysts, Krzanich said that by year end, Intel might slightly exceed its 40 million tablet goal. The subsidies, which Intel calls ""contra revenues"", will drop off as tablet makers switch to Intel's more cost-effective chips, Intel says.“Based on the new platforms coming to market in the back half of this year and early next year, we expect those contra revenue dollars to start to wane pretty significantly,” Smith said.

Like a boomerang, it returns to its owner and then syncs with the owner's smartphone.Falling behind Qualcomm in recent years after it was slow to embrace smartphones and tablets, Intel has been keen to make sure its processors are at the front of future technology trends. CEO Brian Krzanich in January launched the ""Make it Wearable"" contest to encourage entrepreneurs and hobbyists to use Intel's chips to develop new kinds of wearable technology. The prize money is meant to help the winners bring their prototype to market.""This was an experiment to see what we could do in this space and see what kind of creativity we could spawn,"" Krzanich said at an award event on Monday. ""The real value in this was the diversity of the teams and ideas."" Finalists included a pad that lets premature babies in incubators feel the heartbeat of their mothers, and a necklace that uses patterns of pulses felt on the chest to give cyclists turn-by-turn directions so they don't need to look at their smartphones.Samsung Electronics, Motorola and other technology companies are rolling out growing numbers of smart watches and fitness bands, but the wearable category has yet to gain major traction with consumers. Apple plans to roll out a smartwatch in 2015. Intel, whose chips are ubiquitous in personal computers and servers, this year bought health tracker startup Basis.

192,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich expects new semiconductor partners in China to migrate to the U.S. chipmaker's architecture within a few years and give up on ARM technology more widely used in smartphones and tablets.Intel this year signed deals with Rockchip and Spreadtrum Communications to use Intel's technology to make chips for low-cost smartphones and tablets aimed at China's fast-growing consumer market.Spreadtrum and Rockchip specialize in turnkey smartphone and tablet platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use. They typically design their chips with technology licensed from Britain's ARM Holdings Plc, which competes against Intel's technology.While the agreements with Intel do not prevent the Chinese chipmakers from continuing to make ARM-based chips, Krzanich told reporters late on Monday he believes that within two or three years they will exclusively use Intel's architecture. With leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc offering high-end chips based on ARM and Taiwan's MediaTek attacking the Chinese market with inexpensive chips also designed using ARM, adopting Intel's architecture and cutting-edge factories offer a way to differentiate with better performance and features, Krzanich said. ""If you're a small guy trying to compete, it's tough to be in that battle."" Intel was late to mobile and has rushed to make its technology more suitable for tablets and smartphones. While Intel excels at processors for personal computers, it has less experience designing low-power ""system on chips"" or SoCs, key components in mobile devices, which combine features including processors, Wi-Fi and memory. Intel and Rockchip are working on an Intel-branded tablet SoC, with Rockchip contributing expertise on connectivity, graphics and its experience in China's domestic market. Spreadtrum, as part of a deal by Intel to buy 20 percent of its parent company for $1.5 billion, is working with Intel on SoCs expected out next year.Since they are relatively small, both Chinese chipmakers probably do not have the resources to make separate chips based on Intel and ARM technology over the long term, Krzanich said. With demand for smartphones cooling in the United States, manufacturers have increased their focus on China, where demand is strong for handsets priced under $150. Krzanich said Intel might partner with more companies there.""We're not done. China is the fastest growing market in the world,"" he said.

McAfee is now part of Intel Security Group, where Fey had been chief technology officer.Fey told Reuters his role at Blue Coat would be ""very similar"" to his previous job. ""But I get to focus on the cloud and the advanced threats space more,"" he said.""Blue Coat had tremendous growth behind the scenes and now I get to focus on taking that growth and trying to get it to the billion-dollar revenue mark,"" he said in a telephone interview. McAfee confirmed Fey's departure in an email.Since the $7.7 billion acquisition by Intel, McAfee has lost senior managers and key talent in technology development, research and sales.At Blue Coat, Fey will replace David Murphy, who will stay on as a strategic adviser to the board. ""David has been an extremely important person in the company and he remains a substantial shareholder and one of our key go-to people for strategy,"" Blue Coat Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters.Blue Coat, bought by San Francisco-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $1.3 billion in February 2012, operates in an area where businesses and governments are spending more to counter and contain cyber security threats.

214,"  LONDON, Dec 4 European shares headed for a stronger open on Thursday, tracking gains in the United States and Asia, with improving U.S. economic outlook and expectations of further stimulus from the European Central Bank boosting sentiment.     ECB President Mario Draghi will present the bank's updated forecasts for growth in output as well as inflation at a policy meeting later in the day. The ECB could extend a scheme to buy rebundled debt to purchasing corporate bonds, but it is unlikely to announce any radical immediate move such as printing money to buy government bonds.      ""We will be looking at the exact wording of the introductory statement,"" Credit Agricole said in a note. ""If the reference to sovereign debt purchases appears in the statement, then it would be the clearest sign that the ECB is ready to deliver sooner rather than later, probably with a comfortable majority.""     The Federal Reserve's vice chair Stanley Fischer was quoted as saying in an Italian newspaper that the ECB should follow the example of the U.S. central bank and buy government bonds to prop up the tottering euro zone economy.

In France, unemployment rate rose to 10.4 percent in the third quarter from a revised 10.1 percent in the previous quarter, data published by the INSEE national statistics office showed on Thursday.      Investors' focus will also be on energy stocks after Brent crude oil prices rose above $70 a barrel, gaining nearly a percent along with U.S. futures, as a fall in crude stockpiles in the United States supported prices.

215,"  BEIJING Intel Corp (INTC.O) will invest $1.6 billion to upgrade its factory in the city of Chengdu in western China, the latest sign of how the chipmaker is deepening ties in a market that is proving increasingly troublesome for some U.S. technology peers.As part of the upgrade, Intel said in a statement on Thursday it would bring its most advanced chip-testing technology to China. In exchange it will receive local and regional government support for construction. ""Deploying our newest advanced testing technology in China shows our commitment to innovating jointly with China,"" Intel executive vice president William Holt said in the statement. ""The fully upgraded Chengdu plant will help the Chinese semiconductor industry and boost regional economic growth.""The announcement comes three months after Intel purchased a minority stake in a government-controlled semiconductor company to jointly design and distribute mobile chips, an industry that China considers to be of strategic importance. Intel's fortunes in China contrast with the travails of its rival, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which is expected to announce in the coming days a potentially record-breaking settlement with Chinese antitrust regulators.  China's investigation into San Diego-based Qualcomm, as well as a spate of recent probes against firms including Microsoft Corp, have prompted an outcry from foreign business lobbies. They say the Chinese government is increasingly adopting strong-arm tactics to yield technology-sharing or other arrangements beneficial to domestic industry.The government, meanwhile, has defended its regulatory scrutiny as even-handed. It has pointed to a history of Qualcomm and Microsoft facing similar antitrust probes in Western countries. Analysts say there is a broad recognition that foreign companies must do more to stay in China's good graces.""Intel's taking the approach that's appreciated by the Chinese government,"" Nomura analyst Leping Huang said.

""The fully upgraded Chengdu plant will help the Chinese semiconductor industry and boost regional economic growth.""The announcement comes three months after Intel purchased a minority stake in a government-controlled semiconductor company to jointly design and distribute mobile chips, an industry that China considers to be of strategic importance. Intel's fortunes in China contrast with the travails of its rival, Qualcomm Inc, which is expected to announce in the coming days a potentially record-breaking settlement with Chinese antitrust regulators.China's investigation into San Diego-based Qualcomm, as well as a spate of recent probes against firms including Microsoft Corp, have prompted an outcry from foreign business lobbies. They say the Chinese government is increasingly adopting strong-arm tactics to yield technology-sharing or other arrangements beneficial to domestic industry. The government, meanwhile, has defended its regulatory scrutiny as even-handed. It has pointed to a history of Qualcomm and Microsoft facing similar antitrust probes in Western countries. Analysts say there is a broad recognition that foreign companies must do more to stay in China's good graces.""Intel's taking the approach that's appreciated by the Chinese government,"" Nomura analyst Leping Huang said.

217,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 9 Intel Corp on Tuesday unveiled a new platform to make it easier for companies to create Internet-connected smart products using its chips, security and software.Intel's platform is like a set of building blocks based on the chipmaker's components and software for companies to create smart, connected devices, Doug Davis, head of Intel's Internet of Things business, said at a launch event in San Francisco.It also aims to make it easier to connect to data centers in order analyze data collected from devices' sensors. ""We're creating compute capability in end-point devices that scale from our highest performance Xeon processor to the Quark family of products,"" Davis said, referring to Intel's chips.After moving slowly in recent years to adapt its personal computer chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel is determined to make sure it is on the leading edge of future computing trends, industry experts and company executives have said. Adding processors, sensors and web connectivity to devices from soccer balls to industrial machinery, an emerging trend dubbed the Internet of Things, has become a new battleground for Intel, rival Qualcomm and other technology companies. The install base of wireless gadgets will more than double by the end of the decade, with most of the growth coming from smart devices other than PCs and smartphones, according to market research firm ABI Research.Intel's Internet of Things Group had $530 million in revenue in the September quarter. That accounted for just 4 percent of Intel's total revenue in the quarter, but it grew 14 percent over the previous year, which was faster than the company's PC business.Dell, SAP, Tata Consultancy, Accenture  and other companies are working with the new reference model, Davis said.

226,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jan 12 Walt Disney Co, Sony Corp  and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc urged a federal judge to throw out a antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring not to poach each other's animators in order to keep wages down.The defendants told U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, that the plaintiff animators took too long to sue by waiting until five years after the U.S. Department of Justice in 2009 began probing recruiting practices at Silicon Valley and other technology companies.In a Friday night filing, the defendants also called it ""implausible"" to believe they would collude to suppress wages after the federal probe began, and after several companies including Disney had settled related private litigation.""The court might ask what, exactly, these plaintiffs have uncovered that was somehow missed by the industrious High-Tech plaintiffs,"" the companies said. ""The short answer is: nothing."" Daniel Small, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined immediate comment on Monday, saying he had yet to review the defendants' filings.Blue Sky Studios, a unit of 21st Century Fox Inc, is also a defendant. Lighting artist Georgia Cano, character effects artist Robert Nitsch and production engineer David Wentworth are the named plaintiffs.The lawsuit accuses the defendants of having illegally suppressed animators' wages since 2004 by agreeing not to cold call employees, alerting each other to hiring offers, and agreeing not to offer more pay in response to counteroffers. Disney's Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and Intuit Inc  settled similar claims covering other workers for a combined $20 million, while Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and Adobe Systems Inc reached their own $324.5 million settlement last May.Koh last August rejected the $324.5 million accord as too low. Technology workers later asked the federal appeals court in San Francisco to overturn that ruling. As in other anti-poaching lawsuits, the animators' lawsuit relies in part on emails and testimony under oath.It cites, among other things, a 2005 email from a Pixar human resources executive alluding to a ""gentleman's agreement"" not to poach, and testimony in which Lucasfilm founder and ""Star Wars"" director George Lucas was said to want to avoid bidding wars ""because we don't have the margins for that sort of thing.""A hearing on the dismissal motion is set for March 26.The case is In re: Animation Workers Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-04062.

227,"   By Anya George Tharakan and Bill Rigby  Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast current-quarter revenue and gross margins that disappointed investors, sending its shares down more than 2 percent in extended trading. Revenue from its mainstay PC business fell about 3 percent to $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter from the third, raising doubts about the expected recovery of the personal computer business.Global personal computer shipments fell 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to research firm IDC, capping three years of declines. That was not as bad as expected, raising hopes among some investors that the PC market is starting to stabilize. That optimism has helped drive Intel's stock up 16 percent in the past three months, compared with a 7 percent gain for the S&P 500, to levels not seen since 2001. In the light of that, Wall Street was hoping for more encouraging figures. ""The top line looked a little bit light of the Street and gross margin looked a little bit light,"" Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said.""PC was weaker in the fourth quarter than we were expecting,"" Rolland added.The chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter.

""I think we are going to need to see some more restructuring and realignment in the computing and graphics side of the business,"" Van Hees said.AMD, which said in October it would cut 7 percent of its workforce, has been shifting focus to gaming consoles and low-power servers to combat falling laptop sales.But progress has lagged Wall Street's expectations. While the console business has been doing well, it hasn't been enough to offset the effects of the struggling computing business, Van Hees said.Last week Intel gave a disappointing forecast for first-quarter revenue and AMD, a minor player in the PC processor market, followed suit on Tuesday.AMD's revenue fell 22 percent to $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec 27, in line with Wall Street's estimate. The company forecast revenue to fall 15 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, in the current quarter from the fourth quarter.That translates to about $1.02-$1.09 billion, well short of analysts average estimate of $1.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.AMD reported a net loss of $364 million, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $89 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, AMD broke even on a per share basis, just below analysts average estimate of a profit of 1 cent per share.Up to Monday's close, AMD's stock had fallen about 46 percent in the last one year.

Its stock hit a record 94 euros and was up 0.6 percent at 90.08 euros by 1431 GMT.ASML makes lithography machines, which use highly focused beams of light to trace out the circuitry of computer chips. It is a key supplier to the world's biggest chipmakers including Samsung and Intel.Its results are therefore sometimes seen as a proxy for how quickly electronics makers are investing to create the next generation of products.In this instance they suggest strong demand for memory chips used in all manner of mobile devices, and a careful approach to capital spending by top microprocessor maker Intel, which is investing in a new class of chips for laptops capable of cord-free wireless charging and new 3D features. ASML said growth in the first half of 2015 was expected to come from contract chipmakers, known as foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM received a contract from Apple last year to make chips for the iPhone 6.Chief Executive Peter Wennink said the foundry business was ""in its most aggressive ramp-up that we've ever seen, to support new mobile and communications"" devices. He said ASML's order backlog had increased to 2.8 billion euros from 2.41 billion three months before. MIXED PICTURE For logic chips, such as those made by Intel, he said the picture was mixed; one unnamed customer was racing to begin using ASML's next generation of machines in production by 2016, while others are still expanding use of the current generation.Many analysts are wary of the high valuation of the stock, which is trading at around 25 times forecast earnings against a peer average of 17 times, according to Reuters data, despite vulnerabilities to economic swings which in 2008 caused a sharp slowdown and forced it to cut 1,000 jobs.""This is clearly a strong update but given (the) current valuation strong updates are needed to support the share,"" ABN AMRO analyst Marc Hesselink said in a note to clients.Janardan Menon at brokerage Liberum said ASML's medium-term prospects may be overdone, as sales of both smartphones and tablets had peaked after years of rapid growth. ""The mood at the memory chip makers is weakening as we speak,"" he said.Menon added ASML's order book was strengthened by foundry orders for the first half of 2015, but there was little evidence of new appetite from chip makers to invest in its next-generation equipment. ""The likelihood is for some weakness in the second half,"" he said, rating the stock ""hold"".($1 = 0.8640 euros)   (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi and David Holmes)",2015-01-21,INTC,"Wed Jan 21, 2015 | 9:36am EST",UPDATE 5-ASML shares hit record after fourth quarter tops forecasts,http://www.reuters.com//article/asml-holding-results-idUSL6N0V00EU20150121?type=companyNews
241,"   By Arathy S Nair  U.S. chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) forecast weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and said it taking steps to return its computing and graphics businesses to a ""healthy trajectory"" from the second quarter.The company also reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue as it struggles with weak sales of graphic cards and to compete with Intel Corp (INTC.O) in a declining PC market.AMD shares were down nearly 1 percent at $2.22 in extended trading.The results and outlook weren't any worse than expected, said Wedbush Securities Inc analyst Betsy Van Hees.""I think we are going to need to see some more restructuring and realignment in the computing and graphics side of the business,"" Van Hees said.AMD, which said in October it would cut 7 percent of its workforce, has been shifting focus to gaming consoles and low-power servers to combat falling laptop sales. But progress has lagged Wall Street's expectations.While the console business has been doing well, it hasn't been enough to offset the effects of the struggling computing business, Van Hees said.Last week Intel gave a disappointing forecast for first-quarter revenue and AMD, a minor player in the PC processor market, followed suit on Tuesday. AMD's revenue fell 22 percent to $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec 27, in line with Wall Street's estimate.The company forecast revenue to fall 15 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, in the current quarter from the fourth quarter.That translates to about $1.02-$1.09 billion, well short of analysts average estimate of $1.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMD reported a net loss of $364 million, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $89 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, AMD broke even on a per share basis, just below analysts average estimate of a profit of 1 cent per share.Up to Monday's close, AMD's stock had fallen about 46 percent in the last one year.

247,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 17 Soros Fund Management LLC took new positions in the energy sector in the fourth quarter, including stakes in Devon Energy Corp and Transocean Ltd , a regulatory filing showed Tuesday.The hedge fund firm, which manages the investments of investor George Soros and his family, bought 385,497 shares of Devon Energy and 149,000 shares of Transocean in the fourth quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actions appear to be timely, as oil prices and energy stocks have rebounded this month after a months-long slump.While Brent crude prices fell about 60 percent between June and January, they have rebounded more than 10 percent in February, with Brent crude hitting its highest this year on Tuesday at $63 a barrel. The S&P energy index, which had fallen about 20 percent between June and January, has rebounded more than 8 percent in February. Soros's purchase of Transocean shares also came ahead of the company's announcement on Feb. 16 that its chief executive,  Steven Newman, was stepping down. Transocean shares are up nearly 4 percent this year.A Soros spokesman declined to comment. The firm also dumped its stakes in technology companies  Google Inc, Apple Inc and Intel Corp , while also liquidating positions in Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Netflix Inc during the quarter. By dumping the stake in Apple, the fund missed out on a 16 percent rally in the iPhone maker's shares this year. Soros sold 17,142 class A Google shares and 67,572 class C shares, 1.1 million Apple shares and 3.9 million Intel shares. The fund, which disclosed a Yahoo Inc position in the third quarter, sold 3.2 million of its 5.1 million shares in the latest period.Soros is not the only hedge fund to focus on Intel in recent months, as hedge fund manager Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates told cable television network CNBC in mid-January that he was betting against the company's shares.Soros increased its General Motors Co. stake by 412,438 shares to 3.9 million shares, while also adding to its Herbalife Ltd position.

250,"   By Michael Holden and Mark Hosenball | LONDON/WASHINGTON  LONDON/WASHINGTON The masked ""Jihadi John"" killer who fronted Islamic State beheading videos has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi, a British computer programming graduate from a well-to-do London family who was known to the security services.The black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent was shown in videos released by Islamic State (IS) apparently decapitating hostages including Americans, Britons and Syrians.The 26-year-old militant used the videos to threaten the West, admonish its Arab allies and taunt President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron before petrified hostages cowering in orange jump suits.Emwazi's name was first disclosed by the Washington Post, citing unidentified former associates. Two U.S. government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to Reuters that investigators believed Jihadi John was Emwazi.Dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the bridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, Jihadi John became a menacing symbol of Islamic State brutality and one of the world's most wanted men.Hostages called him John as he and other Britons in Islamic State had been nicknamed the Beatles.Emwazi was born in Kuwait but came to Britain aged 6 and graduated with a computer programming degree from the University of Westminster before coming to the attention of Britain's main domestic intelligence service, MI5, according to an account given by Asim Qureshi, the research director of the Cage charity that campaigns for those detained on terrorism charges.Emwazi, a fluent Arabic speaker, said MI5 had tried to recruit him and then prevented him from traveling abroad, forcing him to flee abroad without telling his family, Qureshi told a news conference in London.Emwazi traveled to Syria around 2012, Qureshi said.MI5 does not publicly comment on the identity of militants or their backgrounds while an investigation is still ongoing. The British government and police declined to confirm or deny Emwazi's identity, citing an ongoing security investigation.""We don't confirm or deny matters relating to intelligence,"" said a spokeswoman for Cameron, who has ordered spy agencies and soldiers to track down the killer.MOST WANTED MAN ""Jihadi John"" rose to notoriety in August 2014 when a video appeared showing a masked man raging against the United States before apparently beheading U.S. citizen James Foley off camera. Intelligence services in the United States and Britain used a variety of investigative techniques including voice and facial recognition as well as interviews with former hostages to identify the man, intelligence sources said.But security officials made great efforts to avoid publicly naming Emwazi, fearing that would make him more difficult to catch. Two intelligence sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were uneasy that the name had been revealed.There was no answer at two addresses in west London where Emwazi was listed to have lived. Neighbors described the family as ""normal people"" and ""friendly"".""This is the first time anything like this happens in this neighborhood,"" said Fatima Al-Baqali. ""We have to be careful now. I didn't know this family and I usually know everyone here.""""JIHADI JOHN"" Qureshi, of the Cage charity which describes itself as having campaigned against the 'War on Terror' for more than a decade, said that although he could not be certain Emwazi was John, there were some ""striking similarities"". He declined to elaborate.In a meeting with reporters in London, Qureshi painted a picture of a kind and thoughtful young man who faced harassment from MI5, which apparently suspected he wanted to join the Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab. British authorities have linked Emwazi to another British militant killed in Somalia in a U.S. drone attack. A British court ruling dated December 2011 reported that Elwazi was an associate of Bilal al Berjawi, a high-ranking leader of the Somali-based militant group al Shabaab, a person in possession of the court ruling said. Reuters has not seen the original court ruling. Media reports said he helped supervise the recruitment and training of new Shabaab members. Qureshi said British spies had tried to recruit Emwazi as a source but declined to provide specifics.""There's one character that I remember, one kind person that I remember and then I see that image and there doesn't seem to be a correlation between the two,"" Qureshi told reporters.""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London..,"" Emwazi wrote in an email to Cage.He felt like ""a person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, (who) stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and my country, Kuwait"". Cage said Emwazi was detained in Tanzania, where he went for a safari holiday with two friends in August 2009.He was deported to Amsterdam and interrogated by MI5 and a Dutch intelligence officer and then sent back to Britain, according to Qureshi.Reuters was unable to immediately verify the version of events given by the charity, which provoked criticism for shifting the responsibility for Emwazi's crimes.""I think this is an attempt to deflect attention from Jihadi John,"" said Shiraz Maher, Senior Fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, King's College London. ""They're trying to lay the blame for this at the feet of the British government,"" he told Sky news.The Cage charity, which also worked with the family of Michael Adebolajo, the Muslim covert who with an accomplice killed a British soldier in London in May 2013, said both men had been victims of undue pressure from the security services.Britain's MI5 security service was not immediately available for comment on those allegations. MI5 has argued to British lawmakers that it would be damaging to national security to comment on allegations that is sought to recruit Adebolajo.The British Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee said last year that MI5 had investigated Adebolajo five times, twice as a high priority, but had found no evidence that any attack was being planned.The Committee said it had found no evidence that Adebolajo was harassed by MI5.After becoming frustrated following three failed attempts to return to Kuwait, and changing his name to Mohammed al-Ayan, Emwazi left his parents' home and slipped out of Britain, according to Qureshi.Four months later, police visited the family home to say they had information he had entered Syria. His family thought he was in Turkey doing aid work.""Jihadi John"" fronted gruesome Islamic State videos that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including U.S. citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese Kenji Goto and over 20 Syrian soldiers.

I didn't know this family and I usually know everyone here.""Qureshi, of the Cage charity which describes itself as having campaigned against the 'War on Terror' for more than a decade, said that although he could not be certain Emwazi was John, there were some ""striking similarities"". He declined to elaborate.In a meeting with reporters in London, Qureshi painted a picture of a kind and thoughtful young man who faced harassment from MI5, which apparently suspected he wanted to join the Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab.British authorities have linked Emwazi to another British militant killed in Somalia in a U.S. drone attack.  A British court ruling dated December 2011 reported that Elwazi was an associate of Bilal al Berjawi, a high-ranking leader of the Somali-based militant group al Shabaab, a person in possession of the court ruling said. Reuters has not seen the original court ruling. Media reports said he helped supervise the recruitment and training of new Shabaab members. BRITISH SPIES Qureshi said British spies had tried to recruit Emwazi as a source but declined to provide specifics.""There's one character that I remember, one kind person that I remember and then I see that image and there doesn't seem to be a correlation between the two,"" Qureshi told reporters.""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London..,"" Emwazi wrote in an email to Cage. He felt like ""a person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, (who) stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and my country, Kuwait"".Cage said Emwazi was detained in Tanzania, where he went for a safari holiday with two friends in August 2009.He was deported to Amsterdam and interrogated by MI5 and a Dutch intelligence officer and then sent back to Britain, according to Qureshi.Reuters was unable to immediately verify the version of events given by the charity, which provoked criticism for shifting the responsibility for Emwazi's crimes.""I think this is an attempt to deflect attention from Jihadi John,"" said Shiraz Maher, Senior Fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization, King's College London. ""They're trying to lay the blame for this at the feet of the British government,"" he told Sky news.The Cage charity, which also worked with the family of Michael Adebolajo, the Muslim covert who with an accomplice killed a British soldier in London in May 2013, said both men had been victims of undue pressure from the security services.Britain's MI5 security service was not immediately available for comment on those allegations. MI5 has argued to British lawmakers that it would be damaging to national security to comment on allegations that is sought to recruit Adebolajo.The British Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee said last year that MI5 had investigated Adebolajo five times, twice as a high priority, but had found no evidence that any attack was being planned.The Committee said it had found no evidence that Adebolajo was harassed by MI5.After becoming frustrated following three failed attempts to return to Kuwait, and changing his name to Mohammed al-Ayan, Emwazi left his parents' home and slipped out of Britain, according to Qureshi.Four months later, police visited the family home to say they had information he had entered Syria. His family thought he was in Turkey doing aid work.""Jihadi John"" fronted gruesome Islamic State videos that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including U.S. citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese Kenji Goto and over 20 Syrian soldiers.

260,"   By Andrew Osborn | LONDON  LONDON Islamist militant Mohammed Emwazi, identified as 'Jihadi John,' was a  member of a network in contact with one of the men convicted of trying to bomb the British capital's underground railway in 2005, according to the government.   The man dubbed by British media ""Jihadi John"" has fronted Islamic State videos from Syria that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including British, U.S. and Japanese citizens and Syrian soldiers. U.S. security sources last week identified the man, who appeared clad in black and brandishing a knife, as Mohammed Emwazi.  The British government's view is set out in court papers, reviewed by Reuters and publicly available on the Internet, which refer to 2011 and 2013 British legal hearings concerning two of Emwazi's London associates, known only as Iranian-born ""CE"" and Ethiopian-born ""J1.""The court papers reported in the Observer and Sunday Telegraph newspapers, offer a fleeting glimpse of Emwazi's life in London before he left for Syria.They show that Emwazi was known to Britain's security services as early as 2011 and that they believed he was part of a group involved in procuring funds and equipment ""for terrorism-related purposes"" in Somalia.They show that authorities thought Emwazi was part of a network that numbered at least 12 people.One of the same network's members, ""J1"", spoke on the phone with Hussain Osman, one of the men convicted in connection with an unsuccessful attempt to blow up the London underground in 2005, on the day of the failed attack itself, the papers show. British Islamists killed 52 people in an attack on London's transport network on July 7, 2005. Another group of Islamists -- of which Osman was one -- tried and failed to pull off a second attack two weeks later.  Osman, who like ""J1"" was also born in Ethiopia, was convicted by a London court of conspiracy to murder in 2007 and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in prison.    The same documents show that ""J1"", Emwazi's associate, was stopped by police in Scotland in 2004 with three others wearing plastic gloves. The men said they were on their way to an area where the authorities said an extremist training camp was being held. The camp's organizer, a man identified in court papers only as Hamid, was subsequently convicted of soliciting to murder and of providing terrorism training. TRAINING CAMP Four of the men involved in the failed London bombings had attended a similar camp organized by Hamid earlier that same year, the court papers said.The 2011 court papers pertained to a case between the British government and ""CE"" over the authorities' decision to relocate him outside London as a preventative measure.  The 2013 papers referred to an immigration appeal case between the British government and ""J1."" The legal documents came to public attention as a political row over the way Britain handles militants broke out with the opposition Labour Party accusing Prime Minister David Cameron's government of ""tying the hands"" of security services with insufficiently robust legislation. Separately, a dispute flared between Cameron's Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats -- their junior coalition partners -- over what guidance should be given to universities to prevent militant preachers spreading their message. The Liberal Democrats said they wanted to ensure that only people known to be inciting violence, rather than advocating Islamic caliphates, were prevented from debating.

Avi Strum, general manager of TowerJazz's CMOS image sensor business, said the technology has numerous potential uses, such as the ability for the likes of cooks or car mechanics to operate a computer with gestures rather than having to touch it with dirty hands.The camera can also capture images of an object and quickly create a model for use in 3D printing. ""Intel sensing solutions will bring consumers new experiences and will change the way people capture and share 3D images,"" Strum said. ""That Intel chose us for mass production of such sensors is very positive.""While gesture control is most common in laptops or gaming systems, it is expected to become more widely used in mobile devices such as smartphones.Shares in TowerJazz were up 4 percent at 69.19 shekels  ($17) in early afternoon trade in Tel Aviv.

264,"  * Industry starting to think Apple Watch may boost luxury sales* Apple may make watches cool again among the young - analyst* Swiss makers tinkering with smartwatches of their own* Apple threat is most acute for Swatch, analysts sayBy Martinne Geller and Eric AuchardLONDON/FRANKFURT, March 11 To observers of the secretive Swiss watch industry, its quiet, seemingly passive response to Apple Inc's plan to attack their centuries-old business could be mistaken for submission before an overwhelming adversary.But luxury and fashion groups Richemont, LVMH , Swatch Group and Guess Inc have been busy in the past year tinkering with smartwatches of their own, while aiming to preserve their products' more timeless appeal.When Apple Watch was first announced last September, some experts dismissed such devices as appealing to a different class of customer - those who prize technology over prestige.Now analysts and industry executives are starting to think that maybe the Apple Watch juggernaut will stoke sales of luxury timepieces among younger consumers used to telling the time with their phones, rather than on their wrists.""Apple has the potential to make the watch cool again,"" said CCS Insight mobile analyst Ben Wood, a confessed wearable gadget freak. ""I think the Swiss watch industry are going to be absolutely delighted.""Swatch - which has dabbled with smartwatch experiments for more than a decade and already makes components for fitness band wearable devices, has told Swiss newspapers it is gearing up to offer smartwatches of its own in the next few months. ""Apple is not the only company which is about to toss a smartwatch on the market,"" Nick Hayek, chief executive of Swatch, the world's largest watchmaking group, told SonntagsBlick in January. ""This is not a threat but a huge opportunity for us and the Swiss watch industry.""On Monday, Apple revealed that its line-up of watches will go on sale in April. The entry-level Apple Watch Sport will start at $349, the standard version at $549 and the high-end ""Edition"" watch at $10,000.The upcoming Swatch Smartwatch will include a chip that allows users to make contactless payments with a swipe of the wrist. It will use long-lasting batteries and work with both Apple and Google-based phones, according to news reports.While the Apple Watch has drawn rave reviews for many of its features, its limited battery life of no more than 18 hours before re-charging is considered a big drawback. LUXURY OF TIME The threat of the smartwatch may also be limited due to its short shelf life as a hi-tech, frequently upgraded product.An iPhone tends to lose half its value within the first year after it is introduced, while Rolex's flagship Submariner model has risen in value, analysts at Berenberg Bank noted in a recent report.Montblanc, owned by Richemont, announced in January the launch of the TimeWalker Urban Speed e-strap watch, which combines a traditional mechanical watch with an interchangeable strap containing a Bluetooth connected device.That offers ""the best of both worlds"", according to Berenberg's luxury goods analyst, Bassel Choughari. He said this is less risky than the strategy of LVMH's Tag Heuer, which has partnered with an as-yet-undisclosed U.S. tech company to produce a watch outside Switzerland. ""It creates a bit of a grey area between Swiss-made and probably made-in-China products, so that could be a bit difficult to manage over time,"" Choughari said of the danger to brands.Guess Inc has also announced plans to launch a smartwatch line called Guess Connect later this year.The new models, which come in sporty and jewel-encrusted versions, will link wirelessly to a user's nearby Apple or Google Android smartphone. Guess says these will be compatible with thousands of existing mobile phone apps and can be controlled from the watch using voice activated commands.Fossil Group, another U.S.-based fashion group, has toyed with smartwatches since 2003. A year ago, it said it would produce a smartwatch based on Google's Android Wear software, and in September, it said it had partnered with chipmaker Intel Corp.It too early to know whether the Apple Watch, whose price tags run as high as $17,000 for its yellow or rose gold models, will steal share from the Swiss industry, which sells about 30 million watches a year.The threat that Apple will cannibalise existing watch demand is most acute for Swatch, analysts say, because it has the highest proportion of products selling for a few hundred dollars, instead of several thousands as high-end names do.If Apple sells 20 million watches in the first year, as some analysts estimate, and all of those purchases divert buyers from other watch brands, Swatch could suffer a 6 percent hit to annual revenue, according to a calculation by Barclays analysts.Watch connoisseur Steve Baktidy says he is interested in the Apple Watch but only as a tech gadget to play with. But he also welcomed efforts by luxury makers to introduce more tech features of their own.""Absolutely I'll buy one (from Apple) but it's not going to replace my everyday watch,"" said Baktidy, owner of two auto body repair shops in New York and two dozen watches by luxury brands including Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, Breitling and Omega.

265,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks rose in a broad rally on Thursday, bouncing back from two days of losses, helped by weaker retail sales that paused the dollar's recent rally and tempered the outlook for interest rates.The day's gains lifted the Dow and S&P 500 back into positive territory for the year so far. Banking shares rallied following the Federal Reserve's annual check-up on the industry's health. The S&P financial sector .SPSY rose 2.2 percent and was the day's biggest gainer. A weak outlook from Intel, however, limited gains in the tech sector.Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February, which helped the euro rebound from a 12-year low versus the dollar. Recent weakness in stocks has largely been driven by Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs data, which underscored views the Fed could raise rates as early as June. ""To me, it shows maybe that moving the rate increase closer has potential fallout with regard to the ever-stronger U.S. dollar, and that's a headwind for growth and a headwind for earnings for a lot of companies that do business outside the U.S.,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 259.83 points, or 1.47 percent, to 17,895.22, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 25.71 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,065.95. The day's percentage gains were the biggest for both the Dow and S&P 500 in about a month.The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 43.35 points, or 0.89 percent, to 4,893.29.The rally represented just a partial rebound after a recent bout of weakness, which has left the S&P 500 down 2.4 percent from its March 2 record closing high. Citigroup (C.N) passed in the Fed review, allowing it to raise dividends and sending shares up 3.3 percent to $54.08. Bank of America (BAC.N) was told to get a better grip on internal controls and its data models; shares slipped 0.1 percent to $16.09.Intel Corp (INTC.O) slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain. Shares of the Dow component fell 4.7 percent to $30.80 and limited the Nasdaq's advance. Shares of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) rose 4.2 percent to $107.17 and were the biggest percentage gainer in the Dow after it said it has started work on a sequel to ""Frozen,"" the best-selling animated movie of all time.

According to BlueFin Research Partners, 75 million-76 million PCs will be shipped worldwide in the first quarter, a decline of 8-9 percent from the preceding quarter.Intel, whose historic ""Wintel"" alliance with Microsoft once delivered breathtakingly high profit margins, has been trying to offset the impact of slower PC upgrades by making chips for devices such as ""2-in-1s"", which function as both laptop and tablet.Intel said the mid-point of its gross margin range would remain at 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points.Intel's shares were down 4.8 percent at $30.76 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Microsoft's shares were down 2.4 percent at $41.Shares of ASML Holding NV, the world's largest maker of semiconductor production equipment, were down 2 percent at $104.40.

270,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 12 (Fitch) Intel's negative pre-announcement this morning  suggests the end of support for Windows XP was a more significant factor than  previously estimated in last year's perceived stabilizing personal computer (PC)  demand, according to Fitch Ratings. Consequently, extended PC refresh cycles may  result in a resumption of negative PC sales growth. Intel Thursday changed its first-quarter revenue outlook as a function of weaker  than expected PC demand. Intel now expects $12.8 billion in first-quarter  revenue versus its prior $13.7 billion projection. We believe expectations for sustained negative PC sales growth could pressure  ratings or outlooks for technology companies for which stabilizing PC demand is  a key base case assumption, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (B-/Stable),  Dell Corp. (BB/Positive) and Hewlett-Packard Company (A-/Negative Watch).  While Intel and Microsoft are negatively affected, Fitch believes both companies  have significant financial flexibility at their respective current ratings to  weather weaker PC demand as each continues to shift focus toward growth markets.  Fitch now expects negative low-single-digit PC unit growth for 2015, driven by  the resumption of an extended PC refresh cycle and consumer substitution of  smartphones and tablets for PCs more than offsetting solid demand around the  data center. These secular trends were clouded in 2014 by the end of support for  Windows XP, resulting in only slightly lower PC unit growth for the year.

""Tag Heuer's decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said.""With Apple Watch hitting the market it's no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow.""Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music. The unit of French luxury group Kering gave no details of pricing or launch timing. Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however.Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch.""The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic,"" he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday.Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult.

278,"  * Sees share rising from less than 1 pct* Increase in data traffic to push up demand* Chips would be priced less than leader Intel's   (Adds details, quotes)By Michael Gold TAIPEI, March 19 British chip design firm ARM Holdings PLC said on Thursday its market share in servers may touch around 20 percent by 2020, up from less than 1 percent now, citing massive potential in the market for big data.""This is a nascent market primed for growth,"" Ian Thornton, vice president of investor relations, told reporters and analysts during a briefing in Taipei. The company's chip designs are used in 90 percent of all smartphones worldwide, including those from Apple Inc. It earns royalties from every chip sold.The first servers sporting ARM-designed server chips were shipped in the fourth quarter from Hewlett-Packard Co. As firms like Google Inc and China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd collect and transmit more data, the need for servers to store that data will skyrocket. Thornton said Intel Corp currently holds a more-than 90 percent share in server chips and that ARM would market its chip designs more cheaply than its main rival in this segment.""The average selling price of an Intel server chip is about $600"" versus $100 to $200 dollars for the equivalent ARM chip, Thornton said. Because there is no serious competitor at the moment, ""Intel can charge what they like.""Thornton also said he sees ARM's overall royalties growing by 22 percent this year.

280,"  Intel Corp (INTC.O) is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp ALTR.O in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, making it Intel's biggest purchase ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector.The acquisition of Altera, which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers, the military and other industrial applications, would underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich's determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam. Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, the world's biggest chipmaker has been slower than its rivals to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones.Earlier this month, Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast to $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, as small businesses put off upgrading their personal computers.Shares of Altera shot up about 28 percent after the talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, closing at $44.39 per share on the Nasdaq. Intel shares also gained on the news, rising 6.4 percent to $32. Shares of Xilinx, Altera's main rival, closed up 6 percent.""On the surface, Altera is one of the only semiconductor companies with better gross margins than Intel, and with about two-thirds of its revenue from telecom, wireless, military/aerospace, it definitely fits the bill of diversifying revenue beyond Intel's legacy computer markets,"" said Cowen & Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, in a note to clients.      Intel declined to comment on the report. An Altera spokesman also declined to comment.   Any deal for Altera, valued at $10.4 billion at Thursday's close and more than $13 billion after trading ended on Friday, would easily surpass Intel's previous biggest deal, its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011.Altera's value to Intel is its programmable chips, which are increasingly being used in data centers, where they are customized for specialized functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks.  Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has already been manufacturing chips on behalf of the smaller company since 2013, a major change for Intel, which traditionally has been unwilling to share its cutting-edge technology. Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry. Features such as WiFi or Bluetooth that once required chips sold by separate companies can now be squeezed onto single pieces of silicon.

294,"   By Ahmed Aboulenein, Michael Holden and Simon Falush | LONDON  LONDON (This story corrects name in paragraph 18 to Network for Social Change, from Network for Social Change Charitable Trust to March 4 story)The financial backers of a campaign group that had contact with the man later known as 'Jihadi John' are under pressure from British politicians and a regulator's investigation to explain why they gave it several hundred thousand pounds.The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, a Quaker foundation, and The Roddick Foundation, set up by the late founder of beauty retailer Body Shop, are among those now being asked how they came to fund Cage, a small activist group that called Mohammed Emwazi, killer of American, British and Syrian hostages, a once ""beautiful young man"".""I condemn anybody who attempts to excuse that barbarism away in the way that has been done by Cage,"" British interior minister Theresa May told parliament in response to the comment by Cage's research boss Asim Qureshi to media last week.Cage was set up by a group of London Muslims with the aim of supporting British suspects being held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. Its activists blame U.S. and British foreign policy for radicalizing Muslims and accuse the security services of harassing those who refuse to be informants.Britain's Charity Commission, a government-backed regulator, has launched an investigation into whether Cage's funders had ensured that their money was only used for purposes in line with their objectives. The Commission said in a statement on Monday that it had compliance cases open into the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Foundation and the Roddick Foundation.""In both cases the commission’s regulatory concerns revolve around how the trustees have ensured that charitable grants made to non-charitable bodies are only used for exclusively charitable purposes in line with their objects,"" it said.The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust said in a statement that it had made three grants to Cage in 2007, 2008 and 2011, making a combined total of 305,000 pounds. It said its last grant payment to them was in January 2014.The Roddick Foundation, set up to ""support those who change the world"", gave Cage 35,000 pounds a year in the financial years ending in March 2012 and 2013, and 25,000 pounds a year in the financial years ending in March 2010 and 2011, according to accounts made public by the Charity Commission.The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust said it stood by its funding.""We believe (Cage) has played an important role in highlighting the ongoing abuses at Guantanamo Bay and at many other sites around the world, including many instances of torture,"" it said in a statement.The Roddick Foundation could not be reached for comment as its listed phone number was disconnected and emails to its public email address bounced back. Attempts to reach trustee Gordon Roddick via other organizations to which he is connected yielded no response.SUPPORT The relationship between Emwazi and Cage began in 2009, when he visited its drab office block in a back street behind the East London Mosque.Cage held a news conference last week to publish emails sent to it from Emwazi over several years during which time he complained of being regularly harassed by security services. On its Website, the group says: ""Cage has been campaigning against the War on Terror for more than a decade"".Public information about Cage's finances is scant: It is listed in the UK companies register, but has filed accounts only for 2008 and as a small company it is not obliged to report each year. According to Qureshi and its website, Cage is a non-profit making company limited by guarantee, a structure without share capital that is usually used to protect the people running the company from personal liability for its debts.The group's other main funder, according to Qureshi, is the Network for Social Change, which describes itself as ""a group of individuals providing funding for progressive social change"". The Network for Social Change said its vehicle for donating to non charitable projects, Funding for Social Change Limited, had not funded Cage since 2008.""Funding for Social Change Limited is not and never has been a main funder of Cage,"" a spokesperson for the organization said in an email. ""It provided Cage with a non-charitable grant of 15,000 pounds in 2008 and has not funded it since.""  A British lawmaker told Reuters all of the charities that had funded Cage should dissociate from it after the group's comments at last week's news conference.""It was both extraordinary and disgraceful, they were very clearly coming out as apologists for terrorism... Those that have provided them with support must very seriously question not only their support for Cage but how they got to make such a decision to support an organization like this,"" said John Spellar, a spokesman on foreign affairs for the opposition Labour Party. ""I think there needs to be some very serious rethinking done by a number of these charities and NGOs about how they got into a position.""Cage's Qureshi said the group would continue its work regardless of the criticism leveled at it.""Certain media organizations, right-wing think tanks, don't like our narrative as it goes against the prevailing national security paradigm,"" he told Reuters.""Even though we aren't a proselytizing organization, we are a Muslim response to a problem that largely affects Muslims.""INVESTIGATIONS British Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman told reporters: ""The prime minister thinks that it's absolutely right that the Charity Commission is undertaking the work that it is with regard to the funding of the organization.""If the cases are escalated to inquiry level, and it is found that wrongdoing has occurred, the trustees of each charity can be suspended, an interim manager could be appointed to run the organization or bank accounts could be frozen, said Sarah Hitchings, press officer at the Charity Commission. She added that the investigation so far had found nothing to suggest that this would happen.Cage's Qureshi said funding from such organizations paled in comparison with the money from individuals, though he said he did not have the figures available to share with Reuters.""Every year in Ramadan we have a big fundraiser and people come, they pledge their support for the organization and we collect the money from that, it helps keep us going,"" he said.""The vast majority (of our money) comes from Muslim communities in the UK,"" Qureshi told Reuters. ""They love our work. The community trusts us and believes in what we do.""The group's website invites donors to pledge money online, or arrange for someone to pick up a cash donation.Rafik Aziz, who describes himself as the group's book keeper, said this arrangement was reached after British banks Barclays and the Cooperative closed the group's accounts last March in a move he said was triggered by the arrest of Moazzam Begg, Cage's Outreach Director, who both Britain and the United States have accused of terrorism offences.Begg is the group's most high-profile figure, who spent nearly three years in the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba after being seized in Pakistan in 2002. In 2014, Begg was charged by British police with terrorism offences including providing training and funding terrorism in Syria. He denied the charges. After being held for seven months in custody and with his trial about to start, the charges against him were dropped.Police said at the time the decision to drop the charges came because new material had come to light which meant police and prosecution lawyers had concluded there was no realistic chance of securing a conviction.Aziz said that since the bank account closures, the group had no success with other banks they approached, though he did not name the banks.In addition to the Charity Commission investigation, Cage said last May that two of its board members were being investigated for fraud and tax evasion, although it did not name them and Reuters was unable to identify them.A spokesman for HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) said that it was unable to confirm or deny any probe was happening due to rules about tax payer confidentiality.

322,"  April 27 TIG Advisors LLC, an investment firm that holds shares in Altera Corp, challenged the company's board director nomination on Monday over its refusal to engage with Intel Corp about a potential merger.TIG Advisors is the first shareholder to go on the record in a bid to put pressure Altera. It urged Altera's shareholders in a letter on Monday to vote against the company's lead independent director Michael Nevens at its annual meeting of stockholders scheduled on May 11. ""Stockholders should have right to choose between Intel's reported $54 cash offer and uncertain future of standalone Altera,"" TIG Advisors said in the letter.  Altera appeals to Intel for its line of programmable chips, increasingly used in data centers and customized for functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks, but talks have been off during the past few weeks.

323,"   By Nadia Damouni  Intel Corp (INTC.O) signed a standstill agreement earlier this year with Altera Corp ALTR.O that expires on June 1, giving the world's largest chipmaker the option to launch a hostile bid after that, according to sources familiar with the matter.The agreement, disclosed to Reuters by the sources this week, explains why Intel has refrained from launching a tender offer for Altera's shares once their negotiations broke down. It also underscores the risk Altera faces of such a hostile bid.Earlier this month, Altera rejected an unsolicited $54 per share offer from Intel following months of negotiations, the sources said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. They said Altera agreed to engage in these talks on the basis that Intel would not go public with any offer until June.  In February, Intel discussed offering $58 per share for Altera, based on publicly available information it reviewed at the time, according to the people. After signing a non-disclosure agreement and combing through non-public information, including the company's outlook, it ended up revising down its offer, they said. Last week, Altera posted a sequential 9 percent decline in revenue for the first quarter and said it also expects weakness in its second-quarter guidance, particularly around its wireless business.It is unclear whether Intel would take its proposal directly to shareholders, the sources said, but it remains an option available to it.  Intel and Altera both declined to comment.The acquisition of Altera, which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers and industrial applications and by the military, would underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich's determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam. TIG Advisors LLC, an investment firm that holds shares in Altera, challenged a nomination to the company's board of directors on Monday over Altera's refusal to engage with Intel about a potential merger.

324,"  * Car companies use Nvidia's ""supercomputer on a chip""* Automotive culture invades Silicon Valley* Chipmaker's rivals include Intel, Texas Instruments* Learning the meaning of ""automotive grade""By Paul LienertDETROIT, May 14 It took Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia Corp the better part of a decade to gain acceptance as a global automotive supplier, a lesson for other technology firms hoping to make a similar transition from consumer electronics to car components.Nvidia had a thriving business in supplying powerful graphics processors for video game consoles and laptop computers when representatives of Volkswagen AG asked if it could adapt the same realistic, three-dimensional displays for the dashboards of Audi luxury cars.That was 10 years ago - several lifetimes in Silicon Valley terms, but just a couple of model changes ago for the big car maker. It took six years for Nvidia to develop the chips to power the 3-D navigation system display that launched on the 2011 Audi A8, the brand's top-of-the-line sedan, compared with three to four years to develop a new chip for gaming applications.Along the way, Nvidia engineers learned the hard way they could not just pop a chip designed for a laptop or a game console into a car.""We had to be taught what 'automotive grade' meant,"" recalls Danny Shapiro, Nvidia's senior director of automotive operations. In simple terms, that meant no reboots - because a dashboard screen that fails to light up means an angry customer and possibly an expensive warranty repair. The decade-long effort enabled Nvidia to make the jump from the world of computers and game consoles into the fast-growing market for advanced automotive displays and automated driving systems. It is a leap that other Silicon Valley tech companies want to emulate to cash in on the convergence of automobiles and digital connectivity.Nvidia's success in landing processors on cars including the Audi A8 and the Tesla Model S sedan illustrates the growing willingness among automakers to look beyond their traditional suppliers to obtain a technological edge.""They offer us computing systems with the strength"" to process vast amounts of data required by new driver assistance systems and displays, said Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi's head of technical development.Nvidia is still a niche player with a long way to go to crack the top league of traditional automotive chip suppliers. Much larger companies, including Japan's Renesas Electronics Corp and U.S. chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc, Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, dominate the automotive chip business.Nvidia's automotive sales represented just 4 percent of the company's $4.7 billion annual revenue in its most recent fiscal year. That in turn is just one-tenth of the $1.86 billion in automotive semiconductors that Texas Instruments sold last year. Brooke Williams, TI's business manager for driver assistance systems, said his company already knows how to deal with automakers' demands after 35 years of supplying products for vehicles. ""We understand the automotive design cycle and how the vehicle manufacturers and suppliers work.""SELF-DRIVING CARS Nvidia has made the leap to infotainment systems in vehicles, but not yet to self-driving cars.The company had just $23 million in sales in the automotive segment in 2011. Growth has surged since. This year, the company expects automotive revenue of $183 million, and says it has booked more than $2 billion in future automotive business, most of that involving chips for digital displays and infotainment. By 2020, Nvidia expects to have chips on more than 32 million vehicles. The company is pushing to crack the emerging market for driver assistance systems, which include such tasks as self-parking and semi-automated steering and braking. Those systems require huge amounts of computing power in very small packages. Nvidia has developed and begun selling a chip called the Tegra X1 for automotive and gaming uses, which it says can put the power of a supercomputer in a package about the size of a postage stamp.""Nvidia brings unparalleled graphics capabilities that could prove critical building blocks"" for driver assistance systems, said Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore.Nvidia got coaching from automotive customers who liked the company's technology but were not sure of its ability to measure up to their standards.Early in their relationship, Audi executives took Nvidia engineers on a trip to Audi's home factory in Ingolstadt, Germany.""We told the Nvidia guys, 'you make one part, but we assemble a car here from 10,000 pieces,'"" said Mathias Halliger, Audi's senior systems architect for connected vehicle technologies. ""If even one part is bad, we have a problem.""To drive home the point, an Audi tour guide noted that one of the luxury cars had been rejected because of a tiny flaw in the paint.The plant tour, Halliger said, ""helped Nvidia to understand our requirements. It showed dramatically what we were looking for.""There was more for Nvidia to learn. A typical automotive production cycle can run five years or more, compared with one year for many consumer products. Nvidia had to go back to its suppliers to make sure that key components, from memory to power supply, could be upgraded as needed over that longer life cycle.""When you work with car companies and you engage in these developments with them, over the years you adopt their culture,"" said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang, whose personal automotive stable includes two Ferraris and two Teslas.  ""But the car is dying to be reinvented.""

BakerMay 29 Intel Corp has resumed talks to buy programmable-chip maker Altera Corp and is close to a $16 billion deal, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, paving way for the third mega semiconductor-chip deal this year.The price for Altera could be as much as $54 per share, according to one of the people. This would be a 15 percent premium over the stock's Thursday close of $46.97.If the deal were to go through, it would be Intel's largest, topping its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. It would also underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich's determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry - the company's mainstay - loses steam.The deal will allow Intel to bundle its own server chips with Altera's line of programmable chips, which are increasingly being used in data centers and are customized for functions such as providing quicker web-searches.""It's a good deal essentially because it sews up Intel's data center supremacy even more,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan said.Intel, since 2013, had been manufacturing chips for Altera, which does not have a foundry. The partnership was unusual for Intel, which has traditionally been unwilling to share its cutting-edge technology.

That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production. The economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011.""The data is telling us that the economy is improving but it is not super strong,"" said Kim Forrest, a senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The pace of the recovery will add to investor's concerns about the timing of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.""Today's market action says the rate increase is going to happen in September,"" Forrest added. Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, however, ruled out the threat of an imminent interest rate increase, which should be supportive of stocks.""There is no need for the Fed to raise rates now. The economy simply is not strong enough and that's what today's data tells us,"" Sarhan said.The GDP report also showed that corporate profits declined 8.7 percent in the first quarter, the largest drop in a year.Conflicting reports on Greece's ability to strike a deal with its euro zone partners also weighed on global markets. At 13:44 p.m. ET (1744 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 64.96 points, or 0.36 percent, at 18,061.16, the S&P 500 was down 5.09 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,115.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 5.80 points, or 0.11 percent, at 5,092.17.Eight of the 10 S&P 500 sectors were down.

338,"  (Corrects name in final paragraph to Foerster from Forester)* To pay Broadcom shareholders $17 bln in cash, $20 bln in shares* Combined company to have annual revenue of $15 bln* Broadcom, Avago shares slip after big rise on WednesdayBy Liana B. Baker and Supantha MukherjeeMay 28 Avago Technologies Ltd agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, turning a lesser known company run by a ferocious dealmaker into one of the biggest industry players.Avago, which serves the wireless and industrial markets, is offering Broadcom shareholders $17 billion in cash and Avago shares valued at $20 billion.Broadcom is best known for its connectivity chips, which are used widely in smartphones made by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.The deal is the biggest so far by Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan, who has developed a small chipmaker into a $36 billion company through acquisitions since taking the helm nine years ago.Tan, a serial deal-maker, has trimmed Avago's portfolio by divesting units while bulking up in faster-growing areas.The combined company, to be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom, will be the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp and  Qualcomm Inc. The merger is the industry's second megadeal this year and is unlikely to be the last, analysts said.The $37 billion price represents a premium of about 28 percent over Broadcom's market value of $28.85 billion as of Tuesday's close, before the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks. MORE DEALS? Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry.The Avago-Broadcom deal follows NXP Semiconductors'  $11.8 billion offer to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  in March. Avago had also bid for Freescale, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Intel has also been in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal that could top $10 billion.Until Thursday, Avago's biggest deal was for chipmaker LSI Corp, which it bought for $6.6 billion last year. Tan's strategy has been to look at potential targets that do not necessarily have the best strategic fit but have cost-cutting potential to build value.Avago and Broadcom first spoke about a potential merger in October 2014 but could not agree on a price, said people familiar with the matter who are unauthorized to speak publicly about it.Talks heated up in April when Avago approached Broadcom again with higher offers, and negotiations continued until the two agreed on a deal.Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, which is an Avago investor and holds a board seat, worked closely with the company to help evaluate Broadcom and structure the deal, said two sources who are unauthorized to speak publicly about the deal.BARGAINING CHIP  The merger will help the companies improve their bargaining position with manufacturers.Irvine, California-based Broadcom has been struggling to grow as competition in the mobile chip business intensifies. The company's revenue increased by just 1.5 percent last year.Broadcom's shares closed down 1.5 percent at $56.25 on Thursday, while Avago's fell 0.62 percent to $142.38.The companies said they expected to close the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and save $750 million within 18 months. The deal has a breakup fee of $1 billion, one of the unidentified sources said.The new Broadcom would have annual revenue of $15 billion and an enterprise value of $77 billion, the companies said in a statement.Broadcom shareholders will own about 32 percent of the combined company. They would also have the option to choose between various combinations of cash and stock.Avago, which is incorporated in Singapore and also has headquarters in San Jose, California, said it intended to fund the cash portion of the deal by using funds from the combined company and new debt of $9 billion.Avago was advised by Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.Broadcom was advised by JPMorgan Chase, while Evercore served as financial adviser to the Special Committee of the board.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Broadcom.

343,"   By Lehar Maan and Liana B. Baker  Intel Corp (INTC.O) agreed to buy Altera Corp ALTR.O for $16.7 billion as the world's biggest chipmaker seeks to make up for slowing demand from the PC industry by expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers.By combining with Altera, Intel will be able to bundle its processing chips with the smaller company's programmable chips, which are used, among other things, to speed up Web-searches.Intel said on Monday it would offer $54 per share for San Jose, California-based Altera, a 10.5 percent premium to Altera's close on Friday.Altera's shares were changing hands at $51.78, well below the offer price, in afternoon trading.That suggested that some investors felt the deal could face regulatory hurdles, but analysts said there was virtually no overlap of products between the companies.Intel's shares were down about 1.7 percent at $33.86.The deal valued Altera at about 9 times forward revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data.""It seems very high to me,"" Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters. ""The last one I remember that was close was Broadcom buying NetLogic at 8 times forward revenues, and that didn't turn out very well for Broadcom.""The deal price is unchanged from Intel's unsolicited offer that sources had said Altera rejected in April. The integration of Altera's chips with Intel's will create a new class of products giving customers a significant improvement in performance, lower costs and a lot more flexibility, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. ""That’s the piece that's pretty exciting about it,"" he said.Intel looked at other targets, but Altera was the best bet to create value for the shareholders, Smith said.The transaction is the third big one in the highly fragmented chip industry this year. In the industry's biggest-ever deal, Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) agreed last week to buy Broadcom Corp (BRCM.O) for $37 billion.Altera's programmable chips will allow Intel to increase the computational capability of its Xeon server chips, which could be under attack post the Avago-Broadcom merger, Summit Research analyst Srinivasan Sundararajan told Reuters.NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) set off the latest round of  deals in March when it agreed to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N for $12 billion. BEYOND PCS The deal is Intel's biggest ever, outstripping its $7.7 billion acquisition of security software maker McAfee in 2011.It also underscores Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich's determination to expand beyond chips for PCs, the company's mainstay. Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast in March, saying that small businesses were delaying upgrading their computers. Personal computer shipments fell 5.2 percent in the first three months of this year, extending three years of decline, according to research firm Gartner.Net revenue from Intel's PC group increased just 4 percent in 2014, generating about 62 percent of total revenue, while revenue in its data center group increased 18 percent, providing just over a quarter of overall revenue.The deal will also help Intel become more involved in the so-called Internet of Things - the concept of connecting ordinary household devices to the Internet.The New York Post reported on Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks.Up to Friday's close, Altera's shares had risen 41.3 percent since the Wall Street Journal reported on March 27 that the two companies were in talks. Intel's shares rose 14.6 percent.J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Rothschild Inc are financial advisers to Intel. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP are legal advisers.Goldman Sachs & Co is Altera's financial adviser, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati Professional Corp is legal adviser.

Other data showed construction spending surged in April but consumer spending was unexpectedly flat.Investors are weighing data to try to guess how soon the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said with little evidence of a rebound, the Fed is in no position to start raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. ""The things that seem to be driving the market today are a bounce-back from the selling and some pretty good economic data. But as the day has progessed, some of the enthusiasm has worn off since the debate continues as to when the Fed is going to raise rates,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.""The risk is that the Fed raises interest rates into a slowing economy.""Eight of the 10 major S&P indexes were higher, with health, industrials and technology among sectors with the most gains.

345,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Intel  Corporation (Intel), including the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+'  and short-term IDR of 'F1', following Intel's announcement it will acquire  Altera Corporation (Altera) for $16.7 billion in cash. Fitch's actions affect $13.2 billion of debt, excluding incremental debt  issuance to fund the vast majority of the Altera acquisition. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's belief that Intel's operating profile  will remain strong and credit protection measures solid for the rating, despite  expectations for significant incremental debt issuance to fund the acquisition.  Longer-term, Altera may strengthen Intel's offerings in data center and internet  of things (IoT) Altera is a leading provider of field programmable logic devices (PLD) with 39%  share in the $5 billion PLD market. By combining Intel's processors and Altera's  PLDs on a lower-cost and better-performing single die, Intel hopes to accelerate  growth in the data center and take share from application-specific solutions  providers in rapidly growing IoT markets.  Altera adds nearly $2 billion of revenues with gross profit margins in the  mid-60s, slightly higher than that of Intel with meaningfully lower capital  intensity as a fabless semiconductor marker. In addition, Intel and Altera's  existing foundry relationship and design collaboration with Altera may reduce  integration risk.  Intel plans to fund the acquisition with cash and incremental debt, although  Fitch estimates new debt will comprise the vast majority of the purchase price,  since all but $3.4 billion of Intel's $14.1 billion of total cash at March 31,  2015 was located offshore. As a result, Fitch expects total leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) of approximately 1x versus 0.5x for the latest 12  months (LTM) ended March 31, 2015.  With Fitch's expectations for more than $5 billion of annual free cash flow  (FCF), domestic FCF over the next two to three quarters prior to the  acquisition's close could reduce the amount of new debt to fund the purchase  price. Fitch also expects the company will moderate share repurchases to  maintain conservative total leverage. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are supported by:  --Intel's microprocessor dominance and significant technology leadership,  particularly in manufacturing. Intel's x86 processor architecture is also the  premiere platform for data center/servers, providing the company a significant  advantage in the enterprise and cloud-computing space.  --Broad geographic and business diversification. Although the majority of the  company's revenue is derived from PC and server demand, these markets are driven  by different secular growth trends which Fitch expects to contribute to  longer-term stability.  --Continued long-term secular growth in digitalization and computer adoption  worldwide as well as greater penetration of microprocessors in areas outside of  traditional computing.  Rating concerns include:  --Intel's exposure to the cyclical demand for semiconductors which is typically  exacerbated at the beginning of cyclical downturns due to channel inventory  contraction.  --Significant and fixed investment intensity, including research and development  (R&D) and capital spending. Intel's leading profit margins largely compensate  for this risk although capital spending has at times approached 50% of operating  EBITDA.  --Intel has significant customer concentration with its largest customers  typically accounting for 40% of total revenues. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Flattish organic revenue growth in fiscal 2015, driven by weaker than expected  personal computer (PC) demand that will be offset by continued strength in data  center server chips.  --Beyond the near term, organic revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits,  driven by solid data center-related demand and, to a lesser extent, Intel's  strategy to combine both processers and PLDs on a single die. --Consistent profitability through the forecast period, due to a more stable  pricing environment and Intel's manufacturing cost leadership.  --Annual capital spending of $9 billion to $10 billion and more than $11 billion  of annual R&D investments through the intermediate-term to support the  continuation of Moore's Law. --Management moderates share repurchases to the amount of cash used to fund the  acquisition. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions could result from:  --Fitch's expectation total leverage will remain above 1.25x, driven by more  aggressive share repurchases and/or greater acquisition activity to build  Intel's mobility segment;  --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF-to-adjusted debt approaching 20%, as a  result of continued tablet cannibalization of PC sales, and lack of penetration  into the mobile market.  Positive rating action is unlikely, given the cyclicality and volatility  inherent in the semiconductor business, as well as the need for flexibility in  managing technological changes and challenges. A positive rating action would  likely require:  --Profitability improvement across the Mobile and Communications Group in line  with competitors, signifying improved competitiveness and increased market share  within the space.  --An explicit commitment to a leverage ratio of 1x or below. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Liquidity as of March 28, 2015 was solid and consisted of: -- $14.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of  which $3.4 billion was located in the U.S.;  --$3 billion commercial paper program (CP) with no outstanding balance.  Fitch's expectation for more than $5 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity. The company does not have a revolving credit facility to support its  CP program but Fitch views Intel's strong liquidity as providing ample support  for the program.  Total debt as of March 28, 2015 was $13.3 billion and primarily consisted of:  -- $1.5 billion in 1.95% senior unsecured notes due October 2016;  -- $3 billion in 1.35% senior unsecured notes due December 2017; -- $2 billion in 3.3% senior unsecured notes due October 2021;  -- $1.5 billion in 2.7% senior unsecured notes due December 2022;  -- $750 million in 4.0% senior unsecured notes due December 2032;  -- $1.6 billion principal value in 2.95% junior subordinated debentures due July  2035;  -- $2 billion principal value in 3.25% junior subordinated debentures due July  2039;  -- $1.5 billion in 4.8% senior unsecured notes due October 2041; -- $924 million in 4.25% senior unsecured notes due December 2042.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for Intel:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';  --Short-term IDR at 'F1';  --$3 billion CP program at 'F1';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+';  --Junior subordinated notes at 'A'.

349,"  * Offer of $54 per share is 10.5 pct premium to Friday close* Altera shares trading well below offer* Deal is third big one in chip industry this year   (Adds link to Breakingviews column; updates shares)By Lehar Maan and Liana B. BakerJune 1 Intel Corp agreed to buy Altera Corp for $16.7 billion as the world's biggest chipmaker seeks to make up for slowing demand from the PC industry by expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers.By combining with Altera, Intel will be able to bundle its processing chips with the smaller company's programmable chips, which are used, among other things, to speed up Web-searches.Intel said on Monday it would offer $54 per share for San Jose, California-based Altera, a 10.5 percent premium to Altera's close on Friday.Altera's shares were changing hands at $51.78, well below the offer price, in afternoon trading.That suggested that some investors felt the deal could face regulatory hurdles, but analysts said there was virtually no overlap of products between the companies.Intel's shares were down about 1.7 percent at $33.86.The deal valued Altera at about 9 times forward revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""It seems very high to me,"" Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters. ""The last one I remember that was close was Broadcom buying NetLogic at 8 times forward revenues, and that didn't turn out very well for Broadcom.""The deal price is unchanged from Intel's unsolicited offer that sources had said Altera rejected in April.The integration of Altera's chips with Intel's will create a new class of products giving customers a significant improvement in performance, lower costs and a lot more flexibility, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. ""That's the piece that's pretty exciting about it,"" he said.Intel looked at other targets, but Altera was the best bet to create value for the shareholders, Smith said.The transaction is the third big one in the highly fragmented chip industry this year. In the industry's biggest-ever deal, Avago Technologies Ltd agreed last week to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion. Altera's programmable chips will allow Intel to increase the computational capability of its Xeon server chips, which could be under attack post the Avago-Broadcom merger, Summit Research analyst Srinivasan Sundararajan told Reuters.NXP Semiconductors NV set off the latest round of  deals in March when it agreed to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  for $12 billion.BEYOND PCS The deal is Intel's biggest ever, outstripping its $7.7 billion acquisition of security software maker McAfee in 2011. It also underscores Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich's determination to expand beyond chips for PCs, the company's mainstay. Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast in March, saying that small businesses were delaying upgrading their computers.Personal computer shipments fell 5.2 percent in the first three months of this year, extending three years of decline, according to research firm Gartner.Net revenue from Intel's PC group increased just 4 percent in 2014, generating about 62 percent of total revenue, while revenue in its data center group increased 18 percent, providing just over a quarter of overall revenue.The deal will also help Intel become more involved in the so-called Internet of Things - the concept of connecting ordinary household devices to the Internet.The New York Post reported on Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks.Up to Friday's close, Altera's shares had risen 41.3 percent since the Wall Street Journal reported on March 27 that the two companies were in talks. Intel's shares rose 14.6 percent.J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Rothschild Inc are financial advisers to Intel.

After the Intel-Altera deal, Lattice and Xilinx Inc are the only reasonably large standalone companies left in the programmable chip industry.Lattice caters to the low-end of the market, while Xilinx focuses on higher-end products.Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, agreed to buy Altera last week for $16.7 billion, or $54 per share. That represented a premium of just 10.5 percent to Altera's previous-day close, but was 56 percent more than the stock's price before the Wall Street Journal reported in March that the two companies were in merger talks.""If someone walks in the door and gives us a solid offer at a high premium we are going to consider it,"" Billerbeck said.FBR Capital analyst Christopher Rolland said Lattice was a ""high probability acquisition target"". ""They are sub-scale and would earn far more under a larger company umbrella,"" Rolland said.Billerbeck said he did not think Lattice was an immediate takeover target, given the chip industry's current focus on large acquisitions. ""However, that can change rapidly,"" he said.Lattice, whose shares have fallen about 8 percent this year, reported revenue of about $366 million in 2014, an increase of about 10 percent.

361,"   By Laura Benitez  LONDON, June 12 (IFR) - US technology company Intel Corporation was planning to issue a multi-currency bond for up to USD10bn this week, before torrid European market conditions soured the prospects for a sale.""It looks as if the deal is postponed for now,"" an investor who attended the roadshow said. ""The company doesn't need to rush it to the market and is not willing to pay up given the market volatility. It will likely be back later this summer after it announces earnings and the market settles.""The company was targeting eight- and 15-year euro tranches, a 20-year sterling piece and various US dollar maturities, according to the investor. He expected the euro and sterling portions to total USD4bn with the remainder in US dollars. Intel hired Barclays and JP Morgan to hold a European roadshow from Wednesday June 3 to Friday June 5 ahead of a potential benchmark euro- and/or sterling-denominated deal.The European corporate market has crumbled under the pressure of continued rates volatility over recent weeks, forcing potential issuers either to swallow the chunky premiums required or delay and run the risk of hitting the summer lull. A mere EUR500m was raised this week, making it the slowest week for European corporate bond issuance since July last year.A source close to the deal said Intel is now waiting until after its earnings announcement on July 15 to sell the deal. Intel revealed at the beginning of the month that it would purchase programmable chip-maker Altera Corp for USD17bn.""They wanted to do about half of their planned total debt funding for the Altera acquisition, and the additional USD7.5bn to USD8.5bn funding needed will come from cash on Intel's balance sheet,"" the investor said.Intel is rated A1/A+/A+ (all stable).

362,"   By Liana B. Baker  Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is at the initial stage of reviewing whether to split itself in two or spin off a business, seeking to reverse its fortunes and take on rival Intel Corp, according to three people familiar with the matter.The deliberations are preliminary and no decision has been made, the people said. The review highlights Chief Executive Lisa Su's determination to consider every possible option to turn the company around.AMD has asked a consulting firm to help it review its options and draw up scenarios on how a break-up or spin-off would work, the people said this week, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.One option under consideration is separating AMD's graphics and licensing business from its server business, which sells processors that power data centers, one of the people said. AMD had explored such a move in the past and decided against it, the people said. Su, however, who took over as CEO last October, judged that there is merit for the company to at least consider such a possibility again, the people added. There is no certainty that a split or spin-off will occur, the people cautioned. A spokeswoman for AMD declined to comment. AMD, which has a market capitalization of around $2 billion, has competed with much larger Intel since the 1980s, and at times has made inroads with its PC and server chips. AMD has an extensive cross-licensing agreement with Intel, an issue AMD would have to study carefully in the case of a break-up.In the last few years, AMD has been caught somewhat flat-footed by new competitors designing low-cost and power-efficient chips. AMD shares have fallen 40 percent over the last 12 months. The Sunnyvale, California-based company, which said in October it would cut 7 percent of its workforce, is now shifting its focus to gaming consoles and low-power servers to combat falling laptop sales.While large rivals such as Intel have deeper pockets to fund research on new products, AMD faces declining cash flows and has a more modest balance sheet. AMD's net loss widened to $180 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter that ended March 28, from $20 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. It also missed on revenue expectations. It is forecasting a return to profitability in the second half of the year.(This story has been refiled to fix word syntax in seventh paragraph) (Reporting by Liana B.

366,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK, July 2  NEW YORK, July 2 With analysts' expectations for second-quarter U.S. earnings at rock-bottom levels, many companies may well beat forecasts, possibly setting up the stock market for gains in the coming weeks.Analysts' estimates for second-quarter U.S. earnings have been dialed down sharply since the start of the year, amid concerns a strong dollar will crimp the profits of U.S. multinationals and expectations energy company earnings will drop for a third straight quarter because of low oil prices.With Alcoa set to kick off results season next week, investors are eyeing a 3-percent projected drop in benchmark S&P 500 earnings from a year ago, which would be the first profit decline since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data.However, a similarly dismal forecast from analysts for first-quarter earnings proved overly pessimistic, and S&P 500 companies ended up with a profit gain of 2.2 percent.That's persuaded some strategists to expect similar good news in some sectors in the second quarter, which may well provide a boost to Wall Street.""If profits surprise to the upside, which is what I think they're going to do, that is basically going to convince people we don't have a negative growth problem, that things are better than feared, and that should be positive for stocks,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist for RBC Capital Markets in New York.Golub added he expects ""massive beats"" again in the energy sector in the second quarter, mirroring a pattern seen in the first. Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 4.9 percent from a year ago.GREEK DRAMA The second-quarter profit picture has also been overshadowed by concerns about the debt crisis in Greece, which has driven recent losses in stocks. The S&P 500 is down about 1.5 percent since the June 19 close, and all three major indexes registered losses for last month. Those developments will likely keep investors on edge about results from U.S. companies with considerable exposure to Europe, such as McDonald's.U.S. companies themselves have offered dismal outlooks for earnings, with negative forecasts for the second quarter outpacing positive ones by a ratio of 4-to-1, compared with 5.7- to-1 in the first quarter, according Thomson Reuters.Those grim expectations have been blamed on the impact of a strong greenback, even though a U.S. dollar index  declined 2.9 percent in the second quarter, following a 9 percent jump in the first. A stronger dollar makes it harder for U.S. companies to compete overseas.""I think FX (foreign exchange) has been more of a headwind than we anticipated,"" AutoDesk Chief Executive Carl Bass said in a May 19 conference call with analysts. A weak forecast from Micron Technology last week raised concerns about the outlook for the chip sector, which has  been underperforming the broader market. A semiconductor index  lost 8.7 percent in June, more than four times the S&P 500's 2.1 percent fall.""We're cautiously optimistic. These guys aren't going to come into a number and know they're going to miss by a huge margin,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based Synovus Trust Company, whose top tech holdings include Intel.Tech companies have issued more negative outlooks than any other S&P sector, or 24 out of 97 so far from S&P 500 companies.At the same time, financials are projected to enjoy a 14.8 percent jump in year-over-year earnings, the biggest of any sector, thanks largely to Citigroup, whose results a year ago were hurt by steep litigation charges.Energy companies in the S&P 500 are forecast to have the biggest drop in profits by far from a year ago, by 63 percent, similar to declines projected for the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed.Even then, Golub and other strategists said the ultra-low forecasts just mean companies have an easier bar to beat.""There's some stability in the second quarter with the dollar and oil, so maybe there's going to be a positive surprise for multinationals and the energy sector,"" said Mark Kepner, managing director, sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

367,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Wall Street expects bad news when Intel Corp (INTC.O) reports its second-quarter results on Wednesday although a few short sellers appear to believe the worst is over for the chipmaker's recently sinking stock.Signs of weak demand for personal computers have taken a toll on the shares of Intel ahead of its quarterly report due after the market's close, with Wall Street expecting a year-over-year dip in quarterly revenue for the first time since 2013.Intel's stock is down 18 percent year to date and has fallen about 7 percent since June 25, when Micron Technology (MU.O) blamed weakness in PCs for a drop in quarterly revenues.""The narrative is that it doesn't get much worse than it is right now,"" said FBR analyst Chris Rolland, who rates Intel  ""outperform."" ""As long as DCG (the data center group) hangs in there, I think the stock will probably go up from here,"" he said.Suggesting that some short sellers believe Intel's stock is unlikely to fall much further, the number of shares borrowed has fallen 21 percent since June 29, according to SunGard's Astec Analytics.  But the number of Intel shares shorted at the end of June was the highest since mid-March according to exchange data.  ""Our number still suggests many short sellers are holding onto their positions,"" wrote SunGard analyst Karl Loomes in an email.Shares out on loan are typically used for short sales. Options market traders appear to be slightly cautious ahead of Intel's report. Open interest in Intel puts has been growing at a faster pace than calls since June. Currently 1.2 puts are open for each call, the highest this reading has been this year according to Trade Alert.Intel's stock was flat on Tuesday and trades at 13 times expected earnings.Also hurting Intel's stock recently, rival processor maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) last week posted a steeper-than-expected dip in fiscal first-quarter due to weakness in PCs. Seagate Technology (STX.O), which makes hard-drives for PCs, on Monday warned of poor results for its June quarter.Intel's data center group, which includes high-end server chips, has helped offset trouble in the PC industry in recent years, but it might also be at risk.Last Thursday, QLogic Corp's QLGC.O stock slid 21 percent after the network infrastructure maker warned that its revenue in the June quarter would be less than expected due to general weakness in server and storage markets.

379,"  (Rewrites throughout, adds more details)     By Paul Kilby and Natalie Harrison     NEW YORK, July 22 (IFR) - Intel is on track to price a US$7bn bond on Wednesday to help finance its acquisition of chipmaker Altera after attracting more than US$20bn in investor demand.     The deal, split across four tranches ranging in maturities from five to 30 years, had been long-expected by market participants. Initially marketed in June to European investors, the company held off announcing the deal until today because of market volatility.     Its decision to wait for calmer conditions, and the release of strong second quarter results, clearly paid off as investors rushed to grab a deal that was smaller than initially expected.     Initial new issue concessions - in the range of 20bp-30bp - were a strong selling point in the wake of recent volatility that sent spreads on high-grade bonds to their widest in two years.     Lead managers Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, were able to pull in pricing from any where between 15bp-25bp from start to finish. That left new issue concession of anywhere between flat to 15bp depending on the tranche.      Even then, investors said they were getting a decent premium to both Intel's own curve, which had widened considerably in anticipation of this deal, and its competitors.     ""The big story is that we are at two-year wides on spreads, and a lot of that has been driven by these large issues coming to market and repricing,"" said Matt Duch, portfolio manager, taxable fixed-income at Calvert Investments.     ""But even though spreads on existing holdings are widening, the new issues are coming at decent premiums.""     Michael Dimler, senior credit analyst at Morningstar put  fair value on an Intel five-year at Treasuries plus 70bp, 90bp on a seven-year, 110bp on a 10-year and 175bp on a 30-year bond.     ""(This) reflects our views that Intel should remain well-positioned in its rating category despite the acquisition and that management will pull back on share repurchases to rebuild cash to restore net debt to zero,"" he said.       Intel's bond also looked cheap against peers, especially the long end where the 10 and 30-year were launched at 140bp and 185bp.      That compares to Apple (Aa1/AA+) and Oracle (A1/AA-) whose 2025s were trading at G-spreads of 100bp and 115bp, respectively, while their 2045s were being spotted at Treasuries plus 138bp and 153bp.      Demand was also high because leads indicated to investors earlier today that the company is looking to raise an equivalent of US$7bn-$8bn in total.     That was less than the US$8bn-$10bn that some in the market had initially expected, with the remainder likely to be raised in something other than dollars.     Intel, rated A1/A+/A+, hired Barclays and JP Morgan to hold a European roadshow in June ahead of a potential euro and/or sterling issue, but held off on the deal as markets turned choppy.

After a five-day trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, a jury on Thursday handed McAfee and its attorneys from WilmerHale a near complete victory, but also said McAfee did not prove Colorado-based patent holder TVIIM had misled the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office into granting it the patent in 2005.

386,"  * Q2 rev up 4.5 pct vs estimates of 8 pct fall* Forecasts Q3 rev to fall less than analysts expect* Q2 gaming revenue up 59 pct on strong chip demand* Automotive rev soars 76 pct, enterprise rev down 14 pct* Shares rise more than 9 pct after-market   (Adds analyst comment, details from conference call, updates shares)By Kshitiz GoliyaAug 6 Nvidia Corp reported a surprise rise in second-quarter revenue and gave a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, helped by strong demand for its graphic chips used in gaming and cars.The company's shares rose nearly 10 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Nvidia's revenue increased 4.5 percent in the quarter ended July 26, while analysts on average were expecting revenue to decrease about 8 percent.The company forecast sales would fall in the third quarter, but the decline was again less than analysts' expectations.Nvidia gets a majority of its revenue from its graphic chips made for personal computers, and there were fears that the fall in PC sales would hurt Nvidia just like it has Intel Corp  and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.But, Nvidia said gaming revenue rose 59 percent, helped by strong sales of its popular GeForce series of gaming chips. ""The near term story continues to be PC gaming,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees. ""That is the key driver for them and they continue to dominate in that area.""Nvidia has also been increasing its focus on making chips that allows people to play graphics-heavy games over the internet and chips used in a car's dashboard display and in self-driving cars.Automotive revenue rose 76 percent in the quarter and accounted for only 6.2 percent of total revenue. The company said 8 million cars on the road were using its chips and that it was working with more than 50 companies for its DRIVE chip for self-driving cars.Van Hees said car chips would be a very important long-term story.However, revenue in Nvidia's enterprise business fell 14 percent. The business, which makes chips used for software such as AutoCAD, accounted for 16.2 percent of total revenue.The company's total revenue rose 4.5 percent to $1.15 billion in the second quarter. Analysts had expected $1.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income slumped nearly 80 percent to $26 million in the quarter due to higher costs and a bigger tax bill.Nvidia forecast revenue to fall to $1.16-$1.20 billion in the current quarter from $1.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected a fall to $1.10 billion.Nvidia's shares rose 9.7 percent to $22.43 in extended trading. They had risen nearly 2 percent this year through Thursday, compared with a 11.6 percent fall in the Dow Jones US chip index.

396,"   By Anya George Tharakan and Arathy S Nair  Intel Corp (INTC.O) cut revenue growth forecast for its highly profitable business of making chips for data centers as businesses reduce spending due to weak macroeconomic growth.The world's biggest chipmaker's shares reversed course to trade down as much as 3.8 percent after the bell on Tuesday following the forecast.Intel has been counting on the data center business to help offset declining demand for its chips used in personal computers, its biggest revenue generator.The company agreed in June to acquire Altera Corp ALTR.O for $16.7 billion to expand its line-up of the higher-margin chips used in data centers.Intel said on Tuesday it expected the data center business to grow in ""low double digits"" in 2015, compared with its earlier forecast of about 15 percent growth.The business, the company's second biggest, had grown 19.2 percent in the first quarter, 9.7 percent in the second and 12 percent in the latest quarter. The company was not ""rethinking the long-term growth"" of the business, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call. ""It's a combination of two things — data center weakness and units — it looks like their units are still pretty weak, they are seeing upside from pricing,"" analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said.The weak data center forecast took the shine away from the company's better-than-expected profit and revenue in the third quarter.The company also trimmed its 2015 capital expenditure for the third time to $7.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.Intel had previously forecast capital expenditure of $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The company said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The midpoint of the range is a marginal increase from a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Intel said revenue from its PC business fell 7.5 percent to $8.51 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 26. Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner.Intel's net income fell to $3.11 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

The business, the company's second biggest, had grown 19.2 percent in the first quarter, 9.7 percent in the second and 12 percent in the latest quarter.The company was not ""rethinking the long-term growth"" of the business, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call.""It's a combination of two things - data center weakness and units - it looks like their units are still pretty weak, they are seeing upside from pricing,"" analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said.The weak data center forecast took the shine away from the company's better-than-expected profit and revenue in the third quarter. The company also trimmed its 2015 capital expenditure for the third time to $7.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.Intel had previously forecast capital expenditure of $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million.The company said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The midpoint of the range is a marginal increase from a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel said revenue from its PC business fell 7.5 percent to $8.51 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 26.Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner.Intel's net income fell to $3.11 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

405,"  * Cuts annual capex to four-year low* Says continuing inventory adjustments to weigh on Q4 revenue* Move comes after Intel slices capex   (Adds context, quotes)By J.R. WuTAIPEI, Oct 15 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) on Thursday slashed its annual capital expenditure by over a fifth to a four-year low as weak demand, particularly from China, prompted it to reschedule investment plans. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker which counts Apple Inc as a client, also cut its 2015 outlook for the global semiconductor industry growth to zero from a previously forecast 4 percent, days after rival Intel Corp  also cut its capex and revenue growth forecast, citing weakness in the global economy.TSMC said its capex for this year would total about $8 billion, down from the $10.5 billion to $11 billion estimate it made in April. The capex forecast would be the lowest since 2011, TSMC said. ""This year's $8 billion is kind of low, but next year is expected to be higher,"" Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told an earnings briefing, adding that it was too soon to give estimates for 2016.Ho said TSMC had lowered its estimate partly due to the sluggish demand outlook from China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in nearly a quarter of a century, and not because of a loss in client orders. Cost savings, and forex-related gains, also helped the company reduce its capex, she added.China's smartphone market, the world's largest, shrank in early 2015 for the first time in six years.TSMC, which posted a 5.1 percent quarter-on-quarter drop in third quarter net profit, said it expects revenue for the fourth quarter to range between T$201 billion ($6.3 billion) and T$204 billion, lower than the previous three-month period.Inventory reduction will continue to weigh on revenue growth in the fourth quarter, said Mark Liu, TSMC's co-chief executive officer.

413,"   By John Weavers  SYDNEY, Nov 17 (IFR) - Intel Corporation, rated A1/A+ (Moody's/S&P), has sparked plenty of excitement in Australia ahead of tomorrow's fixed-income investor call for a potential debut offering of Kangaroo bonds.The US technology giant has only issued bonds in US dollars previously, so to make Australia its first offshore port of call would represent another coup for the Kangaroo market following on from Apple's A$2.25 billion ($1.58 billion) blowout three-tranche trade in August.Given that all of Intel's US dollar bond issues have been for $1 billion or more, expectations are centring on an inaugural Kangaroo trade of at least A$1 billion to make it worthwhile, according to a DCM banker not involved in the transaction.Apple's sale dwarfed all previous Australian dollar offerings from non-financial companies, raising hopes for a decisive broadening of Australia's underutilised fixed-income market.The previous largest corporate Australian dollar bond offerings were two A$1 billion trades from local mining giant BHP Billiton. Prior to Apple the biggest pure corporate Kangaroo issuance was for A$500 million, although SABMiller, the London-based global brewer, raised A$700 million from what was technically a domestic five-year trade on July 31 this year, issued through FBG Treasury (Aust). Intel, which is a major Apple supplier, returned to its domestic bond market for the first time since 2012 in the third quarter of this year when it raised $8 billion to help fund its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp agreed earlier in 2015.On the buy side, the Australian dollar bond market is dominated by banks and mining companies in the corporate space, making investors very keen, as Apple confirmed, to get their hands on rare, blue-chip technology paper, although pricing is still all important. Crucially, Apple priced in line with its US dollar curve and just inside its euro curve while offering healthy pick-ups over Australian comparables which persuaded domestic fund managers to lap up 60% of its bonds.Pricing is unlikely to be so compelling for Intel Kangaroo bonds, however, given that the company's $1.75 billion 2.45 percent July 29 2020 bond swaps back below the current 108bp BBSW/asset swaps clearing rate for new five-year senior unsecured bonds issued by Australia's four higher-rated (Aa2/AA-/AA-) major banks.A leading Australian fund manager stressed that major banks do not represent the lowest acceptable limit for new corporate issuers, especially if they provide additional value in terms of portfolio diversification. ""An Intel bond may not be a screaming buy in purely pricing terms but it offers other portfolio advantages while we still have to find out from the company why it is interested in issuing Kangaroos as well as the level of any new issue premium it may provide,"" he said.A syndication manager pointed out that the market has become more challenging since Apple visited Down Under. ""Several investors have become risk-averse in recent months and are now only interested in the five-year segment and/or issues that offer decent new issue concession to help contain downside risk,"" he said.Deutsche Bank, a joint lead manager with CBA and Goldman Sachs for the Apple Kangaroo, is arranging tomorrow's investor call with Westpac. The group call will be held at 11:30 Sydney time (00:30 GMT) to be followed by one-on-one discussions.California-based Intel Corporation is one of the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers, based on revenue.

416,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to Intel  Corp.'s (Intel) 4-year and 7-year senior notes issuance in Australia. Fitch  currently rates Intel's long- and short-term Issuer Default Ratings 'A+/F1'. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch rates $22.2 billion of debt, prior to the  issuance. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release.  With the AUD senior notes sale, Intel will complete the debt component funding  for the company's $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp. (Altera), which is  expected to close by the end of 2015. The AUD notes sale follows Intel's $8  billion of notes issuance in July 2015.  This amount is well below Fitch's original expectation of nearly $15 billion and  has been driven by stronger than anticipated domestic free cash flow (FCF) since  the acquisition announcement. Fitch estimates total leverage (total debt to  operating EBITDA) of 0.9x at closing versus prior expectations for just over 1x.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's belief that Intel's operating profile  will remain strong and credit protection measures solid for the rating, despite  incremental debt issuance to fund the Altera acquisition. Longer-term, Altera  should strengthen Intel's offerings in data center and internet of things (IoT)  markets. Altera is a leading provider of field programmable logic devices (PLD) with 39%  share in the $5 billion PLD market. By combining Intel's processors and Altera's  PLDs on a lower-cost and better-performing single die, Intel hopes to accelerate  growth in data center and take share from application-specific solutions  providers in rapidly growing IoT markets.  Altera adds nearly $2 billion of revenues with gross profit margins in the  mid-60s, slightly higher than those of Intel, with meaningfully lower capital  intensity as a fabless semiconductor marker. In addition, Intel and Altera's  existing foundry relationship and design collaboration with Altera may reduce  integration risk.  With Fitch's expectations for more than $5 billion of annual free cash flow  (FCF), domestic FCF over the next two to three quarters prior to the  acquisition's close could reduce the amount of new debt to fund the purchase  price. Fitch also expects the company will moderate share repurchases to  maintain conservative total leverage. The ratings are supported by:  --Intel microprocessor's dominance and clear and significant technology  leadership, particularly in manufacturing. Intel's x86 processor architecture is  also the premiere platform for data center/servers, providing the company a  significant advantage in the enterprise and cloud-computing space.  --Broad geographic and business diversification. Although the majority of the  company's revenue is derived from PC and server demand, these markets are driven  by different secular growth trends which Fitch expects to contribute to  longer-term stability.  --Continued long-term secular growth in digitalization and computer adoption  worldwide as well as greater penetration of microprocessors in areas outside of  traditional computing.  Rating concerns include:  --Intel's exposure to the cyclical demand for semiconductors which is typically  exacerbated at the beginning of cyclical downturns due to channel inventory  contraction.  --Significant and fixed investment intensity, including research and development  (R&D) and capital spending. Intel's leading profit margins largely compensate  for this risk although capital spending has at times approached 50% of operating  EBITDA.  --Intel has significant customer concentration with its largest customers  accounting for 40% of total revenues. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Slightly down organic revenue growth in fiscal 2015, driven by weaker than  expected personal computer (PC) demand that will be partially offset by  continued strength in data center server chips.  --Beyond the near term, organic revenue growth in the low-single digits, driven  by solid data center-related demand and, to a lesser extent, Intel's strategy to  combine both processers and PLDs on a single die. --Consistent profitability through the forecast period, due to a more stable  pricing environment and Intel's manufacturing cost leadership.  --Annual capital spending of $9 billion to $10 billion and more than $11 billion  of annual R&D investments through the intermediate term to support the  continuation of Moore's Law. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions could result from: --Fitch's expectation that total leverage will remain above 1.25x, driven by a  more aggressive share repurchases and/or greater acquisition activity to build  Intel's mobility segment;  --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF to adjusted debt approaching 20%, as a  result of continued tablet cannibalization of PC sales, and lack of penetration  into the mobile market.  Positive rating action is unlikely, given the cyclicality and volatility  inherent in the semiconductor business, as well as the need for flexibility in  managing technological changes and challenges. A positive rating action would  likely require:  --Profitability improvement across mobility businesses in line with competitors,  signifying improved competitiveness and increased market share within the space.  --An explicit commitment to a leverage ratio of 1x or below. LIQUIDITY Liquidity as of Sept. 26, 2015 was solid and consisted of: --$20.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, $10.1  billion of which was located outside the U.S.;  --$5 billion commercial paper (CP) program with no outstanding balance.  Fitch's expectation for more than $5 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity. The company does not have a revolving credit facility to support its  CP program, but Fitch views Intel's strong liquidity as providing ample support  for the program.  Total debt as of Sept. 26, 2015 was $21.2 billion and primarily consisted of:  --$1.5 billion of 1.95% senior notes due October 2016;  --$3 billion of 1.35% senior notes due December 2017;  --$1.7 billion of 2.45% senior notes due Juley 2020; --$2 billion in 3.3% senior notes due October 2021;  --$1 billion of 3.1% senior notes due July 2022; --$1.5 billion of 2.7% senior notes due December 2022;  --$2.2 billion of 3.7% senior notes due July 2025; --$750 million of 4% senior notes due December 2032;  --$975 million principal value of 2.95% junior subordinated debentures due  December 2035;  --$1.1 billion principal value of 3.25% junior subordinated debentures due  August 2039;  --$1.5 billion of 4.8% senior notes due October 2041;  --$924 million of 4.25% senior notes due December 2042; --$2 billion of 4.9% senior notes due July 2045; --$1 billion of 4.9% senior notes due August 2045.  FULL LIST OF RATINGS  Fitch currently rates Intel Corp. as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+';  --Short-term IDR 'F1';  --$5 billion CP program 'F1';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A+';  --Junior subordinated notes 'A'.

The major S&P sectors all ended sharply lower. The Russell 2000 small-cap index dropped as much as 3.5 percent to its lowest level since July 2013.The energy sector dropped 2.87 percent as oil prices fell 6.5 percent, in part due to fears of slow economic growth in China, where major stock indexes also slumped overnight. The energy sector has lost nearly half of its value after hitting record highs in late 2014.""Initially when oil was down, the convenient line was 'Well, it's good for the other nine sectors,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""That tune has changed. Now, it's a contagion to the other nine sectors. It's a contagion to Main Street and Wall Street.""

424,"   By John Weavers  SYDNEY, Feb 16 (IFR) - The Coca-Cola Company  (Aa3/AA/A+) looks set to provide the first real test of the year for the corporate Kangaroo market, having mandated Deutsche Bank to arrange investor meetings from March 7 for a potential debut trade.The stellar A$2.25 billion ($1.59 billion) triple-tranche issue last August from Apple, rated Aa1/AA+ (Moody's/S&P), raised hopes that Australia would become a key second-tier destination for overseas credits, alongside the sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar markets.Intel, rated A1/A+ (Moody's/S&P), followed three months later with a slightly underwhelming inaugural A$800 million dual-tranche sale, which, despite being the second-largest corporate Kangaroo, failed to match hopes for a A$1 billion-plus issue.Intel's average order sizes were back at the typical A$20 million-A$50 million levels rather than the bumper Apple tickets of up to A$150 million, as the world's biggest chip-maker struggled amid a more difficult market backdrop than the one Apple had faced. Limited credit analyst coverage among Australian fund managers also weighed on the Intel trade, while several Asian investors felt the pick-up offered over Intel's US dollar curve was insufficient to compensate for the lower liquidity in the Australian market. The latter is a particularly important consideration during times of global market stress.Local funds are more familiar with Coca Cola, especially with regional bottler Coca-Cola Amatil, rated A3/A- (Moody's/S&P), having previously issued Australian dollar bonds, including a A$150 million seven-year MTN in November 2012.With the Aussie dollar, a proxy for China risk, now trading at around 70 US cents after being near parity between October 2010 and October 2014, a Kangaroo issue must now exceed A$700 million to reach the equivalent US dollar benchmark size of $500 million. It will be a very impressive result if Coca-Cola matches the size of its first Matterhorn transaction in September 2015, a SFr1.325 billion ($1.345 billion) three-trancher.Coca-Cola debuted in the euro market 12 months earlier with a 2 billion euro ($2.23 billion) dual-trancher and followed up with a whopping 8.5 billion euro five-note issue last February. The company, historically a large issuer, printed its last US dollar transaction in October 2015 with a $4 billion SEC-registered three-part senior unsecured offering.Deutsche Bank's role as arranger for the Coca-Cola roadshow underlines its position as the go-to international bank for US corporate blue chips looking to visit Down Under.Deutsche was joint lead manager for the Apple Kangaroo with CBA and Goldman Sachs and also led the Intel debut alongside Westpac.Although the Korea National Oil Corporation A$325 million three-year floating-rate-note sale on February 2 was technically 2016's first corporate Kangaroo, the state-owned company is seen as sovereign rather than corporate risk, while only 2 percent of the bonds were allocated to Australasian investors.

428,"   By Joel Schectman and Susan Heavey | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A new U.S. export restriction against China's ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged Iran sanctions violations is likely to disrupt the telecom manufacturer's sprawling global supply chain and could create substantial parts shortages, according to sanctions experts.Under the measure announced by the Commerce Department on Monday, U.S. manufacturers will be banned from selling components to ZTE, which is a major global supplier of telecom-networking equipment. In addition, foreign manufacturers will be prohibited from selling products containing a significant amount of U.S.-made parts to the Chinese company.The Commerce Department, confirming the decision that was first reported by Reuters on Saturday, said ZTE planned to use a series of shell companies “to illicitly reexport controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws."" It said ZTE acted ""contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.""While ZTE suppliers can apply for an export license to ship any American-made equipment or parts, the Commerce Department said such license applications generally will be denied.   The export restriction, which does not stop ZTE from selling handsets in the United States, is expected to have a global impact.“It is going to have a large ripple effect. It’s very significant to many companies both in the U.S. and (outside the) U.S.,” said Doug Jacobson, an export attorney at law firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, who said he has been fielding calls from clients who supply ZTE since Reuters broke news of the impending export restrictions.For example, a Taiwanese chipmaker that uses American-made components to make processors for ZTE handsets would likely have to cut off those sales. If the Taiwanese supplier only procures components from outside the United States it can continue to sell to ZTE, experts said.“I am telling all my clients today that anything (for ZTE)not already on board an airplane going to China, you cannot ship it starting tonight. They have to scrub and screen their customers lists – pending orders and future orders – to make sure that any transactions with ZTE are flagged and stopped.”ZTE, which has annual sales of more than $15 billion and is the only Chinese smartphone maker with a meaningful presence in the U.S. market, can appeal the decision. ZTE is among the largest companies that the Commerce Department has hit with a near-total export ban, according to public records. In 2014, the department restricted exports to Russian energy companies Lukoil OAO and Gazprom OAO, but those restrictions only stopped American companies from supplying certain types of oil-production projects, such as Arctic offshore and deepwater drilling.  EFFECT ON HANDSET PRODUCTION ZTE is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, with a 7 percent market share, behind Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), according to research firm IDC. It sells handset devices to three of the four largest U.S. mobile carriers - AT&T (T.N), T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N).Although ZTE is not being banned from selling handsets in the United States, the restriction could disrupt handset production if ZTE sources U.S.-made parts to manufacture its handsets, experts said. AT&T declined to comment, and T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment.A ZTE website states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM (IBM.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are ""key strategic partners."" Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they were ZTE suppliers, but did not elaborate on specific products sold to the Chinese company or how sanctions would affect their businesses.Texas Instruments (TXN.O), which has also said it provides processors for the Chinese company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The impact of the new restrictions on these three companies was not immediately clear as most of them produce components both in the United States and overseas. Microsoft, in an emailed statement, said, ""We follow U.S. law and will review new U.S. restrictions.""A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if ZTE purchases other products, such as software.The other U.S. companies did not respond to requests for comment.The U.S. decision could even prompt suppliers to halt sales of non-U.S. components that are still allowed, said Kay Georgi, an export attorney at law firm Arent Fox LLP.""When you get placed on one of these lists nobody wants to do business with you at all,"" Georgi said. The United States has long banned the sale of U.S.-made technology products to Iran as part of its sanctions, even as China maintains close diplomatic, economic, trade and energy ties with Tehran. Last year, the United States and major world powers reached a deal with Iran to loosen economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.""We hope this sends a strong message to ZTE, to China, and to other Chinese telecommunications companies who present serious national security risks not only by evading export controls, but by purposefully compromising supply chain security,"" said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee.

433,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Andy Grove, the Silicon Valley elder statesman who made Intel into the world's top chipmaker and helped usher in the personal computer age, died on Tuesday at age 79, Intel said.The company did not describe the circumstances of his death but Grove, who endured the Nazi occupation of Hungary during World War Two, living under a fake name, and came to the United States to escape the chaos of Soviet rule, had suffered from Parkinson's.Grove was Intel’s first hire after it was founded in 1968 and became the practical-minded member of a triumvirate that eventually led “Intel Inside” processors to be used in more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers.With his motto ""only the paranoid survive,"" which became the title of his best-selling management book, Grove championed an innovative environment within Intel that became a blueprint for successful California startups.Grove, who was named man of the year by Time magazine in 1997, encouraged disagreement and insisted employees be vigilant of disruptions in industry and technology that could be major dangers - or opportunities - for Intel. In doing so, he could be mercurial and demanding with employees who he thought were not doing enough and in 1981 required the staff to work two extra hours a day with no extra pay.Grove's overhaul of Intel’s business - switching from digital memory to processors - was an early example of his obsession with detecting major shifts in business and technology and staying flexible enough to move quickly and make the most of them.""It's not that you shouldn't plan but you should not regard your plans to be anything more than a baseline model of what might happen,” Grove said.While Intel founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore proposed much of the chip technology that helped created the semiconductor industry, Grove was the stickler for detail who turned their ideas into actual products. He was responsible for driving growth in Intel’s profits and stock price through the 1980s and 1990s.     NAZIS, COMMUNISTS Grove, who was Jewish, was born Andras Grof in Budapest in 1936. Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in his youth, and after the Soviets followed, Grove sneaked into Austria in 1956 and then emigrated to the United States, where he learned English and earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley.Grove went to work in 1963 at Fairchild Semiconductor, where he researched technology that would eventually be used to make microchips. At Fairchild, he also met chip visionaries Noyce and Moore, who left to found Intel in 1968. Grove quickly joined them, running research and manufacturing. He became Intel’s president in 1979, CEO in 1987 and chairman and CEO in 1997. He gave up his CEO title in 1998 and stayed on as chairman until 2004. In its early years, Intel focused on making DRAM memory chips. When Japanese competition soared, Grove made the fateful decision to reinvent Intel as a manufacturer of microprocessors – the brains at the center of personal computers and other electronic devices.As the personal computer industry took off in the 1980s, Intel supplied its processors to IBM and then to Compaq and other manufacturers making ""IBM clone"" PCs. Intel's chips, along with Microsoft’s Windows operating system, quickly became an industry standard in the exploding PC industry, with Grove funneling profits into research and development to create faster and faster processors. Under his stewardship, the Pentium brand and “Intel Inside” logo became widely recognized by consumers. Intel remains one of the world's leading semiconductor companies but the PC chipmaker is wrestling to adapt to trends toward smaller gadgets like smartphones and tablets.Grove also was a champion of keeping manufacturing within the United States, arguing outsourcing the manufacturing of electronics products - like batteries or televisions - meant U.S. companies missed out on gaining experience necessary to make technology breakthroughs.Intel still makes most of its chips in U.S. plants.During his time at Intel in the 1990s Grove was treated for prostate cancer and later wrote an influential cover story in Fortune magazine, criticizing the medical establishment's treatment of the disease as inefficient compared to scientific standards applied in semiconductor research.In later life, Grove donated tens of millions of dollars for research on Parkinson's disease, a condition he suffered from. He also regularly criticized government and medical researchers for making slow and inefficient progress beating that disease compared to accomplishments made in the chip industry.Grove and his wife, Eva, who married a year after meeting while working at a resort in New Hampshire in 1957, had two daughters.

434,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Andy Grove, the Silicon Valley elder statesman who made Intel into the world's top chipmaker and helped usher in the personal computer age, died on Tuesday at age 79, Intel said.The company did not describe the circumstances of his death but Grove, who endured the Nazi occupation of Hungary during World War Two, living under a fake name, and came to the United States to escape the chaos of Soviet rule, had suffered from Parkinson's.Grove was Intel’s first hire after it was founded in 1968 and became the practical-minded member of a triumvirate that eventually led “Intel Inside” processors to be used in more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers.With his motto ""only the paranoid survive,"" which became the title of his best-selling management book, Grove championed an innovative environment within Intel that became a blueprint for successful California startups.Grove, who was named man of the year by Time magazine in 1997, encouraged disagreement and insisted employees be vigilant of disruptions in industry and technology that could be major dangers - or opportunities - for Intel. In doing so, he could be mercurial and demanding with employees who he thought were not doing enough and in 1981 required the staff to work two extra hours a day with no extra pay.Grove's overhaul of Intel’s business - switching from digital memory to processors - was an early example of his obsession with detecting major shifts in business and technology and staying flexible enough to move quickly and make the most of them.""It's not that you shouldn't plan but you should not regard your plans to be anything more than a baseline model of what might happen,” Grove said.While Intel founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore proposed much of the chip technology that helped created the semiconductor industry, Grove was the stickler for detail who turned their ideas into actual products.

438,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is the clear favorite in the upcoming bidding for Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) core Internet business, according to Wall Street analysts, in large part because the telecommunications company's efforts to become a force in Internet content have gone relatively well under the leadership of AOL Inc Chief Executive Tim Armstrong.Verizon acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion - its first big foray into the advertising-supported Internet business - and it is not yet clear how well the unit is performing financially. Subsequent moves, including the takeover of much of Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) advertising technology business, a deal to buy Millennial Media for about $250 million and the recent launch of the mobile video service go90, are also too recent to assess.Yet analysts have given the big phone company high marks for allowing AOL to operate independently and folding in other recent acquisitions without much drama. And they said Armstrong seems to be driving Verizon's recent moves in go90 and recent acquisitions. ""The management puts a lot of faith in Armstrong,"" BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk said. That faith derives in part from the belief that Armstrong did a good job at left-for-dead AOL, especially in assembling a strong set of products to deliver targeted digital ads to customers.Combining AOL and Yahoo, an idea that has come up many times over the years, could instantly make Yahoo a major player in Internet advertising, with Armstrong - one of the world's top ad executives - at the helm, analysts said. Armstrong ""has good M&A experience, and a pretty solid ad tech stack,” B. Riley & Co analyst Sameet Sinha said. Verizon's hands-off approach that has worked with AOL, though, might not be suitable if the far-bigger Yahoo were taken over. With Yahoo's struggling business, ""the luxury of autonomy is simply not there,"" Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said.   Verizon, AOL and Yahoo declined to comment.START THE BIDDING Verizon showed interest in Yahoo's core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would ""see if there is a strategic fit"" for Yahoo's holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo, under pressure from activist investors, launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). The first round of bidding is slated for next week, and Verizon plans to make a bid, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its ad-supported mobile video service go90, targeted at millennials and built on video streaming technology acquired from Intel Corp (INTC.O) in 2014.The app, which launched in October, offers videos from Comedy Central and Vice, among others, as well as basketball and football games.  However, analysts cautioned that even a combined Yahoo-AOL would lack the unique data, such as user interests and tastes, that powers its rivals in online ads, chiefly Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook Inc (FB.O).Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community - in contrast to Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer, who has been struggling to revive Yahoo. Mayer would likely leave after a Verizon-Yahoo deal, analysts said. Verizon is not especially interested in Yahoo's massive stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T), which are worth far more than its core internet business, the sources said. That could leave an opening for a bidder such as Softbank Group (9984.T), Yahoo's partner in Yahoo Japan, which might be able to devise a way to minimize the tax bill that would come with any sale of the Asia investments.""(Yahoo) is ultimately Verizon’s to lose,"" said Robert Peck, Internet analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""They’re the leading candidate in this effort and can afford to pay the most because of cost synergies and scale.""Other players weighing joint or solo bids are media company Time Inc (TIME.N) and several private equity firms including Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), according to sources. The owner of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper also said this week it is in talks with potential partners to mount a joint bid.

449,"   By Narottam Medhora  Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Tuesday it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it refocuses its business towards making microchips that power data centers and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found.Tech companies including the former Hewlett Packard Co and  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have reorganized in the face of the PC industry decline. Many new tech users around the world turn to mobile phones for their computing needs, and corporations increasingly rely on big machines rather than desktop models to run their businesses. Global personal computer shipments fell 11.5 percent in the first quarter, tech research company IDC said on Monday.Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, lowered its revenue forecast for the year. It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits.Intel's shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading.Most of Intel's factories are in the United States, although it did not identify where cuts would be focused geographically. It said it would record a pretax restructuring charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter and expected annual savings of $1.4 billion per year starting mid-2017. (bit.ly/1WDPfBm)The company also said Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will move to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Intel said it would begin a formal search process for a new CFO.Smith said that Intel now expects the PC market to decline by a percentage in the high single digits in 2016 versus a prior forecast of a mid single-digit decline. Declines in China and other emerging markets are also leading to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. ""PC demand, at least in the eyes of Intel, is expected to be weaker than the industry originally anticipated,"" said Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at S&P Capital Global Market Intelligence.He added that although the industry has already seen some of the weakness experienced by Intel, the company's comments dashed any hope of recovery.The Santa Clara, California-based company has been focusing on its higher-margin data center business as it looks to reduce its dependence on the slowing PC market. Intel has also made inroads into the mobile devices market, although competitors Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Samsung Electronics Co(005930.KS) dominate there. Intel said in a statement the job cuts would be carried out by mid-2017 and the restructuring would ""accelerate its evolution from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices.""Sales of products for the data center and the Internet of things accounted for 40 percent of revenue and the majority of operating profit, it added.Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann, who rates Intel ""under perform"" said the problems leading to the job cuts were likely more about Intel than the broader tech industry. ""The bigger issue is the restructuring and will it be enough for the company to properly adapt to a changing environment where cloud and IoT competitive dynamics are quite different,"" Mosesmann added. On a per share basis, the company earned 42 cents per share, in the first quarter, up from 41 cents a year earlier.Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion.Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents.Up to Tuesday's close, Intel's shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year, compared with a slight gain in the broader semiconductor index .SOX.

It said it would record a pretax restructuring charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter and expected annual savings of $1.4 billion per year starting mid-2017. (bit.ly/1WDPfBm)The company also said Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will move to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Intel said it would begin a formal search process for a new CFO.Smith said that Intel now expects the PC market to decline by a percentage in the high single digits in 2016 versus a prior forecast of a mid single-digit decline. Declines in China and other emerging markets are also leading to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. ""PC demand, at least in the eyes of Intel, is expected to be weaker than the industry originally anticipated,"" said Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at S&P Capital Global Market Intelligence.He added that although the industry has already seen some of the weakness experienced by Intel, the company's comments dashed any hope of recovery.The Santa Clara, California-based company has been focusing on its higher-margin data center business as it looks to reduce its dependence on the slowing PC market. Intel has also made inroads into the mobile devices market, although competitors Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Samsung Electronics Co(005930.KS) dominate there. Intel said in a statement the job cuts would be carried out by mid-2017 and the restructuring would ""accelerate its evolution from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices.""Sales of products for the data center and the Internet of things accounted for 40 percent of revenue and the majority of operating profit, it added.Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann, who rates Intel ""under perform"" said the problems leading to the job cuts were likely more about Intel than the broader tech industry. ""The bigger issue is the restructuring and will it be enough for the company to properly adapt to a changing environment where cloud and IoT competitive dynamics are quite different,"" Mosesmann added. On a per share basis, the company earned 42 cents per share, in the first quarter, up from 41 cents a year earlier.Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion.Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents.Up to Tuesday's close, Intel's shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year, compared with a slight gain in the broader semiconductor index .SOX.

455,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) revealed a more than $1 billion stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a rare foray into the technology sector, which Buffett has largely shunned apart from a poorly performing investment in IBM (IBM.N). Shares of Apple rose 3.7 percent on the news, closing up $3.36 at $93.88. Berkshire made its investment in the first quarter, before the iPhone maker in April reported its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years.The investment was announced amid an increasing view among investors that Apple may deserve a lower valuation because its heady growth days may be over. However, Apple has a strong balance sheet and management, attributes long favored by Berkshire.""It makes sense because it's a consumer company disguised as a technology company with a great business model, strong cash flow and a cheap valuation,"" said Jeff Matthews, author of books about Buffett and a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund. ""It's not a leap of faith.""In a regulatory filing detailing most of its stock holdings, Berkshire said it held 9.81 million Apple shares worth $1.07 billion as of March 31.The value of the stake has since fallen to about $921 million, even with Monday's gain. Berkshire's largest technology bet has been Buffett's roughly $12.1 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp, an investment now more than $1.6 billion in the red.  Apple stock ""is stunningly cheap, and it has a massive pile of cash,"" said Steve Wallman, founder of Wallman Investment Counsel in Middleton, Wisconsin, who has owned shares of Berkshire since 1982 and Apple since 2003. ""Apple is not getting credit for research and development it is doing behind the scenes.""An Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.MIXED VIEWS OF HEDGE FUNDS  The Apple investment was made by one of Buffett's two stockpicking deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his assistant said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. Combs and Weschler, who ran hedge funds before joining Berkshire, each invest about $9 billion and usually make smaller wagers, while Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, makes bigger investments such as IBM.Investors said Combs may have been the Apple buyer. He  invested in chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for Berkshire in 2011.Buffett's assistant did not respond to a request for comment.In April, Apple said revenue for the quarter ended March 26 declined as an increasingly saturated smartphone market hurt iPhone sales, which fell for the first time. Chief Executive Tim Cook is looking to develop other technologies for the Cupertino, California-based company, and last week unveiled a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing.Apple's market value last week dipped below that of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), even though Apple generates roughly triple the revenue and profit. Before Monday, shares of Apple were down by a third from their April 2015 peak. Synovus Trust Company portfolio manager Daniel Morgan, noting that Buffett is known as a value buyer, said; ""That kind of puts the icing on the cake that Apple now is probably considered more of a mature technology company, like we would think of Microsoft, Intel or Cisco.""I don’t think we can put them in the same bracket right now as Google, Amazon (AMZN.O) or Netflix (NFLX.O),” said Morgan said, who owns Apple because of its low price-earnings ratio and high dividend yield.""It's a value stock that has the potential for a big growth,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York who also holds Apple stock.Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is also a fan, and his firm Greenlight Capital on Monday said it boosted its Apple stake by 31 percent in the first quarter.Other prominent investors have retrenched.Last month, billionaire Carl Icahn said he sold his Apple stake on concern about the company's relationship with China. David Tepper's Appaloosa LP sold its stake in the first quarter, while Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates and Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management slashed their stakes. Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors also shed its Apple stake, a person familiar with the matter said.BUFFETT ON YAHOO Despite his traditional aversion to technology sector, Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he offered to help Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, finance a bid for internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).Reuters first reported Buffett's involvement on Friday. While Buffett told CNBC he would not be an equity partner, he could collect dividends or interest on the financing, and perhaps take an equity stake later.""Buffett has always restricted himself from investing in things he doesn't know or understand, and staying within his circle of confidence,"" said Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook & Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham, Alabama, which invests 8 percent of the $350 million it manages in Berkshire.The Apple investment may have been made with proceeds from the sale of AT&T Inc (T.N) stock, as Berkshire exited what had been a $1.6 billion stake.In Monday's filing, Berkshire also reported higher stakes in IBM, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Visa Inc (V.N), and lower stakes in MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

Company research chief George Yancopoulos was a top winner in 1976 for research that involved cutting protozoans in half to see what factors enabled the tiny organisms to regenerate. The young scholars stuck to the regeneration theme when Schleifer started Regeneron in 1988, with Yancopoulos its founding scientist. The company focused on discovering nerve-growth proteins that could regenerate neurons. They hoped to find cures for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.Those lofty efforts failed, but the company kept the Regeneron name as it changed course and focused on other diseases.A teacher at Forest Hills High School, in Queens, New York, encouraged Schleifer to enter the Westinghouse competition and gave him inspiration that has lasted a lifetime. ""It taught me the value of having a teacher who really cared and served as my mentor,"" said Schleifer. He expressed concern that many fine young scientific minds have been lost over recent decades to more-glamorous fields like investment banking, but said the Regeneron Science Talent Search will hopefully keep many others on track.Intel in March said its sponsorship would be ending but provided no details. Company executives declined further comment on Wednesday, including whether the discontinued sponsorship was related to austerity moves as Intel moves forward with 12,000 planned job cuts globally.

473,"   By Edward Taylor | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT BMW (BMWG.DE) is teaming up with Intel (INTC.O) and Mobileye (MBLY.N) to develop new technology for the auto industry that could put self-driving cars on the road by around 2021.The alliance highlights a shift in the dynamics of research and development in the car industry, which until recently saw automakers largely dictating terms for suppliers to manufacture their proprietary technologies at specified volumes and prices.  Now carmakers are increasingly striking up partnerships with technology firms using open technology standards, seeking to harness their expertise in areas including machine learning and mapping as they race against Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) to develop driverless vehicles. ""Highly autonomous cars and everything they connect to will require powerful and reliable electronic brains to make them smart enough to navigate traffic and avoid accidents,” Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on Friday at a joint news conference announcing the alliance.The three companies said their new platform would be made available to multiple carmakers and they expected vehicles with highly and fully-automated driving would be brought into mass production by 2021. It is too early to say which other carmakers would join the alliance, BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger said at a news conference on the outskirts of Munich on Friday.Sophisticated cruise control systems already enable ""hands off"" driving as cameras and computers allow cars to automatically brake, steer and accelerate in traffic at low speeds. But drivers are required to stay in control.  Now BMW, Intel and Mobileye will develop cars with even higher levels of automation described as ""eyes off,"" ""mind off,"" and ""driver off"". This requires much more computing power and software know-how, forcing traditional carmakers to collaborate more closely with technology specialists.Both industries see huge revenue opportunities in the market for autonomous vehicles, although it is unclear how many drivers will be prepared to relinquish control and how quickly laws will be put in place to allow fully autonomous vehicles on the roads.But creating common technology standards would help all manufacturers update their vehicles faster, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said. ""That will be critical for advancing the safety aspects of this.""  A common approach to standards will also make it easier for regulators to understand and approve the roadworthiness of a vehicle while still leaving enough scope for individual car manufacturers to customize their cars, Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua said.Beyond technological hurdles there are legal questions over who is responsible when a crash occurs. On Thursday, the driver of a Tesla Model S car, operating in Autopilot mode, was killed in a collision with a truck in the United States, prompting an investigation by federal highway safety regulators. When asked about the crash, BMW CEO Harald Krueger said: ""The accident is very sad .... We believe today the technologies are not ready for series production,"" he added, explaining the alliance had not forecast that until 2021. ""For the BMW group, safety comes first,"" he said. As part of the new alliance, Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker which has been looking to expand into the automotive electronics market, will supply the microprocessors - or central processing units - to control an array of sensors.Auto camera and software maker Mobileye will supply its Road Experience Management (REM) technology and make its latest EyeQ5 chip available to be deployed on Intel computing platforms.The three companies said they would demonstrate their technology in a prototype in the near future.

""We finally saw the Dow give up its solid rally.""     Treasury prices also attracted bids on news that Brazil arrested 10 people on Thursday suspected of belonging to a group supporting Islamic State (IS) and discussing acts of terrorism during next month's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.      ""The Brazil arrests certainly played into investor anxiety,"" said Rupert.     In late trading, benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes  were up 5/32 in price for a yield of 1.561 percent, down from 1.580 percent late on Wednesday. Earlier, benchmark yields hit 1.628 percent, the highest level since June 24.      U.S. 30-year bond prices were flat, yielding 2.296 percent. The yield touched a three-week peak of 2.360 percent earlier in the session.     U.S. two-year notes were up 1/32 in price, yielding 0.685 percent, down from 0.714 percent on Wednesday. Yields touched a four-week high of 0.731 percent.     Yields across the curve were boosted earlier in the session by generally upbeat U.S. economic data.     Thursday's data showed U.S. initial jobless claims hit a three-month low at a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended July 16. Mid-Atlantic factory activity, however, contracted, but details showed expanding new orders and employment.      U.S. data since the release of a strong nonfarm payrolls report for June a few weeks ago have been positive overall, pushing yields higher since the lows hit following Britain's shock vote to exit the European Union.     ""Data on the economy suggests the U.S. economy is still on track to grow at or slightly above trend,"" said New York-based Kirk Barneby, investment director of fixed income at Center Asset Management. ""The fundamentals are there to justify rate increases.""     Fed funds futures rates late on Thursday suggested a more than 50 percent chance the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates at least once this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch, compared with less than 20 percent a few weeks ago.

490,"  AMSTERDAM Aug 17 Shares in Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML Holding fell after remarks by an Intel official suggested the company may hold off on using ASML's newest tools in commercial production.Analysts said the comments by Mark Bohr, Intel's Director of Process Architecture and a familiar figure in the industry, were no cause for alarm, but shares fell 4.5 percent to 93.54 euros by 1130 GMT in Amsterdam on Wednesday.Intel holds a 15 percent stake in ASML and is a key customer for its lithography machines which use focused light beams to map out the circuitry of computer chips.Speaking at an event in San Francisco, Bohr said Intel would initially rely on older ASML tools at Intel's 7 nm fabrication plants, switching only to ASML's newest EUV tools when they are deemed ready. EUV stands for ""extreme ultraviolet""-range light waves. ASML dominates the market for lithography machines, but it is counting on adoption of the EUV machines -- which can cost up to 100 million euros ($113 million) each -- to increase sales to a target of 10 billion euros by 2020.Bernstein analysts said Bohr's comments did not appear to mark a major change. ""Intel would never bet unequivocally on an unproven technology,"" Stacy Ragson wrote in a note on Intel's presentation.""Dr. Bohr's comments, while perhaps a bit more direct than what might have been perceived before, should not have been surprising."" Bernstein rates ASML shares ""Outperform"". ASML still expects EUV machines to enter production in 2018 and be running at full volume by 2019, company spokesman Lucas van Grinsven said.Analyst Jos Versteeg from Dutch private bank Theodoor Gilissen, said Wednesday's share decline presented investors with a ""nice purchasing moment.""""Even if EUV were delayed, that wouldn't be bad for ASML's results, given that many more (current generation) systems would have to be sold"" to compensate, he said.

At the same time, PC growth slowed, eroding the traditional McAfee customer base’s potential.The unit, rebranded as Intel Security Group in 2014, will revert to the McAfee brand name following the closing of the deal, expected in the second quarter of 2017.McAfee’s founder, John McAfee, was for a time on the run from a murder investigation in Belize and is a pariah in the industry. He recently sued Intel to get back the right to use his name. Chris Young, Intel Security's general manager, will be named  chief executive of the new company.Intel Security's revenue rose 11 percent to $1.1 billion through the first half of this year, the company said in a statement.  TPG, which is making a $1.1 billion equity investment in the company, first approached Intel’s board about a potential transaction for McAfee around a year ago, sources familiar with the matter said. TPG also led a $120 million investment round for security startup Tanium last year and was the lead investor in a $100 million funding round in internet security firm Zscaler.

499,"  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) said on Thursday it was collaborating with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to develop a wearable technology platform to track the progression of disease in patients with Huntington's, a fatal degenerative disorder.The inherited condition causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in a gradual decline in motor control, cognition and mental stability.There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington's, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis.Teva (TEVA.N), with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington's study, the Israeli company said on Thursday.Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement.The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity. The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware.Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare.The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions. Businesses such as Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products.Earlier this month, Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), announced a joint venture combining devices with services to improve diabetes care.In August, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Verily created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes.Sanofi (SASY.PA) also has a diabetes deal with Alphabet, while Biogen (BIIB.O) is working with the tech giant to study the progression of multiple sclerosis.Teva, last year, announced it would partner with IBM's (IBM.N) Watson Health.

Teva, working with Intel, will deploy the technology in a sub-study within an ongoing study on Huntington, which will start later this year in the United States and Canada. Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure their functioning and movement.

Net profit reached 396 million euros ($434.65 million) for July-September from 322 million euros in the same period a year prior. The result compared with the 410 million euro average of 17 analyst estimates in a Reuters poll.However, sales of 1.82 billion euros beat analysts expectations of 1.72 billion euros on the back of higher sales of ASML's newest machines.ASML forecast fourth-quarter revenue of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion euros. Perhaps of greatest interest to company watchers, ASML reported three orders for the new machine, the NXE:3400 EUV system. CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement that six customers were ""now actively engaged in the EUV introduction in both memory and logic.""As a result, the company booked 1.42 billion euros worth of new orders in the quarter, besting analyst estimates of 1.24 billion euros. ASML's fortunes are seen as relying on how quickly the industry adopts the machines, which cost around 100 million euros apiece and are currently being tested by several of the world's biggest chipmakers ahead of entering into scale production.A misunderstanding over remarks by Intel in August about its time-frame for adopting the EUV systems led to a selloff in ASML shares.ASML is dominant in its segment, lithography systems, which use focused rays of energy to help semiconductor makers lay out the circuitry of computer chips.($1 = 0.9111 euros)   (Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Edwina Gibbs)",2016-10-19,INTC,"Wed Oct 19, 2016 | 2:28am EDT","UPDATE 1-ASML Q3 results miss on profit, but sales up on orders of newest machines",http://www.reuters.com//article/asml-holding-results-idUSL8N1CP0NI?type=companyNews

536,"   By Joseph White  Auto parts maker Delphi Automotive Plc and Israeli technology firm Mobileye NV will put an Intel Corp chip at the heart of their joint effort to produce self-driving vehicles by 2019, the companies said on Tuesday.The move is a boost for the world's largest semiconductor maker, which is also working with German luxury car maker BMW AG and Mobileye on self-driving technology, but has not been able to extend its broader chip dominance into the fast-emerging autonomous vehicle market.Companies from Alphabet Inc's Google to Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Tesla Motors Inc are vying to put autonomous vehicles on U.S. roads, which could radically reshape transportation across the country. Intel will provide a ""system on chip"" for autonomous vehicle systems that Delphi and Mobileye are developing together, Glen De Vos, Delphi's vice president of engineering, told Reuters.  UK-based Delphi is talking with established automakers and new or niche vehicle companies, such as manufacturers of commercial vehicles, interested in automating vehicles, De Vos said. The system Delphi and Mobileye are developing would likely come to market first in a commercial vehicle operating in a limited area, such as an airport shuttle or a ride-hailing service, DeVos said. Delphi is testing autonomous driving technology in vehicles in Singapore. By the end of this year, Delphi hopes to choose a city in the United States to launch a test fleet of self-driving cars during 2017, De Vos said. The company is also looking for test site in a European city.""We are looking at Pittsburgh and Boston and a couple of others,"" De Vos said. Pittsburgh is where ride services company Uber is testing its own self-driving vehicles. Delphi and Mobileye will stage a demonstration of their self-driving vehicle system at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, De Vos said. That system will use current, electromechanical laser imaging technology, or LIDAR, that is too expensive for use in consumer vehicles, he said.Delphi is also working with Quanergy Systems, a maker of solid-state LIDAR systems, De Vos said.
