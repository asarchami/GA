0,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Oct 17 Taking a page from his last job, Eaton Vance's new Chief Equity Investment Officer bets that reorganizing his analysts into new teams will boost performance.Since joining the Boston company in April from Goldman Sachs, Edward Perkin has regrouped Eaton Vance's 27 stock analysts into teams meant to develop investment ideas that match the strategies of the firm's various funds.That marks an important change from the past, when a central pool of analysts advised many different portfolio managers.The idea is to improve returns in Eaton Vance Corp  stock funds, which have posted mixed performances and outflows in recent years.""We have got good people,"" Perkin said. ""It's more about the structure of the department.""Eaton Vance has about $17.8 billion in stock funds overseen by Perkin that have suffered about $2.3 billion in net withdrawals so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit. Along with performance concerns, investors have lost enthusiasm for the large-cap sector overall.Morningstar analyst Greg Carlson said it is hard to know if Perkin's shifts will be enough. While having strategy-specific research teams has worked for Goldman, Carlson noted that competitors such as T. Rowe Price Group and Fidelity Investments still use centralized groups of analysts.Eaton Vance may need bigger changes, Carlson said. ""For as long as I can remember, Eaton Vance's in-house equity funds, on average, haven't been particularly great or terrible. They've been middle-of-the-road,"" he added.FROM LONDON, AND BACK AGAIN  Perkin, 42, replaced Duncan Richardson, who retired last fall after 26 years with the firm. Perkin most recently worked for Goldman in London and said he is considering expanding Eaton Vance's London office to include analysts or portfolio managers as he creates more global funds. Perkin's division manages about $6 billion in global equities, a figure he said could be ""many times that.""Perkin was also named co-manager of the $4.3 billion Eaton Vance Large Cap Value Fund, which two other co-managers left in May. It has returned 1.53 percent so far in 2014, beating 75 percent of its peers, according to Morningstar, after a period of weak performance.One new holding since Perkin took over is logistics firm C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc, which Perkin said should benefit from the trucking industry's tight capacity.Also, Perkin said the fund dropped two airlines, United Continental Holdings Inc and Delta Air Lines Inc, on concerns about their profits and their use of charges such as baggage fees.""If you can't charge the full price to your customer and you have to trick them with all these ancillary items, that's not a good business,"" he added.

3,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani  Dec 9 Logistics services provider UTi Worldwide Inc faces a fresh snag in its attempt to return to growth with the sudden resignation of its chief executive on Monday.UTi shares posted their largest percentage fall in 10 months on Tuesday after the company reported its eighth straight quarterly loss and said Eric Kirchner, its CEO of six years, had resigned.UTi, which acts as a broker between shippers and freight companies, did not give a reason for Kirchner's departure. Company officials declined to take questions about it on a conference call with analysts.""We think Kirchner's departure at such a critical juncture may raise questions about the company's ability to return to growth and reduce costs,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst John Barnes wrote in a note to clients. UTi, which was expected to post a profit two quarters ago,  has been grappling with higher costs related to the implementation of a new service and billing platform.The company has lagged the wider U.S. logistics market this year that boosted results of rivals such as C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc, XPO Logistics Inc and Expeditors International of Washington Inc.Truck tonnage level in October was the second highest on record after August, according to the American Trucking Association. While shares of C.H. Robinson and XPO have jumped about 60 percent and 25 percent in the past year, UTi shares have dropped about 30 percent.Analysts on average were expecting revenues of C.H. Robinson, XPO and Expeditors to rise in the year ending December, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UTi's revenue, however, is forecast to fall 1 percent in its year ending January.Long Beach, California-based UTi's new CEO, Edward Feitzinger, said on Tuesday the company's service problems were largely behind it, but did not say if he expected revenue to pick up in the coming quarters.At Monday's close of $13, UTi traded at 46.3 times forward 12-months earnings estimates - much higher than an average 20.5 times of C.H. Robinson, Expeditors and Hub Group Inc, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.At 252.1 times, XPO was the most expensive of the group.

4,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Navy on Thursday said it was launching a more intensive effort to ensure that any wiring or fuel line problems with its CH-53E and MH-53E heavy-lift helicopters are corrected as quickly and effectively as possible.The Navy first ordered inspections of the Sikorsky Aircraft helicopters in February 2014 to find and fix any sign of the damaged fuel lines and wires that caused a January 2014 crash of an MH-53E Sea Dragon that killed three crew members.But top Navy officials have now ordered a renewed focus on the issues after random checks last month showed that many of the initial inspections had not been thorough, and 70 percent of the 28 aircraft inspected still had discrepancies and problems.The helicopters were built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp and first entered service in the 1980s. ""Correcting the causal factors in the Jan. 8, 2014 MH mishap is paramount to the CH/MH-53 community,"" said Kelly Burdick, a spokeswoman for Naval Air Systems Command, or Navair, the Navy command that oversees aircraft programs. After reviewing the assessment done in mid-January, officials agreed ""that a more intensive effort was warranted to ensure full mitigation of any wiring or fuel line discrepancies can be completed as quickly and effectively as possible,"" Burdick said.Colonel Hank Vanderborght, program director for the CH-53 and MH-53 helicopter programs, raised concerns about the inspections in a 11-page briefing that was first reported by the Virginian-Pilot, a Virginia-based newspaper, on Thursday.""...The risk of cabin fire was not mitigated and the hazard of chafing on fluid-carrying lines and wires was not eliminated,"" Vanderborght wrote. The newspaper also quoted an email from a Marine Corps officer who said, ""We don't need another mishap as a result of chafing wire on a fuel line.""One of the Navy's MH-53E helicopters was forced to land in Kuwait last month after two wires chafed, causing an electrical arc that sparked a small fire, according to the newspaper. Burdick said the Navy was committed to ensuring the safety of the aging helicopters, which are slated to remain in service until the mid- to late-2020s, and any discrepancies are addressed immediately.As of April 2014, the Navy had 152 of the CH-53E Super Stallions, and 28 MH-53E Sea Dragons, according to a Navair website.

Robinson rally lifts transport stocks* Indexes up: Dow 0.4 pct, S&P 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.5 pct   (Updates to close)By Caroline ValetkevitchJune 3 U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, helped by optimism that Greece was close to an agreement to avoid default and as further gains in bond yields lifted financials.The S&P financial index climbed 0.7 percent and was among the day's top sector performers as U.S. benchmark Treasury debt yields jumped to seven-month highs, extending recent gains. Adding to the day's upbeat tone, Greece's international creditors signaled they were ready to compromise to avert a default even as Athens indicated it might skip an IMF loan repayment due this week.""Yields going higher is a net positive for all of the financials. Higher yields on fixed income translate into higher rates and that increases the net interest margin for financials,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.Economic data bolstered the view the Federal Reserve may consider raising interest rates later this year, including reports showing the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April on a drop in imports and private sector jobs in May. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.33 points, or 0.36 percent, to 18,076.27, the S&P 500 gained 4.47 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,114.07 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 22.71 points, or 0.45 percent, to 5,099.23.The Fed, in its Beige Book report, said U.S. economic activity expanded from early April to late May and growth was expected to continue at a ""modest"" to ""moderate"" pace.The consumer discretionary index rose 0.7 percent. Ten-year bond yields have risen about 28 basis points in three days, their biggest rise in a comparable period in nearly two years. While that boosted financials, it weighed on utilities index for a second day. The index was down 1.4 percent.Logistics company C.H. Robinson jumped 5.5 percent to $64.62 and was the biggest daily percentage gainer in the S&P 500. It also lifted the Dow Jones transportation average, which was up 1.2 percent, bouncing back from near correction territory last week.Wendy's rose 3.3 percent to $11.47 after the hamburger chain said it would buy back $1.4 billion of shares, including some from Nelson Peltz's Trian Group, its largest shareholder.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,548 to 1,503, for a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,908 issues rose and 863 fell for a 2.21-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite 151 new highs and 21 new lows.About 6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.2 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

France's president suggested that an agreement was within reach. ""Greece is driving the market sentiment today,"" said Marshall Gause, chief executive officer of Geneva Fund Partners in Denver, Colorado.""As the risk around Greece is starting to significantly reduce, investors are putting back money into U.S. equities.""The market also got a boost from data that showed U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April after surging in March, while companies picked up their hiring in May after a pullback the previous month. Investors have been keeping a keen eye on economic data for clues on the timing of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve - the first in nearly a decade.At 12:31 p.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 61.1 points, or 0.34 percent, at 18,073.04, the S&P 500  was up 2.91 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,112.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 17.17 points, or 0.34 percent, at 5,093.69.The strong employment report pushed U.S. benchmark Treasury debt yields to their highest since November. That weighed on utilities and other dividend paying shares, which tend to compete with bonds as investments.The utilities index fell 1.76 percent, down for a second straight session, and was the biggest loser among the 10 major S&P 500 sectors. Five of the sectors were higher, with the teleservices sector's 0.78 percent rise leading the gains.C.H. Robinson jumped 5.2 percent to $64.44, helping the Dow Jones transportation index gain 1.1 percent and recover from a recent spell of weakness.Synchronoss Technologies' shares jumped 18.8 percent to $50.54 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the software maker was working on a possible sale that could be valued at more than $2 billion.Wendy's rose as much as 5.5 percent to a more than 7-year high of $11.71 after the hamburger chain said it would buy back $1.4 billion of shares, including some from Nelson Peltz's Trian Group, its largest shareholder.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,480 to 1,474, for a 1.00-to-1 ratio on the upside. On the Nasdaq, 1,797 issues rose and 868 fell for a 2.07-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 index showed nine new 52-week highs and four new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 123 new highs and 17 new lows.
