0,"  Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) reported a higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, aided by lower fuel costs and increased fares, and its shares gained more than 3 percent.Delta, the third-largest U.S. airline behind American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), said it would ""significantly improve"" profitability this year by controlling costs and offering more customer amenities.The carrier, which cut its capital spending forecast for 2014 to $2.3 billion from $2.5 billion, said that margins would widen. It forecast an operating margin of 6 percent to 8 percent for the first quarter. That's higher than estimates of 5.4 percent from airline analyst Helane Becker of Cowen & Co and 5.8 percent from Fred Lowrance of Avondale Partners.""The strong earnings reflect not only what Delta has been doing, including investments in its airports and products, but also the fact that the airline has been able to attract and keep more business travelers,"" said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Hudson Crossing LLC in San Francisco.He said Delta was also managing its business so that it sells fewer seats at deep discounts.""Delta is going into 2014 from a very solid position,"" Harteveldt added.Passenger revenue gains at Delta were strongest in the United States and Latin America, helped by holiday travel in the fourth quarter. Corporate ticket revenue rose 7 percent from a year earlier. EXCLUDING ITEMS, PROFIT DOUBLES Profit before one-time items more than doubled in the fourth quarter to $558 million, or 65 cents a share. Analysts on average, were expecting 63 cents, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S.  Net income totaled $8.5 billion, or $9.89 a share, including a noncash gain of $8 billion from a reversal of a tax allowance. A year earlier, Delta earned $7 million, or 1 cent a share, on that basis.Quarterly revenue rose 6 percent to $9.08 billion. Yield, a measure of the average airfare paid per mile flown, rose 4 percent to 17.05 cents.Operating expenses increased 2 percent, while costs for aircraft fuel and related taxes fell 7 percent.

7,"  By John Kemp     LONDON, Jan 22 When Delta Air Lines announced it was buying the Trainer oil refinery from Phillips 66, in April 2012, the U.S. carrier hailed the transaction as ""an innovative approach to managing our largest expense"".     Since then, the company says vertical integration has lowered jet fuel prices in the U.S. Northeast, its home region, and will eventually provide company-specific benefits as the refinery processes more cheap domestic crudes and returns to profitability.     But the jury is still out on Delta's strategy. The refinery remained in the red in 2013, reporting a loss of $116 million. On Tuesday, the airline said the refinery lost $46 million in the fourth quarter.     No other airline has copied Delta in buying a refinery, even though plenty of other refineries are up for sale in Western Europe and on the U.S. East Coast.     It remains unclear whether vertical integration is a more effective solution to the problem of managing airline fuel costs than traditional hedging using futures, options and swap contracts.          RISING FUEL BILLS     Fuel costs are increasingly critical to the profitability of airlines. In 2013, Delta spent nearly $11.5 billion - a third of its operating costs - to buy almost 4 billion gallons of jet fuel.      Jet fuel prices have risen almost five-fold since 2002, becoming the largest operating expense for airlines such as Delta (Table 1).     Demand for jet is growing significantly faster than other refined products. But for refiners, jet is only one relatively minor co-product from plants designed to maximise production of more important fuels like gasoline and diesel.     So as refiners have closed plants on the U.S. East Coast and in Northwest Europe to eliminate excess gasoline output and improve their margins, the squeeze on jet supplies has grown intense, and the fuel is becoming relatively more expensive.     ""Because global demand for jet fuel and related products is increasing at the same time that jet fuel refining capacity is decreasing in the U.S. (particularly in the Northeast), the refining margin reflected in the prices we pay for jet fuel has increased,"" Delta complained in its 2012 annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.     Trainer's closure would have threatened to push jet costs even higher by tightening fuel supplies in the greater New York region. Delta therefore ""acquired the Trainer refinery and related assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in June 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin we are paying"", it explained.          RISK MANAGEMENT     With fuel bills accounting for such a high share of the airline's cost base, managing price risks has become ever more essential.     Like other airlines, Delta has sought to protect itself through active hedging using futures, options, collars and swaps.     The costs of hedging have been large at times, reaching $1.4 billion in 2009, when oil prices unexpectedly collapsed, though of course most of the costs of true hedges should have been offset by reduced operating expenses elsewhere (Table 2).     The question is whether buying Trainer was a cheaper and more effective way of hedging price risks and guaranteeing fuel supplies than relying on traditional hedging programmes and importing fuel from other regions if needed.     Delta paid just $150 million to acquire the refinery and agreed to invest a further $100 million in modernising the plant to maximise jet fuel production. In addition, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Delaware County have provided additional financial assistance to support job retention, investment and economic development.     Delta's investment was ""modest"" and ""equivalent to the list price of (just one) new widebody aircraft,"" the airline's chief executive noted at the time.     Owning the refinery would allow Delta to reduce its annual fuel expense by $300 million and ensure jet fuel availability in the Northeast. ""We expect the Trainer acquisition to be accretive to Delta's earnings, expand our margins, and to fully recover our investment in the first year of operations,"" the company promised in April 2012.          JET MAXIMISATION     In practice, Trainer has struggled to meet expectations. The refinery has reported losses in four of the last five quarters, according to the company's records.     Trainer was badly hit by Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. Even so, the company has repeatedly promised it is about to return to profit, only to record more losses (Table 3).     The company has been reconfiguring the refinery to maximise production of jet fuel and other high-margin distillates. The process should be completed in the first quarter of 2014, when the combined yield of jet and distillates will hit 40 percent of total output.     Delta says its acquisition and reconfiguration of Trainer have already helped lower jet fuel prices by 5 to 10 cents per gallon when compared with heating oil (see page 18 of its investor presentation in December 2013).     Those benefits accrue to all airlines operating out of New York and the rest of the Northeast. But Delta hopes to secure company-specific gains by making Trainer itself profitable. The company makes much of its plans to buy more domestic crude, which is cheaper than imports, as well as making further operational improvements.     Delta wants to capture the cost advantage of processing cheap Bakken crude, trapped in the United States by logistics constraints and a ban on crude oil exports, for itself. Trainer will supply nearly all of Delta's jet fuel needs.     Delta's management insists that buying Trainer has been a success, despite doubts expressed by some outside the company.     ""We continue to get questions as to how do we feel about Trainer,"" Delta president Edward Bastian said at a presentation to investors on Dec. 11. ""Let me be very clear. Trainer has been a great success for Delta. And we are pleased that we made that acquisition.""     ""When we entered the market with Trainer, 40 percent of the jet fuel supply was returned to New York Harbor, and it had an immediate impact on jet fuel prices,"" he added. ""Every cent we save on fuel saved us $40 million a year,"" Bastian said. ""It's well worth the $150 million capital investment we've made in this refinery.""          INTEGRATION VS HEDGING     Buying Trainer has not yielded all the benefits that Delta originally expected. It remains an open question whether vertical integration or using derivatives will be more cost-effective in the long term. But it is notable that no other airline has chosen to follow Delta's lead in this area.     In fact, structural changes in the industry may be reducing the overall need for fuel-price hedging. Delta observes structural changes in aviation have produced a much closer correlation between ticket revenues and fuel costs. Fuel surcharges, the elimination of excess capacity and a disciplined approach to expansion are keeping costs and revenues aligned more closely.     Airlines use hedging to mitigate the impact of short-term rather than long-term changes in fuel prices. Since tickets are only sold up to a year in advance (and most are sold with much shorter maturities), airlines need only to manage price changes lasting for a few months up to a year (the difference between fixed-price ticket sales and variable-price fuel purchases).     Virtually all airline hedging is concentrated in a 12-month window. Airlines assume that if a rise in fuel costs lasts beyond that time frame, it will affect all airlines, and everyone will raise ticket prices.     If fuel charges and the elimination of spare capacity are forcing a closer alignment between fuel prices and ticket prices within the 12-month window, even short-term hedging may be becoming somewhat less critical than before.     Perhaps the best way of thinking about Delta's investment is that the company paid $150 million, and is shouldering some ongoing losses, to keep plenty of jet-making capacity in the Northeast.      But Delta has yet to show that buying Trainer has yielded a competitive advantage that it could not have obtained through more conventional hedging and supply agreements. It may not have cost the company much, but the benefits have been elusive.

12,"  Major U.S. airlines on Monday said cancellations of thousands of flights would hurt first-quarter profit, but some added that revenue would still show improvement.Flight cancellations tend to add to airline costs during the first quarter, when winter storms hit the hardest. Five U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) - said that winter storms had led to more than 78,000 canceled flights among them.Some airlines cited a noticeable increase in their canceled flights tied to bad weather this year, with American Airlines saying its 28,000 cancellations for January and February more than doubled from the year earlier.Delta said that as of the end of January, its cancellations from bad weather had topped all of those for 2013.Delta told a J.P. Morgan investor conference disruption from winter storms hurt revenue for the current quarter by $90 million as it canceled 17,000 flights. The storms dented pretax profit for the quarter by about $55 million, Delta added. The carrier said it expected operating margin, a measure of income to costs, of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent for the first quarter, compared with a prior view of 6 percent to 8 percent.Cancellations can help unit revenue, an important measure of pricing power and how full planes are, as more travelers are put on remaining flights.Delta said unit revenue would rise 3 percent to 4 percent in the current quarter, compared with its prior view of a 2 percent to 4 percent increase. American added it still expected unit revenue to rise about 2 percent to 4 percent in the period. United said it halted 23,000 flights tied to weather in the first two months of 2014. The company had disclosed last month that disruption from the storms would hurt first-quarter unit revenue.JetBlue told the same conference it canceled nearly 4,000 flights because of the winter storms, and Southwest said it halted about 6,500 flights in January and February. JetBlue forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in first quarter unit revenue, while Southwest outlined expected growth of 3 percent.Cowen & Co airline analyst Helane Becker cut her first quarter profit estimate for Delta to 30 cents a share from 32 cents in a note to clients, citing the updated outlook. She raised her quarterly estimate for Southwest to 17 cents a share from 14 cents, but also cut her estimate for JetBlue for the period to 6 cents a share from 13 cents.Shares of the major U.S. airlines ended mixed, with Delta down 0.5 percent to $35.17 and United off 2.3 percent to $46.66. American was off 0.2 percent to $38.96 and JetBlue fell 1.8 percent to $8.87.

17,"   By Karen Jacobs | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) has been making inroads in the dogfight over the lucrative market for business travel between New York and London, but the newly merged American Airlines Group (AAL.O) is fighting back.Delta is hoping to attract customers through its new partnership with Virgin Atlantic, known for its high-tech and non-traditional approach to flying, and its own boosted profile in New York, where it expanded flights and renovated terminals.Now under new management, American is trying to bounce back from years of under-investment and market share losses, drawing from its recent merger with U.S. Airways.The New York-London route is popular with Wall Street executives who are willing to pay for the priciest seats and who often travel at the last minute. Eager for their business, airlines are using their best planes on the route and investing in upgrades such as satellite WiFi and seats that turn into flat beds.The alliances provide more flights under one banner, and better links to other U.S. and European cities. That convenience can win over corporate accounts, locking in lucrative business travelers.""This is a battle royale,"" said George Hamlin, an aviation consultant in Fairfax, Virginia. ""This is about who gets the greatest number of the passengers who pay the most money.""American and joint venture partner British Airways (ICAG.L) have an estimated 59 percent share of seats flown between the United States and London's Heathrow airport, compared with about 24 percent for Delta and Virgin, and United Continental Holdings Inc's (UAL.N) 14 percent share, according to a U.S. government filing by Delta and Virgin.IMPORTANCE OF NEW YORK London is the top international destination from New York and business-class fares can reach into the thousands of dollars, making the route one of the most profitable.For example, the highest possible business-class fare between John F. Kennedy airport and London Heathrow on any given day is about $18,200 round trip, according to Nick Fleetwood, a manager at Cook Travel in New York.While the airlines don't disclose New York-London revenue, their Atlantic routes, which include destinations other than London, account for significant income. Delta's passenger revenue from Atlantic service rose 3 percent to $5.7 billion last year, and the region supplied about 15 percent of its operating revenue. American's 2013 Atlantic revenue rose 10 percent to $3.8 billion, accounting for about 14 percent of overall revenue.Delta says corporate customer interest has increased since its Virgin venture formally began in January. While Virgin's hip image and planes fitted with mood lighting and futuristic bars are part of the lure, Delta is also aiming to win business travelers who previously shunned it because of its weak schedule to London Heathrow.Delta offered just three nonstop daily flights between New York's JFK airport and Heathrow before the tie-up. Starting next month, its venture with Virgin will operate nine nonstops between the New York area and London, and aim for flight times that are more convenient for business travelers.That compares with 17 daily flights between the New York area and London from American Airlines and British Airways.Delta-Virgin customers will also have greater choice flying to London from other parts of the United States as the two airlines fill holes in each other's route maps. ""Delta prior to this merger was a player but not to the extent that it will be able to compete now,"" said Goran Gligorovic, executive vice president with Omega World Travel, an agency that handles corporate contracts with airlines. ""The more reach an airline has, either with alliances, code-shares or its own service, the more interesting partner it becomes for any corporation,"" he said.FENDING OFF THE CHALLENGE American must work through labor problems, complete gate divestitures and meld computer systems following its exit from bankruptcy and merger with US Airways late last year. Now the world's largest carrier by traffic, American will refresh its fleet with hundreds of new planes over the next few years.American has put its flagship aircraft on the New York to London route: a new extended range Boeing 777-300 that has separate cabins for first and business class with fully reclining seats, as well as coach seats with power outlets and USB jacks. Late last year, American took an older 777 used on the route out of service to upgrade it with lie-flat seating, citing a need to be competitive with the Delta-Virgin venture.Once the top carrier at both LaGuardia and JFK airports, American lost its lead over the past decade. Meanwhile, Delta added flights and upgraded facilities at Kennedy and LaGuardia, United merged with Continental and built a fortress hub in Newark and JetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) expanded at JFK.American is now second behind Delta in passenger market share at LaGuardia, and ranks third at JFK, behind JetBlue and Delta, according to data for 2013 from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Delta is seen as a prime customer for a potential revamp of the Airbus A330, which the European manufacturer is considering updating with new engines to help airlines reduce fuel bills. Delta bought 10 current-generation A330s last year.Airbus has not said whether it plans to go ahead with the ""A330neo"" but is expected to take a decision later this year and interest from Delta could be decisive, industry sources say.However, Delta, which tends to shy away from radically new models in order to reduce technical and financial risks, could expand its fleet of existing models of the Boeing 777, they add. Delta has 18 next-generation Boeing 787s on order.Delta operates 16 747-400s and 74 767-300s, aviation news and statistics provider Flightglobal reported last month. While Boeing and Airbus are playing up double-digit percentage reductions in fuel costs in their newest models such as the 787 and the A350, Delta typically prefers to buy aircraft toward the end of their production cycle when prices are lower.Anderson told Reuters in an interview last year that Delta would continue its policy of waiting for jets to prove themselves before placing orders.He did not rule out expanding the airline's order for Boeing 787s, inherited from its 2008 takeover of Northwest Airlines, but called on Boeing to reduce prices to compete against the A330, which Delta had helped to launch in the United States.The A330-300 sells for $246 million at list prices, compared with $289 million for the comparable Boeing 787-10, but industry sources say the A330 is typically sold at well below half price since the 20-year-old design has a dwindling sales backlog.(Reporting by Karen Jacobs in Washington; Additional reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)",2014-04-03,DAL,"Thu Apr 3, 2014 | 5:22pm EDT",Delta says may buy up to 50 wide-body jets to update fleet,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-delta-planes-idUSBREA3225L20140403?type=companyNews

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) because it has longer runways, Delta spokeswoman Leslie Scott said. ""It wasn't traveling fast when it happened,"" Scott said. ""They landed normally at JFK, but once they were taxiing to the gate, the aircraft exited the taxi-way and ended up in the grassy area."" There were no reports of injuries, and passengers were disembarked and shuttled to a terminal, Scott said. The plane left at about 6:45 p.m. Eastern Time (22:45 GMT) and landed at JFK at about 9 p.m. Eastern Time. A cockpit indicator signalled a problem with the hydraulic system, which controls multiple systems, including the brakes, as the plane was descending into the New York area, Scott said.

28,"   By Karen Jacobs  Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) reported a higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on Wednesday and gave a strong outlook for the current period, sending its shares up nearly 5 percent.The carrier forecast that operating margin, a measure of income to costs, and passenger unit revenue would both expand in the current period.Delta ""has been outperforming on the revenue front and costs are being kept in line,"" said Kevin Crissey, an airline analyst with Skyline Research.Delta, the third-largest U.S. airline by revenue behind American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), said gains in corporate market share and fees for items such as seat upgrades and priority boarding would bolster the second quarter.In the first quarter, strong demand helped overcome the negative effect of 17,000 flight cancellations from winter storms that shaved $90 million from revenue. The company benefited from lower fuel and plane maintenance costs. Net income was $213 million, or 25 cents a share, up from $7 million, or 1 cent a share, for the year-earlier first period.Excluding items such as fuel-hedge contract adjustments and charges for fleet changes, profit was 33 cents a share, compared with 29 cents expected by analysts on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Quarterly revenue rose 5 percent to $8.92 billion. Yield, a measure of the average airfare paid per mile flown, rose 1 percent to 17.21 cents. Passenger revenue per available seat mile, or unit revenue, rose 3 percent to 14.24 cents. Operating expenses were roughly flat in the quarter. Costs for fuel and related taxes fell 3 percent and expenses tied to maintenance of aircraft dropped 9 percent.Atlanta-based Delta bolstered revenue by charging more for seats with greater leg room, replacing 50-seat jets with larger, more cost-efficient planes while buying a refinery to help reduce fuel expenses. Delta ""continues to get higher yields from attracting more corporate travelers,"" said S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Jim Corridore.Delta said it expected an operating margin of 14 to 16 percent for the second quarter, better than the year-earlier period's 11 percent. That compared with Crissey's expectation of 12 to 14 percent.The carrier forecast that unit revenue would rise in the mid-single-digit percentage range in the second period.

30,"  NEW YORK Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said on Wednesday it expects its 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, to be profitable in the second quarter of 2014.The refinery, run by Delta subsidiary Monroe Energy LLC, produced 50 percent distillate refined products in March, which includes diesel and jet fuel, after first-quarter work on one of the refinery's crude units, Delta's chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said on a conference call.A 90,000-bpd crude unit at Trainer underwent planned maintenance in January.The modifications ""will yield a higher level of jet and diesel distillates going forward and improve the profitability of Trainer,"" Delta said in its earnings release on Wednesday.In addition to lower refinery throughput because of the planned work, Delta said Trainer incurred a $41 million loss for the first quarter ""as a result of the same lower market fuel prices that lowered Delta's overall fuel spend."" The refinery's profitability also ""was negatively impacted by an increase in Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) expense,"" Delta said in its earnings release.RINs, or ethanol blending credits, are paper credits used to meet quotas for blending biofuel into gasoline and diesel.The company did not specify the RINs cost in the first quarter, but officials said on Wednesday they would ""continue to work with the EPA to reduce this burden."" The cost of the RINS is at the heart of an ongoing battle between refiners seeking to get the Environmental Protection Agency to ease the rules and ethanol proponents hoping to keep them in place.A group of refiners last year successfully convinced regulators that ethanol blending capacity had hit its peak. In November, the EPA explicitly recognized the so-called blend wall, proposing to cut corn ethanol blending quotas from 14.4 billion gallons to about 13 billion gallons for 2014.A final rule is expected to be completed by the end of June.Delta's share price was up 4.6 percent at $36.58 at 1:21 p.m. (1821 GMT) on Wednesday.(Reporting by Robert Gibbons; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-04-23,DAL,"Wed Apr 23, 2014 | 1:40pm EDT",Delta Air expects Trainer refinery to post profit in second quarter,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-delta-air-lines-refinery-idUSBREA3M1A920140423?type=companyNews

The airline, 51 percent owned by its British billionaire founder Richard Branson, reported a 51 million pound ($85.6 million) group pretax loss for the year to Dec. 31. Virgin changed its financial reporting period last year but calculates the comparable 2012 loss would have been 102 million pounds.Delta bought a 49 percent stake in Virgin last year and started operating a new joint venture with the British airline on Jan. 1, which Kreeger said would help to push Virgin's bottom line into the black by attracting more U.S. customers. COST SAVINGS Also playing roles in the pick-up this year will be Virgin Atlantic Little Red, the company's short-haul operation between London Heathrow and three other British airports, and new aircraft with increased fuel efficiency.The company is due to receive its first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner this year and has 16 on order. The improvement in Virgin Atlantic's losses last year was driven by more than 40 million pounds of cost savings, Kreeger said, citing significant improvements in fuel management.Kreeger dismissed concerns about a European Commission examination of foreign holdings in European airlines, saying that the Delta deal had already undergone regulatory scrutiny.Virgin, which like other established carriers has suffered in recent years from soaring fuel costs, increased competition and the global economic downturn, is playing catch-up with several other European long-haul carriers.Transatlantic rival British Airways, part of IAG, and Air France-KLM both returned to profitability in 2013.""One of the reasons the company has been a little slower to rebound was the delays we saw in the delivery of 787s,"" Kreeger said, referring to an aircraft order made in 2007.

The Delta CEO's comments come as the newly elected No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, threw the future of the bank in doubt by saying he opposes renewing its charter when it expires at the end of September.Ex-Im helped finance $37.4 billion worth of U.S. exports in 2013. Scrapping the bank would be a blow to Boeing BA.N, Caterpillar CAT.N, General Electric GE.N and other U.S. companies that rely on Ex-Im financing to make sales in export markets where commercial lending is scarce. The bank is the U.S. government export credit agency and is intended to provide loans and loan guarantees to support exports. While Delta has called for reforms at the bank, firms that benefit from its export finance support have launched a lobbying push to reauthorize the institution.The Delta chief is due to testify on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee, where Chairman Jeb Hensarling is also an Ex-Im skeptic. Anderson is due to tell Hensarling's panel that competition among airlines for international passengers is skewed in favor of carriers that are backed by their home governments, and that Ex-Im makes matters worse. ""That fight is heavily tilted in favor of foreign airlines receiving government subsidies, both from those airlines' home governments, and, amazingly, from our own,"" Anderson said in testimony prepared for delivery on Wednesday.Ex-Im loan guarantees to Emirates, the airline based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are equivalent to $20 million per plane, effectively giving the carrier one free plane for every eight new planes it buys, he said.     Anderson said reauthorization of the bank's charter could be a vehicle for reforms.First, he urged banning financing of widebody aircraft, such as Boeing's 777, to airlines that are owned by foreign governments or that are capable of obtaining credit in private markets. Delta also wants the bank to disclose fully the details of its widebody plane financing, including information on the routes on which those aircraft will be deployed. Anderson also called on the bank to conduct analyses of the impact on the U.S. economy and air travel industry of all widebody aircraft transactions and to allow interested parties to comment on each transaction.

""That fight is heavily tilted in favor of foreign airlines receiving government subsidies, both from those airlines' home governments, and, amazingly, from our own,"" Anderson said in testimony prepared for delivery on Wednesday.Ex-Im loan guarantees to Emirates, the airline based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are equivalent to $20 million per plane, effectively giving the carrier one free plane for every eight new planes it buys, he said.Anderson said reauthorization of the bank's charter could be a vehicle for reforms.First, he urged banning financing of widebody aircraft, such as Boeing's 777, to airlines that are owned by foreign governments or that are capable of obtaining credit in private markets. Delta also wants the bank to disclose fully the details of its widebody plane financing, including information on the routes on which those aircraft will be deployed.Anderson also called on the bank to conduct analyses of the impact on the U.S. economy and air travel industry of all widebody aircraft transactions and to allow interested parties to comment on each transaction.

62,"  CARACAS, July 7 Delta Air Lines will run only one flight a week to Venezuela instead of one a day because of difficulties  repatriating revenue through the country's exchange controls,  the company said on Monday.Venezuela requires airlines to sell tickets in local bolivar currency, but carriers say they are not receiving approval from the exchange control board to turn those earnings back into dollars.The dispute has led nearly a dozen airlines including American Airlines to reduce or suspend service. The International Airline Transport Association (IATA) says the industry has the equivalent of $4 billion trapped in the South American country.""Effective August 1st, 2014, Delta Air Lines will reduce its daily service between Atlanta and Caracas to a weekly service, operating from Atlanta to Caracas on Saturdays and returning from Caracas to Atlanta on Sundays,"" Delta said in a statement. A spokeswoman said in an email that ""the debt created over the past several years due to currency issues made us take a business decision to minimize our risk."" The IATA last month said the Venezuelan government was being ""wilfully irresponsible"" in preventing airlines from repatriating ticket revenue.American Airlines cut weekly flights between the United States and Venezuela to just 10 from 48 previously as of July 2, with Miami now the only direct U.S. destination. President Nicolas Maduro has threatened to kick out airlines that halt flights or restrict service. He recently said a cut  in availability of foreign flights was because airlines were using more of their fleet to fly to Brazil for the World Cup.The government in recent weeks had said it would allow airlines to repatriate revenue at a rate of around 50 bolivars per dollar, from roughly 11 bolivars currently. But the local airlines association this month said that change had been put on hold indefinitely.

Other U.S. and European carriers have said they will not fly to Israel until further notice.The FAA on Tuesday said it told U.S. carriers they were prohibited from flying to or from Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv for up to 24 hours, citing ""the potentially hazardous situation created by the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza."" On Tuesday a rocket had hit about a mile from the airport. Anderson said Delta made its decision ""decision wholly independent"" of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. ""We will not allow a flight to be dispatched over Iran, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan or North Korea,"" he told CNBC. ""We make this decision wholly independent of any geopolitical or regulatory mandate.""White House deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken on Wednesday said he had not heard from the FAA yet about whether it would lift the ban or any other details about its plan for flights in the region.   ""They've been working very closely with Israeli authorities overnight to see if the concerns raised yesterday could be alleviated and they could lift the notice but I haven't heard from them this morning,"" Blinken told CNN in an interview.Israel has rejected the decision to bar flights to its airport. ""Our airport is safe. Our airport is secure. And we hope the American carriers will be flying to Israel soon,"" Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in an interview on MSNBC on Wednesday. The decision to halt flights to Israel follows the downing last week of a Malaysia Airlines jet over Ukraine with nearly 300 aboard.

It struck a similar deal with Phillips 66 (PSX.N) to swap Trainer's refined products for more jet fuel. The SEC filing made no mention of another agreement from 2012: a three-year deal under which BP was to supply crude oil to the refinery.On Monday, Monroe announced that privately-held midstream company Bridger LLC would supply 65,000 bpd of North Dakota Bakken crude to its refinery, helping it reduce its reliance on more costly imports.

77,"   By Anna Louie Sussman | NEW YORK, July 25  NEW YORK, July 25 Delta Air Lines Inc's  refining unit has chartered a U.S.-flagged oil tanker for the first time, allowing it to tap directly into cheap Texas shale oil as the company overhauls its supply strategy.Monroe Energy LLC, the Delta subsidiary that runs the airline's 165,000 barrel per day (bpd) Trainer refinery, has time-chartered the 330,000-barrel MR Seabulk Arctic, a Jones Act vessel built in 1998, for two years beginning in August, according to sources familiar with the deal. A Delta spokesman confirmed the charter but provided no further details.It has an option to switch to a newly build ship in 2016 for an additional three years. Seabulk Tankers Inc, an indirect,  wholly-owned subsidiary of SEACOR Holdings Inc that owns the Seabulk Arctic, has three tankers on order from General Dynamics's NASSCO shipyard in San Diego, the first of which will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2016.The ship was previously chartered to leading U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp, which sources say has moved to reduce its exposure to the Jones Act shipping market, a once-quiet niche that has surged in recent years on growing demand to ship Texas shale crude to East Coast refiners.Monroe is paying upward of $80,000 per day for the Seabulk Arctic, a comparatively cheap rate that results from its age, higher fuel consumption and the longer duration of the contract. In contrast. Exxon Mobile Corp agreed to a record $120,000 a day charter in May. After dropping the Seabulk Arctic charter, Valero will no longer have any domestic tonnage, sources said. A spokesman for Valero did not immediately reply to requests for comment.TRADING OVERHAUL?  Ships moving between U.S. ports are required to be Jones Act compliant - U.S.-flagged, U.S.-built, and U.S.-crewed - making them about three times more expensive than international vessels.Still, spot rates have doubled in three years as gushing shale wells in Texas depress Gulf Coast light crude prices, making the two-week journey to the East Coast more profitable than imports from the North Sea or Nigeria.The Seabulk Arctic charter is the latest indication that Monroe is taking a new tack in its trading operations two years after Delta bought the Trainer plant, southwest of Philadelphia. At that time Delta sealed deals with BP and Phillips 66  to supply crude to the refinery and swap refined fuels for jet fuel.

79,"   By Anna Louie Sussman | NEW YORK, July 31  NEW YORK, July 31 Delta Air Lines Inc is exploring constructing a 5-mile pipeline to ship oil from a new crude-by-rail hub near Philadelphia to its Trainer refinery, a move that would allow it to scale back use of costly barges.Currently, crude being railed into the Eddystone terminal makes its way to nearby refineries on the Delaware River via barges capable of carrying around 150,000 barrels, which adds around $1 per barrel of transport costs. The project is in the discussion stage, said a spokesman for Delta. Its Monroe Energy subsidiary has been holding meetings with local community groups in recent weeks.The proposed underground pipeline would transport some 65,000 barrels per day of crude from Eddystone, one of dozens of new terminals being built around the country to unload mile-long oil trains from North Dakota, to the 165,000 barrel per day (bpd) Trainer refinery. The Eddystone terminal has throughput capacity of around 80,000 bpd and received its first train in May. It is currently operating at around 65,000 bpd. It could double capacity by the end of next year. A pipeline, if built, would be Delta's latest effort to improve the economics and flexibility of the refinery it bought two years ago, making it easier to tap into the shale oil boom.Earlier in July, Monroe Energy chartered a Jones Act ship for transporting domestic crude for the first time, allowing it to directly tap into Texas shale. It also this month signed a deal for midtream company Bridger LLC to supply it 65,000 bpd of North Dakota Bakken crude, largely by rail.

84,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  U.S. airlines stocks fell on Wednesday after Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) trimmed its operating margin forecast and reported that international passenger traffic lagged slightly in August, heightening concerns that other U.S. carriers might encounter similar headwinds. While Delta's August performance was relatively robust, Delta shares were down 5.2 percent at $38.79 in midday trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) shares were down 3.3 percent at $39.16 on the Nasdaq, United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) stock fell about 2.3 percent at $48.83.""It's still a very strong performance,"" said CRT Capital Group analyst Michael Derchin. ""The market tends to overreact.""  At a conference organized by Cowen and Co on Wednesday, Delta said it expected operating margins of 15 percent to 16 percent in the third quarter, down from guidance of 15 percent to 17 percent it gave in July. Analysts said the change likely stemmed from Delta's notching down its passenger unit revenue forecast to 2 percent to 3 percent growth in the third quarter from 2 percent to 4 percent growth forecast earlier.Separately, the Atlanta-based airline said it filled only 88.7 percent of its seats on transatlantic flights this August, compared with 91.5 percent last year. Its U.S. load factor rose, however, to 87.2 percent from 85.3 percent a year earlier.

85,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | Sept 3  Sept 3 U.S. airlines stocks fell on Wednesday after Delta Air Lines trimmed its operating margin forecast and reported that international passenger traffic lagged slightly in August, heightening concerns that other U.S. carriers might encounter similar headwinds.While Delta's August performance was relatively robust, Delta shares were down 5.2 percent at $38.79 in midday trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. American Airlines Group Inc shares were down 3.3 percent at $39.16 on the Nasdaq, United Continental Holdings stock fell about 2.3 percent at $48.83.""It's still a very strong performance,"" said CRT Capital Group analyst Michael Derchin. ""The market tends to overreact."" At a conference organized by Cowen and Co on Wednesday, Delta said it expected operating margins of 15 percent to 16 percent in the third quarter, down from guidance of 15 percent to 17 percent it gave in July.Analysts said the change likely stemmed from Delta's notching down its passenger unit revenue forecast to 2 percent to 3 percent growth in the third quarter from 2 percent to 4 percent growth forecast earlier. Separately, the Atlanta-based airline said it filled only 88.7 percent of its seats on transatlantic flights this August, compared with 91.5 percent last year. Its U.S. load factor rose, however, to 87.2 percent from 85.3 percent a year earlier. Other U.S. carriers have yet to announce August traffic, and concern about empty seats on flights across the Atlantic and to Latin America may be putting pressure on their performance, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Joseph DeNardi.""[There is] excess capacity in the international market,"" he said.Some investors also may be apprehensive about the impact that the Ebola virus and Middle East tension could have on air travel, Derchin said.

94,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Department of Transportation said on Tuesday it is looking into a complaint that Delta Airlines Inc used ""unfair and deceptive practices"" to block development of a second major airport near Atlanta.The agency's action comes in response to a complaint filed by county commissioners and a private group trying to develop commercial air service at Silver Comet Field, a small airport about 40 miles from Atlanta. The DOT also received a letter opposing the plan from newly elected county commissioners due to take office in January. The DOT action is not a formal investigation, as requested by airport proponents. The agency told Reuters it is ""looking into the matter"" after receiving the complaint in a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx last week.The developments, which have not been previously reported, are the latest in a long-running dispute over efforts to create an alternative to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.Atlanta, the No. 9 U.S. metropolitan area, is the only one of the top 10 without at least one secondary airport, according to Census Bureau and Federal Aviation Administration data.Last October, the Paulding County Board of Commissioners said it planned to bring commercial air service to Silver Comet Field, in a county northwest of the city. In 2012 it signed a deal to develop airport infrastructure with Propeller Investments, a New York-based private equity firm. Allegiant Travel Co , a low-cost carrier, has said it intends to serve Silver Comet Field. Delta has long opposed a second commercial airport in the Atlanta area. Chief Executive Richard Anderson has said it would divide investment and ""ultimately be an economic and community failure."" Atlanta's mayor has also opposed the development.In the letter to Foxx, Paulding County Commission Chairman David Austin and Robert Aaronson, Chairman of Propeller Airports and a former senior official at FAA and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said Delta wants to preserve its dominance in Atlanta.They said Delta is ""interfering"" with efforts to develop low-cost air service around Atlanta, even though the Silver Comet plan has been ""endorsed by Paulding County, the State of Georgia and the FAA."" Delta's actions ""are harming consumers and stifling economic development in the region,"" they said in the letter.Paulding County and Propeller officials said, that since the agreement was signed last October, a series of incidents has stalled the project. These include lawsuits challenging the development brought be country residents through an Atlanta law firm did not charge them legal fees.A detailed chronicle of events filed with the DOT complaint letter also notes break-ins at the homes of a state representative whose district includes Paulding County, and the county commission chairman, who support the project.In a separate letter last week, three newly elected members of the five-member Paulding County Board of Commissioners asked Foxx and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta to halt commercialization of the airport.  The members, who take office in January, said the current county board ""conspired behind closed doors"" to start air service at Silver Comet, despite objection by residents who voted in three ""anti-commercialization"" candidates last May.Delta said its objections are shared by local property owners, environmental groups and labor unions. The airline     declined to comment on the legal backing of local residents who oppose the airport expansion.""The proposal is a waste of taxpayer dollars, violates the city's restrictions on the land, and would siphon off increasingly scarce federal funding that's more needed at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,"" Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said. ""Metro Atlanta is best served by a single, strong airport at Hartsfield-Jackson,"" which has enough room for new airlines to being service, he added. Delta has agreed to work with the airport to accommodate new entrants if necessary.""

100,"  PARIS/SEATTLE European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) has won a crucial order worth roughly $14 billion at list prices from Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) for 50 long-haul, wide-bodied jets, three people familiar with the matter said.The order, to be split between the all-new A350-900 and a recently announced revamp of the current-generation A330, follows a closely fought competition with Boeing (BA.N).Airbus emerged as the front-runner in part after it became clear its revamped A330neo could be delivered earlier than Boeing's temporarily sold-out 787 Dreamliner, one of the people said.Airbus and Delta declined to comment.""This is bad news for Boeing on a number of fronts,"" said Leeham Co analyst Scott Hamilton, who first reported the deal.""They had offered some 777s as a stopgap, so this does not help 777 production. It is also a valuable endorsement for the A330neo,"" he said.  The A330neo is an upgraded version of Airbus's most profitable wide-bodied jet, the A330, with new engines to make it more fuel efficient.Airbus had previously won 127 orders or commitments. Delta said earlier this year it was looking to buy as many as 50 wide-bodied jets to replace aging Boeing 747-400 and 767-300ER planes. The carrier said it was considering the Airbus A330, A350 as well as Boeing's 777 and 787 models.It ordered 10 current-generation A330s last year.Airbus sales chief John Leahy predicted after launching the A330neo at July's Farnborough Airshow that it would benefit  Delta, which already profitably operated the A330. But Boeing has said the 1990s core design is no match for its newer 787.

101,"  (Adds analyst quote, details)PARIS/SEATTLE Nov 20 European planemaker Airbus  has won a crucial order worth roughly $14 billion at list prices from Delta Air Lines for 50 long-haul, wide-bodied jets, three people familiar with the matter said.The order, to be split between the all-new A350-900 and a recently announced revamp of the current-generation A330, follows a closely fought competition with Boeing.Airbus emerged as the front-runner in part after it became clear its revamped A330neo could be delivered earlier than Boeing's temporarily sold-out 787 Dreamliner, one of the people said.Airbus and Delta declined to comment. ""This is bad news for Boeing on a number of fronts,"" said Leeham Co analyst Scott Hamilton, who first reported the deal.""They had offered some 777s as a stopgap, so this does not help 777 production. It is also a valuable endorsement for the A330neo,"" he said.The A330neo is an upgraded version of Airbus's most profitable wide-bodied jet, the A330, with new engines to make it more fuel efficient. Airbus had previously won 127 orders or commitments.Delta said earlier this year it was looking to buy as many as 50 wide-bodied jets to replace ageing Boeing 747-400 and 767-300ER planes. The carrier said it was considering the Airbus A330, A350 as well as Boeing's 777 and 787 models. It ordered 10 current-generation A330s last year.Airbus sales chief John Leahy predicted after launching the A330neo at July's Farnborough Airshow that it would benefit  Delta, which already profitably operated the A330. But Boeing has said the 1990s core design is no match for its newer 787.Hamilton added that Airbus would also take heart from the fact that it had sold the all-new A350 to Delta, whose chief executive Richard Anderson has said he prefers established models with less maintenance risk and lower purchase costs.""It is the first time since bankruptcy that Delta has bought a brand-new airplane model,"" Hamilton said.

105,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Saundra Amrhein  A group of Delta Air Lines pilots seeking to replace the current pilots' union at the U.S. carrier are struggling to win enough support.    The Delta Pilots Association (DPA) claims that nearly half of the airline’s 12,000 pilots have at some time in the past four years signed cards backing it to be their union for collective bargaining with management. But under U.S. labor law, many of the cards – a third or more – are invalid because they weren’t signed in the past 12 months, DPA said.    The group is trying to oust the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which has represented pilots at the carrier since 1940. To take ALPA’s place, DPA would need more than 50 percent of the pilot workforce to sign valid cards within a 12-month period to trigger an election through the National Mediation Board, during which all of Delta's pilots would vote to determine which union should represent them.""The longer time goes, the harder it seems to become,"" said Amie Howard, a first officer who volunteers for DPA. ""I think we need to get a little more creative... We've got a contract coming up. Now's (the) perfect time.""DPA says the number of people it has signed up has slowed since 2012 contract talks. Negotiations for the next contract can begin in April 2015. ""We're kind of fighting apathy,"" said Tim Caplinger, who founded DPA in 2010 and is also a first officer. Still, he said he was hopeful of making a breakthrough in the coming months.     ALPA, which also represents United Airlines pilots and 28 smaller pilot groups, says that its size gives it wide impact and that few pay attention to DPA.     Delta declined to comment.  DPA organizers say they will push Delta more aggressively to share recent financial gains with workers and have accused ALPA of being cozy with Delta management, a charge ALPA rejects.      ""When our interests are aligned (with Delta's), we link our arms with our management,"" said Captain Mike Donatelli, the leading Delta representative in ALPA.

107,"  Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said on Thursday it expects to boost pretax profit by 11 percent to at least $5 billion next year, helped by falling jet fuel prices and rising revenue.Speaking at its investor conference, the Atlanta-based carrier projected a net $1.7 billion benefit in 2015 from fuel-price declines, but said that includes a loss of $1.2 billion on its fuel hedges caused by the recent sharp drop in fuel prices.Delta shares rose 4.8 percent to $48.43 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.The nation's third-largest carrier by traffic is continuing to rein in other costs. It has cut debt by nearly $10 billion in the last six years, to an estimated $7.2 billion by the end of 2014, and expects next year's debt level will fall to less than $6 billion, greatly reducing interest expense. Delta has slowed the growth of non-fuel expenses to 0.3 percent this year from 4.6 percent in 2012. It expects the growth to rise less than 2 percent in 2015. Delta said it also will cut costs by retiring its Boeing (BA.N) 747s and older 757 and 767 models. Delta recently ordered 25 Airbus (AIR.PA) A330neos and 25 A350-900s, which it says will produce a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction in seats versus 747s and allow it to reduce per-seat operating costs by more than 20 percent.     Delta's overall capacity will increase just 2 percent next year, including a 3 percent increase in domestic capacity, the airline said. Delta expects to increase revenue with several initiatives, including a new slate of fare categories it introduced on Monday. The new five-class structure adds ""basic economy"" aimed at travelers looking for low-cost carrier service.

116,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines formally launched bids Monday to wrest control of a key slot in Tokyo's Haneda Airport from Delta Air Lines as part of a fight among the carriers to stake out a greater presence in Asia.The two airlines have lobbied the U.S. Department of Transportation for months to rescind Delta's right to land at the airport in one of four daily times, or slots, allotted to U.S. carriers by an international agreement between the United States and Japan. Last month, the regulator agreed to review the situation, specifying Jan. 5 as the deadline for carriers to bid formally for the slot.Monday's applications by American and Hawaiian reflect the larger battle taking place for service to Asia. If either wins the slot, competition would increase over U.S. travelers to the region, where Delta and United Airlines are currently the leading U.S. carriers.American and Hawaiian allege that the incumbent, which won the right to fly from Seattle to Haneda in 2013, has underused the slot, planning limited winter service barely enough to prevent the slot from reverting to the regulator. They say they would serve Haneda more frequently than Delta and give U.S. travelers more options, with American vying to fly from Los Angeles and Hawaiian petitioning to fly from Kona International Airport in Hawaii.Delta earlier responded to the campaign by asking the Department of Transportation on Dec. 22 to drop its review.

117,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Jan 5 American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines formally launched bids Monday to wrest control of a key slot in Tokyo's Haneda Airport from Delta Air Lines  as part of a fight among the carriers to stake out a greater presence in Asia.The two airlines have lobbied the U.S. Department of Transportation for months to rescind Delta's right to land at the airport in one of four daily times, or slots, allotted to U.S. carriers by an international agreement between the United States and Japan. Last month, the regulator agreed to review the situation, specifying Jan. 5 as the deadline for carriers to bid formally for the slot.Monday's applications by American and Hawaiian reflect the larger battle taking place for service to Asia. If either wins the slot, competition would increase over U.S. travelers to the region, where Delta and United Airlines are currently the leading U.S. carriers.American and Hawaiian allege that the incumbent, which won the right to fly from Seattle to Haneda in 2013, has underused the slot, planning limited winter service barely enough to prevent the slot from reverting to the regulator. They say they would serve Haneda more frequently than Delta and give U.S. travelers more options, with American vying to fly from Los Angeles and Hawaiian petitioning to fly from Kona International Airport in Hawaii.Delta earlier responded to the campaign by asking the Department of Transportation on Dec. 22 to drop its review. The petition said Delta is in ""full compliance"" with the conditions of the slot order, adding that the regulator gave it the slot ""indefinitely"" under those terms without specifying that it could revoke the grant if it so chose. In a testimony included with American's application, its Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Nocella wrote, ""Addressing the lack of any American service at all to Haneda is critical to American's Asia presence, enhancing our network to be competitive with United and Delta, and giving the traveling public meaningful choices.""""Gaining access to Haneda heads the list of American's top international priorities,"" he added.

A simple majority is enough to require the board to act. The federal agency is expected to order an election within four to six weeks, the union said.A vote to join the IAM could bring tough bargaining to the Atlanta-based carrier. Delta workers lack union representation, except for pilots and dispatchers, bucking the norm in one of the most unionized U.S. industries, government data show.

If flight attendants unionize, no dues would be paid until they ratified a new contract, IAM spokesman James Carlson said, adding that the benefits of a union-backed contract would far outweigh any costs.A ballot is likely to give flight attendants the option of joining the IAM, writing in a union candidate or opting against a union, Carlson said.

121,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  With plummeting oil prices expected to cut airlines' costs by billions of dollars, Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said Tuesday that it will channel the savings toward debt reduction and returning more cash to shareholders.The Atlanta-based carrier expects to reduce spending by at least $2 billion in 2015 thanks to the oil glut, which has driven down global prices by more than 58 percent since June, executives said in a conference call. Fuel is the largest variable cost for airlines, often representing a third or more of their total operating expenses.Delta said it likely will apply the savings toward its adjusted net debt, which tallied at $7.3 billion at the fourth quarter's end. Also on the table is giving more cash back to investors if its board approves, which would come on the heels of $575 million returned to shareholders last quarter, Chief Executive Richard Anderson said in a conference call.""It's painting a very positive outlook for the industry for 2015,"" CRT Capital Group analyst Michael Derchin said, referring to both the carrier's outlook and its quarterly earnings, which exceeded expectations even with a net loss caused by fuel hedging.Delta's shares surged 7.3 percent, making it the biggest percentage gainer in the S&P500, while American Airlines Group  Inc (AAL.O) shares rose 5.9 percent and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) shares gained 3.5 percent.    In the fourth quarter, Delta took a $1.2 billion hit to settle losing fuel hedges, which had failed to anticipate the sharp drop in oil prices. That was the largest factor in a $712 million net loss for the airline in the quarter. Existing hedges likely will force Delta to pay more for fuel in 2015 than its unhedged competitors, such as American Airlines, although Anderson said that if oil prices remain at current low levels, ""we are set up to fully participate in recent fuel declines during 2016.""In addition, our hedge book provides excellent protection, should fuel rise from current levels,"" he added.The airline earned 78 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter, excluding the fuel hedging and other special charges, topping the average analyst estimate of 77 cents per diluted share, also excluding the charges. Anderson didn't say whether funds would be returned to shareholders through share buybacks or dividend hikes, but in the past the carrier has used a mixture of both.Delta executives played down the possibility that the cash freed up by lower oil prices would go either toward lowering fares or buying jetliners, in line with similar statements from rivals. Based on the airline's forecasts, ""not even the most pessimistic investor can claim that Delta is handing over fuel savings to passengers,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note.  Anderson said on the conference call that Delta does not expect to make any big fleet orders. The carrier only might buy a ""few more airplanes"" when some of its existing jets reach retirement age, he said.Delta expects to pay on average $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon of jet fuel for 2015, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during the earnings call.The estimate is far below the airline's adjusted fuel expense for 2014, which was an average $2.87 per gallon.

131,"   By Jarrett Renshaw  A federal mediator has been called in to revive stalled labor negotiations at Delta Airlines Inc's  Philadelphia-area refinery, as both sides seek to prevent the nation's largest U.S. refinery strike in 35 years from spreading to the East Coast.The presence of a federal mediator is uncommon and signals that the local chapter of the United Steelworkers union and Monroe Energy, a Delta subsidiary, remain far apart at the negotiating table, according to local labor and company officials.Local tensions are one of several factors that the leadership at USW International has considered when calling for strikes at 12 other refineries across the country. While most of those refineries continue to operate using management staff, some oil traders fear the strike may begin to disrupt supplies and drive up fuel prices if it drags on.The union requested a mediator last week, just days before its contract expired on Sunday. The union is operating under a rolling 24-hour contract, and the USW International could order a strike at anytime at the 185,000 barrel-per-day plant. ""We thought he was needed, so we called him,"" Denis Stephano, head of USW local 10-234, said Monday of the union's decision to request a mediator.The USW International, which is leading negotiations for 65 refineries across the U.S., has already called for strikes in 15 facilities since Feb. 1, including 12 refineries that account for one-fifth of U.S. domestic production capacity. Labor leaders have threatened more strikes if talks, which resume Wednesday, fail. A strike at Trainer would represent a stark reversal of the mood just a few years ago when the USW and Delta Airlines worked together to help save the refinery. Some of the disagreement involves concessions refinery workers granted in 2012 to help save the facility.Delta purchased the refinery to help manage its jet fuel costs, its biggest expense. In recent earnings calls, executives have called the experiment a financial success. Negotiations take place simultaneously at the local and national level, with the national discussions involving specific items like wages and the use of contractors. But the dividing lines are not always clear.""We are hopeful that we will be able to resolve the outstanding issues soon, but it's fair to say that a number of local issues are affected by the National Oil Bargaining Pattern (NOBP), which Shell the industry lead negotiator and the USW, have not reached agreement on yet,"" Adam Gatusso, a spokesman for Monroe Energy, said.The federal mediator is from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. A spokesman for the agency said mediators have been sent to ""multiple"" refineries, but declined to provide specific numbers.",2015-03-03,DAL,"Tue Mar 3, 2015 | 1:12pm EST",Federal mediator tapped for Delta refinery talks,http://www.reuters.com//article/refinery-operations-delta-trainer-idUSL1N0W51UT20150303?type=companyNews

137,"  SAN FRANCISCO, April 1 Delta Air Lines Inc  has become the first U.S. airline to accept payments via Alipay, the PayPal-like service run by an Alibaba Group Holding Ltd affiliate that is used by hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.The airline has started taking payment for flight tickets on delta.com from Alipay's 300 million-plus registered users, Alipay said in a statement on Wednesday.As the largest online payments service in a country where consumer finance remains less-than-fully developed, supporting Alipay - run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial - should make it more convenient for would-be Chinese travelers to buy Delta tickets. That decision underscores the attractiveness to the industry of China, now the world's largest source of outbound tourism after a decade of super-charged economic growth. The U.S. airline has said it wants to be the most Chinese-friendly American carrier.Chinese tourists have emerged as a potent economic force, ranking among the world's biggest spenders. They splashed out $165 billion on international travel in 2014, up 28 percent from 2013 - the biggest percentage increase in two years, according to data released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Much of that is spent in and around Asia, but governments are increasingly wooing the country's affluent jet-setters. In November, the United States signed a landmark deal with the country, extending one-year visas issued to Chinese travelers to up to a decade.Delta itself has been adding non-stop U.S.-China flights since 2009. It flies direct between Beijing and Shanghai and Detroit and Seattle, and from July 9 will link Los Angeles and Shanghai.

K. and Jeffrey DastinMay 13 Delta Air Lines Inc said it will return more than $6 billion to investors through share buybacks and dividends by the end of 2017, and raised its target for operating profit margin.The Atlanta-based carrier promised on Wednesday to return at least 50 percent of its free cash to stockholders via a new $5 billion share repurchase program, and by hiking its dividend to 13.5 cents per share from 9 cents, starting in the third quarter. The carrier said it is targeting an operating margin of 14 to 16 percent through 2017, up from earlier goals of 11 to 14 percent. It estimated earnings per share would rise more than 15 percent over the same period, up from a target of 10 to 15 percent growth.Mergers, new passenger fees and measures to fly fuller planes have helped U.S. airline profits soar in recent years. The plummeting price of oil since June has added hundreds of millions of dollars more to carriers' bottom lines, with fuel often representing a third or more of their operating expenses.Southwest Airlines Co on Wednesday also announced a $1.5 billion share buyback program and raised its quarterly dividend by 25 percent. Delta rose almost 1.5 percent to close at $46.78, while Southwest fell 2.3 percent to $41.27, both on the New York Stock Exchange.Southwest's ""capital deployment plan is not as lucrative"" as Delta's, CRT Capital Group analyst Adam Hackel said in an email. ""Investors seem on edge (that Southwest's) new pilot contact, which will be finalized this year, will raise costs significantly,"" he added.Delta said it was on track to complete the remaining $725 million from its previous $2 billion buyback program by June 30, one and a half years ahead of schedule.It said it expected to achieve and maintain $4 billion of adjusted net debt by the end of 2017, down from $7.4 billion at the end of the first quarter.Delta forecast capital expenditures of $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually to improve its fleet, facilities, technology and products, which will allow it to replace 20 percent of its mainline fleet over the next three years.Delta ""continues to break from the age-old airline habit of buying way too much shiny metal in the fat years,"" Barclays analyst David Fintzen said in a research note.

168,"  Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) on Tuesday lowered its forecast for unit revenue this quarter as U.S. domestic business tickets booked near customer travel dates yielded less per mile than the carrier expected.The Atlanta-based airline said it estimates passenger revenue per available seat mile, which measures sales relative to planes' carrying capacity and travel distance, to decline 4 percent to 5 percent this quarter compared to a year ago. It had previously forecast a drop of 2 percent to 4 percent.""It should only get better from here,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel said, noting that Delta did not adjust its margin guidance despite the lower unit revenue.  Shares fell 2.5 percent as the news stoked investor fears about the outlook for the U.S. airline industry. U.S. airline stocks sold off last month after Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) forecast up to 8 percent capacity growth for 2015 and its competitors vowed to stand their ground, despite the possibility of lower fares and revenue.The new guidance puts Delta in line with peers American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), both of which expect a passenger unit revenue drop of 4 percent to 6 percent this quarter. Delta said passenger unit revenue fell 5 percent in May on year-over-year basis.

169,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | June 4  June 4 Delta Air Lines Inc on Thursday said its operating profit margin this quarter could be lower than it expected as the U.S. airline industry wrestles with slightly weaker U.S. demand and with oil prices inching up.The Atlanta-based carrier forecast an operating margin for the second quarter of 15.5 percent to 16.5 percent, down from prior guidance of 16 percent to 18 percent, according to regulatory filings. It raised its fuel cost forecast by 5 cents per gallon.The margin revision may fuel debate on whether U.S. carriers are adding plane seats and flights in excess of demand, forcing them to lower airfare. In the first quarter, the U.S. economy contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate due to heavy snowfall, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, with activity now rebounding modestly. Delta on Tuesday lowered its passenger unit revenue guidance for the second quarter as U.S. business travel booked close to customers' trip dates yielded less money per mile than expected.""We are seeing some of those similar headwinds,"" Jim Compton, chief revenue officer of competitor United Continental Holdings Inc, said during an investor conference Thursday. Delta's shares fell more than 1 percent while United's tumbled more than 2 percent after Compton said United was pricing competitively to maximize revenue in markets such as Chicago, where American Airlines Group Inc and Southwest Airlines Co have posted lower fares.The drops follow a wider U.S. airline stock selloff last month on concern that price wars are brewing in Dallas, Seattle and other markets, with Southwest forecasting capacity growth and competitors vowing to stand their ground. Some investors now fear there now is less focus on capacity discipline, which helped U.S. airlines post billion-dollar profits in the past year and announce the largest stock buybacks in their histories.The airlines insist otherwise. Delta said it intends to keep capacity flat in the fourth quarter, including a 3 percent reduction in international service because the strong dollar has weighed on foreign demand.United's Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said Thursday that increasing capacity by squeezing more rows of lightweight seats onto aircraft - not by buying planes - diluted unit revenue but was ""earnings accretive.""

170,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | MIAMI  MIAMI Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) is hoping to strengthen partnerships with carriers in South Korea, Mexico and Brazil, and it has been approached about investing in Japan's bankrupt Skymark Airlines, Delta's president Ed Bastian told reporters Monday.The comments, made on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) annual meeting, reflect Delta's focus on streamlining flight service through cross-country partnerships and ventures.Bastian declined to comment on the status of the Skymark investment talks and what their outcome might be. Aircraft leasing firm Intrepid Aviation Ltd (INTR.N), the biggest creditor of Skymark Airlines, is seeking another sponsor for the failed budget carrier instead of ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T), a Japanese rival airline bidding to take part in the restructuring.Skymark holds landing slots at Tokyo's Haneda Airport that U.S. airlines consider valuable, as a treaty limits U.S. carriers to four slots there. A Skymark investment could pave the way for greater Delta service to Asia, where U.S. airlines are competing vigorously to grow.Delta is also interested in growing its relationship with long-time partner Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (003490.KS) after their ties were weakened by Delta's acquisition of Northwest Airlines, which already had extensive Asian routes and competed with KAL, Bastian said. ""We've been working hard with our Korean colleagues to reestablish a solid base for the relationship,"" he said. ""I'm optimistic we'll find an answer"" on how to proceed.Delta is eyeing growth through partnerships across the Pacific, too.

174,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Sagarika Jaisinghani  Delta Air Lines Inc has reached a tentative deal with its union to pay pilots more than competitors, while making its profit-sharing plan less generous in some cases. The airline said late Wednesday that it will purchase 20 used and 40 new single-aisle aircraft from the Boeing Co if its pilots ratify the contract, replacing planes that are scheduled to retire through 2019.The deal marks a slight move away from profit-sharing, which some analysts and aviation executives have called outdated and costly. It also underscores an industry shift away from flying smaller, less-efficient jets than those Delta has agreed to purchase.The Delta Master Executive Council (MEC), part of the Air Line Pilots Association, approved the deal Wednesday. It raises hourly wages by 8 percent upon signing, 6 percent on Jan. 1, 2016 and 3 percent for each of the following two years.Pilots at the Atlanta-based airline will vote on the contract in coming weeks, some six months ahead of the date it officially could be amended. Ratification would mark a victory for Delta as other airlines have taken years to reach union deals. The hikes place wages 3.5 percent above American Airlines Group Inc and 13.5 percent above United Continental Holdings Inc by 2016, the Delta MEC said. By 2018, pilots on average will earn an extra $42,000 annually.While Delta's existing contract pays pilots 10 percent of profits or 20 percent if pre-tax annual income reaches at least $2.5 billion, the tentative deal requires that Delta earn at least $6 billion before the higher, 20 percent payout begins. Delta's pre-tax income in 2014 was $4.5 billion, excluding special items.In a Wednesday research note, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker called the deal ""a welcome revision to the industry's most generous profit sharing program.""He lowered earnings per share estimates for the third and fourth quarters of 2015 but inched up his 2016 estimate as the profit-sharing change ""outweighs medium-term wage growth."" Ratification also triggers the purchase of 20 used Embraer SA E190 aircraft held by Boeing and 40 new Boeing 737-900ERs. It shrinks Delta's fleet of smaller regional jets to 425 from 450, according to the Delta MEC.Despite the orders, Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker estimated in a research note that Delta can maintain its guidance for annual capital expenditures of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.

If pilots vote for it, the agreement will have an amendable date of Dec. 31, 2018, Delta said late Wednesday. If the deal is ratified, Delta will have a new contract about six months before it can officially be amended on Dec. 31. In contrast, union deals at other U.S. airlines took multiple years to reach.

Some 97 percent of eligible pilots voted.The contract's rejection was a mixed blessing for the airline, whose shares rose nearly 5 percent. Hourly pay would have risen 8 percent upon signing, trimming third quarter earnings per share by 10 cents to $1.66, according to one analyst's estimate.Delta has said it would purchase 20 used and 40 new single-aisle aircraft from Boeing to replace planes scheduled to retire through 2019 if the new contract was ratified. The orders were not firm.Delta and Boeing declined to comment. Boeing had been trying to finalize an agreement to sell the jets to Delta for months.

186,"  (Adds Boeing decline-to-comment, analyst estimate, background)By Jeffrey DastinJuly 10 Delta Air Lines Inc pilots have rejected a tentative contract agreement, casting in doubt both the labor deal and the airline's plans to order extra planes from the Boeing Co.Nearly 7,000, or 65 percent, of voting pilots rejected the contract, according to Delta's Master Executive Council, part of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). Some 97 percent of eligible pilots voted.The contract's rejection was a mixed blessing for the airline, whose shares rose nearly 5 percent. Hourly pay would have risen 8 percent upon signing, trimming third quarter earnings per share by 10 cents to $1.66, according to one analyst's estimate. Delta has said it would purchase 20 used and 40 new single-aisle aircraft from Boeing to replace planes scheduled to retire through 2019 if the new contract was ratified. The orders were not firm.Delta and Boeing declined to comment. Boeing had been trying to finalize an agreement to sell the jets to Delta for months.Delta pilots opposed to the proposed contract said it offered slight gains in light of Delta's growing profits and that higher wages meant sacrificing more-lucrative profit-sharing.

Delta will also guarantee third-party loans to Gol of up to $300 million, the statement said.Gol plans to borrow the money this year, depending on market conditions, Edmar Lopes Neto, the company's chief financial officer, told investors on a conference call Friday. The loan will have a counter-guarantee of shares in Smiles, Gol's frequent-flyer plan, Gol said.""It's always important to bolster the company's liquidity,"" Lopes Neto said. ""It's not a short-term question because if we look at our debt profile, there is no growing cash need in the short term, and by short-term I mean 12 months."" According to the most recent number released by Gol, the Brazilian airline has a cash position of 2.4 billion reais ($1.1 billion).Since 2012, Gol has sold stakes to Delta and Air France-KLM SA as it raised funds to add foreign routes and invest in a turnaround strategy after years of heavy losses. Gol preferred shares have fallen more than 20 percent in the last two weeks and are down more than 50 percent this year.Delta now owns 2.9 percent of Gol's non-voting preferred shares and Air France-KLM owns 1.5 percent, according to the Gol Web site. Volluto owns 100 percent of Gol common, voting shares and 61.2 percent of its preferred stock.The terms of the share offering will be announced on July 14, Gol said. Of the up to $146 million new shares to be sold, Volluto will buy 61 percent and Delta the rest. Gol's problems have been exacerbated by a decline in the value of Brazil's currency the real. A weaker real has driven up the cost of aircraft leases and other foreign debt.In the first quarter, Gol recorded a loss of 627.7 million reais ($199 million). The result was seven times larger than a year earlier and the company's 13th-straight negative quarter.Delta and Gol also agreed to extend the terms of their strategic and commercial operating agreements, the statement said.($1 = 3.1584 Brazilian reais)   (Writing and additional reporting by Jeb Blount; Editing by Christian Plumb and Diane Craft)",2015-07-11,DAL,"Fri Jul 10, 2015 | 8:05pm EDT","UPDATE 3-Delta, Gol boost air accord in $446 mln stock, debt deal",http://www.reuters.com//article/gol-linhas-ae-delta-accord-idUSL1N0ZQ2AH20150711?type=companyNews

192,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Delta Air Lines Inc on Wednesday reported that second-quarter profit jumped 85 percent, topping expectations, but forecast a third-quarter drop in unit revenue as the carrier continued to see weaker demand abroad due to the strong U.S. dollar.Shares fell 2.3 percent to $42.65 in premarket trade.The Atlanta-based airline earned $1.49 billion in the last quarter versus $801 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, profit was $1.03 billion, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.21, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Last year, Delta (DAL.N) posted adjusted profit of $889 million, or $1.04 per share.Despite the earnings beat, Delta's third-quarter outlook  reflected a challenging revenue environment as the U.S. dollar weighed on foreign travelers' spending power.The carrier forecast that passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), which measures sales relative to the capacity and distance of flights, will decline between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent in the third quarter. It estimated capacity would grow about 3 percent in the third quarter but stay flat in the fourth period after the peak summer travel season ends.""We believe this plan will allow us to get our unit revenue back on the right trajectory by the end of the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said in a memo to employees, seen by Reuters. Investors have called on U.S. airlines to restrain capacity growth to match lower demand. However, frequent talks with Wall Street about capacity, which has an impact on prices, have raised eyes at the U.S. Department of Justice and prompted an investigation into whether carriers have worked together illegally to keep air fares high.Delta expects an operating margin of 19 percent to 21 percent in the third quarter, compared with 15.2 percent a year earlier.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel called the report ""very strong,"" noting that the airline expects to keep costs in check. Delta forecast average fuel costs would be between $1.90 and $1.95 per gallon in the third quarter, versus $2.40 per gallon last quarter to account for hedging losses. It estimated unit costs, excluding fuel and other charges, will stay flat year over year.The airline said its initiative to roll out fares that are priced differently to include certain amenities contributed $56 million to total revenue, which was $10.71 billion, topping estimates. PRASM fell 4.6 percent.

199,"  (Adds details on outlook and results, analyst comment, share price)By Jeffrey DastinJuly 15 Delta Air Lines Inc on Wednesday reported that second-quarter profit jumped 85 percent, topping expectations, but forecast a third-quarter drop in unit revenue as the carrier continued to see weaker demand abroad due to the strong U.S. dollar.Shares fell 2.3 percent to $42.65 in premarket trade.The Atlanta-based airline earned $1.49 billion in the last quarter versus $801 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, profit was $1.03 billion, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.21, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Last year, Delta posted adjusted profit of $889 million, or $1.04 per share. Despite the earnings beat, Delta's third-quarter outlook  reflected a challenging revenue environment as the U.S. dollar weighed on foreign travelers' spending power.The carrier forecast that passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), which measures sales relative to the capacity and distance of flights, will decline between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent in the third quarter.It estimated capacity would grow about 3 percent in the third quarter but stay flat in the fourth period after the peak summer travel season ends. ""We believe this plan will allow us to get our unit revenue back on the right trajectory by the end of the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said in a memo to employees, seen by Reuters.Investors have called on U.S. airlines to restrain capacity growth to match lower demand. However, frequent talks with Wall Street about capacity, which has an impact on prices, have raised eyes at the U.S. Department of Justice and prompted an investigation into whether carriers have worked together illegally to keep air fares high. Delta expects an operating margin of 19 percent to 21 percent in the third quarter, compared with 15.2 percent a year earlier.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel called the report ""very strong,"" noting that the airline expects to keep costs in check.Delta forecast average fuel costs would be between $1.90 and $1.95 per gallon in the third quarter, versus $2.40 per gallon last quarter to account for hedging losses. It estimated unit costs, excluding fuel and other charges, will stay flat year over year.The airline said its initiative to roll out fares that are priced differently to include certain amenities contributed $56 million to total revenue, which was $10.71 billion, topping estimates. PRASM fell 4.6 percent.

201,"  TOKYO Delta Air Lines has been proposed as a sponsor to rehabilitate Skymark Airlines Inc [SKALF.PK] by the bankrupt Japanese carrier's biggest creditor - a plan that challenges a separate proposal that has put forward ANA Holdings as a sponsor.If the move is approved by a majority of creditors, it could help Delta use Tokyo's Haneda airport as a transit hub for passengers coming off its flights from Los Angeles. Currently, Delta's connecting opportunities are limited because it has no alliance partner in Japan.Skymark's creditors are slated to vote on the rival plans by an Aug. 5 meeting of debt holders. Both plans would likely result in the winning sponsor taking a stake of under 20 percent in the discount airline.Airline leasing firm Intrepid Aviation, Skymark's biggest creditor, said it had conducted a thorough process to identify the strongest sponsor candidate.    As an incentive for other creditors to adopt its plan with Delta as the sponsor, Intrepid in its rehabilitation plan said it would withdraw a demand that Skymark pay it 30 billion yen  ($242.91 million).""We feel confident that this plan provides a better solution to the creditors, so we are quite hopeful that the plan will be accepted,"" Franklin Pray, Intrepid President and CEO, said at a press briefing in Tokyo. The rival plan promoting ANA, Japan's biggest carrier, as sponsor is backed by Skymark and domestic private equity firm Integral Corp.For ANA, gaining a foothold in Skymark would give it access to additional landing rights at Haneda, where along with its affiliates, it already holds more than half the 486 slots, most of them for domestic routes, helping cement its dominance of air travel in Japan. A spokesman for ANA, which has offered to buy a 16.5 percent stake the in discount carrier, said that its stance was unchanged after Delta stepped forward. ""We have the experience and are in the best position to support Skymark,"" he said.Intrepid, Skymark's biggest creditor, holds 38.1 percent of Skymark's debt, followed by European aircraft maker Airbus Group with 28.9 percent and jet engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings with 15.7 percent.Skymark holds 36 landing slots at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which connects to cities throughout Japan and which many travelers prefer to Narita International Airport because it is closer to central Tokyo.  Skymark Airlines ran into financial trouble after an ambitious expansion that included buying Airbus A380 jumbo jets. It filed for rehabilitation proceedings in late January.

It took off from Anchorage, Alaska, with 255 passengers and eight crew members on board, Delta said in a statement.Cooper said a fire in one of its two engines erupted midflight but the pilots were able to extinguish the flames by shutting down the engine. He added that the fire was out by the time the plane landed. Delta said its preliminary investigation showed the engine experienced a power surge. ""While it's still early and technicians are continuing their look at the engine, this was not an outright fire,"" said airline spokesman Morgan Durrant.Firefighters met the plane upon landing. There were no injuries reported. Durrant said the carrier gave customers snacks and blankets while they waited for a replacement plane in Seattle.""Though rare, jet engines are designed to handle (a power surge) and it can result in an engine tailpipe flame as fuel and oxygen are expunged from the surging engine,"" Durrant said.

209,"   By Richard Cowan and Jeffrey Dastin | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The U.S. Transportation Department is investigating possible price gouging by the five biggest U.S. airlines while train service was disabled between New York and Washington following a deadly Amtrak crash in May, it said on Friday.The regulator sent letters on Friday asking each carrier to detail average fares along the route before, during and after the crash. It demanded an explanation for price increases, if any, and asked the airlines whether they communicated with each other about those fares, which might signal collusion.The review involves Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), all of which said they were cooperating with the probe.American and United added they were confident that no wrongdoing would be found, while Delta said it did not increase prices but instead lowered some of its highest fares by nearly 50 percent following the crash.""These airlines have allegedly raised fees beyond what you would ordinarily expect in the Northeast Corridor at a time when the Amtrak line was shut down,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters on Friday. The probe comes at a difficult time for U.S. airlines, already the subject of a Justice Department investigation into whether they worked together illegally to keep fares high by signaling plans to limit flights. Consumers are also showing signs of dissatisfaction after carriers recently squeezed more seats onto planes and added new ancillary fees, increasing the cost of air travel.The new probe will have to account for ticket prices being a computer-automated response to demand, industry consultant Robert Mann said. Reservation systems displayed high fares simply because all the cheaper ones had been purchased. ""You had a runaway bookings situation because of the unfortunate incident,"" Mann said.Delta and American said they added seats to accommodate more passengers, and Delta allowed previously ticketed Amtrak customers fly for free. Eight people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia. Amtrak traffic between Washington and New York City was shut down for six days as a result.Foxx said the investigation comes after Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy contacted the Obama administration with concerns over consumer protection.The Transportation Department has authority to stop any illegal practice by the airlines, according to Foxx, although it was not immediately clear what punishment could result from the investigation.

220,"  Delta Air Lines banned shipments of lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo trophies on its aircraft on Monday amid international outrage over the killing of Zimbabwe's most famous lion by a American hunter.The No. 2 U.S. passenger carrier is the only American airline to fly directly between the United States and Johannesburg.Delta said in a statement the ban was effective immediately.A roiling debate over species conservation has followed the killing in Zimbabwe of 13-year-old Cecil the lion by Minneapolis dentist and trophy hunter Walter Palmer, as well as a second lion killing by an American dentist, Jan Seski of Pittsburgh.Authorities in Zimbabwe have launched investigations into both killings. Palmer said he killed the lion in a hunt he believed was legal. Seski has made no public statement.Before Delta's ban, the airline's policy required ""absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species,"" it said.Delta will also review policies on accepting other hunting trophies with government agencies and other organizations that support legal shipments, the airline said. Nearly 400,000 people signed a Change.org petition that was started by a Delta customer calling for the airline to stop transporting exotic hunting trophies, the organization said. The most popular Change.org petition, which has gotten 1 million signatures, calls for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list African lions as a threatened species and punishment for those involved in Cecil's death. The United States has the world's most powerful animal protection law, the Endangered Species Act, which has been extended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to many non-U.S. species including the African elephant and cheetah.Adding the African lion to the U.S. list would not prohibit trophy hunting but it would require a permit from the service to import lions or their body parts to the United States.

The airline revised its schedule on Friday to reflect the change, part of a broader 15-to-20 percent cut in capacity to the Middle East and Africa that Delta announced in April.""The reduction comes amid overcapacity on U.S. routes to the Middle East operated by government-owned and subsidized airlines,"" Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said in a statement, noting that daily service would return in the spring of 2016.Delta said months ago that its international capacity cuts were in response to falling crude prices hitting demand in oil-rich markets and to the strong U.S. dollar that has hurt the spending power of foreign travelers. Yet the latest news underscores a trade row that is rippling through Washington.Large U.S. unions and airlines, led by Delta, charge that Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have received some $42 billion in subsidies from their home governments in the past decade. They say this has allowed the Gulf carriers to start dumping capacity into the United States, driving down prices and pushing out competitors. The Gulf carriers have denied that they are subsidized and say poor customer service has caused U.S. airlines to lose market share.Other U.S. carriers such as JetBlue Airways Corp  and the air cargo unit of FedEx Corp have backed the Gulf airlines, saying that government action would signal an abandonment of the United States' liberal trade policy in favor of protectionism. The Obama administration is currently reviewing the issue.Delta is the only airline that flies between Atlanta and Dubai. Its service reduction will leave the Washington-Dubai flights on rival United Continental Holdings Inc as the only remaining daily nonstop on a U.S. carrier this winter.Emirates operates a freighter service to Atlanta and currently flies passengers to nine U.S. cities from Dubai, with plans to add more. Qatar Airways will launch Atlanta-Doha flights in July 2016.

237,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Delta Air Lines Inc is running its Philadelphia area oil refinery at a near-record 110 percent of capacity, according to a person familiar with operations, a sign of the surprisingly strong summer profits U.S. refineries are generating.While collapsing global crude oil markets have cast a dark shadow over much of the energy industry, refiners are running flat out this summer to meet record U.S. demand for gasoline. Some have pressed beyond their theoretical limits as rivals suffered unexpected breakdowns or glitches last month.The refinery, in Trainer, Pennsylvania, has been running at a clip of roughly 204,000 barrels per day for the past month, the source said, resulting in higher yields of gasoline and distillates. The plant's nameplate capacity is 185,000 bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.“We have run that before, but not in a very long time,” the source said.The refinery is operated by a Delta subsidiary, Monroe Energy, which declined to comment.The increased run rates are the result of, among other factors, the replacement and widening of pipes to allow for greater flows, the source said. Typically, crude units can safely run above their stated capacity, but processing units are limited by a number of factors, including piping and the type of crude, experts say.Delta is not alone.

""Refiners are taking advantage of it.""HOBBLED RIVALS An unusually large number of Monroe's rivals have been hobbled by glitches or outages over the past month. U.S. refiners processed more than 17 million barrels per day in the last week of July, the highest on record. Throughput rates have, however, fallen in each of the past four weeks,  typically the time when summer holiday gasoline demand peaks. On the East Coast alone, refiners processed 1.23 million bpd of crude oil in the first week of August, the highest since September 2011, just before the last of a string of refinery closures that reduced the region’s capacity. Last week throughput had eased to 1.217 million bpd.PBF Energy is still working to repair compressors associated with the gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker at its Delaware City refinery after a Aug. 21 fire knocked it out of service. Phillips 66 shut its Bayway, New Jersey, refinery's 150,000 bpd FCC, the largest on the East Coast, unexpectedly last week before restarting it on Sunday, and Philadelphia Energy Solutions was forced to shut an FCC over the weekend and suffered a fire in a reforming unit Monday.

240,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Ankit Ajmera  Delta Air Lines Inc on Friday said its third-quarter unit revenue continued to fall during the year's busiest travel season but hinted that financial metrics were already improving.The Atlanta-based airline said passenger unit revenue, which measures sales relative to the capacity and distance of flights, declined between 4.5 and 5.5 percent, compared with earlier guidance of a 4.5 to 6.5-percent drop.For months, Delta and rivals American Airlines Group Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc have seen steep declines in unit revenue as a strong U.S. dollar hurt travel demand abroad and smaller surcharges in international markets decreased the value of sales. Yet the industry has taken steps to reduce fall and winter capacity to match lower demand, which analysts say should help unit revenue. According to Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel, the unit revenue decline likely reached its bottom in the third quarter.Delta said it expects third-quarter operating profit margin, adjusted for the changing market value of its fuel hedges, to be between 20 and 21 percent, compared with 15.8 percent a year earlier. Margins have benefited because the cost of fuel - typically a third of airlines' operating expenses - has fallen dramatically from a year ago. Delta said it paid between $1.80 and $1.85 per gallon on average in the third quarter.However, the airline said unit costs excluding fuel, profit-sharing and other expenses grew about 1 percent in the quarter.

242,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) on Wednesday said it will put the brakes on its expansion of flight capacity in 2016, in a move to fill up more planes and sell more seats at higher fares.Delta, the third-largest U.S. airline, said its capacity -- or total mileage flown by its planes' seats -- would grow zero to 2 percent next year, compared with a nearly 3 percent rise this year. Wall Street analysts, noting stagnant foreign demand for U.S. carriers, have pushed them to shrink international service so fewer discount fares are necessary to sell out flights. A strong dollar has hurt foreigners' spending power in the United States for months and lowered the value of foreign sales in dollar terms.""We see this as a major positive, not just for (Delta), but also for the industry,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel said of Delta's capacity plan.In morning trade, shares of the Atlanta-based airline rose 2.4 percent after Delta also posted higher-than-expected adjusted profits of $1.38 billion, up 36 percent from a year earlier. U.S. airline earnings have surged in the past year as fuel costs have plummeted and companies have taken care not to add flights in excess of demand. Fees for extra services have helped, too.Delta said its initiative to roll out fares that are priced based on the different amenities they include, such as priority boarding, contributed $75 million to its revenue of $11.11 billion in the third quarter. Revenue fell 0.6 percent from a year earlier, however. For the fourth quarter, the airline said it would keep capacity flat compared with a year earlier to slow the decline in passenger revenue per available seat mile to between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. That gauge fell 4.9 percent in the third quarter.""We have consistently achieved our long-term goals and will continue to do so regardless of the direction of fuel prices,"" Chief Executive Richard Anderson told investors on a call Wednesday.Delta earned $1.74 per diluted share in the third quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.71, both on an adjusted basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income was $1.32 billion with an operating profit margin of 21 percent.

254,"   By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Low interest rates and a U.S. stock market that is still down 2 percent for the year have taken their toll on corporate America's pension plans.    Pension liabilities grew 1 percent in the third quarter, as returns fell 2.5 percent, according to global consulting firm Milliman. The increase in the pension shortfall has been largely driven by investment losses in August and September, low discount rates used to value pension liabilities, and recent studies showing that people are expected to live longer over the next 20 years. While the government has granted relief into 2021 for companies to improve their pension funding, corporate executives with severely underfunded pensions have some urgency to take action, or pay stiffer premiums to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure their programs.     As a result, companies with some of the larger unfunded liabilities have started to load up on riskier assets such as stocks and junk bonds to make up for lost ground in hopes they do not have to contribute more cash, pension managers and consultants say.Private pensions added nearly $50 billion in so-called ""other"" assets, which pension consultants say could include hedge funds and private equity. The investment in other assets is nearly double the $26 billion invested in the second half of 2014 and far more than the $14.2 billion invested in all of 2010, according to Federal Reserve data.Market losses and low interest rates have also slowed the $2.4 trillion sector's move into the safety of long-term bonds,  Fed data showed, as many had planned to do when they reached a high funding status.    Insurer American International Group Inc, for example, aims to grow its holdings of alternative investments that include hedge funds and real estimate by nearly 80 percent this year, while trimming its bond exposure, according to regulatory filings.    ""Things are moving in the wrong direction,"" said Andrew Wozniak, head of BNY Mellon Fiduciary Solutions in New York. ""They are trying to find the right balance between contributing to improve the funding status and taking more risk within the pension plan to have a higher return to close that funding gap.""    Thirty seven of the top 100 U.S. corporate pensions by assets tracked by Milliman had funding ratios below 80 percent at the end of 2014, more than double that level in 2013.    The overall funding ratio for these U.S. companies fell to 81.7 percent in September this year, down from 85.5 percent at the end of June, Milliman data showed.       The funding ratio measures a pension's solvency, and 80 percent for many plans closed to new entrants has generally been considered a threshold in which they should be thinking about moving into fixed income to preserve gains. Falling below that level could delay a pension's move to the stability of fixed income assets that would help cushion portfolios from market volatility.TURNING TO RISKY ASSETS      Among the underfunded corporate pension plans in Milliman's top 100 at the end of 2014 were Delta Air Lines Inc with a 42.8 percent funding level and American Airlines Group Inc  at 62.4 percent.         AIG, which had a funded ratio of 70 percent at the end of last year, has targeted an increase in other investments to 31 percent this year from 17 percent in 2014, according to the company's 2014 annual report, while lowering its bond allocation to 27 percent from 28 percent in 2014.    American Airlines and AIG declined to comment.    In addition to heavily loading up on riskier investments, Delta is also pumping $1 billion a year into its pension through 2020.    Delta, whose funding level is the lowest among the Top 100 companies in the Milliman index, should reach an 80 percent funded ratio in the next five years, according to financial documents provided by the company.    Only 12 percent of the airline's pension is invested in fixed income with 21 percent in equities and the rest in other investments.     The airline has been severely underfunded over the last three years, with funding ratios of 46.9 percent in 2013 and 38.1 percent in 2012. Frank van Etten, head of client solutions at UBS Global Asset Management, which oversees $695 billion in assets, said some pensions needed to take on more risk due to higher return targets.    ""We do expect more shifts in allocations given the decreased levels of funding ratios,"" Chicago-based Van Etten added.    Adding to their burden, the Society of Actuaries last year estimated retirees are living longer than just a decade ago, a factor the Internal Revenue Service is expected to adopt in 2017 when calculating pensions' future payouts. DERISKING DELAY?     The shift into bonds by corporate pensions was part of a derisking process that began in the last three years as their obligations declined and funding levels improved.     The objective is to move 50 percent to 80 percent of pension assets into long-term bonds, usually corporate investment-grade debt.     But that goal may have to wait now, pension consultants say.    ""What we have seen is a delay in moving into long-duration bonds while they're waiting for the long end of the (yield) curve to go higher and market conditions to improve,"" said Philadelphia-based Charles Tan, head of North American fixed income at Aberdeen Investments, managing more than $480 billion in assets.    Fed data showed that private pensions' bond purchases tumbled to $7.4 billion in the second quarter, from $56.5 billion in the first quarter.    One reason for the drastic decline in bond purchases, analysts say, is the expectation of an interest rate increase by the Fed, which diminishes the value of the bonds.     From 2012 to 2014, private pensions have amassed more than $250 billion in fixed-income debt.    At the end of last year, fixed-income allocation grew to 42.7 percent from 39.5 percent at the end of 2013, Milliman data show.    Despite expectations for a Fed rate hike, longer-term bond yields have declined, a factor in computing discount rates used to estimate pension liabilities. Lower discount rates, which are based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds, increase a pension plan's projected liabilities.    Pension discount rates fell to 4.19 percent in September, from 4.23 percent in August and down more than 2 percentage points since the global financial crisis in 2008.""There is a greater deficit now on the balance sheet. They are feeling more of that pain from a cash and financial statement perspective,"" BNY Mellon's Wozniak said.

279,"  (Adds comment from United, Delta, Southwest and JetBlue, analyst comments, detail on pricing process)By Jeffrey DastinNEW YORK Jan 5 The top U.S. airlines said Tuesday that they have raised fares in the first industry-wide hike since June, moves that may offset increasing labor costs but draw the ire of customers.Fares increased $3 one-way for U.S. domestic flights on American Airlines Group Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co  and JetBlue Airways Corp, each company told Reuters.The price hike comes at a precarious time for the industry, which is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for potentially conspiring to limit flights and keep fares high. The airlines have denied collusion.The federal agency declined to comment on the fare rise.Airlines have long monitored each others' prices and quickly responded to changes, much like gas station owners watch the signs of their competitors. Carriers file fares with the Airline Tariff Publishing Company, a distributor that has a product for price tracking primarily used by industry insiders.This week's fare hike began with changes by Delta on Monday, the airline confirmed. Southwest was the next to follow suit, two analysts said.""The industry has never met a Southwest fare increase it didn't match, for as far back as our records go,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note. ""Just as Southwest often plays the spoiler role, competitors consistently follow Southwest's lead to the upside."" U.S. airlines regularly adjust their fares, but an industry-wide match is far less common. A $3-rise occurred last in June when Southwest also matched a change by Delta, Baker said in a prior note.CONSUMER IMPACT  Tuesday's news is another indication that airlines are not translating savings from a year's decline in fuel prices into lower ticket prices, a break from a decade ago when more airlines vied for customers.Consumers will have little choice but to accept the hike because the five airlines control more than 80 percent of the U.S. travel market, following four high-profile mergers.The price hike is unlikely to decrease demand for corporate travel, as employers accept higher fares as the cost of doing business, industry consultant Robert Mann said. Airlines are betting the rise will boost revenue even if leisure travel dips, he said.However, competition is still high on the busiest U.S. routes. The lowest leisure fares were on average 24 percent lower from a year earlier for the top 1,000 domestic routes, according to a late December report by travel consultancy Harrell Associates.Mann said the price hike will help the airlines manage growing labor costs and prepare for new contracts with wages likely to balloon.He said it may have the side effect of leaving planes emptier, a plus when winter cancellations force airlines to rebook customers onto other flights.

281,"  (Adds details, quotes and background)Jan 8 Southwest Airlines Co must make room for rival Delta Air Lines Inc in its gates at Dallas Love Field Airport, a U.S. district court ordered on Friday.The decision lets Delta maintain its five daily flights between Atlanta and space-constrained Love Field, sparing the carrier from having to cancel the flights of thousands of passengers who have already booked their trips.Southwest, which controls 18 of 20 gates at Love Field, accused Delta of trespassing on its airport property as a gate-sharing agreement between them was set to expire in the summer of 2015. The budget carrier then accommodated Delta pending a resolution in court. ""This isn't the end of this case, and we are evaluating our future options,"" Southwest said in a statement. ""Southwest plans to continue serving our customers with 50 nonstop destinations with 180 flights a day.""Love Field, the headquarters of Southwest, has been key to the low-cost carrier's growth strategy since a law that capped flying from that airport to several states expired in October 2014. Southwest had originally expressed concern that accommodating Delta would lead to flight delays or prevent it from ramping up to 180 flights per day from the airport starting in August 2015. Coordinating with Delta to ensure efficient gate usage let the ramp-up proceed, however.""The Court finds the chaos and inconvenience of disrupted service by removing Delta from Love Field before the legal issues are decided would be a great disservice to the public,"" U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas wrote in the order. Southwest is enjoined from adding flights on any of its gates shared with Delta, and it must inform the U.S. district court if it ever reduces flight service from Love Field, the order said.Delta said Friday it was pleased to continue its Love Field service.Delta also operates tens of daily flights from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, where Southwest is barred by contract from expanding unless it relinquishes rights at the newly renovated and more central Love Field.

285,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) on Tuesday said a billion-dollar windfall from low fuel prices will far offset slumping sales to Europe after the November Paris attacks, forecasting its profit margin will more than double in the first quarter.Shares were up around 3 percent in afternoon trading, despite Delta reporting a fourth-quarter adjusted profit of $926 million just short of analysts' average estimate of $928 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.With fuel prices chopped nearly by half from a year earlier, Delta said it expects an operating margin between 18 percent and 20 percent in the first quarter, up from 8.8 percent in the same period in 2015.Delta, the third-largest U.S. airline by capacity, has also bet that fuel will stay lower for longer.In order to pocket each dollar that oil prices decline, Delta has closed its fuel hedges for 2016, exiting contracts at a cost of $100 million to $200 million per quarter, its Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said Tuesday on an investor call. The financial instruments protected against rising oil prices but required a payout when prices fell. Delta expects $3 billion in fuel savings this year, Jacobson said.

286,"  Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) is considering whether to purchase Bombardier's CSeries aircraft, the carrier's chief executive said on Tuesday, in what could be a headline-grabbing win for the planemaker's new flagship jet.Canada's Bombardier hopes to find a major customer to give momentum to the single-aisle CSeries as it prepares the jet to enter service after years of delays and cash problems.""We actually think at the right price it's quite a competitive airplane, particularly given the engine technology,"" Delta Chief Executive Officer Richard Anderson said on the airline's quarterly conference call with investors. ""We're taking a very serious look at it.""Delta, the third-largest U.S. airline by capacity, previewed the jet in late December at its Atlanta headquarters.Bombardier stock was up more than 3 percent in midday trading. A spokeswoman for the Montreal-based plane and train-maker said Bombardier's sales campaign to airlines for the CSeries has gained momentum since the aircraft's certification in December. ""We are a top contender in several key campaigns,"" spokeswoman Marianella de la Barrera said by phone from Toronto.In a separate campaign, larger rival Boeing Co (BA.N) looks well placed to snatch at least part of a deal for about 30 small jets from United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), worth around $2 billion at list prices. Still, a deal with United has not been finalised and could face last-minute shifts in negotiations with competing bidders like Bombardier and rival Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA). One aviation analyst said Delta, now looking to replace some of its aging narrowbodies is a potential customer for the CSeries aircraft. But Bombardier faces rivals with ""deep-pockets"" that are aggressively competing on price. Delta's fleet of 57 A319-100s had an average age of 13.7 years as of Sept. 30, 2015, according to an airline quarterly filing. ""Several American carriers are looking at the CSeries,"" said the analyst, who spoke on condition that his name not be published because he was not authorized to talk to the media. ""The question is who moves first.""Earlier on Tuesday, Bombardier said it was ramping up the CSeries program to full production, with pilots from launch customer Swiss International Airlines kicking off aircraft flight training.

288,"  Jan 19 Delta Air Lines Inc is considering whether to purchase Bombardier's CSeries aircraft, the carrier's chief executive said Tuesday, in what could be a headline-grabbing win for the planemaker's new flagship jet.Canada's Bombardier is hoping to find a major customer to give momentum to the single-aisle CSeries as the jet prepares to enter service after delays and cash problems. Larger rival Boeing Co already looks well placed to snatch at least part of a deal for about 30 small jets from United Continental Holdings Inc, worth around $2 billion at list prices. ""We actually think at the right price it's quite a competitive airplane, particularly given the engine technology,"" Delta's Chief Executive Richard Anderson said on the airline's quarterly conference call with investors.

""We have not seen it in terms of passenger refund or change requests,"" he said, speaking in an interview.The World Health Organization, citing strong suspicions of a link between the mosquito-borne virus and thousands of cases in Brazil of babies born with abnormally small heads, declared a global health emergency on Monday. On the impact of the virus on future travel patterns, Bastian said, ""It's hard to know as people look out and build their future plans if they're going to change (where they're) going"" because of Zika.Bastian's comments echoed statements from other top travel companies that it is too early to tell if the virus is affecting bookings.Delta and other carriers have offered to refund passengers with tickets to Zika-impacted regions and to re-assign certain crew who are concerned about infection. Bastian declined to comment on whether Delta would increase its almost 10-percent stake in Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4.SA), but said Delta is interested in the country for the long run.Ratings firm Moody's said on Thursday that Gol and Latam Airlines Group SA LAN.SN are most exposed to an expected reduction in air travel to Latin America due to the Zika virus.

Those who lack blending capacity must buy compliance credits from other refiners or other companies that blend fuel.Delta-owned merchant refiner Monroe Energy LLC wants the EPA to shift the compliance obligation to blenders. In a Jan. 29 filing in the District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, the company asked for a review of the current regulation.It was the latest attempt by Monroe and other refiners to shift compliance onto fuel blenders. EPA denied similar requests in 2010. The crux of their argument is that high compliance costs for refiners have not successfully pushed more ethanol into the market, and the EPA should look at shifting compliance to fuel blenders and retailers.The EPA has said it would consider a shift, but the larger number of fuel blenders could make oversight more challenging. Monroe said the EPA's release of rules late last year that set biofuels requirements through 2016 at targets below a plan Congress laid out in 2007 gave the refiner a basis to petition the appeals court over the policy.EPA acknowledged the so-called ""blend wall"" oil companies have said makes it impossible to meet the targets without major changes at pumps and in vehicles.The higher the amount of ethanol, the more costly the requirements become for oil refiners like Monroe, which meets its obligation by purchasing compliance credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), in an opaque market. Those costs ballooned in the first nine months of 2015 due to higher prices of the credits.Monroe said its petition was timely because with the new rule, the EPA decided its regulation of refiners and importers could no longer ensure transportation fuels would contain the biofuels volumes set by Congress and the agency must exercise its authority to reduce the annual requirements Congress set.The EPA also reversed an earlier position that higher RIN prices could meaningfully impact the annual supply of biofuels in transportation fuel in the near term, the petition said.Monroe did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",2016-02-05,DAL,"Fri Feb 5, 2016 | 6:59pm EST",Delta-owned refinery challenges U.S. policy on bio-fuels program,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-biofuels-delta-idUSL2N15K2U1?type=companyNews

316,"  PARIS/MONTREAL, April 7 Delta Air Lines  is in talks with planemakers that could lead to the acquisition of dozens of small narrowbody jets, industry sources said.The Atlanta-based airline has said it needs to phase out as many as 120 older aircraft as it trades up from regional to larger mainline jets with 100 or more seats.Industry sources said Canada's Bombardier is pushing particularly hard for a deal for its struggling new CSeries aircraft after losing out to Boeing at United Airlines earlier this year.A U.S.-based Delta employee who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bombardier executives were in Atlanta this week. He could not say whether Delta would buy the CSeries because the ""negotiations are ongoing"".It was not immediately clear how widespread the talks were at this stage, nor whether the airline had yet decided on the shape or size of a potential order, which some industry sources estimated could involve as many as 50 to 100 aircraft. ""Delta has been evaluating new and used aircraft acquisition opportunities in the roughly 100-seat gauge as we've continued to replace our 50-seat regional fleet with larger, more customer friendly mainline aircraft,"" an airline spokesman said. Last month Delta CEO-elect Ed Bastian told a JPMorgan investor conference that it would need more small narrowbody planes in the same category as the 110-130-seat CSeries.""We have 120 MD-80s that need to be retired over the next five years. So ... there's still a considerable need there.""Such a deal could be attractive for Bombardier, Embraer  of Brazil, as well as the smaller types of Airbus or Boeing jetliners.

Where demand is weak, Delta said it would cut service if necessary.Its incoming president, Glen Hauenstein, cautioned during a conference call Thursday that the turnaround in passenger unit revenue would come a few months later in 2016 than previously forecast. However, Wall Street had been braced for worse.According to a recent survey by Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay, a third of airline investors polled believed Delta would simply fail to hit the unit revenue goal this year.Delta forecast Thursday that passenger unit revenue would decline between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent in the second quarter from a year ago. It dropped 4.6 percent in the first quarter. ""From here, we believe the first plausible case for (unit revenue) recovery can be made,"" said JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker in a note on Delta's results.Baker highlighted that U.S. airlines have made multi-city trips in the United States more expensive to book, and they are growing U.S. domestic capacity slower, therefore undercutting rivals less.The top carriers have also raised U.S. domestic fares by $22 round-trip this year, according to FareCompare.com. Delta executives also challenged forecasts that business travel was in a slump. Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg recently cut his rating of shares of Delta, United and American to a ""hold"" from ""buy,"" in part because a slowdown in U.S. corporate profits would hurt travel demand.Hauenstein said business clients from healthcare to financial services had booked more travel on Delta during the first quarter, even though lower yields - a measure of average fares paid per mile per passenger - offset this.""In our core European markets, the U.S. point of sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels,"" he added, referring to the March 22 attacks that closed the city's main airport temporarily.

321,"  Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) has not decided which planes to acquire to renew its fleet of single-aisle jets, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on Thursday, as various manufacturers appeared to be vying for a deal.Delta spokesman Michael Thomas reiterated in a phone interview that no decision had been made, after The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday afternoon that the airline was in the final stages of a deal to acquire up to 125 Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) CSeries jetliners.A final agreement between Atlanta-based Delta and Bombardier for 75 firm orders and options for 50 more of its 110-130 seat CSeries planes is expected at the end of April when the carrier's board meets to review the proposed deal, the Journal said, citing three sources familiar with the matter.Bombardier is close to a deal with Delta, but a final agreement hasn't been reached, a separate source familiar with the talks told Reuters. A Bombardier spokeswoman declined to comment.Bombardier shares closed 7 percent higher on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Reuters reported last week that Delta was in talks with planemakers to buy dozens of narrow-body jets, with Bombardier pushing hard to sell its CSeries aircraft.Bombardier earlier this year lost out to Boeing Co (BA.N) for orders by United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).  Jacobson told analysts on a conference call after Delta released first-quarter earnings that he hoped to provide an update in May on the company's aircraft spending. He declined to discuss media speculation about Delta's potential fleet purchases.Delta, the second-largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic,  plans to retire about 115 older MD-88 aircraft and phase out smaller, less-efficient jets that it contracts regional airlines to fly, Jacobson said.Delta may refurbish older plane parts as an alternative to buying new planes, Jacobson said. Delta was in talks with code-share partner Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4.SA) about acquiring planes that the Brazilian airline might sell, although it had yet to make any decisions, incoming Chief Executive Ed Bastian added on the conference call.Delta reported a first-quarter profit above analysts' estimates and indicated it could cut flight capacity in the fall if necessary to stop a months-long decline in a key benchmark that measures revenue as divided by its total plane seats and miles flown.

323,"   By Allison Lampert and Euan Rocha | MONTREAL/TORONTO  MONTREAL/TORONTO Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) faces a pivotal week that may see a key deal announced with Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) but a federal aid package is unlikely to be approved in time for its annual meeting on Friday.    The deal with Atlanta-based Delta for up to 125 CSeries jets is critical for Bombardier as Delta would be the first major U.S. airline to purchase the CSeries, which is entering service years late and billions of dollars overbudget.    Delta’s board is widely expected to approve the purchase, which includes 75 initial orders, this week. A Delta commitment, coupled with a firmed up agreement for 45 CSeries jets with Air Canada (AC.TO), would put Bombardier's CSeries order book above the 300 mark, allowing the company to hit a psychologically-important internal target by the time the first plane enters service in July 2016.    ""It is a flagship customer outside of Canada, which may enable and help them to capture other orders and it establishes the CSeries as a real player in the market,"" said Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins. Delta could not immediately be reached for comment. The advance in CSeries order talks comes as Canada's federal government and Bombardier remain far apart over a $1 billion aid package.The government wants a say in the suppliers Bombardier is using for the plane program, two sources said, and has asked the company to modify its dual-class share structure which favors the founding Bombardier-Beaudoin family.     Bombardier spokeswoman Isabelle Rondeau declined to comment on the federal talks.     An order from Delta, the second-largest U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, would overshadow a decision on federal aid and the finalization of a separate CSeries investment by the Quebec province.     ""The stamp of approval by Delta is worth much more to them than a deal with the federal government,"" said an aerospace analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media.Quebec, which negotiated a separate $1 billion agreement with Bombardier to be finalized during the second quarter, did not make a first payment to the company as originally expected on April 1. The province, which wants the same conditions as the federal government, is said to be waiting for Bombardier to finalize an agreement with Canada before completing its own deal, two sources familiar with the matter said.       Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard on Monday said the province would finalize its deal with Bombardier as soon as certain conditions in its agreement with the company are completed. He did not specify what those were or give a timeframe.     ""We will eventually finalize the agreement,"" Couillard told reporters on the sidelines of a Montreal aerospace conference. ""It’s only a question related to liquidity and other subjects that have to be met. They will be met. We are there.""   Couillard said he had ""full confidence” that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government recognized the importance of the aerospace sector to Quebec and would invest in the CSeries.An investment manager whose company owns Bombardier stock said he hoped the federal government made a decision soon because the talks were becoming a distraction for the company's management.     ""The company has to get to the next stage which is operations,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the federal talks are confidential. ""Those discussions are taking a lot of time with a lot of people and I’m sure those people would like to be focused elsewhere.""

325,"  (Adds quotes, details)By David LjunggrenOTTAWA, April 28 A big order by Delta Airlines Inc for Bombardier Inc jets does not change the Canadian government's stance on whether to meet the plane maker's request for financial aid, a source close to the matter said on Thursday.The Canadian government's focus has always been on the long-term viability of the Quebec-based company and Canada's aerospace sector, not on a single deal, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.Bombardier wants $1 billion in federal aid to help support its new CSeries jet. Sources say the two sides are far apart on matters such as corporate governance and the extent of Ottawa's involvement in running the company. ""It's always been about the long term, not six months to six months, or one deal or another ... a single deal does not a company make or break,"" the source said.""Everyone understands ... the stakes are the same in terms of long-term viability of the company and long-term viability of the sector."" Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare said earlier on Thursday that the Quebec-based company had not yet found the right elements for a deal with Ottawa but remained hopeful it could come to an agreement.Bellemare spoke after Delta announced an order for 75 CS100 planes, worth an estimated $5.6 billion based on the list price, the first from a major U.S. airline for the CSeries jet. Federal Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, who is in charge of the Bombardier matter, congratulated the company in a statement and said talks on aid were continuing. He gave no details.Ottawa and Bombardier are committed to ensuring that any aid deal would comply with World Trade Organization restrictions on subsidies, the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said.Brazilian plane maker Embraer SA has already expressed concern about a separate $1 billion aid deal that the Canadian province of Quebec struck with Bombardier last year.

330,"  (Adds details, background)     April 28 Delta Air Lines Inc on Thursday ordered 75 CSeries CS100 planes worth $5.6 billion from Bombardier Inc, throwing a lifeline to a new aircraft program that is years late and billions of dollars over budget.     The widely anticipated order marks a turning point for Canada's Bombardier as it strives to break into the fleets of top airlines globally and serve a niche market for 100-seat planes that larger rivals Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE  have neglected.      With the CSeries order, Delta said it would not induct Embraer's E190 into its fleet as planned. Delta had said in December it would add up to 20 Embraer 190 and 20 new Boeing 737-900ER jets. (bit.ly/1JcAHz8)     Bombardier said separately on Thursday that the deal included an option for Delta to buy an additional 50 CS100 aircraft.      For Delta, the deal allows it to phase out 50-seat jets that it contracts regional airlines to fly under its Delta Connection brand.     The larger CS100 planes burn less fuel per passenger and have room for two cabin classes rather than one, giving it the opportunity to up-sell customers to business.     The Bombardier aircraft will also be flown by Delta's own pilots, reducing Delta's reliance on contractors as a shortage of regional pilots looms in the United States.     Boeing beat out Bombardier to sell United Continental Holdings Inc 65 jets earlier this year. The planemaker is also studying whether to revise one version of its best-selling 737 jet to fend off the competition.      Swiss International Air Lines, a unit of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, expects to take delivery of its first CS100 at the end of June, with the first flight, from Zurich to Paris Charles de Gaulle, scheduled for July 15.     Air Canada has also signed a letter of intent to buy 45 CSeries, with an option for 30 more of the narrow-body aircraft.

334,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said on Friday it has ordered 37 current-generation A321 aircraft from Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) worth $4.25 billion at list prices, a move that will help it replace aging aircraft.The new jets, set to be delivered through 2019, add to A321s Delta already has on order, boosting the carrier's fleet of these planes to 82, the airline said. Airlines typically enjoy discounts of 40 percent or more on aircraft list prices.The announcement comes a day after Delta ordered 75 CSeries aircraft from Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), boosting the Canadian planemaker's backlog, even as it faces a long road back to profitability. Delta also said on Friday it did not plan to buy Boeing Co (BA.N) planes in the near future.The Airbus purchase will help Atlanta-based Delta, the second-largest U.S. carrier by traffic, achieve its planned growth while retiring 116 old MD-88 aircraft, which seat 149 people. The new planes can seat 185 people, the airline said. ""The order for the A321s is an opportunistic fleet move that enables us to produce strong returns and cost-effectively accelerate the retirement of Delta’s 116 MD-88s in a capital efficient manner,"" Delta's incoming Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a news release.Reuters reported earlier this month that Airbus was nearing a deal to sell Delta the 37 jets. Bastian told reporters in Atlanta that the airline had no current plans to buy Boeing planes.""At the present time, I'd say we're not in the market,"" Bastian said. ""There's not a significant domestic need ... There's not an international need as well."" While Delta talks frequently with Boeing, he said, ""their product and the commercial offerings did not match what the CSeries was providing us, and they did not match the (Airbus) 321s, and Boeing was at the table at every one of the contests that we had.""

335,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Concern over future U.N. aircraft emissions standards was a factor in a Delta Air Lines Inc deal announced this week to buy 75 new CS100 jets from Bombardier Inc, a Delta executive said on Friday.Delta's decision was in part because the planes will comply with standards that the United Nations aviation arm will likely  introduce over the next decade, said Greg May, senior vice president for supply chain maintenance and fleet strategy.Atlanta-based Delta, the No.2 U.S. carrier by traffic, currently has an older fleet than rivals United Continental Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc, though Delta manages thanks to its large maintenance operation called TechOps and has renovated interiors.The pending standards from the International Civil Aviation Organization would apply to all new aircraft models launched after 2020 and would be phased in for existing aircraft built from 2023. These preliminary efforts to cap carbon dioxide emissions were a factor in Delta's deal with Bombardier, which was announced Thursday, May said. ""It's definitely a consideration. It's not the deciding factor, but we're always monitoring our entire fleet for emissions, noise, environmental friendliness,"" May told reporters. He was speaking aboard the company's first A321 jet from Airbus Group SE, which was delivered in March.Separately, May said that if Boeing Co were in the future to make a new, larger 737 MAX variant, Delta could be interested.""We will have interest (in) a larger and longer-range MAX,"" he said. ""The bigger interest point for us on that is to get more range."" However, Delta's incoming Chief Executive Ed Bastian said earlier Friday that the airline is not in the market for a Boeing order for the time being, after placing the CS100 order and announcing Friday it would buy 37 more Airbus A321s.May said that Delta does not like placing large plane orders at any given time that would lock in the airline's growth and not allow it to respond flexibly to customer demand. ""Huge orders for us would be firm orders for 150, 200 aircraft with one manufacturing type. What we find is as far as getting economy-of-scale pricing, 50 to 75 aircraft is plenty to really get the cutting-edge kind of deals that we want,"" May said.Delta has a fleet of about 1,300 aircraft, he said.

Bellemare said talks over a $1 billion cash injection from the Canadian government were moving forward and he hoped for a deal soon.""They are still ongoing and progressing. These are complex negotiations and we are working towards a win-win solution,"" he said, adding, ""we are not there yet"".Asked how far it was willing to go in accepting conditions such as constraints on its choice of suppliers, Bellemare said Bombardier would need to remain free to run its business. ""There has got to be the right solution for them and for the business. We are a global company and we work in a very complex environment all around the world, so we have to maintain operational flexibility. It is very critical.""He rebuffed suggestions that a federal aid package, combined with a $1 billion planned investment by Quebec in the CSeries, would lead to the plane programme being nationalised. ""The financial structure around the aircraft doesn't change the fact that this product is a Bombardier product,"" he said.Bellemare was appointed CEO just over a year ago at a time when the CSeries was running short of cash amid weak sales.""There was a rough patch and it was a little bit difficult in 2015, but Bombardier is a solid company with good financial resources today, and we are here to stay.""Asked whether Bombardier would consider expanding its two 110- to 130-seat CSeries models to compete with larger Airbus and Boeing jets, the head of its commercial airplanes unit, Fred Cromer, said, ""At this point it is all on the CS100 and CS300.""(Writing by Tim Hepher, Allison Lampert; Editing by G Crosse and Chris Reese)",2016-06-01,DAL,"Wed Jun 1, 2016 | 6:11pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Bombardier sees more CSeries jet deals after Delta,http://www.reuters.com//article/airlines-iata-bombardier-ceo-idUSL8N18T4UW?type=companyNews

355,"  (Adds detail on deal Iran)By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK, June 2 Boeing Co expects to hit its target of $10 billion in operating cash flow this year and to return all free cash flow to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday.Muilenburg's remarks came after a delay emerged last week with the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program, which raised worries about additional costs.The company is not seeing any new technical problems during flight tests of the tanker for the U.S. Air Force, and has not slowed production of the first 18 aircraft, Muilenburg said at an investor conference in New York organized by Sanford C Bernstein. He did not comment on whether Boeing's earnings would be affected by the tanker delay. The company said last week any potential costs would be accounted for in the second quarter.But investors are focused on Boeing's ability to generate cash amid spending to increase jetliner production and develop three new products: the tanker, the 737 MAX and the 777X. Boeing also is cutting costs to lift profits on its flagship 787 Dreamliner, which has nearly $30 billion in deferred costs. Boeing faces tough competition from European rival Airbus  and increasing encroachment from Canada's Bombardier Inc, which in April sold up to 125 of its  CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines, a deal worth $5.6 billion at list prices.""While it's a competitive environment, it's not one where we have to make bad financial decisions for market share's sake because of the strength of the backlog that we have,"" Muilenburg said when asked if Boeing was cutting prices to win orders. Boeing has 5,720 jetliner orders in its backlog.With aircraft sales slowing, Muilenburg said the prospect of a major order with Iran was moving closer.After talking with Iranian airlines, he said, ""we can see the market demand is real,"" and covers narrowbody and widebody planes. Airbus' announcement of 118 sales is a good indicator of the potential, Muilenburg added.""We see market space that's measured in that category,"" he said. ""You can anticipate that that's potentially a 50-50 kind of marketplace for Boeing and Airbus and we're going to battle it out competitively.""

358,"  (Corrects paragraph 6 to remove repetitive numbers)* Bombardier woos new CSeries buyers at key airline meetings* Accounting charge sheds rare light on aircraft pricing* Bombardier CEO says CSeries re-launched and 'here to stay'By Tim Hepher and Allison LampertDUBLIN/MONTREAL, June 3 Bombardier  performed a high-stake sales pitch for its CSeries jet at 30,000 feet on Friday, hoping to persuade more than two dozen airline bosses to buy the industry's newest fuel-saving model while reining in discounts.The Canadian planemaker flew Star Alliance bosses on board its 110-seat CS100 between airline gatherings in Europe where it sought to preserve momentum after winning a lifeline order for the money-losing jet from Delta Air Lines.""We are in a good place today. We have the contracts ready for you as you exit the plane,"" Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare joked to the 28 leaders on board.Just over a year ago, Bombardier might have had trouble rounding up as many CEOs after seeing Canada's aerospace ambitions waver under the pressure of cash shortages.But while the project survived a near-death experience with Delta's discounted order, Bombardier's rivals and others in the industry predict it will remain on the rack a while longer as others demand equal bargains, keeping the CSeries in the red.""I want the best deal, better than Delta,"" said Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam.He probably won't get that, having expressed interest in 10-15 jets rather than 75 bought by Delta. But his remark illustrates Bombardier's challenge in narrowing CSeries losses. ""The question is whether or not Bombardier will be successful in raising prices,""  said Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director of Germany's DVB Bank.""For this to happen, it needs a few conditions and one of them is a steady growth market.""Bombardier's task is not made easier by an outbreak of transparency in the secretive jet market after it was forced by Canadian accounting rules to take a $500 million charge for the Delta deal and two others totalling 127 planes.Rival jetmakers and analysts quickly calculated Delta had paid $22-23 million a plane, a whopping two-thirds discount.Macquarie analyst Konark Gupta wrote Bombardier could have difficulty getting the CSeries to breakeven by 2020-21 if it keeps selling at such prices.

""I think they have got their work cut out trying to convince others to pay maybe $10-15 million more (than Delta) - why would they?"" said Airbus executive vice-president Chris Buckley.'IMPOSSIBLE' STANDARD Bombardier additionally faces accusations of price dumping from rival Embraer, which it denies.""We have to show the market that this price level is unsustainable,"" said commercial chief Paulo Cesar Silva said.""No company can be viable under the conditions that Bombardier offered in the Delta campaign. That won't be the market standard. It's impossible."" Industry sources say Airbus leased jets as try-outs for as little as $1 a month to enter the U.S. market in the 1980s, but found itself trapped at low prices for years after that.But deals are usually kept secret and Bombardier's provision has shed unusual light on its flexibility.""The next big guy Bombardier talks to is going to say 'will you be taking a $500 million loss for me'?"" an industry source said.Bombardier executives respond that in the cut-throat airliner world, negotiations always start far apart.They acknowledge using 'one-off' price tactics to reboot the troubled project but deny discounting as much as reported, and say others' estimates fail to reflect shifting costs.Bombardier seeks new customers in every continent including a major low-cost carrier to diversify its order book and demonstrate it can serve different business models.While chasing new customers, it must also prevent existing ones delaying or cancelling.Industry sources estimate as many as 100 of the 325 orders are at risk owing to the patchy finances of early customers.But the recent order boost does give the company more visibility on production and strengthens the profile of its order book: two other parameters watched by investors.""If you question some orders, we would not debate that,"" Bellemare said.

370,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Airlines' efforts to help the U.S. government manage long airport security lines are not sustainable, the chief executive of American Airlines Group Inc said in an interview.American, Delta Air Lines Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc have each added $4 million to what they typically spend on workers who stock bins at checkpoints and take care of tasks other than screening, which is handled by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA).This, however, is not a solution to waits that have caused more than 70,000 of American's customers to miss flights this year, CEO Doug Parker said Wednesday in New York.The TSA must add enough staff to handle checkpoints on its own during peak travel times, he said. Recently, the agency has relied on airlines to handle some of its non-screening work.The remarks underscore airlines' concern that fewer people will book flights if lengthy airport waits continue.""I checked into Dallas-Fort Worth on the way out here, and we have - it appeared - at least as many American Airlines employees standing out in front of security helping move the lines as there are TSA agents,"" he said. ""That's neither right nor sustainable."" Parker said a staffing shortage at the TSA, not fuller planes, has caused the crisis.A spokesman for TSA declined to comment.The TSA had aimed for 25 million people to sign up for a pre-vetting service such as ""PreCheck"" that moves travelers through checkpoints three times as fast, and it cut agents accordingly. But only about 10 million travelers have enrolled, and screening lapses prompted the TSA to reduce its practice of pulling regular fliers into those fast lanes. This year, the TSA projects it will screen 15 percent more people than in 2013, with 12 percent fewer agents. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1sMaHZu)Parker said the TSA has been responsive, reallocating funds to hire 768 more agents, though more are needed.One benefit that may come of the crisis is new technology at airports, he said. The TSA worked with Delta and Atlanta Airport to open two lanes that automate the distribution of bins at a checkpoint, a practice in place in Europe. Peter Neffenger, the head of TSA, said the lanes were about 30 percent more efficient.Parker said the lanes let travelers go around those held up in security: ""We’re all waiting for this one person who... left their cell phone in their pocket, and that doesn't happen anymore.""American, the world's largest airline, is working with major airports to roll out the automated lanes, Parker said. He declined to specify which ones.

378,"  (Adds restoration of a portion of Delta cuts and PES no comment)By Jarrett RenshawNEW YORK, July 6 U.S. East Coast refiners have cut production in recent days amid mounting concerns that a glut of supply will hammer profits even as motorists are expected to hit U.S. roads in record numbers this summer.Philadelphia Energy Solutions was the latest East Coast refiner to clip production, reducing output by 10 percent Tuesday night at the 135,000 barrel-per-day Point Breeze section of the Philadelphia refinery complex, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.A Philadelphia Energy Solutions spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday.That news follows Delta Air Lines Inc's decision to cut production by 16 percent at its 185,000 bpd refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, a source told Reuters on Tuesday, citing economic and operational reasons. The steps are unusual because refiners often run at high rates during the summer to meet gasoline demand. It also marks the second round of run cuts this year.About 40,000 bpd has been cut on East Coast, just a small portion of the region's capacity, but the measures reflect, in part, deepening concerns about refiners' profits. Gasoline margins 1RBc1-CLc1 have plummeted more than 30 percent in the past eight trading sessions to February lows. That spread was down nearly 6 percent Wednesday.""The fundamental weakness in gasoline markets is being exemplified by the RBOB crack spread, which is closing in on levels which would encourage refiners to dial back on runs,"" said Matt Smith, analyst at New York-based oil cargo tracker Clipperdata.Delta has since restored roughly 10,000 bpd of the cuts related to operations, a source said Wednesday, but the plant is still running about 11 percent short of capacity, the source said. Delta did not respond to requests for comment by email. Phillips 66 has cut production in the 135,000 bpd gasoline-making unit at its Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, by roughly 6,000 bpd, a source told Reuters on Wednesday, but the source said the reduction is not believed to be related to poor margins.Phillips 66 declined to comment.The U.S. East Coast is brimming with petroleum products, with inventories of gasoline at 72.5 million barrels as of last week, substantially above the five-year average.The 135,000 bpd Point Breeze section of the Philadelphia refinery runs lighter, sweet crudes, like that from the Bakken shale of North Dakota and from the North Sea.

381,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Delta Air Lines Inc's decision to sell fewer seats from the United Kingdom this winter highlights the threat that Britain's planned exit from the European Union and new airline competition pose to U.S. airlines that have raked in cash from flights across the Atlantic.Air travel between the United States and Europe has churned out steady profits in the past decade since top U.S. carriers deepened partnerships with European rivals, consolidating what had been a fragmented, money-losing market outside the summer tourist season. With immunity from U.S. antitrust law, the airlines in four trans-Atlantic joint ventures have shortened layovers, set prices and distributed revenue among them. But a combination of new entrants and economic uncertainty stirred up by Britain's 'Brexit' vote threaten their business.According to travel data analysis company ForwardKeys, Europe was the only region that saw fewer advance bookings by travelers from other continents for the first five months of the year. As of May 31, long-haul bookings to Europe for summer trips were down 2.1 percent this year, compared to bookings made at the same time a year ago, the ForwardKeys study found. A more than 10-percent drop in sterling against the U.S. dollar since the June 23 Brexit vote has chopped some $40 million off Delta's annual UK sales, the company said on Thursday.  In response, it said it will cut 6 percent of its U.S.-UK seats this winter.  ""We have seen some strength in the U.S. point of sale to the UK as the pound has deteriorated,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on an analyst call. ""Likewise, we've seen some reduction in our UK point of sale coming to the United States, and that's why we're making certain of the capacity adjustments combined with overall high levels of capacity in the North Atlantic.""Even so, Delta said this summer was still on track to be one of the most profitable on record for its trans-Atlantic business.

385,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Four U.S. carriers have won tentative approval to launch daytime U.S. flights to Tokyo's Haneda airport as early as this fall, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Wednesday.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines Group Inc, Hawaiian Holdings Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc would gain the rights for flights that depart or land in the day at Haneda, which is closer to Tokyo than Narita International Airport, the department said in a statement. U.S. business travelers and tourists prefer to be at airports in the day.Prior to a U.S.-Japan agreement in February, U.S. carriers could only leave and land in Haneda at late hours in the night.Approvals were given to Delta for flights from Los Angeles and Minneapolis, Hawaiian from Honolulu, American from Los Angeles, and United from San Francisco. Except for Minneapolis, the cities already had night-time flights to Haneda.A final decision will be issued after a public comment period, the department said. Service must begin within 90 days after the decision. The Transportation Department said in a written order that if Delta scaled back its Minneapolis flight plans, the government would cancel the authority and give the flight to American in Dallas.Other airlines have questioned if there was enough traffic to support a Minneapolis route. The department rejected requests for Haneda flights from Dallas by American Airlines, Newark by United and Delta from Atlanta.American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said in an email that the carrier was disappointed that the Dallas flight was not approved and it was considering all options. The airline could file objections to the decision before it is final.In 2010, the Transportation Department selected Delta's Detroit-Haneda service proposal for night-time service, but after less than two years in operation it was canceled in 2012 and moved to Seattle. Delta discontinued the Seattle flight in 2015, saying it was not commercially feasible.  (Reporting by David Shepardson.

389,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), the largest U.S. refiner, expects to get hit with a half-billion-dollar bill in the second half of the year thanks to the rising cost of meeting government mandates to blend biofuels.For the full year, the company's cost to blend renewable fuels like ethanol will swell to between $750 million to $850 million, mainly to pay for the paper credits used to meet the U.S. biofuels program, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the San Antonio, Texas-based refiner said on Tuesday as it reported second-quarter results.The RFS program requires oil refiners and importers to blend more renewable fuel or buy paper credits in an opaque, sometimes volatile market. Compliance credits to meet the standards, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), were about 25 percent higher in the second quarter than a year earlier.It is another blow for the company, which is already dealing with weak refining margins.The price tag would be up from the $440 million Valero paid for biofuels compliance in 2015, the most it has paid to meet RFS requirements since at least 2009, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  Valero spent about $334 million in the first six months of 2016 on biofuels compliance, the company said.Elevated costs for RINs credits are one of the headwinds the company faces, said John Locke, Valero's vice president of investor relations, on a call with investors.  The biofuels program was launched more than a decade ago to boost the use of renewables to cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote energy independence. This year's more ambitious requirements could hurt U.S. refiners, already facing what could be their worst year since the shale boom began.That puts expected second-half costs at as much as $516 million, nearly matching the $517 million it spent for all of 2013, when RIN prices surpassed a record of $1.40 apiece. The current price is around 96 cents.Prices of RINs have been rising since regulators set annual targets in May for the amount of biofuels including ethanol required to blend with gasoline and diesel and as worries have mounted of tightening inventories.  ""If I'm a refiner with a lot of gasoline and distillate production, why wouldn't I be concerned about rising RIN prices? The conditions are there for them to (rise),"" said Timothy Cheung, vice president at ClearView Energy Partners in Washington. He estimated that RIN prices could rise another 25 percent by year-end.Valero and companies such as Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), which owns a refinery, are stepping up their push to get regulators to tweak the program to shift onus to comply further downstream.

392,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Delta Air Lines Inc is flooding the New York market with jet fuel from its refinery, sacrificing refining profits in order to lower the carrier’s fuel costs, according to a company memo seen by Reuters.   The memo, written by the head of Delta’s Monroe Energy subsidiary, says the refinery will act against its own financial interest to try to maintain lower jet fuel prices and save the nation’s second-largest airline money on fuel, its top operating expense.    The unusual move, in a unique situation, adds to long-standing questions about Delta’s decision to purchase the Philadelphia refinery in 2012. Critics have argued that the entire industry benefits from lower jet fuel prices, giving Delta no advantage over its competitors for owning the refinery. Jeff Warmann, who runs the refinery, told employees about the strategy in a July 27 memo. While weak jet fuel margins have hurt the refinery’s bottom line, they have also resulted in lower fuel costs for parent company Delta, Warmann argued.“Normally with such low product prices, a merchant refiner would shift yields and production to other products. We plan to continue to produce jet fuel and pump it into the New York market, pressuring the price of jet fuel to even lower levels,"" Warmann wrote. ""This negatively impacts our refinery economics, but greatly helps reduce Delta’s fuel cost.” The 182,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery based in Trainer, Pennsylvania - about 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Philadelphia - produces roughly 40,000 bpd of jet fuel, accounting for roughly 30 percent of the New York Harbor market, experts say. The memo does not say how long it plans on running with this strategy.The New York Harbor market is the center of U.S. jet fuel trading.SUBSIDIZING RIVALS?  Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston and longtime critic of the airline’s decision to buy the refinery, said at those levels Delta could influence the prices of jet fuel, but noted that its competitors like Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc  enjoy the benefit of those lower costs too, without the burden of running a refinery.""They are using shareholder money to subsidize the other airlines,"" said Hirs. Warmann's memo said the strategy cost the refinery about $30 million in the second quarter, which left it with a $10 million loss for the period, but he said it saved Delta about $100 million. To put that in perspective, Delta reported net profit of more than $1.5 billion in the quarter. Its overall adjusted fuel expense fell $408 million from the same quarter the year before, in spite of $614 million in losses on fuel hedges, a remnant of when prices were much higher. The airline has no fuel hedges for the rest of the year.Three former commissioners of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, said in interviews with Reuters that Warmann’s comments would likely catch the attention of regulators, but that it is not uncommon for energy companies to try to influence commodity prices. They said companies get into trouble when they manipulate commodity prices and take market positions intended to take advantage of their influence. Delta said the action was legal, and not manipulation.“Delta has always said that the refinery is part of an integrated strategy aimed at managing our jet fuel costs. Ensuring supply and lowering fuel costs isn’t manipulation, it’s a natural consequence of owning the business. We are comfortable that our strategy is fully compliant with the law,” a Delta spokesman said Tuesday. PRODUCTION CUT  In recent weeks, the refinery has cut production by nearly 25 percent to help trim high product inventories and weak margins, but nearly all of the cuts have been to gasoline and have not affected jet fuel output, a source told Reuters on Tuesday.East Coast inventories of jet fuel were at 9.2 million barrels last week, lower than at this time of year in the last five years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Refining margins have been hurt by high inventories, causing some refiners to cut runs to trim stockpiles and boost profits.Spot jet fuel prices fell below $1 a gallon earlier this year, their lowest levels since 2009, according to the Energy Department.An executive at a rival East Coast refinery said on Tuesday that Delta may not be putting pressure on jet fuel prices at all, arguing the rising costs of renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, have played a much more important role in pressuring costs. The executive asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak publicly for the company.   CREDITS  Refiners earn credits by blending biofuels like ethanol into gasoline and diesel or buying them in the open market, but jet fuel is exempt from the requirements. The credits averaged about 78 cents apiece in the second quarter of 2016, about 25 percent above the same period a year ago. Jet fuel has sold at a discount against the distillate benchmark price that is roughly equal to the credit price. Jet fuel's discount would be higher than the cost of renewable credits if Delta's strategy was successful, the executive argued. ""The reason jet is cheap isn't because of Delta, it's because of RINs pricing,"" the executive said. After profitable years in 2014 and 2015, Delta's refinery lost $10 million in the second quarter, following a loss of $18 million in the first quarter, and the company expects the refinery to lose money this year.In the memo, Warmann said the combination of high product inventories and the disappearance of cheap domestic crude has conspired to make the third and fourth quarters ""very challenging.""

Flights gradually resumed about six hours later.The disruptions dealt a blow to Delta's efforts to use its recent success in avoiding flight cancellations to win over corporate and leisure customers. With Monday's outage, Delta now joins rivals Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) among airlines that have suffered flight disruptions during the past year due to data system malfunctions.The financial impact from Monday's flight cancellations was not yet clear. Delta said passengers booked for travel Aug. 8-12 would be entitled to a refund if their flight is canceled or significantly delayed. The airline said late Monday it would provide $200 in travel vouchers to all customers who experienced a delay of greater than three hours or a canceled flight as a result of Monday's disruptions. Analyst Jim Corridore of S&P Global Market Intelligence downplayed the impact to Delta, saying it was ""not as severe as a mild snowstorm.""

397,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Major refiners like Valero Energy Corp are on track to pay record amounts this year for credits to comply with U.S. renewable fuel rules, corporate filings show, a trend that hurts profits and has some looking to export more to avoid the cost.Refiners and fuel importers are required to meet a U.S. biofuel quota of roughly 10 percent through blending products like ethanol into gasoline and diesel. If they fall short, they can buy credits generated by companies in compliance. But the cost of the credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), has jumped.The rising costs have hurt a sector already struggling with huge global fuel stockpiles. The S&P 1500 index of refining and marketing companies has fallen 18 percent so far in 2016, compared with a 6.5 percent gain for the broader market.In the first half of 2016, a collection of 10 refinery owners including Marathon Petroleum Corp, spent at least $1.1 billion buying RINs, a Reuters review of their filings showed. This puts them on track to surpass the annual record of $1.3 billion the same group spent in 2013.Refinery executives sharply criticized the regulations during recent earnings calls, saying the burden helped bring about the weakest profits in five years.""RINs continue to be an egregious tax on our business and have become our single largest operating expense, exceeding labor, maintenance and energy costs,"" CVR Refining Chief Executive Jack Lipinski said last month. Marathon Chief Executive Gary Heminger said on a call last month that demand for RINs are going to outpace supply and the company wanted to see renewable fuel standards eased.Refiners without blending or retail outlets, such as Delta Air Lines and CVR, have to buy a greater percentage of RINs because they don't create their own. Delta is part of a refiner group challenging fuel standards through the courts. Supporters of the existing policy, including the influential corn lobby, said the regulations have produced the desired effect: more renewable fuels in the nation's gasoline and diesel. They noted refiners can avoid the cost of RINs by investing in blending operations.""Companies that refuse to blend more renewable fuel will end up paying a premium to other market participants, including speculators, but this is a choice,"" said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, which represents ethanol producers. ESCAPE THROUGH EXPORTS Renewable fuel credits averaged about 78 cents apiece in the second quarter, about 25 percent above the same period a year ago, according to Oil Price Information Service data analyzed by Reuters. Prices for the credits have rallied on more ambitious targets from U.S. regulators on the volumes of ethanol required to be blended with gasoline, traders and industry sources said.The price of credits has fuel makers like PBF Energy Inc and Valero looking to increase exports, which are not subject to the regulations, as a way to escape the costs.PBF Chief Executive Thomas Nimbley said on an earnings call last month that it was ""very important"" that they expand their refined product export operations, citing RINs as a driver. Refiners are also lobbying to shift the responsibility of compliance from their industry to blenders and distributors who mix gasoline with ethanol for delivery to filling stations.

407,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  U.S. airline stocks jumped on Wednesday after Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said sales trends were improving and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) said it would slow its breakneck growth of flights in 2017, giving investors hope that the industry could recover from a revenue rut.Delta Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on a conference call with investors that the airline expected a $150 million drop in pretax income due to a power outage that shut down computer systems in August. The incident forced Delta to cancel 2,300 flights over three days and highlighted airlines' fragile technology infrastructure.Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, now expects an operating profit margin of 18 percent to 19 percent in the third quarter, compared with a prior outlook of 19 percent to 21 percent. However, Jacobson said Delta's underlying performance was on track.""This has been a challenging quarter... but we do have a lot of momentum,"" Jacobson said. ""We see a lot of signs, reasons to be optimistic."" The Atlanta-based airline has not canceled a single flight in the past 10 days, Jacobson said. Domestic unit revenue, a closely watched measure that compares sales to flight capacity, also showed ""solid improvement"" as fall schedules took effect, the company said in a regulatory filing.

408,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  U.S. airline stocks jumped on Wednesday after Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said sales trends were improving and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) said it would slow its breakneck growth of flights in 2017, giving investors hope that the industry could recover from a revenue rut.Delta Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on a conference call with investors that the airline expected a $150 million drop in pretax income due to a power outage that shut down computer systems in August. The incident forced Delta to cancel 2,300 flights over three days and highlighted airlines' fragile technology infrastructure.Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, now expects an operating profit margin of 18 percent to 19 percent in the third quarter, compared with a prior outlook of 19 percent to 21 percent. However, Jacobson said Delta's underlying performance was on track.""This has been a challenging quarter... but we do have a lot of momentum,"" Jacobson said. ""We see a lot of signs, reasons to be optimistic."" The Atlanta-based airline has not canceled a single flight in the past 10 days, Jacobson said. Domestic unit revenue, a closely watched measure that compares sales to flight capacity, also showed ""solid improvement"" as fall schedules took effect, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Delta, No. 2 globally in passenger traffic after American Airlines [AAMRQA.UL], said income fell about 4 percent to $1.3 billion in the third quarter. That nonetheless topped what analysts expected per share on an adjusted basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.While plummeting fuel costs led to a blockbuster rise in U.S. airline profits since 2014, oil prices have to a degree plateaued and no longer are a force to improve the sector's results.At issue now is lower revenue. Budget carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) are fighting larger airlines over a fixed number of travelers and charging less per ticket.Delta said it expects its operating profit margin, excluding items, to shrink to between 14 percent and 16 percent in the fourth quarter from 17.1 percent a year earlier. If pilots approve a union-negotiated contract, analysts said the margin will be lower still.In addition, the third quarter was ""the weakest revenue environment in recent memory,"" Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said on an analyst conference call. Trans-Atlantic flights earned less than expected because attacks in Europe discouraged would-be vacationers, Delta's President Glen Hauenstein said.Norwegian also began flights from New York to Paris, a hub city for Delta's partner Air France KLM SA (AIRF.PA), increasing competition for price-sensitive customers.Hoping to counteract an uptick in rivals' flights, Delta will cut capacity across the Atlantic by 3 percent to 4 percent starting in November, said Hauenstein. Capacity refers to how many seats an airline flies and how far it flies them. Delta also plans to grow capacity just 1 percent in early 2017, versus growth of 2.7 percent in the first quarter of this year.Shares were up 1.5 percent in early afternoon trading.Delta hopes next year's moves will be enough to stop a months-long decline in passenger unit revenue.

440,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Liz Hampton | NEW YORK/HOUSTON  NEW YORK/HOUSTON Major airlines including Delta, United and American could face higher fuel costs if U.S. regulators allow Colonial Pipeline Co to stop shipping a dirtier blend of jet fuel by 2018.The Colonial system carries most of the jet fuel that is delivered via pipeline to the East Coast and used by busy airports serving New York, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, along with U.S. military bases.The pipeline company said earlier this month it would ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to halt shipments of high-sulfur jet fuel and diesel.Preliminary estimates indicate that jet fuel prices could rise significantly if Colonial wins approval, said John Heimlich, chief economist for the industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A).Rising fuel prices could make certain flights unprofitable, forcing airlines to cut service and sell fewer seats - likely at higher prices.It would take jet fuel price increases of 30 to 50 cents per gallon to have a big impact on pricing or flight availability, said Robert Mann, an industry consultant and former executive at American and other airlines. Jet fuel in the New York Harbor traded at about $1.44 per gallon as of Tuesday. A Colonial spokeswoman said the pipeline company was discussing its regulatory proposal with affected airlines but declined further comment to Reuters.The move would allow Colonial, which daily ships more than 3 million barrels of petroleum products, to more efficiently move more low-sulfur products through its pipeline. Cutting down on dirtier fuels would reduce so-called ""transmix,"" which occurs when high-sulfur and low-sulfur products are combined. The resulting mixture has to be refined or blended again.Colonial has not specified what it intends to ship in place of high-sulfur fuels. But the pipeline has been full for about four years, and Colonial would likely see strong demand for any open space.The company shut its gasoline pipeline for the second time in less than two months on Monday after an explosion in Alabama killed one worker and injured five others. It briefly shut the distillates line as well, which transports jet fuel. American Airlines Group Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp declined to comment on Colonial's regulatory proposal, referring questions to A4A. A spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines Co declined to comment, saying the airline is still evaluating the plan.Delta Air Lines Inc may be more insulated from fuel price shocks than others because the company operates a refinery in the northeast U.S. that is heavily geared toward jet fuel production. Delta did not respond to requests for comment.SHIFTING REGULATIONS, DEMAND Colonial's plan is driven largely by waning demand for high-sulfur fuels. Railroad and marine transportation companies, for instance, are using less high-sulfur diesel fuel in response to environmental regulations.Sulfur levels in jet fuel are not currently regulated, however, and the industry still uses high-sulfur fuels widely, in part because they have better lubricating qualities for airplane engines. Airlines can and do use a range of cleaner fuels, Heimlich said, which Colonial would continue to ship under its proposal. But airlines are concerned that many refiners could take years to make upgrades required to produce jet fuel to Colonial's proposed low-sulfur standard.Some refiners would need to invest in desulfurization units known as hydrotreaters, said David Hackett, president of the energy consultancy Stillwater Associates. Or they could update their facilities to process sweet crude instead of high-sulfur sour crude. Either way, refinery costs would go up, and the transition would take time, raising the prospect of airline fuel shortages.""Three years is minimum,"" Hackett said.  POLITICAL, LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES Colonial needs permission from the energy commission to stop shipments of high-sulfur fuel, and the airlines can exert influence on that process. A commission spokeswoman declined to comment, noting that Colonial's proposal has not been formally filed with the agency.At stake is a large portion of the about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of jet fuel that moves from the U.S. Gulf to the East Coast via pipeline, according to U.S. Energy Department data. About two-thirds of East Coast jet fuel demand is currently met by pipeline flows from the Gulf Coast, according to analysts at Energy Aspects. If Colonial wins approval, airports in the southeastern U.S. may turn to Kinder Morgan's 700,000 barrel-per-day Plantation Pipeline, which has less than a third of Colonial's capacity. Kinder Morgan, in a statement, said it is ""evaluating the changing market conditions"" before considering any expansion of shipping high-sulfur jet fuel.If Plantation and other interstate pipelines followed Colonial's lead, it could make supplying airports even more challenging.Trucking fuel to major airports is not feasible due to the sheer volume of fuel needed. Waterborne shipments could be expensive, in part due to the Jones Act, a maritime policy which requires goods transported by water between U.S. ports to be carried on U.S.-flagged ships. That may make it cheaper to import jet fuel, particularly from Europe.

451,"   By Allison Lampert | MONTREAL  MONTREAL Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) pilots are expected to keep existing rules in their new labor contract that prevent the U.S. No. 2 carrier from flying aircraft above a certain weight on regional routes, in a blow to Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011.T), whose latest models exceed that limit.The pilots' new labor contract will keep what is known as a ""scope clause,"" which restricts planes heavier than 86,000 pounds and with more than 76 seats from being flown on regional routes, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Voting results on the new contract are expected on Dec. 1. The clause effectively protects well-paid pilot jobs at major airlines, as it prevents the carrier from using bigger planes on outsourced regional routes, which generally pay less well and have inferior working conditions.When planemakers such as Brazil's Embraer and Japan's Mitsubishi designed their latest regional jets, with heavier but more fuel-efficient engines, they expected the scope clause to have loosened, but unions have managed to hold on to it. Delta's vote will follow similar decisions by unions at American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) earlier this year and in 2015.     Pilots' opposition to relaxing scope clauses is a problem for Embraer’s E175-E2 regional aircraft that is to be delivered in 2020, and Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 jet, slated for delivery in mid-2018, which both exceed the weight limit.UBS downgraded Embraer to a 'sell' rating this week after it resumed coverage, citing risks from the scope clause pushback at American, Delta and United. Analyst Darryl Genovesi said it was unlikely the carriers would fly the E2 on only mainline routes, due to higher costs.      ""This puts the viability of the E175-E2 at risk since most of the demand for it originates at those three airlines,"" Genovesi wrote in a note to clients.MORE EFFICIENT Regional carrier SkyWest Inc (SKYW.O), which operates flights for Delta, among others, is the launch customer for the E175-E2, with 100 firm orders. In a statement, Embraer said its existing E-175 dominates the 70-seat market where it holds 84 percent of market share and the Brazilian planemaker would continue to sell that jet past 2020 if scope clauses do not change.However, the statement said: ""Embraer believes scope clauses will eventually be relaxed in the future as fuel prices increase and airlines look for more efficient products.""  A Mitsubishi spokesman was not available for comment, outside normal business hours in Japan.In September, the company said it is working with customers to address weight issues for the MRJ90, which is about 600 kilograms (1323 lbs) too heavy.     U.S. pilot unions have taken an increasingly hard line on higher salary demands and are making fewer concessions to U.S. carriers. Their current stance against changing scope clauses could, however, be a boon for Embraer's Canadian rival Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), which sees it as an opportunity to boost sales of its CRJ-900, which fits current weight limits, one of the sources said. Mesa Air Group Inc [MESAR.UL] Chief Executive Jonathan Ornstein said he will not purchase new planes that do not comply with existing scope clauses as he does not believe the current limits will be changed in the near future. Instead, the Arizona-based regional carrier will buy more current generation E-175s, along with additional CRJ900s to replace 38 regional jets being phased out over the next four years.""I don't think there's any chance the pilots will change their weight requirements.

The clause effectively protects well-paid pilot jobs at major airlines, as it prevents the carrier from using bigger planes on outsourced regional routes, which generally pay less well and have inferior working conditions.When planemakers such as Brazil's Embraer and Japan's Mitsubishi designed their latest regional jets, with heavier but more fuel-efficient engines, they expected the scope clause to have loosened, but unions have managed to hold on to it. Delta's vote will follow similar decisions by unions at American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) earlier this year and in 2015.     Pilots' opposition to relaxing scope clauses is a problem for Embraer’s E175-E2 regional aircraft that is to be delivered in 2020, and Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 jet, slated for delivery in mid-2018, which both exceed the weight limit.UBS downgraded Embraer to a 'sell' rating this week after it resumed coverage, citing risks from the scope clause pushback at American, Delta and United. Analyst Darryl Genovesi said it was unlikely the carriers would fly the E2 on only mainline routes, due to higher costs.      ""This puts the viability of the E175-E2 at risk since most of the demand for it originates at those three airlines,"" Genovesi wrote in a note to clients.MORE EFFICIENT Regional carrier SkyWest Inc (SKYW.O), which operates flights for Delta, among others, is the launch customer for the E175-E2, with 100 firm orders. In a statement, Embraer said its existing E-175 dominates the 70-seat market where it holds 84 percent of market share and the Brazilian planemaker would continue to sell that jet past 2020 if scope clauses do not change.However, the statement said: ""Embraer believes scope clauses will eventually be relaxed in the future as fuel prices increase and airlines look for more efficient products.""  A Mitsubishi spokesman was not available for comment, outside normal business hours in Japan.In September, the company said it is working with customers to address weight issues for the MRJ90, which is about 600 kilograms (1323 lbs) too heavy.     U.S. pilot unions have taken an increasingly hard line on higher salary demands and are making fewer concessions to U.S. carriers. Their current stance against changing scope clauses could, however, be a boon for Embraer's Canadian rival Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO), which sees it as an opportunity to boost sales of its CRJ-900, which fits current weight limits, one of the sources said. Mesa Air Group Inc [MESAR.UL] Chief Executive Jonathan Ornstein said he will not purchase new planes that do not comply with existing scope clauses as he does not believe the current limits will be changed in the near future. Instead, the Arizona-based regional carrier will buy more current generation E-175s, along with additional CRJ900s to replace 38 regional jets being phased out over the next four years.""I don't think there's any chance the pilots will change their weight requirements. Zero,"" Ornstein said.

454,"   By Allison Lampert and Jeffrey Dastin | MONTREAL/NEW YORK  MONTREAL/NEW YORK Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) pilots on Thursday agreed to a new contract that delivers a 30 percent pay raise by 2019, as the aviation industry deals with mounting demand for higher wages to fly planes at a time of big profits.Delta's pilots last year rejected a tentative contract deal that would have increased wages but cut profit sharing in certain cases. The new contract, backed by 82 percent of pilots at the No. 2 U.S. airline by traffic who voted on ratification, keeps existing gains on profit sharing, according to Delta's unit of the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA).The Delta contract, a four-year deal retroactive to the beginning of this year, could have a snowball effect for higher pay in the industry when the next round of bargaining between pilots and top U.S. airlines gets underway in 2019.United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) pilots, who approved a 19 percent raise in a deal reached earlier this year, will get an extra bump to match Delta's gains thanks to a clause in their current contract.The deal with Delta's 13,000 pilots raises their pay by 18 percent immediately and a cumulative 30 percent by Jan. 1, 2019. For instance, a Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 captain of 12 years would see wages rise to $284.01 per hour in 2019 from $218.15 in 2015.""The new pilot agreement contains an industry-leading package of pay, benefits and work rules,"" Delta said in a statement.Delta and United shares were down slightly in afternoon trading.""Higher labor costs are going to pressure earnings next year, so the best way the airlines can counteract that is raising airfares,"" said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York.However, investors seem to have accepted this as the ""price of doing business,"" Hackel said. U.S. and European commercial pilots are demanding their share of recent gains made by airlines. Top carriers posted record profits in 2015 after years of mergers and slashing costs to survive higher oil prices and the negative effect that the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacked airliner attacks had on air travel.The International Air Transport Association, an airline trade association, has forecast higher-than-expected profits of $39.4 billion for the airline industry this year, with more than half coming from North American carriers.PATTERN BARGAINING  Pilots at multiple airlines say their compensation and benefits are worse now than they were before the 2001 attacks, and they will keep pushing for more.At American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), the world's largest carrier, 737 captains would earn $82,000 less than those at Delta in 2017, under a five-year contract American pilots approved last year, according to figures from the Allied Pilots Association (APA).""This is a pattern bargaining industry. The next contract is always the most generous contract,"" industry consultant Robert Mann said.APA, which represents only American's pilots, said management has refused its requests for a mid-contract adjustment to boost salaries, a source of tension.APA President Dan Carey has said he supports closer ties to its larger peer ALPA, with the goal of negotiating similar working conditions at the country's top carriers. Improved conditions at Delta could also influence current ALPA-led negotiations for pilots at Spirit Airlines Inc (SAVE.O), JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) and Frontier Airlines, though these low-cost carriers are unlikely to offer matching salaries.""We’re asking for the industry standard. And that standard, by virtue of the Delta deal, has increased,"" said Paul Slotten,  negotiating committee spokesman for the union representing Spirit pilots.While work stoppages over low pay rarely take place in the U.S. industry because of hurdles set up by the Railway Labor Act, that is not the case in Europe.Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHAG.DE) canceled nearly 4,500 flights over the past week due to six days of strike action by its German pilots as part of a salary dispute that has cost the German airline hundreds of millions of euros and grounded thousands of flights since early 2014.""Airlines are making a lot of money, and pilots want a piece of it,"" aviation consultant Mike Boyd said.

455,"   By Chris Prentice and Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Delta Air Lines Inc is preparing to market gasoline from a refinery it owns outside Philadelphia, signaling a shift in strategy toward managing the plant as a commercial refiner rather than a dedicated jet fuel supplier.Delta became the first airline to own a refinery when it bought the shuttered plant in 2012, hoping to turn the facility into its own jet fuel supplier and capitalize on cheap oil supplies from a boom in U.S. shale output.Instead of marketing the gasoline and diesel from the 185,000 barrels per day Monroe Energy plant, until now Delta has swapped the billions of dollars of motor fuel for jet fuel under a contract with Phillips 66 that is set to expire next year.Now, Monroe is ramping up to sell small volumes of blended gasoline and ultimately diesel at a distribution center owned by Sunoco Logistics Partners outside Philadelphia, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.The sales will allow Monroe to benefit from motor fuel profit margins, an attempt to turn around a loss-making plant at a difficult time for the refining industry along the U.S. East Coast, added the source.The region's refiners are fighting to survive, as they rely on foreign waterborne crude for supply. Two plants in the region have been shut in the past decade.The company plans to increase sales volumes, including of diesel, over the next year after the Phillips 66 swap agreement expires, according to the source, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak with the press. A Delta spokesman declined to comment on the plan and a Monroe Energy spokesman said the company does not discuss operations.""At this point, they may feel they have better economics to sell the gasoline outright,"" said Robert Mann, a former airline executive and principal at R.W. Mann & Company, Inc.A commercial refiner would look at profit margins for each fuel, which vary seasonally, and adjust production to maximize the output of the fuel with the best margin. Delta has been maximizing jet fuel output, regardless of variations in margins.That may have saved Delta money on jet fuel supplies, but cost it potential profit from producing other products. Mann said if the refiner abandons efforts to maximize jet fuel supply, Delta may reconsider whether owning the plant is worthwhile.DRAG ON PROFITS After a few successful years, the refinery has lost money in 2016 amid an industry-wide slump that has hit East Coast refiners the hardest. The refinery lost $83 million in the first nine months of the year compared to $282 million in profits last year. Monroe Energy slashed employee bonuses to save money earlier this year. But the refiner's manager, Jeff Warmann, told employees then not to worry about mounting losses because the real goal was to pump jet fuel and drive prices down.Monroe, like other merchant refiners, has also taken a hit from rising costs to meet U.S. annual biofuels requirements. Those require refiners who cannot blend biofuels, as mandated by the government, to buy paper credits from those that can. Those credits, called RINs, have soared in cost in the time Delta has owned the plant.In the first three quarters of this year, Monroe paid $130 million to purchase RINs, nearly double the $67 million during the same time the year earlier.Blending ethanol into gasoline will allow Monroe for the first time to generate credits, though it will still meet just a fraction of its total biofuels obligation. Delta has been embroiled in a years-long lawsuit with the Environmental Protection Agency over the scheme, which the airline says are too heavy a burden.

456,"  Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said on Friday it would take a $475 million hit in the fourth quarter from a new contract that hikes pilots' pay retroactively to the beginning of 2016.Delta, the No.2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it would pay profit-sharing and higher wages to pilots, including $380 million for the first three quarters of the year. It expects the payments to push down its operating profit margin for the quarter to between 9.5 percent and 10.5 percent, about five percentage points below its prior outlook.Excluding the effects of the contract, Delta said its margin would be at the high end of its previous forecast. Average fares are stabilizing for U.S. flights booked at the last minute, after falling for months, it said.Delta shares were up 1.5 percent in morning trading.       ""Core results look good,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note. The financial impact of the pilot agreement is ""as expected, though it still stings,"" Baker added. The contract raises wages 30 percent by 2019, just one example of the wage crunch that top airlines are facing.U.S. and European commercial pilots are demanding to share in recent gains by airlines, which slashed costs last decade to survive higher oil prices and the negative effect the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacked airliner attacks had on air travel.    Also on Friday, Delta said passenger unit revenue, which measures sales relative to the capacity and distance of Delta's flights, declined 1 percent in November from a year earlier after falling 6.5 percent in October. The company previously forecast November results year-over-year would be much stronger than October's.
