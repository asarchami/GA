0,"  Jan 9 DuPont said on Thursday that Mark Vergano, a 26-year veteran, will become chief executive of the chemical conglomerate's titanium dioxide business when it is spun off next year.Vergnano will oversee the new company and its 7,500 employees after the spinoff, set for the second quarter of 2015. Vergnano, 55, currently oversees the unit within DuPont. Delaware-based DuPont first announced the deal last October, saying it would use a complex, tax-free transaction to effectively give existing DuPont shareholders 100 percent ownership. The new company, which makes titanium dioxide, a popular pigment found in products ranging from car paint to sunscreen, is expected to be publicly traded.

7,"  By Ben KlaymanDETROIT Feb 5 Aston Martin expanded a recall on Wednesday to cover most of its sports cars built since late 2007 after discovering a Chinese sub-supplier was using counterfeit plastic material in a part supplied to the British luxury sports carmaker.Owned by Kuwaiti and private equity investors, Aston Martin said it would now recall 17,590 cars, including all of its left-hand drive models built since November 2007 and all right-hand drive models built since May 2012.That affects about 75 percent of all vehicles built in that period, a spokeswoman said. Its Vanquish model is not affected.Aston Martin found that Shenzhen Kexiang Mould Tool Co Limited, a Chinese subcontractor that moulds the affected accelerator pedal arms, was using counterfeit DuPont plastic material, according to documents filed with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The material was supplied by Synthetic Plastic Raw Material Co Ltd of Dongguan, according to the documents.The cars are being recalled from model years 2008 through 2014 because the accelerator pedal arm may break, increasing the risk of a crash, according to the NHTSA documents. The engine would return to idle and the driver would be unable to maintain or increase speed, according to the documents.Aston Martin spokeswoman Sarah Calam said there had been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the issue and 22 failed parts had been reported. She said the financial impact to the automaker was small, but did not quantify the total.The cost of the recall is of great interest because Aston Martin has struggled to fund the development of a range of new vehicles while rivals like Bentley, owned by Volkswagen , and Rolls Royce, owned by BMW, have the ability to draw on the resources of their parent firms. Aston Martin's owners include Italian private equity fund Investindustrial, Kuwait-based Adeem Investment and Prime Wagon.Germany's Daimler AG also has stake of less than 5 percent in the British automaker.Of the Aston Martin cars affected in the recall, 7,271 are in Europe and 5,001 in the United States, Calam said. The company sells cars in 41 countries.The latest recall replaces one announced last May and expanded in October. Because of the issue, Aston Martin is now being supplied directly by a DuPont distributor.Both Aston Martin and chemical company Dupont sent people to China to directly supervise the production of all pedal arms, including verifying each bag of DuPont plastic material, Calam said.PIRACY PROBLEM The automaker plans to shift production of the pedal arms from China to the United Kingdom ""as soon as possible"" in 2014,  she said. Last May, Aston Martin initially recalled 2,832 cars globally to replace the accelerator pedal arm after finding the affected part included material that did not meet specifications, Calam said.After another arm broke that was not part of that group, the company expanded the recall to 16,825 cars and required the use of material made by DuPont.When one of the replacement parts broke in December during installation by a U.S. dealer in Connecticut, however, Aston Martin froze the recall and found the counterfeit plastic material was being used in place of the DuPont material, she said.The recall includes all the cars previously repaired, Calam said. Under the recall, Aston Martin will replace the accelerator pedal assemblies.The manufacturer of the throttle pedal assembly that included the counterfeit material is Precision Varionic International Limited, according to the NHTSA documents.The company's quality director, John Penman, did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment.It is not the first time DuPont has dealt with piracy in relation to China.U.S. prosecutors indicted a California businessman in 2011 with stealing DuPont trade secrets in order to sell them to a Chinese company. That trial is ongoing.",2014-02-05,DD,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 1:43pm EST","UPDATE 1-Aston Martin recalls 17,590 cars due to counterfeit material",http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-astonmartin-recall-idUSL2N0LA12O20140205?type=companyNews
8,"   By Caroline Copley | ZURICH  ZURICH Syngenta SYNN.VX is aiming to increase cost-cutting to $1 billion a year by 2018, the world's No. 1 crop chemicals maker said on Wednesday after disappointing the market with an 11 percent fall in profit for last year.Earnings were hit by higher seed production costs, a writedown on seed inventories and lower-than-expected sales in crop protection in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Mike Mack told Reuters.Mack has changed Syngenta's sales model so that a single account manager sells farmers everything from seeds and pesticides to fertilizers and support services, and he aims to boost sales to $25 billion by 2025 from $14.69 billion in 2013.On Wednesday, he pledged to take a more disciplined approach to costs after net profit came in at $1.64 billion, missing the average forecast of $1.7 billion in a Reuters poll. Last year the company made cost savings of $460 million.Syngenta's unfavorable product mix also hurt profitability, with sales of low-margin non-selective herbicides up 24 percent while sales of its higher margin seeds slipped 1 percent, J. Safra Sarasin analyst Philipp Gamper said. ""I think the reshuffling of the organization may have cost them a bit of momentum on the operating level,"" said Gamper, who has a 'neutral' rating on the stock.Vontobel analyst Patrick Rafaisz, who rates the stock a 'buy', said he was cheered by the new efficiency program which he thinks should help improve Syngenta's financial performance after a disappointing 2013.Shares in Syngenta, which have fallen 10 percent this year, fell 3.3 percent to 306.6 francs by 0939 GMT, compared with a 0.6 percent weaker European chemicals sector .SX4P. The stock trades at 14.9 times forward earnings, at a discount to U.S. rival Monsanto's (MON.N) 19.3 times, but at a premium to DuPont's (DD.N) 14.0 times.Sales growth of 5 percent at constant currency rates lagged the 10 percent growth reported by Monsanto and the 13 percent higher sales in DuPont's agriculture business for 2013.Gamper said Syngenta has suffered from its weaker position in corn and soybean seeds than peers. Seed sales for those products dropped 8 percent while the smaller area of diverse field crops rose 18 percent. Syngenta forecast an improvement in its gross margins this year and said cost savings should offset investments in research and development.It reported a margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 19.7 percent, down from 21.9 percent on the year. In 2015, it expects to come in at the lower end of its target for an EBITDA margin in the range of 22 to 24 percent.The cost savings should help it raise the margin to 24 to 26 percent by 2018, it said.The company said it would pay a dividend of 10 francs per share, up 5 percent, and flagged further increases. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a dividend of 10.40 francs.(Editing by Louise Ireland)",2014-02-05,DD,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 7:04am EST",Syngenta promises $1 billion in cost cuts by 2018 as profit drops,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-syngenta-results-idUSBREA140JF20140205?type=companyNews

The German firm did not specify on Tuesday what it meant by a slight increase in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). But analysts had on average forecast a gain of almost 10 percent, and BASF shares fell more than 1.5 percent.""It seems that the company does not want to become too positive, too early,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Markus Mayer, who also pointed to lower-than-expected earnings at some of BASF's speciality chemicals businesses. The German group's fourth-quarter EBIT, adjusted for one-off items, rose 18 percent to 1.45 billion euros ($1.99 billion), beating the 1.38 billion euro average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts, helped by strong margins at its oil and gas as well as its basic petrochemicals divisions.""In the Asian emerging markets and in Eastern Europe, we forecast a significant increase in automotive production,"" the maker of catalytic converters, insulation foam and coatings said.Demand from consumer goods makers in Japan and the United States and from the electronics industry would also shore up earnings in a generally challenging economic backdrop, it added. BASF's largest U.S. rivals, Dow Chemical Co and DuPont, last month sought to boost shareholder value with share buyback programmes after posting forecast-beating quarterly earnings.But BASF, which spent about 10 billion euros on its own stock between 1999 and 2008, reiterated it would focus on expanding and upgrading its network of plants.At 1030 GMT, its shares were down 1.6 percent at 81.92 euros, worse than the 0.4 percent decline of the STOXX Europe 600 Chemicals index.",2014-02-25,DD,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 5:54am EST",UPDATE 2-BASF sees car and consumer industries nudging profit higher,http://www.reuters.com//article/basf-results-idUSL6N0LU0FD20140225?type=companyNews

14,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A California businessman was convicted on Wednesday of stealing DuPont (DD.N) trade secrets to help a state-owned Chinese company develop a white pigment used in a wide range of products.In a San Francisco federal court, a jury found Walter Liew guilty on over 20 criminal counts including conspiracy to commit economic espionage and trade secret theft. It also convicted another defendant, former DuPont engineer Robert Maegerle, on multiple counts as well.U.S. prosecutors contended Liew paid former DuPont employees like Maegerle to reveal trade secrets that would help the Chinese company, Pangang Group, develop a white pigment called chloride-route titanium dioxide, also known as TiO2. The pigment is used to make a variety of white-tinted products, including paper, paint and plastics.Liew was ordered into custody after the verdict. In a statement, his attorney Stuart Gasner said they were ""very disappointed"" in the result.""Walter Liew is a good man in whom we believe and for whom we will continue to fight,"" Gasner said.An attorney for Maegerle could not be reached for comment.Defense attorneys argued Liew never intended to benefit the Chinese government, and that the DuPont materials Liew and Maegerle handled were not trade secrets. The United States has identified industrial spying as a significant and growing threat. DuPont is the world's largest producer of TiO2.Prosecutors also charged Pangang Group (000629.SZ), a steel manufacturer in Sichuan province, in the case, but that indictment stalled after a U.S. judge ruled that prosecutors' attempts to notify Pangang of the charges were legally insufficient.U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in San Francisco said fighting economic espionage is a top priority.""We will aggressively pursue anyone, anywhere who attempts to steal valuable information from the United States,"" she said in a statement. DuPont had filed a civil lawsuit against Liew in 2011 and alerted the FBI, which launched the criminal case. During trial, Liew's attorney called the relationship between DuPont and the government an ""unholy alliance.""Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, countered Liew attended a banquet in 1991 with a number of Chinese officials. In court filings, prosecutors say the banquet was hosted by Luo Gan, who at the time was a high-ranking official of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. Luo Gan went on to become a member of the nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo, prosecutors wrote in a court filing.'PUFFERY'  Liew described the meeting in a draft letter that U.S. federal officials say they seized from his safety deposit box and presented to the jury.""The purpose of the banquet is to thank me for being a patriotic overseas Chinese who has made contributions to China,"" Liew wrote in a memo to a Chinese company, according to U.S. prosecutors, ""and who has provided key technologies with national defense applications, in paint/coating and microwave communications.""Luo Gan gave Liew directives at the meeting, and two days later Liew received a list of ""key task projects,"" including TiO2, prosecutors said. Pangang ultimately paid Liew's company $28 million.Liew's attorney told jurors the letter was merely ""puffery"" on the part of his client.Sentencing for Liew and Maegerle is scheduled for June.The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is United States of America vs. Walter Liew et al., no. 11-cr-573.(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-03-06,DD,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 7:18pm EST",U.S. businessman convicted in China economic espionage case,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-dupont-china-verdict-idUSBREA2501420140306?type=companyNews

18,"  * Stamp to be most valuable object by weight, size ever sold* Is from collection of du Pont heir convicted of murder* Philatelic expert calls expected sale ""a milestone""By Michael RoddyLONDON, March 24 A rare One-Cent Magenta postage stamp printed in British Guiana in 1856 and most recently owned by the estate of a du Pont chemical company heir convicted of murder is expected to fetch a record price of $10-$20 million, Sotheby's said on Monday.The stamp is being sold by the estate of the late John du Pont, who died aged 72 in a Pennsylvania prison in 2010 where he was serving a sentence for the 1996 shooting of Olympic champion U.S. wrestler David Schultz.Du Pont, whose wealth was estimated at $250 million at the time of his 1997 trial, was one of the richest murder defendants in U.S. history at the time of his conviction.Sotheby's said experts from the Royal Philatelic Society London had re-authenticated the British Guiana One-Cent Magenta, the only one of its kind known to exist, and the auctioneer would offer the stamp at auction in New York on June 17.""It is one inch by one and a quarter inches, it's tiny and when it sells it will be the most valuable object by weight and size ever sold,"" David Redden, Sotheby's vice chairman and director of special projects, told Reuters. ""Our estimate on this stamp is $10 million to $20 million. That seems like an awful lot, but in the great scheme of things, across the entire collecting world, the most extraordinary objects in every field, that price suddenly becomes a little modest.""Chris Harman, chairman of the Philatelic Society's expert committee, said the stamp printed in what is now called the Republic of Guyana was without peer.""It's one of the first stamps in the world, 1856, British Guiana was one of the first countries in the world to issue their stamps, and this was a locally printed stamp, of which there are very few Four-Cent, and there's only one One-Cent, so it has gained this iconic status,"" he said.It has not been on public view since 1986, when it was exhibited at a stamp show in Chicago. The last time it was certified as authentic by the Royal Philatelic Society was in 1935, since when several attempts at forging it have been made.The current auction record for a single stamp is 2,875,000 Swiss francs (approximately $2.2 million), set by the Treskilling Yellow in 1996. FAMILY FORTUNE Du Pont, who purchased the One Cent in 1980, was a great-great-grandson of E.I. du Pont, who in 1802 founded the chemical firm that bears his name and created one of America's largest family fortunes.Du Pont was found guilty but mentally ill in connection with Schultz's death. During the trial, his attorney said du Pont suffered from delusions.The One-Cent Magenta was printed in British Guiana in 1856 after a shipment of stamps from England was delayed, which threatened a disruption of postal service throughout the colony. The postmaster turned to the printers of the local Royal Gazette newspaper, and commissioned a contingency supply: the One-Cent Magenta, a Four-Cent Magenta, and a Four-Cent Blue.The sole-surviving example of the One-Cent was first rediscovered not far from where it was initially purchased.In 1873, L. Vernon Vaughan, a 12-year-old Scottish schoolboy living with his family in British Guiana, found the stamp among a group of family papers bearing many British Guiana issues.A budding stamp collector, Vaughan added it to his album and later sold the stamp to another collector in British Guiana.The One-Cent entered Britain in 1878, and shortly after, it was purchased by Count Philippe la Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the greatest stamp collectors in history.France seized his collection, which had been donated to the Postmuseum in Berlin, as part of the war reparations due from Germany, and sold the stamp in 1922.It changed hands several times after that before du Pont, an avid philatelist, paid $935,000 for the stamp in a 1980 auction, marking its most recent record-setting price.""I don't think any of us will probably see it again in our lives, and so that is a milestone,"" Harman said.

19,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $919.9 million jury verdict that favored DuPont Co over the alleged theft of its trade secrets related to a fiber used to make Kevlar bulletproof vests.The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia voided the September 2011 verdict against Kolon Industries Inc, saying the trial judge wrongly excluded evidence that was material to the South Korean company's defense. It also ordered that a new judge be assigned to the case.A Richmond jury had awarded the damages after finding that Kolon had willfully and maliciously stolen 149 DuPont trade secrets relating to the latter's Kevlar para-aramid fiber, used to make tires, fiber-optic cables and body armor.The 4th Circuit said it was ruling ""with reluctance,"" noting that Kolon and five executives were criminally charged in August 2012 with trade secret theft, after the FBI obtained what the court called ""compelling evidence of Kolon's misconduct.""In a separate decision on Thursday, the 4th Circuit upheld the dismissal of Kolon's antitrust countersuit accusing DuPont of trying to monopolize the U.S. market for para-aramid fiber.Both civil cases and the criminal case had been overseen by U.S. District Judge Robert Payne in Richmond.The 4th Circuit directed that Payne be replaced in the trade secrets case, after Kolon had argued that he should have recused himself because of a conflict of interest. It is unclear whether Payne will stay on the criminal case.Thomas Sager, DuPont's general counsel, said in a statement that the Wilmington, Delaware-based company is disappointed that the damages award was thrown out. ""We will continue to vigorously pursue Kolon to hold them accountable and are confident that we will prevail,"" he said.Kolon's lawyer Jeff Randall, a partner and co-chair of the intellectual property practice at Paul Hastings, said the company is pleased that the damages award was overturned.""All Kolon has ever asked for in this litigation is an opportunity to fully present its defense,"" Randall said in a phone interview. ""DuPont has for decades published details about Kevlar in hundreds and hundreds of publicly available patents. A significant part of our defense is to be able to show that.""Shares of DuPont were down 20 cents at $67.92 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.""FUNDAMENTAL ERROR""  DuPont began the litigation in February 2009, claiming that Michael Mitchell, a 24-year DuPont veteran, had taken proprietary information about Kevlar when he left in 2006 to start his own fiber business, and later shared it with Kolon.The 4th Circuit said Payne erred by excluding Kolon evidence suggesting that DuPont had disclosed some of the trade secrets in earlier litigation against rival Akzo Nobel NV.While not deciding whether any of this evidence should have been admitted, the 4th Circuit said Payne's ""blanket exclusion"" of the evidence ""severely prejudiced"" Kolon.""Absent fundamental error, we are loath to overturn a jury verdict in a civil case,"" the court said in an unsigned opinion. ""Jury trials are expensive, in time and resources, both for the litigating parties and for society as a whole. We are constrained to fund such a fundamental error in this (case).""In the antitrust action, Kolon argued that DuPont violated the Sherman Act by having held a more than 70 percent U.S. market share of para-aramid fibers, and requiring big customers to buy 80 percent or more of their fibers from the company.But the 4th Circuit said DuPont's market share had fallen below 60 percent during the 2006 to 2009 period at issue, and was in the midst of a ""steady, decades-long loss"" of market share to another rival, Japan's Teijin Ltd.""In light of DuPont's reduced market share and lack of durable market power, the evidence cannot sustain a jury finding that DuPont had the power to control prices or exclude competition, or was truly predominant in the market,"" Circuit Judge Albert Diaz wrote.Much of Diaz's opinion focused on Kolon's effort to have Payne recused because he had been a partner in a law firm, now known as McGuireWoods, that represented DuPont in the Akzo litigation at the time of that case.Kolon, however, did not file its recusal motion until November 2011, and Diaz said Payne had the discretion to conclude that Kolon waited too long. One judge dissented, saying the antitrust case should be revived before a different judge.The cases in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are E.I. DuPont de Nemours Co v. Kolon Industries Inc, Nos. 12-1260 and 12-2070; and Kolon Industries Inc v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours Co, No. 12-1587. The criminal case is U.S. v.

22,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Kanika Sikka  Chemicals maker DuPont (DD.N) expects its agriculture business to grow this quarter as farmers buy seeds and insecticides after a delayed start to planting season in North America, which hurt the company's revenue in the first quarter.Shares of DuPont, a Dow 30 component, were down about 1 percent at $67.19 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.DuPont said it expected ""modest"" growth in sales and ""significant"" growth in operating earnings in its agriculture business in the current quarter.Sales in the agriculture business, DuPont's biggest, fell 6 percent, the first decline in 10 quarters, as farmers put off purchases due to a colder-than-usual winter.""Impact of the weather pushed a lot of the agriculture demand out of the quarter and into the second quarter,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst James Sheehan said.DuPont's operating earnings fell 5 percent to $1.44 billion in the agriculture business.Farmers' plans to sow more soybean than corn this year is also hurting DuPont as corn is more profitable for the company and corn plantings need more pesticides.DuPont said lower-than-expected corn plantings in Brazil, North America and Ukraine would likely hurt its farm unit in the first half of the year. However, Chief Executive Ellen Kullman told reporters on a call that the company's ""growth fundamentals in agriculture continue to be excellent both in the United States and on a global basis.""DuPont reaffirmed its 2014 operating earnings forecast of $4.20-$4.45 per share.""I think the theme is an ongoing recovery in most of DuPont's end markets, lean corporate management, and new products and solutions driving sales,"" said Eric Linser of Avant-Garde Advisors, a wealth management firm that owns DuPont shares.First-quarter operating earnings rose in five of DuPont's seven units, including in industrial biosciences, nutrition and health and performance materials businesses.As part of a strategy to move into less volatile businesses, the company is hiving off its performance chemicals unit, which has weighed on results since 2012 due to weak prices for a white pigment used in toothpastes, sunscreens and other products.

Farmers' plans to sow more soybean than corn this year is also hurting DuPont as corn is more profitable for the company and corn plantings need more pesticides.DuPont said lower-than-expected corn plantings in Brazil, North America and Ukraine would likely hurt its farm unit in the first half of the year.However, Chief Executive Ellen Kullman told reporters on a call that the company's ""growth fundamentals in agriculture continue to be excellent both in the United States and on a global basis.""DuPont reaffirmed its 2014 operating earnings forecast of $4.20-$4.45 per share.""I think the theme is an ongoing recovery in most of DuPont's end markets, lean corporate management, and new products and solutions driving sales,"" said Eric Linser of Avant-Garde Advisors, a wealth management firm that owns DuPont shares. First-quarter operating earnings rose in five of DuPont's seven units, including in industrial biosciences, nutrition and health and performance materials businesses.As part of a strategy to move into less volatile businesses, the company is hiving off its performance chemicals unit, which has weighed on results since 2012 due to weak prices for a white pigment used in toothpastes, sunscreens and other products.Operating earnings in the business, which also makes materials used in non-stick cookware and refrigerants, fell 20 percent in the quarter.INVESTOR ACTIVISM  Analysts speculate that the planned sale of DuPont's performance chemicals unit was at the behest of Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management disclosed a stake in the company last year.Peltz called DuPont's stock undervalued, but did not spell out how he seeks to increase value.

28,"   By Cezary Podkul | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 15 Nearly three dozen advanced biofuel companies including DuPont and Spain's Abengoa  appealed to President Barack Obama on Thursday to rethink the methodology for setting U.S. biofuel blending quotas.In their letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, 33 suppliers of ""advanced"" biofuels such as lower-carbon ethanol made from corn stovers, said the proposed cuts ""are too aggressive"" and said the final rule should increase the volumes.The groups also urged the administration to rethink the way it arrives at the figures. This added a new wrinkle in the months-long debate over the biofuel rules, as the agricultural industry makes a last-ditch effort to fight the proposed cuts.Within weeks, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to make a final decision on 2014 quotas for blending biofuels into U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel. In November, the EPA proposed reducing the quotas. That unprecedented decision was a historic win for oil refiners, who oppose the quotas, but a blow for farm and biofuel groups.At 15.21 billion gallons, the EPA's 2014 proposal is nearly 3 billion gallons below the 18.15 billion required under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2007 law mandating steadily growing use of biofuels like advanced and corn-based ethanol. The EPA is widely expected to make some changes in its final rule, including an upward revision in quotas.While much attention has been paid to the where the quotas may ultimately fall, the advanced biofuel industry urged the administration to focus attention on how the EPA arrives at them. ""It is not clear that the Administration yet recognizes that its proposal changes how the RFS works at a fundamental level, and that this methodological shift would effectively undercut advanced biofuel projects under development,"" the companies wrote.In proposing the cuts, the EPA used a provision of the Renewable Fuel Standard which allows it to adjust the blending requirements in case of ""inadequate domestic supply"".But the law does not specify what ""inadequate domestic supply"" means, an ambiguity which allowed the EPA to view supply constraints in terms of distribution and consumption. Gasoline is limited to 10 percent ethanol content for cars manufactured before 2001, and the vast majority of gasoline stations do not supply higher blends - a limitation called the ""blend wall"" which the EPA explicitly cited in its proposed rule.To address the issue, the EPA scaled down the mandates such that ethanol would not comprise more than 10 percent of gasoline demand, and then added its estimates of advanced biofuel production to come up with the overall biofuel quota.The advanced biofuel producers warned that this method gives the oil industry the upper hand in deciding how much biofuel is ultimately consumed.""This interpretation has the practical effect of handing the future trajectory of the RFS to the oil industry by virtue of the fact that the oil industry itself controls the distribution of fuel to consumers,"" the firms wrote.

29,"  * Real-life wrestling murder at prestigious 12-day festival* Steve Carell unrecognisable as Du Pont heir in Foxcatcher* Cronenberg's ""Maps to the Stars"" also has Cannes premiereBy Alexandria SageCANNES, France, May 19 Inner demons are at the emotional core of ""Foxcatcher"", Bennett Miller's compelling film about the 1996 murder of a wrestling champion by the heir to the prominent U.S. Du Pont family, premiering at the Cannes film festival on Monday.It is the first time at Cannes for U.S. director Miller, whose 2005 film ""Capote"" earned him a nomination as Best Director at the Academy Awards and a Best Actor win for its star, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.The top-notch cast includes Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo as Olympic champion brothers Mark and Dave Schultz, and a cast-against-type and completely unrecognisable Steve Carell as John du Pont, a role Miller said was ""far out of his (Carell's) comfort zone"".""My athletes consider me as a brother, a father and a leader,"" Du Pont boasts during the film after he establishes a training camp for amateur wrestlers on the grounds of his family's sprawling mansion.But the reality is darker and far less flattering. An odd character shut inside his world of privilege and surrounded by his mother's (Vanessa Redgrave) equestrian trophies, Du Pont suffers from an inferiority complex.Yet delusions of grandeur, and a deep-seated assumption that money can buy him anything, see him overstepping his role as benefactor as he clearly yearns to be part of the team - wearing a warm-up suit with his athletes and calling himself their coach and mentor.Despite the sweat and muscle that are the backdrop, it is a quiet and intensely psychological film that explores the ultimately fatal relationship between du Pont and the two brothers.""There's a lot of American male repressed non-communication happening in this film,"" Miller told journalists and critics at a press conference. ""There's an undercurrent beneath the undercurrent. Every scene is just the tip of the iceberg."" The real Mark Schultz visited the set during filming.""Having Mark there was emotionally very intense because he was sort of reliving a difficult time for him,"" said Ruffalo. ""You go through a bad time in your life once and then you have to go through it again on a movie set, that's a little heavy.""As for Carrel, Miller said he had trusted his instincts that the actor lauded for his skills at comedy could handle the transformative role.Approaching a dramatic role is no different from a comedic one, the actor said: ""I don't think that characters in films know that they're in a comedy or a drama, they're just characters in a film."" GROSS SELF-ABSORPTION The prestigious 12-day festival on the palm-lined French Riviera is now in its sixth day. Also due to hit the red carpet on Monday evening were Robert Pattinson and Julianna Moore, stars of ""Maps to the Stars"" by a Cannes regular, Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg.Often called Cronenberg's answer to Robert Altman's scathing attack on Hollywood, 1992's ""The Player,"" the film centres on an aging actress (Moore) and daughter of a famous film star desperate to land a role playing her now-dead mother.Taken to task in Bruce Wagner's script are a myriad of soft targets that make Hollywood tick - the personal assistants called ""chore whores"", the daily healing massages, the teenage stars, limousines and agents and the gross self-absorption.Cronenberg denied that his film was Hollywood-centric, saying its themes of monstrous egotism, callous self-advancement and privilege applied elsewhere.""You could set this in Silicon Valley, you could set it on Wall Street, anywhere people are desperate, ambitious, greedy, fearful,"" Cronenberg said. ""You could really set it anywhere and still have that same tone and same ring of truth.""Reaction to the film after a Sunday night press screening was mixed. The Hollywood Reporter said it was ""a prank more than a coherent take on 21st century Hollywood"" and, in a broadly positive review, Britain's Guardian called it ""vivisectional in its sadism and scorn"".

DuPont shares lost 4 percent to $65 and were among the biggest negative influences for the Dow and S&P 500, a day after  it cut its operating profit forecast for the quarter and full year, mainly due to a worse-than-expected performance at its agriculture and performance chemicals units.It was among the latest companies to warn on the quarter, with the ratio of negative to positive outlooks at 4.2 to 1, higher than the long-term average of 2.6 to 1, Thomson Reuters data showed.""I think what we're in the midst of is a mini correction in which prices have finally achieved a certain valuation level that has become increasingly uncomfortable for market participants in the absence of further decisive evidence that the economy is on the right track,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

35,"  (Adds comments from parties and case background, paragraphs 3-10)By Dan LevineOAKLAND, Calif., July 10 A California businessman was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Thursday for stealing DuPont trade secrets to help a state-owned Chinese company develop a white pigment used in a wide range of products.A jury found Walter Liew guilty earlier this year on over 20 criminal counts, including conspiracy to commit economic espionage and trade secret theft. The government had requested a sentence between 17-1/2 years and nearly 22 years. Attorneys for Liew, 56, argued he should receive a maximum of eight years.The United States has identified industrial spying as a significant and growing threat to the nation's prosperity.     Prosecutors also charged Pangang Group, a steel manufacturer in Sichuan province, in the Liew case, but that indictment stalled after a U.S. judge ruled that prosecutors' attempts to notify the Chinese company of the charges were legally insufficient. At Thursday's sentencing, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said Liew ""turned against his adopted country for greed,"" adding that a ""loud message"" must be sent to those looking to steal from American companies.An attorney for Liew, Stuart Gasner, declined to comment outside court. But during the hearing, he argued that Liew's sentence should be limited because the trade secrets at issue were not very valuable to DuPont. Liew, in custody since the jury returned its verdict, was clad in a yellow prison jumpsuit at his sentencing and apologized for his actions for what a government lawyer said was the first time. ""I feel terrible about it,"" Liew said.At trial, U.S. prosecutors argued Liew met with Chinese officials who directed him to seek technologies that could help the country. He then paid former DuPont employees to reveal trade secrets to help Pangang Group develop a white pigment called chloride-route titanium dioxide, also known as TiO2, the government argued. The pigment is used to make a variety of white-tinted products, including paper, paint and plastics. Outside court, DuPont attorney Michael Clarke told reporters the company operates TiO2 plants in several countries. ""Theft of proprietary information puts those jobs at risk,"" he said.Pangang paid Liew's company $28 million, according to prosecutors. White ordered that amount of money forfeited to the government, and fined Liew's company, an engineering consulting firm, about $19 million.The judge acknowledged that Liew fought his way out of poverty and was a loving father. However, White said the businessman embarked on ""a virtual white collar crime spree.""The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is United States of America vs. Walter Liew et al., no. 11-cr-573.

41,"   By Carey Gillam  DuPont  will pay a fine of $1.275 million and spend an estimated $2.3 million more to settle claims by U.S. officials that the global chemical conglomerate failed to prevent toxic releases of hazardous substances in West Virginia that killed at least one man, environmental regulators said on Wednesday.E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co reached the settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Justice in a case about eight alleged releases of harmful levels of hazardous substances between May 2006 and January 2010 from a DuPont facility in Belle, West Virginia, the EPA said.Several of the releases posed ""significant risk to people"" and a nearby river, the government said in statement announcing the settlement. One DuPont worker died after exposure to a toxic gas released due to DuPont’s ""failure to comply with industry accident prevention procedures,"" the EPA said.    The problems came to light in January 2010 when plant operators discovered that more than 2,000 pounds of methyl chloride had been leaking, and employees had failed to respond to alarms triggered by the release. In addition to the $1.275 million penalty, DuPont is to take corrective actions to prevent future releases. The company has estimated it will spend $2.276 million to complete required improvements. The company said it already has spent nearly $7 million to comply with an EPA order for corrective measures.DuPont expressed deep ""regret"" for the death of its employee in a statement issued Wednesday and pledged tight controls. ""We remain committed to meeting all regulatory requirements and operating at the highest standards for protection of our employees, contractors, community and the environment,"" the company said.The EPA said that inspections of DuPont's records identified five incidents in which the company released harmful quantities of hazardous substances and then did not report the releases in a timely manner. The largest of these was the release of 80 tons of methanol into the Kanawha River in West Virginia on Sept. 21, 2010.

44,"   By Ayesha Rascoe | WASHINGTON, Sept 9  WASHINGTON, Sept 9 The nascent U.S. cellulosic ethanol industry has urged the White House to change course on targets for biofuel use, warning in a letter to President Barack Obama on Tuesday that current policy risks losing investments to China and Brazil.Federally set mandates for the use of fuels such as corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol, made from plant waste like grasses and wood, must be based on the industry's ability to produce the fuel, not on infrastructure restraints, executives of several biofuel companies wrote.The Environmental Protection Agency rocked the biofuels industry last year with a draft plan slashing requirements for blending renewable fuels into U.S. gasoline and diesel in 2014.Companies including POET LLC, Abengoa Bioenergy and Dupont told Obama that investments in innovative fuel technology could be lost if EPA does not reconsider.""If the proposed methodology is not fixed in the final rule ... the 2014 rule will have inadvertently done more than your worst critics have to harm a low carbon industry you have always championed,"" the executives said. Following a backlash to the initial proposal, the companies said they expect the administration to raise the targets from the proposed rule to the final rule, sent to the White House for review in August.But an increase in targets will not be enough to support new  investment, the companies said, as long as the agency continues to limit targets based on the number of fueling pumps available to dispense higher blends of ethanol in gasoline - a variable mostly controlled by big oil companies. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires increasing amounts of ethanol and biodiesel to be mixed into U.S. fuel supplies each year until 2022.The EPA said it lowered the targets for 2014 because the nation had reached a point where the law would require ethanol to be blended into gasoline at levels higher than the 10 percent per-gallon mixture that dominates retail fuel stations.But capping ethanol at 10 percent of the fuel supply will not give oil companies any incentive to invest in new fueling equipment, and the biofuel program will ""cease to be effective,"" the companies said. After years of falling far short of the targets set by Congress, makers of cellulosic biofuels are starting to gain some momentum.While 2014 production will come nowhere near the 1.75 billion gallon target originally set by Congress, POET and Dutch food and chemicals group DSM last week jointly opened a plant in Iowa with an initial production target of 20 million gallons a year using corn cobs, stalks and other crop waste as its feedstock.Quad County Corn Processors opened a plant this week that should produce 2 million gallons cellulosic ethanol a year.It is unclear how much cellulosic ethanol will be produced in 2014. EPA's draft proposal set the target at 17 million gallons.

56,"  (Adds Honeywell and Dupont's comments)By Foo Yun Chee and Barbara LewisBRUSSELS Oct 21 U.S. firm Honeywell International Inc's joint venture with chemicals company DuPont to produce a new refrigerant for car air conditioning systems to meet new environmental rules may be anti-competitive, the European Commission said on Tuesday, following a near-three year probe.The Commission said the agreements between the two companies related to the new coolant, known as R1234yf, may have blocked rivals keen to participate in its development and production.The coolant, which is designed to meet an EU directive aimed at reducing the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases in car air conditioning systems, has pitted EU regulators against Germany and its powerful car makers led by Daimler. Last month the Commission ordered Germany to stop its carmakers using a banned refrigerant with a higher ""global warming potential"" than the Honeywell-Dupont product within two months or face court action and possible fines.The new R1234yf coolant is already used in about 2 million cars globally.When Honeywell and Dupont announced a joint venture to construct and operate a global manufacturing plant for the new refrigerant they said they had developed the product jointly but would market and sell it separately. ""The cooperation they entered into in 2010 ... may have limited its (the R1234yf refrigerant's) availability and technical development, in breach of EU antitrust rules,"" the Commission said in a statement on Tuesday.It sent a so-called statement of objections or charge sheet setting out its concerns to the companies. Honeywell rejected the charges, saying it had complied with EU rules.""The allegations outlined in the statement of objections are baseless and conflict with the EU's own laws that encourage collaboration on development,"" the company said in a statement.DuPont said it was disappointed with the Commission's move  and that it would defend its case vigorously.The firms can ask for a closed-door hearing to argue their case. If found guilty, they could face fines of up to 10 percent of their global turnover.

DuPont said on Tuesday it expected ""sluggish growth in the global economy, along with continuing headwinds in agriculture and from currency"" in the fourth quarter ending December.The agriculture unit recorded a 4 percent fall in sales in the three months ended September, the third straight quarterly decline. The business accounts for about a fifth of net sales.DuPont, which is spinning off its performance chemicals unit, said related costs would be about 16 cents per share this year. Trian said last month that efforts underway at DuPont were not enough to fix ""underperformance"".Trian's $1.6 billion stake in DuPont translates into about 23.5 million shares, making it the sixth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.Kullman said on the call she was ""confident"" the company's plan would deliver ""sustained and superior value"" for its shareholders.DuPont has announced a $5 billion share purchase program and also plans to cut $1 billion in annual costs by 2019. The company is reducing its global workforce in the ""low single digits"" in percentage terms. DuPont has about 58,000 employees in more than 90 countries. ""We're very cost focused and we see an opportunity for over a billion dollars currently,"" Kullman told Reuters.Total operating earning margins across the company's units improved 1.3 percentage points in the third quarter.DuPont forecast a 20 percent rise in fourth-quarter operating earnings from 59 cents per share, a year earlier. That works out to about 71 cents, compared with the average analyst estimate of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.On an adjusted basis, DuPont reported earnings of 54 cents per share, just above the average analyst estimate of 53 cents.Net sales fell by 3 percent to $7.51 billion due to portfolio changes, the company said.

60,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Kanika Sikka  DuPont (DD.N) said there were ""competitive advantages"" in keeping its businesses together after higher operating margins in five of its seven units helped the company report a slightly better-than-expected quarterly profit.Activist investor Nelson Peltz has urged DuPont to separate its agriculture, nutrition and health, and industrial biosciences divisions from the more volatile but strong cash flow-generating materials businesses.""Our current capital structure provides us with important financial flexibility we need to pursue strategic growth opportunities in light of regional and highly seasonal agricultural cash flows,"" Chief Executive Ellen Kullman said on a post-earnings call.Kullman said there had been a number of ""constructive discussions"" with Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP.DuPont said on Tuesday it expected ""sluggish growth in the global economy, along with continuing headwinds in agriculture and from currency"" in the fourth quarter ending December. The agriculture unit recorded a 4 percent fall in sales in the three months ended September, the third straight quarterly decline. The business accounts for about a fifth of net sales. DuPont, which is spinning off its performance chemicals unit, said related costs would be about 16 cents per share this year.Trian said last month that efforts underway at DuPont were not enough to fix ""underperformance"". Trian's $1.6 billion stake in DuPont translates into about 23.5 million shares, making it the sixth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. Kullman said on the call she was ""confident"" the company's plan would deliver ""sustained and superior value"" for its shareholders.     DuPont has announced a $5 billion share purchase program and also plans to cut $1 billion in annual costs by 2019. The company is reducing its global workforce in the ""low single digits"" in percentage terms. DuPont has about 58,000 employees in more than 90 countries.""We're very cost focused and we see an opportunity for over a billion dollars currently,"" Kullman told Reuters.Total operating earning margins across the company's units improved 1.3 percentage points in the third quarter.  DuPont forecast a 20 percent rise in fourth-quarter operating earnings from 59 cents per share, a year earlier. That works out to about 71 cents, compared with the average analyst estimate of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.On an adjusted basis, DuPont reported earnings of 54 cents per share, just above the average analyst estimate of 53 cents.   Net sales fell by 3 percent to $7.51 billion due to portfolio changes, the company said. Analysts on average had estimated $7.95 billion.

Holliday, 66, also headed the 10-member executive committee of the United Nations' and World Bank's Sustainable Energy for All initiative, launched in 2009.""We have seven billion people on the planet but we have enough resources for about four billion,"" Holliday says in a video posted on the initiative's website.

66,"  (Adds comment from DuPont and Dow)By Carey GillamNov 17 Crop-devouring armyworms are showing increasing resistance in some U.S. farm fields to a popular type of genetically modified crop that should kill them, scientists said on Monday.The evolution of insect resistance ""is a great threat"" long- term to the sustainability of the GMO crop biotechnology that has become a highly valued tool for many U.S. farmers, according to Fangneng Huang, an entomologist at Louisiana State University (LSU) and lead researcher for a three-year study.The study was published on Monday in the PLOS One online journal (www.plosone.org) for peer-reviewed research, after being presented at the Entomological Society of America annual meeting in Portland, Oregon.The research documents resistance by fall armyworms in the southeastern United States to the Cry1F protein found in many  corn products developed by Dow AgroSciences and DuPont  to fight off the destructive pests. It is the latest evidence in recent years showing that insects are developing resistance to crops that have been genetically modified to kill them.Like ""super weeds"" that have developed resistance to glyphosate-based herbicide and make it harder for farmers to keep fields from being overrun with weeds, the armyworms are starting to devour corn crops that should repel them, said Dominic Reisig, an entomologist at North Carolina State University. Armyworms can be a problem for farmers in many U.S. states, but the resistant armyworms have been documented only in some areas of Florida and North Carolina. The range of these resistant armyworms is unknown, researchers said.They said farmers should plant more non-GMO corn as a refuge and possibly increase the use of pesticides to control the resistance.The GMO corn at issue contains Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes. Bt corn, popular with farmers throughout the Americas, has been on the market roughly 18 years. Newer types of Bt corn with multiple modes of action are still showing effectiveness, Huang said. ""We don't know how long they can last,"" Huang said.Officials with Dow said fall armyworm resistance is nothing new and not a significant problem. DuPont said the company was trying to help farmers manage fall armyworms, and said the Cry1F protein still offers benefits.Researchers have also expressed concerns about Bt resistance in western corn rootworm.The study was conducted by researchers from LSU, North Carolina State University, the University of Florida, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the University of Minnesota and the University of Georgia.

70,"  * China allows imports of Syngenta corn MIR 162* Also approves DuPont, Bayer biotech soybeans* But bottleneck to prevent further approvals   (Recasts, adds context, analyst comments)By Tom Polansek and Niu ShupingBEIJING/CHICAGO, Dec 18 China has approved the import of a genetically modified corn strain it blocked last year, causing market turmoil, and has given clearance to biotech soybeans that had been waiting years for clearance, in a sign of improving relations with the United States.U.S. Agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack said on Wednesday that China approved imports of American-grown Viptera corn developed by Swiss-based Syngenta, known as MIR 162, as well as shipments of biotech soybeans developed by DuPont Pioneer and Bayer CropScience.Industry sources and analysts said China's change of heart was down to a warmer political climate between Beijing and Washington since the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum last month, where the two announced a joint plan to limit carbon emissions and made breakthroughs on eliminating duties on technology products.""We believe the approval came because of a better China-U.S. relationship, which has improved since the APEC meeting,"" said Li Qiang, chief analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Ltd, one of the country's leading consultancies.The green light, for which Syngenta had waited nearly five years, does not represent a fundamental change in Chinese policy towards genetically modified food, since it already allows imports of at least 15 varieties of such crops. Vilsack said the import approvals did not represent a loosening of China's sluggish regulatory review process for GMO crops, either.""Their system is what it is,"" said Vilsack. ""You get approvals sometimes, and sometimes you don't.""The practical consequences are also likely to be limited by a big stock overhang in China that is creating a bottleneck for new imports.Trade sources said Beijing could delay the issuance of 2015 import quotas to private feed mills until March or even April 2015 as new regulations require buyers to first purchase corn from state reserves before being handed down quotas. Syngenta applied for import approval of MIR 162 in 2010, while Germany's Bayer has been waiting seven years for China to approve a new soybean seed called LL55.HOMEGROWN AMBITIONS There remains a backlog of products waiting for a licence to sell into China. Another Syngenta genetically modified variety known as Agrisure Duracade, which U.S. farmers harvested for the first time this autumn, has not been approved for import in China.""China has not approved other GMO strains (by Syngenta), and that may become a potential risk for business,"" said Li at JC Intelligence.China may be dragging its feed on new GMO approvals as government officials fear over-reliance on foreign GMO technologies.China's Agriculture Minister Han Changfu said in May that the government needed to develop its own GM technologies to meet its food security needs.Syngenta's MIR 162 corn seed came under the spotlight in 2013 after Beijing forced some 1.2 million tonnes of corn to turn back due to detection of this unapproved strain.Commodity traders Cargill Inc and Archer Daniels Midland Co, along with dozens of farmers, have sued Syngenta over MIR 162, claiming hundreds of millions of dollars in damages because of the disruption caused by the ban.China's Agriculture Ministry's Biosafety Office said it will soon make an official announcement but declined to give any details.

81,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A slew of U.S. multinational companies, from DuPont (DD.N) to Procter & Gamble (PG.N), showed that a strong U.S. dollar hurt their earnings, and several blue-chip exporters said the situation will get worse if the greenback holds its strength.All told, the resurgent U.S. currency could shave up to $12 billion off U.S. companies' fourth-quarter 2014 revenue alone, according to currency expert Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FireApps, a data analytics company in Phoenix, Arizona, that examines quarterly reports for currency-related losses. The pain is hitting multiple sectors, including industrial companies such as 3M Co (MMM.N), technology companies like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), airlines such as American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), healthcare companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), and consumer firms like Procter & Gamble - which all garner a large portion of their sales from outside the United States. ""This is a slow-motion crash,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said. After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar .DXY has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining. ""You have companies who don’t normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. ""It’s really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening."" HEDGING HELP LIMITED WITH SHARP MOVES The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors.While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts' ability to estimate losses.  One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates.Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share.The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps.American icon Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations. Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple's 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report.Apple's Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a ""clear headwind"" included in the company's guidance for the year ahead.Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics.  Medical device maker Stryker Corp (SYK.N) said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent. Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and IBM (IBM.N).Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps.

91,"   By Kevin Allison | CHICAGO  CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - DuPont has driven a wedge between shareholders and Nelson Peltz. Adding two turnaround veterans to the $70 billion chemical giant's board may make stockholders think twice about voting in a rival slate from the billionaire activist's Trian Fund Management. DuPont says Peltz nixed an offer to add one of his picks because he wanted the spot. He may just have been outplayed.The nominees put forward by Delaware-based Dupont are impressive. Tyco International Chairman Edward Breen presided over two breakups at the once-struggling industrial conglomerate during his decade as chief executive. James Gallogly led rival chemicals maker LyondellBasell out of bankruptcy.That kind of experience means Peltz, who says DuPont's performance has fallen short under Ellen Kullman, and that the company should consider breaking itself up, may now face an uphill struggle to convince other shareholders to support his alternative slate. Of Trian's four board nominees, including Peltz himself, only one - Robert Zatta, a former Campbell Soup  executive who is now acting CEO of soon-to-be-acquired lithium producer Rockwood Holdings - has experience at the helm of a chemical company.It's a crafty piece of jiu-jitsu by Kullman, after her initial response to Trian's public critique of DuPont's performance last autumn failed to impress. But Peltz left himself vulnerable to being boxed in by refusing to discuss a settlement with DuPont at a meeting in Chicago on Wednesday. In a letter to Trian, DuPont said it had also offered to put one of its nominees on the board if the activist agreed to drop its alternative slate. The company said Peltz refused to consider any deal that didn't involve a seat for him personally.Even if the blown power play results in Peltz's slate getting shot down, the activist may end up relatively satisfied. At the very least, two strong independent appointments from DuPont's own nominating committee should leave him feeling reassured that the refreshed board has the experience necessary to give proper weight to his proposals.  CONTEXT NEWS -  DuPont on Feb. 5 said it had appointed two new directors to its board. - The new board members are Edward Breen, the chairman and former chief executive of Tyco International; and James Gallogly, the former CEO of chemical industry rival LyondellBasell. They will replace two outgoing directors who are set to take board seats at Chemours, DuPont's forthcoming performance chemicals spinoff.- The appointments came as DuPont is locked in a proxy battle with billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management.- DuPont said its board had also offered to consider appointing one of the independent board candidates nominated by Trian, in return for the activist dropping the rest of its slate and backing DuPont's nominees. DuPont said Peltz had rejected the settlement offer because it did not include him personally getting a board seat.(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP has been publicly critical of the company's performance and requested DuPont use a tool called a universal proxy, which has played a key role in company shake-ups. A traditional proxy uses white cards that contain the company-backed nominees or gold cards that list the shareholder nominees. The universal proxy allows shareholders to split their vote if they are not fully convinced of either party during a proxy battle.DuPont said a universal proxy could compromise access and accuracy and issuing the card to all 600,000 individual shareholders could be cumbersome. A date for the shareholder meeting has not been set. Last year it was April 23.        The universal card played a key role in billionaire activist investor William Ackman's loss to Target Corp (TGT.N) in 2009 and his successful shakeup of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd's (CP.TO) board a few years later.    Peltz's Trian said it was disappointed that DuPont chose to limit shareholder choice.DuPont said on Tuesday it had consulted with experts and believes the use of a traditional proxy card remains the most reliable and accurate process for electing directors.

Separately, Trian also sent a letter to DuPont's board on Thursday saying the company's recent communication with its shareholders incorrectly suggests that the hedge fund will not work well with DuPont's board.Trian has been urging DuPont to split its volatile materials business from the rest of the company, an offer DuPont has repeatedly rejected by highlighting the benefits of keeping its units together. The hedge fund later softened its view and said it was ""open-minded"" about keeping DuPont together.In November, rival Dow Chemical Co averted a proxy fight with Dan Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point LLC, by agreeing to add four independent directors to its board.DuPont's shares were up 0.5 percent at a 17-year high of $79.72 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

113,"   By Nadia Damouni and Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Fidelity Investments, a major investor in DuPont (DD.N), has put pressure on activist fund Trian Fund Management LP and the chemical conglomerate to reach a settlement in what it sees as a detrimental proxy fight, according to people close to the matter.Fidelity, whose 2.5 percent stake makes it DuPont's sixth largest shareholder, has not publicly revealed what sort of  compromise it was seeking. Yet its unusual intervention as peacemaker could influence other mutual fund investors in DuPont and pre-empt what could be this year's biggest battle over board representation. In a filing with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission last Wednesday, Trian disclosed that on March 11 it received a call from one of DuPont's largest stockholders encouraging Trian and the company to resolve the proxy contest and avoid a costly and disruptive conflict. It did not disclose the name of that investor, but those familiar with the matter said it was Fidelity, the second largest U.S. mutual fund company.A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment. DuPont and Trian reiterated their positions, but declined to comment on Fidelity's involvement.""Since 2009, DuPont has been executing a transformational strategy that is delivering superior results,"" a DuPont spokeswoman said.""In direct contrast, Trian has a singular, value-destructive agenda to break up and add excessive debt to DuPont, which we believe would put shareholder value at risk,"" she added. A Trian spokeswoman rejected the criticism. ""We have met recently with many of DuPont's largest stockholders and our ideas clearly resonate with them,"" she said. ""We believe that Trian's presence on the board will help to drive sales, margins, and earnings growth at a company where EPS (earnings per share) is expected to be lower in 2015 than in 2011 for the fourth year in a row.""Trian, which owns a 2.7 percent stake in DuPont, is pushing for the appointment of four of its own directors at the company's annual shareholder meeting on May 13. The slate includes Trian's co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Nelson Peltz, who has requested a seat on the board since earlier this year.     DuPont, which has a market capitalization of $65 billion, named two of its own nominees, Ed Breen and Jim Gallogly, as directors last month. In an attempt to end the proxy war, the Wilmington, Delaware-based company has said it is prepared to accept one of the fund's nominees, but has refused to add Peltz to its board.   DuPont had said it would spin off its performance chemicals business. Peltz also wants the company to separate its volatile but cash flow-strong materials businesses from its nutrition and health, agriculture, and industrial biosciences divisions.DuPont has rejected the proposal, stressing that keeping its businesses together would allow the company to benefit from its science platform, global scale, market access and brand.SHAREHOLDERS DIVIDED  Over the past few weeks, both camps have been lobbying with DuPont's top 30 to top 40 investors, the sources said. A Reuters poll of investors who hold about 48 million DuPont shares representing 5 percent of the company, found them split on Trian's board representation.""We bought DuPont before this happened, and we do think this is, at minimum a distraction, at maximum a dislocation to the plan that is in place,"" said Robert Zagunis, managing director of Jensen Investment Management, which owns 1.8 million DuPont shares. ""We want this to be resolved, and with DuPont winning the proxy."" Others disagreed. ""We think the board needs to make decisions in the boardroom to maximize value. Trian brings one perspective for them,"" said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer for California State Teachers' Retirement System, which held about 3.6 million shares as of Feb. 28.

118,"  (Adds investor reaction to Fink letter)By Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK, April 14 BlackRock Inc chief Larry Fink has asked the top executives of the 500 largest publicly listed U.S. companies urging them to take a long-term approach to create value for shareholders or risk losing his firm's support.In a letter to the chief executive officers of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years.""It is critical ... to understand that corporate leaders' duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies' shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long term owners,"" Fink wrote in the letter, dated March 31.BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager. At the end of 2014, it had $4.65 trillion of assets under management.In 2014, dividends and buybacks in the United States totaled $900 billion, the highest ever, according to the letter. Through March, buyback authorizations totaled $257 billion, the fastest start to any year on record, according to Birinyi Associates.Many market analysts expect that a rise in interest rates will not derail the buyback boom bolstering stocks.The company made Fink's letter available to Reuters after The New York Times first reported on the document on Monday evening, ahead of the company's scheduled release of first-quarter results on Thursday. Given the low interest rate environment, such moves ""send a discouraging message about a company's ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long-term,"" Fink wroteCorporate boards should act as ""the first line of defense"" against short-term pressures.""In the last two years, activists have taken positions in some of the largest U.S. corporations seeking larger share repurchases, divestitures or other corporate action. The companies targeted included Apple Inc, General Motors Co, DuPont and Qualcomm Inc.Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co, which has $8.2 billion in assets under management, disagrees with Fink and believes most activists now are more long-term than the corporate raiders of the 1980s. ""I think the majority of activist investors today are really investors and are not going into this to slash and burn,"" Smith told Reuters in an interview Tuesday afternoon.For example, Smith applauded Nelson Peltz' Trian Fund Management LP for taking a long-term approach with its campaign against the management of chemicals and agricultural company DuPont.Trian is pushing the company's board to be more accountable and argues it should be split in two. The fund is pushing for four seats on DuPont's board.""I think Trian represents a positive influence,"" he said. Smith also disagrees with Fink that dividends are a sign  companies are thinking short-term.""Dividends are the mother's milk of returns to investors,"" said Smith, who only invests in companies that pay them. ""Dividend increases are the most tangible statement management can make about the firm's fundamentals and future prospects.""For its part, BlackRock has revised its proxy guidelines to highlight it expects board members to protect shareholders against short-term thinking.Firms that have a long-term strategy to create shareholder value, as well as credible metrics to assess performance, will have BlackRock's support during periods of underperformance.""In such cases, we will take action to ensure that the owners' interest are effectively served,"" he wrote.Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles and known as the Warren Buffett of bonds, shared Fink's sentiments.""In a number of cases, in the tech area among the most prominent of the examples, is where you ought to be reinvesting in the business,"" he said.

While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram.

Dupont, which receives 60 percent of sales from outside the United States, said it expects a strong dollar to reduce its 2015 profit by 80 cents per share, higher than its earlier forecast of 60 cents.The company said it expects full-year operating earnings to be at the low end of its forecast of $4.00-$4.20 per share.DuPont is targeting annual cost cuts of $1 billion and expects the savings to add 40 cents per share to 2015 profit.The company expects to meet two-thirds of its cost savings target from work force reductions and the remaining from streamlining its asset base by consolidating facilities, or outsourcing some services. Cost cuts added 10 cents to DuPont's operating profit in the quarter ended March 31, helping mitigate the impact of a 10 percent fall in agriculture sales, the company's biggest unit.The company, which is locked in a proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz, also raised its quarterly dividend to 49 cents per share from 47 cents on Tuesday.DuPont is only days away from a shareholder vote which will decide if Peltz will get the four board seats he has been campaigning for. The company's shareholder meeting will be held on May 13. Peltz has criticized DuPont for missing earnings expectations, among other things. The activist investor wants DuPont to separate its materials businesses from its nutrition and health, agriculture, and industrial biosciences divisions.DuPont, which is in the process of spinning off its performance chemicals unit, has rejected the demand.The spinoff of the company, named Chemours, was on track for the middle of this year, DuPont said on Tuesday.Net income attributable to DuPont fell 28 percent to $1.03 billion, or $1.13 per share, while sales fell 9 percent to $9.17 billion.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.DuPont executive vice president Jim Borel said in an interview that he expects new products in the company's biologicals pipeline to start hitting the market within about five years. Borel said the biologicals market is growing rapidly ""and it's an area where science can make a real difference.""DuPont expects demand in Europe, North America and Latin America, Borel said.Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont's move is the latest in a string of acquisitions and expansions by the world's largest agrichemical companies to harness microbes, plant extracts and other natural substances to try to better control pests and improve plant health, quality and yield. They have long been the subject of exploration and analyses by scientists, both for use in human and plant health. New technologies have sped up the process.Rival Monsanto Co.

DuPont's purchase of Taxon is aimed at boosting its reach into biological products for agriculture, but the company already has business units developing such things as probiotics for human health, enzymes and proteins for industrial applications and animal feed, and inoculants for agriculture.DuPont reaped more than $1 billion in biologicals sales last year.Industry leaders have said biological-based product offerings have the potential to dramatically increase the number of bushels farmers coax from their crops. Future improvements are forecast not just for corn and beans, but wheat, canola, cotton and fruits and vegetables.  The move coincides with concerns from consumers and environmentalists, and increased regulatory rigor, over the effectiveness and efficiency of some genetically engineered crops and agricultural chemicals that many U.S. farmers rely on. The more natural biological solutions face fewer concerns and regulatory hurdles, according to agricultural experts.Borel said that while new biological products for crops could reduce demand for some existing agrichemicals, others would be complementary. ""This is giving farmers more options,"" Borel said.Some companies are working on offerings that are sprayed on seeds to wash off into the soil and protect the crop from pests, reducing the need for insecticide applications. Others say they are building microbial applications that will make crops grow better with less water or less fertilizer.

On Monday, DuPont said ISS had reached the ""wrong conclusion"" in failing to recommend that shareholders vote for all 12 of DuPont's directors. Asked if he still had confidence that DuPont would prevail in the proxy contest, Cutler, speaking after Eaton reported first-quarter results on Wednesday, said: ""We have made no forecasts one way or the other. That really is going to be for shareholders to determine.""Chemical conglomerate DuPont has refused to add Peltz to its board and has rejected his demand to split the company's volatile materials business from the more stable units such as agriculture, nutrition and health, and industrial biosciences. Trian is DuPont's fifth largest shareholder.DuPont's board is open to a negotiated settlement with Trian, sources close to the matter told Reuters on Monday.

""We are very pleased that the two leading proxy advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, have recognized that change is warranted at DuPont,"" Peltz said in a statement on Thursday.The chemical maker has said it is prepared to add Myers to its board, but has refused to give a board seat to Peltz. The company has also rejected the investor's demand to split its volatile materials business from more stable units such as agriculture, nutrition and health, and industrial biosciences.Glass Lewis agreed with DuPont's rejection of Trian's break-up plan."" ... Fairly convincing to us that a break up of DuPont at this juncture is likely not the best alternative to enhance shareholder value,"" Glass Lewis wrote in a report. However, the advisory firm concurred with Trian's criticism of DuPont's earnings performance.""We believe shareholders should be concerned with management's inability in recent years to meet its own long-term growth targets or its initial earnings guidance in any of the last three years,"" Glass Lewis said.DuPont reported a fall in first-quarter sales last week and said it expects 2015 operating profit to be at the low end of its previously forecast range of $4.00-$4.20 due to a higher-than-expected foreign currency impact.""We believe Trian has identified legitimate concerns at DuPont, primarily related to operational execution and management accountability,"" the proxy firm said on Wednesday.

143,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del.  WILMINGTON, Del. DuPont (DD.N) repelled a board challenge from activist investor Nelson Peltz on Wednesday, dealing him a surprising blow after shareholders backed all 12 directors nominated by the U.S. chemical conglomerate's management.Peltz's Trian Fund Management had sought four seats on the board, including one for himself, and had pushed the 213-year-old company to split its businesses to unlock more value for shareholders. DuPont stock closed down 6.8 percent at $69.33, making it the top percentage loser in the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX. This was the stock's biggest single-day decline since October 2012, and, with 33.5 million shares changing hands, this was the busiest trading day in the company's history.The vote ends a high-stakes corporate drama that revved up in January when Trian announced its dissident slate. The hedge fund holds a 2.7 percent stake in DuPont, making it the company's fifth-largest shareholder. DuPont won the backing of three of its largest shareholders, Vanguard Group, State Street Global and BlackRock Institutional Trust, which are index funds, according to a source close to the matter. Trian won the majority of non-index institutions and would have prevailed had one of those three index funds voted differently, the source said.DuPont Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman said the company spent several months explaining to investors how it is retooling its business. A key focus has been the planned spinoff of its performance chemicals business, which supplies titanium dioxide products and Teflon coatings, in the coming weeks.“We don’t tell our story well enough and have undergone a lot of change,"" Kullman told reporters at the annual meeting, which drew 400 shareholders in DuPont's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.DuPont, which said it spent $15 million on its shareholder campaign, also reached out to its retail investor base, which accounts for more than a third of shares.""They normally don’t vote as often as they should, but apparently we got their attention this time, and they were active,” Kullman said.  Peltz acknowledged the need to spend more time with retail investors and index funds. But he said DuPont had already made important changes, including cost cuts and a share buyback, at Trian's prompting. ""We don't believe these things would have occurred without our involvement,"" he said.Before the meeting, it seemed as if Peltz would attain at least some success in the proxy fight. Trian's alternate slate had won at least partial public backing from proxy advisory firms such as ISS, as well as the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which owns 3.6 million DuPont shares.DuPont's victory could be a model for how other chief executives could try to fend off activist investors, experts said.SHADOW MANAGEMENT	      DuPont, which had a market value of $68 billion as of Tuesday, had warned that Trian would try to establish a ""shadow management"" that would undermine the company's transformation.Kullman, a 27-year DuPont veteran who has been CEO since January 2009, is also targeting another $1.3 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2017. But growth challenges remain.    DuPont last month reported that first-quarter sales fell 9 percent, their biggest decline in five quarters.Mawer Investment Management Ltd, which owns 900,000 DuPont shares, voted for the company's nominees partly because management seemed to be aware of a need for more cost cuts and improvements in operational efficiency, said portfolio manager Grayson Witcher.Trian first approached DuPont nearly two years ago with ways it said the company could improve its operating performance, according to a filing. Often, the $11 billion fund works behind the scenes during an activist campaign. Trian has won board seats at companies including Legg Mason Inc (LM.N) and more recently Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) in settlements rather than through proxy contests. Trian had pushed DuPont for a more significant break-up: separating its agriculture, nutrition and health, and industrial biosciences units from those businesses with strong cash flows but that are more volatile. Trian had also said recently that it was not wedded to any specific strategy.DuPont had offered Trian one seat on the board to resolve the proxy fight, but insisted that Peltz could not be the nominee.Peltz said on Wednesday that he would monitor DuPont's performance and that the stock price could nearly double to $120 by the end of 2017.Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst James Sheehan said he expected Trian to keep agitating for change.""If DuPont’s financial performance stumbles,"" he said, ""they can easily mount this proxy fight again and possibly prevail.""However, analysts speculated that Wednesday's drop in DuPont shares stemmed partly from anticipation that Peltz will soon unload his stake.

""You're now heading from an earnings-centric market to a macro-focused market,"" said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York. ""People seem to be in watch mode as they get an understanding of what's next.""In particular, investors are waiting for inflation numbers and the next jobs report in coming weeks, said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio.However, Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York, said he was seeing solid volume of investors adjusting their portfolios after earnings season.""I'm seeing more healthy activity which is buying, selling and shorting stocks,"" said Fenske. ""I'm seeing a return of conviction."" The S&P's information technology index, was the best performer with a 0.5 percent increase.The S&P utilities index was the worst performer, with a 1.1 percent drop. Duke Energy weighed most on that sector and AES Corp fell 2.5 percent drop after it priced a secondary share offering.""It's a gauge of people's perspectives as to what the Fed will do next,"" said Frankel, adding that utilities are in favor if people think the Fed will stall on interest rate hikes.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.574 points, or 0.04 percent, to 18,060.49, the S&P 500 lost 0.64 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,098.47 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 5.50 points, or 0.11 percent, to 4,981.69. DuPont shares fell 6.8 percent to $69.33 after it won a proxy fight against Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average.Macy's fell 2.4 percent to $63.73, while Ralph Lauren  fell 3 percent to $129.18 after they reported results.Pall Corp rose 4.4 percent to $123.89 after Danaher  said it would buy the company in a $13.8 billion deal. Danaher was up 1.6 percent at $87.35.Shares of pipeline company Williams Partners LP  jumped 22.7 percent to $58.16 after Williams Cos said it would buy its affiliate for about $13.8 billion.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,695 to 1,369, for a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,369 issues rose and 1,345 fell for a 1.02-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 34 new lows.About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

146,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Corporate America may find fresh courage to say ""no"" to deep-pocketed activist investors after the chief executive of DuPont (DD.N), one of the world's biggest chemical companies, beat back the year's most prominent challenge to management on Wednesday.Nelson Peltz, who runs the $11 billion Trian Management hedge fund, was dealt a rare setback when investors, including pension fund Calpers, sided with DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman to rebuff his attempt to win four board seats and press the company into breaking itself up.The outcome underscores how a CEO with strong allies among its largest investors can fend off activist advances, and could provide a model for how corporate leaders handle future battles waged by hedge funds such as Pershing Square Capital Management, Starboard Value, and ValueAct.""Companies will be more emboldened by this and more willing to stick to their convictions and strategies, and not necessarily rush into a negotiated settlement,"" said Damien Park, managing partner at consulting firm Hedge Fund Solutions, which helps companies defend against activists.Analysts said Kullman's open dialogue with big shareholders, including Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, was instrumental in DuPont's victory over Peltz, who had the support of prominent shareholder advisory firm ISS.     In the past, companies seeking to avoid the cost and distraction of proxy battles have tended to accept agitators onto their boards before a full vote by shareholders.

147,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON May 13 Corporate America may find fresh courage to say ""no"" to deep-pocketed activist investors after the chief executive of DuPont, one of the world's biggest chemical companies, beat back the year's most prominent challenge to management on Wednesday.Nelson Peltz, who runs the $11 billion Trian Management hedge fund, was dealt a rare setback when investors, including pension fund Calpers, sided with DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman to rebuff his attempt to win four board seats and press the company into breaking itself up.The outcome underscores how a CEO with strong allies among its largest investors can fend off activist advances, and could provide a model for how corporate leaders handle future battles waged by hedge funds such as Pershing Square Capital Management, Starboard Value, and ValueAct.""Companies will be more emboldened by this and more willing to stick to their convictions and strategies, and not necessarily rush into a negotiated settlement,"" said Damien Park, managing partner at consulting firm Hedge Fund Solutions, which helps companies defend against activists.Analysts said Kullman's open dialogue with big shareholders, including Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, was instrumental in DuPont's victory over Peltz, who had the support of prominent shareholder advisory firm ISS. In the past, companies seeking to avoid the cost and distraction of proxy battles have tended to accept agitators onto their boards before a full vote by shareholders. DuPont spent $15 million trying to fend off Peltz, whose fund spent $8 million on its campaign, according to each side.For example, Peltz's partner Ed Garden joined the Bank of New York Mellon board last year, and Third Point's Daniel Loeb got three seats on auction house Sotheby's board.

The company expects sales in the agriculture business to fall the most in the current quarter - in the ""mid-teens"" in percentage terms, steeper than the 11 percent fall in the latest quarter.Consolidated net sales fell 11.5 percent to $8.60 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $8.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to DuPont fell 12 percent to $940 million. On an operating basis, it earned $1.18 per share, in line with analysts' expectations.Shares of the company, which in May thwarted an attempt by activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management to land board seats, were down 1.5 percent at $55.90 in late afternoon trading. They hit a two-year low of $52.79 earlier.

160,"   By Jessica Dye  A federal judge in Ohio has denied DuPont's motion to dismiss claims for punitive damages from the first two bellwether trials over allegations that it sickened thousands by leaking a chemical known as C-8 into drinking water near one of its West Virginia plants. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus in the Southern District of Ohio said that plaintiffs' evidence regarding DuPont's conduct could lead jurors to reasonably conclude that the company's actions ""had a great probability of causing substantial harm.""

161,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Monsanto Co (MON.N), having ditched an audacious $46 billion offer for Syngenta AG SYNN.VX, may downshift to a humbler strategy of beefing up its crop protection portfolio through other acquisitions, partnerships and licensing agreements.The deal's collapse leaves Monsanto, Syngenta and other agrochemical sector companies facing a bleak landscape of plummeting grain prices and farm income. In the United States, farmers are tightening their budgets and cutting back on everything from equipment to seeds and pesticides.On Wednesday, Monsanto said it was focused on its core businesses and plans to resume its two year, $10 billion share repurchase program, which was put on hold while it was bidding for Syngenta.Monsanto declined to say anything more about its next move, including which companies might be the St. Louis-based firm's next target or how much it would be willing to spend.Monsanto President Brett Begemann had previously told Reuters in an interview that a Syngenta deal was not its only option going forward.""There are other alternatives,"" Begemann told Reuters last month.Speaking at the same time, Michael Frank, vice-president of Monsanto's global commercial business, said Monsanto wanted to expand its portfolio of crop-protection chemicals and seed-treatment products, with Syngenta or without it. ""If we don't acquire Syngenta, we'll still be on Plan A. But there will be a substitute company,"" Frank said. ""It won't be Syngenta. It will be somebody else, or somebodies else.""Or, say analysts, the company could opt to steer away from acquisitions and head into a different direction.""We would expect Monsanto to continue to pursue further agreements in both licensing further molecules and collaborating with partners on joint development of molecular applications that expand Monsanto's product offerings,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts Keith Carpenter and Vitali Savitski wrote in an analyst report Wednesday.For months, some of the major players in the farm chemicals and seeds business have been the subject of restructuring talk. During the summer, BASF SE put together loan guarantees for a prospective bid for Syngenta - but wouldn't submit a bid unless Monsanto made a formal offer. Meanwhile, activist investors in recent years have pushed DuPont Co (DD.N) and Dow Chemical (DOW.N) to divest assets exposed to commodity price swings, in efforts to tap into value not reflected in the parent company stock prices, industry sources said.""Crop chemical assets are undervalued by the market and therefore any crop chemical asset is attractive,"" said Pauline McPherson, co-fund manager of Kames Capital's global equity fund, which holds Syngenta stock.Paulson & Co., the hedge fund headed up by billionaire investor John Paulson, took a stake in Syngenta in July and may have tried to pressure its board to negotiate with Monsanto, according to people familiar with the matter. The Swiss pesticide maker could face further pressure in the coming months from incoming shareholder activists buying stock, said one senior Europe-based investment banker. ""They will be smelling an opportunity,"" said the banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Still, with Monsanto out of the picture, there are no obvious buyers for Syngenta with the possible exception of BASF (BASFn.DE), the German chemicals group, which lined up a loan package earlier this summer from large multinational banks.Sources said BASF made the move, in part, so it could be in a position to block Monsanto from becoming the world's largest agricultural chemical and seeds business.A BASF spokeswoman told Reuters on Wednesday the company could not comment on the market or other companies.

162,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chemical giant DuPont Monday will face the first trial in litigation from residents near one of its plants in West Virginia who have accused the company of sickening them by emitting a toxic chemical that leaked into their drinking water.Carla Marie Bartlett is among the approximately 3,500 plaintiffs who have sued DuPont in federal court in Ohio, saying they contracted one of six diseases linked to perfluorooctanoic acid, known as PFOA or C-8. Bartlett said she developed kidney cancer from contaminated water.Bartlett's will be the first case to go to trial, in an early test of potential liability for the allegedly decades-long leak. A second trial will start Nov. 30.While DuPont is the named defendant, a recent spin-off of its performance chemicals segment, Chemours Co, will cover Dupont's potential liability, according to a Chemours spokeswoman. The lawsuits center on DuPont's Washington Works plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia, where the company used C-8 as a processing aid to make products like Teflon non-stick cookware.Plaintiffs say DuPont used C-8 at the plant since the 1950s and continued even after learning that it was potentially toxic and that it had been discovered in nearby drinking water supplies in Ohio and West Virginia. DuPont spokesman Daniel Turner said in a statement that knowledge about C-8 has evolved over the past 15 years and that the company has worked with regulators, employees and nearby residents to assess and address health and safety concerns. The company said it has phased out use of C-8 in recent years.In 2001, residents brought a class action against DuPont over C-8 exposure. DuPont settled in 2004, agreeing to fund medical monitoring programs and install new water treatment systems. It also agreed to convene a panel of scientists to determine whether any diseases were linked to C-8. That panel concluded there was a probable link between C-8 and six diseases: kidney and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension and high cholesterol.Class members with one of those diseases then individually sued DuPont. The company agreed not to challenge whether C-8 can cause those diseases, but plaintiffs still must prove it is to blame for their individual illnesses.DuPont said it believes Bartlett's exposure to C-8 was insufficient to cause health problems, and that other factors, like obesity, may be to blame for her cancer.A lawyer for Bartlett did not return requests for comment.",2015-09-14,DD,"Mon Sep 14, 2015 | 7:50am EDT",DuPont to face first trial over C-8 exposure,http://www.reuters.com//article/dupont-trial-preview-idUSL1N11K0JT20150914?type=companyNews

176,"   By Sneha Banerjee  DuPont (DD.N) Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman is stepping down this month and will be replaced temporarily by board member and veteran U.S. executive Edward Breen, who oversaw the break-up of conglomerate Tyco International Plc TYC.N. The chemical and crop company, which is struggling with the strong U.S. dollar and weakening agricultural markets in Brazil and other emerging markets, slashed its earnings forecast for the second time this year.Shares of DuPont, officially known as E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co, rose 5.6 percent to $54.17 in extended trading.Kullman, 59, joined the company more than 27 years ago and has been its CEO since 2009. Earlier this year, she fended off an attempt by activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management to land board seats. Trian declined comment on Kullman's exit. Before Monday's announcement, Du Pont shares were down nearly 28 percent from May 12, the day before Peltz lost his proxy battle with DuPont. Kullman acknowledged as recently as last week that the slide in its share price was ""a concern.""A major DuPont shareholder said on Monday that Kullman’s decision to leave makes it far less likely that Peltz would launch a second proxy contest. There was wide expectation that Peltz’s Trian, which has kept a 2.5 percent stake in DuPont, would have another go at DuPont come next proxy season.""Clearly the board has continued to press Peltz’s concerns about underperformance and some steps were taken,"" said the investor, who asked not to be named. Because of the tough currency and demand environment, DuPont lowered its 2015 forecast for operating earnings per share to about $2.75 from $3.10. It already cut its forecast in July. ""Kullman appears to be accepting the blame for not having good visibility on the company’s earnings,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst James Sheehan, adding that the appointment of Breen should please activist investors.  ""Breen is an individual both sides respect, and he will be accepted by Trian Partners as an interim CEO,"" he said. ""His selection probably does not indicate a dramatic shift in corporate strategy.""A source close to DuPont told Reuters that Breen has said that DuPont's four main divisions have synergies and that he did not want the CEO job permanently.  DuPont is also speeding up cost cuts to counter weakening sales, saying it has redesigned some operations and is now targeting about $1.6 billion in annual savings by the end of 2017.  Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings per share for the year, including expected benefits from share repurchases and cost savings, are expected to rise 3 percent from a year earlier.Kullman is set to leave Oct. 16, when Breen will take over as interim CEO.Breen was Tyco CEO from 2002 to 2012, cleaning up the mess left behind by previous CEO Dennis Kozlowski, who left in 2002 and was subsequently convicted and imprisoned for receiving unauthorized bonuses and other financial crimes.

181,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Michael FlahertyBOSTON/TORONTO Oct 6 The departure of DuPont's chairwoman and chief executive Ellen Kullman has bought the U.S. chemical manufacturer a few months' grace to boost its stock price and appease activist investor Nelson Peltz.Before Kullman's surprise retirement announcement, the billionaire fund manager was considering launching a second attempt to get representation on DuPont's board, people familiar with his thinking said on Tuesday.""This goes a long way to inoculate the company from another proxy fight,"" said Damien Park, who works with companies facing pressure from activist shareholders as managing partner at Hedge Fund Solutions.Representatives for Peltz's Trian Fund Management and DuPont  declined to comment.Feted with a standing ovation from shareholders in May when she prevented Peltz and three of his nominees from getting onto the DuPont board, Kullman, 59, presided over a 25 percent slide in the stock price in the intervening period, weakening her support among investors. The 213-year old company, which makes Teflon and Kevlar, has appointed board member Edward Breen, a former CEO of Tyco, as interim chief executive and has hired a search firm to find a permanent replacement for Kullman.Breen made six companies out of Tyco, a sprawling conglomerate beset by scandal and strategic flipflops, and several large shareholders in DuPont said he had a few months to ramp-up cost-cutting and reverse the stock price decline.One investor said Breen was the perfect candidate to do the type of work Peltz was pushing for, removing the need for another boardroom battle. ""My expectation is that he will be super aggressive on the cost cutting and that the idea of an integrated science company is out the window,"" said one large institutional investor. ""This is long overdue.""Kullman had blamed much of the stock price drop on global markets including a rising dollar but some investors had already grown restless with her leadership, complaining that she was not fully executing on the changes she initiated.The $8 billion Columbia Dividend Income Fund exited DuPont during the second quarter, complaining that ""free cash flow has deteriorated."" The Alpine Equity Fund told investors that DuPont has ""lagged for the period when investors were disappointed after its board won a proxy battle with an activist shareholder who aimed to split the company.""Breen set out immediately on a charm offensive by calling top investors and assuring them of his plans to improve productivity and improve capital allocation.Kullman's announcement has boosted the stock price over 12 percent.Peltz' Trian Fund had been nursing a small loss for the year through late September, largely caused by DuPont's decline, people who had seen his numbers said.Now with the share price up again, that loss could go away, vindicating his bet.""I tell clients that even if you win a proxy fight, activists aren't necessarily going to go away. You can win the battle but still lose the war,"" said Chris Young, head of takeover defense practice at Credit Suisse.

A tie-up would merge two agricultural chemicals businesses and fold in DuPont's seeds business, analysts said, bringing a close look from regulators. Farmers said they were concerned about higher prices for seeds and chemicals. ""I look at it like Pepsi and Coca-Cola merging, then splitting into syrup, bottling, and snacks & sundry businesses,"" said Eric Linser of Avant-Garde Advisors, which owns DuPont shares. ""I was blown away ...when I saw the news break.""The combined company could split into material sciences, such as plastics used in packaging and car engines, specialty products and agrochemicals, sources said, cautioning that plans were not final. Cost synergies could reach $3 billion, CNBC reported.The Wall Street Journal first reported on Tuesday that talks were underway. Both Dow and DuPont declined comment on Wednesday.    Cheap financing and lack of growth in many industries, including ag and chemicals, have led to more buybacks, higher dividends and acquisitions as a way to boast earnings, said Grayson Witcher, portfolio manager at Mawer Investment Management Ltd, which owns DuPont stock. Shareholders said a likely driver in the deal was DuPont Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen, a corporate turnaround expert who broke up the Tyco conglomerate earlier this decade. Dow shares closed up 12 percent to a record high of $56.97. DuPont, a Dow Jones industrial average component, jumped nearly 12 percent to $74.49 after reaching a session high of $75.72.""It's like a Christmas present,"" said Jack Murphy, portfolio manager with Levin Capital Strategies, speaking of the stock's rise.But antitrust specialists warned of potholes ahead. ""It is eye-popping,"" said Steven Bizar, an antitrust expert with law firm Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney. ""I would wonder whether it would be stopped or whether major, major divestitures may be required.""    Reports of the talks broke as the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Justice Department either killed or filed lawsuits to challenge five deals in a month.The Justice Department killed Electrolux's bid to buy General Electric's appliance business, while Chicken of the Sea, owned by Thai Union, abandoned a bid to buy Bumble Bee Foods under pressure from the department. The FTC filed challenges in the past month to stop Staples from buying Office Depot as well as two health care mergers. ""JUST PLAIN NO"" In agriculture, Dupont sells about one-third of the corn and soybean seeds planted in the United States, while Dow has about five percent. ""That strikes me as a just plain no,"" said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust law at University of Wisconsin Law School. ""I would think that the ag chemical combination is the ... most problematic.""Caleb Hamer, a farmer in Iowa who buys seed from DuPont Pioneer and herbicides from Dow, said a marriage would probably promote research into new products. But consolidation could also boost costs. ""It scares me a little bit in terms of losing competition,"" he said.The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) expressed concerns about consolidation when farm profits have plunged to the lowest since 2002.  ""Our membership will be very concerned about further consolidation in the ag supply space,"" said AFBF chief economist Bob Young.  Outside of agricultural, Dow and Dupont compete in only a few areas and the overlap could be resolved by selling assets, said an antitrust expert who spoke privately to protect business relationships.""It looks relatively doable,"" said the expert, who added the deal would need approvals in enough jurisdictions that the review could take a year.While the deal was described by Reuters sources as a ""merger of equals,"" Dow shareholders could argue for up to 60 percent of the merged company, citing its slightly larger market capitalization and higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over the past 12 months. The largest of the three companies resulting from a post-merger breakup would include Dow's leading plastics franchise and DuPont's performance materials segment, which sells polymers and other products to automotive equipment manufacturers, said Laurence Alexander, equity analyst for Jefferies.The 2016 EBITDA of a combined company would be about $8.2 billion, including an estimated 5 percent in cost savings, Alexander said in a note.The second company would likely combine Dow's infrastructure solutions unit, which sells building insulation and adhesives, with DuPont's safety and protection business, which produces protective materials like Kevlar, Alexander said. It would have 2016 EBITDA of about $4.3 billion, after estimated savings of 5 percent. A tie-up of Dow and DuPont's agricultural businesses would generate 2016 EBITDA of about $4.1 billion, including 10 percent in savings, Alexander said. The new company could better compete for farmer business if Monsanto eventually acquires Syngenta.""We think this makes it more likely that Monsanto re-approaches Syngenta,"" Bernstein analysts said in an email. Monsanto withdrew a deal for Syngenta in August.   Syngenta is No. 1 in crop chemicals with 19 percent market share last year, just ahead of Bayer's CropScience division with 18 percent.Monsanto is the leader in seeds with a 26 percent market share, followed by Dupont Pioneer's 21 percent.ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERS For Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, a merger with DuPont  would come as he faces new pressure from a major investor and an ongoing federal investigation into his spending.Reports of a potential deal come a week before the expiration of a standstill agreement between Dow and activist investor Daniel Loeb, who promised to refrain from publicly criticizing the company for a year.""I’m sure that played a role in the timing of this,"" said analyst Robert Scelza with Key Banc Capital Markets. Dow added four independent directors to its board in November 2014, averting a proxy fight with Loeb, who has called for a split of the company.DuPont has faced pressure from another activist investor, Nelson Peltz, to separate its agriculture, nutrition and biosciences units from its building and safety materials divisions. Peltz lost a proxy battle for DuPont board seats in May, before Ellen Kullman stepped down as CEO in October.Breen would be CEO of the combined company, while Liveris would be executive chairman, the Journal reported.

The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) expressed concerns about consolidation when farm profits have plunged to the lowest since 2002.""Our membership will be very concerned about further consolidation in the ag supply space,"" said AFBF chief economist Bob Young.Outside of agricultural, Dow and Dupont compete in only a few areas and the overlap could be resolved by selling assets, said an antitrust expert who spoke privately to protect business relationships.""It looks relatively doable,"" said the expert, who added the deal would need approvals in enough jurisdictions that the review could take a year.While the deal was described by Reuters sources as a ""merger of equals,"" Dow shareholders could argue for up to 60 percent of the merged company, citing its slightly larger market capitalization and higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over the past 12 months.The largest of the three companies resulting from a post-merger breakup would include Dow's leading plastics franchise and DuPont's performance materials segment, which sells polymers and other products to automotive equipment manufacturers, said Laurence Alexander, equity analyst for Jefferies.The 2016 EBITDA of a combined company would be about $8.2 billion, including an estimated 5 percent in cost savings, Alexander said in a note.The second company would likely combine Dow's infrastructure solutions unit, which sells building insulation and adhesives, with DuPont's safety and protection business, which produces protective materials like Kevlar, Alexander said. It would have 2016 EBITDA of about $4.3 billion, after estimated savings of 5 percent. A tie-up of Dow and DuPont's agricultural businesses would generate 2016 EBITDA of about $4.1 billion, including 10 percent in savings, Alexander said. The new company could better compete for farmer business if Monsanto eventually acquires Syngenta .""We think this makes it more likely that Monsanto re-approaches Syngenta,"" Bernstein analysts said in an email. Monsanto withdrew a deal for Syngenta in August.Syngenta is No. 1 in crop chemicals with 19 percent market share last year, just ahead of Bayer's CropScience division with 18 percent.Monsanto is the leader in seeds with a 26 percent market share, followed by Dupont Pioneer's 21 percent.ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERS For Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, a merger with DuPont  would come as he faces new pressure from a major investor and an ongoing federal investigation into his spending.Reports of a potential deal come a week before the expiration of a standstill agreement between Dow and activist investor Daniel Loeb, who promised to refrain from publicly criticizing the company for a year.""I'm sure that played a role in the timing of this,"" said analyst Robert Scelza with Key Banc Capital Markets.Dow added four independent directors to its board in November 2014, averting a proxy fight with Loeb, who has called for a split of the company.DuPont has faced pressure from another activist investor, Nelson Peltz, to separate its agriculture, nutrition and biosciences units from its building and safety materials divisions.Peltz lost a proxy battle for DuPont board seats in May, before Ellen Kullman stepped down as CEO in October.Breen would be CEO of the combined company, while Liveris would be executive chairman, the Journal reported.(Reporting by Swetha Gopinath and Sneha Banerjee in Bengaluru, Diane Bartz in Washington, Karl Plume and Tom Polansek in Chicago, Kanika Sikka and Sinead Carew in New York; Writing by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Jeffrey Benkoe)",2015-12-09,DD,"Wed Dec 9, 2015 | 4:17pm EST","UPDATE 2-Dow, DuPont soar on prospect of $130 bln merger 'Christmas present'",http://www.reuters.com//article/dow-ma-dupont-idUSL3N13Y4KV20151209?type=companyNews

The prospect of a merger between chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont boosted those shares. Dow Chemical  was last up 11 percent while DuPont was last up 12 percent. The dollar was sharply lower in afternoon trading, as the severe selling that characterized last week's plunge against the euro after disappointment over European Central Bank policy moves appeared to have resumed. The euro rose to $1.0966 after hitting a high of $1.1030, a level not seen since early November; it was seen as something of a surprise ahead of the Dec. 15-16 Federal Reserve meeting on U.S. monetary policy.""This is just an old-fashioned clean-out in a thin market that's jittery ahead of next week,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.""I think the dollar is going to bounce back, though, particularly if you have continued risk aversion in other markets, in equities and commodities.""

U.S. crude was last up 42 cents at $37.93 per barrel.While many investors expect oil to fall below 2008 lows due to a global supply glut, the rebound helped U.S. shares, which were also boosted by reported merger talks between Dow Chemical and DuPont.

200,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Olivia Oran  As iconic brands are snapped up and corporations merged and swallowed in a record-breaking whirl of deals, there has been one constant: Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).The Wall Street firm is once again top dog in the global M&A rankings, having advised on transactions worth close to $1.7 trillion this year, more than the annual economic output of Australia, including Friday's $130 billion tie-up between U.S. chemical giants DuPont (DD.N) and Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N).Goldman's No 1 status comes despite the bank having lost several veteran bankers this year, including Gordon Dyal, its former M&A chief and Jack Levy, one of four global co-chairmen of M&A, and reflects the enduring success of its partnership model, 15 years after the company went public.Becoming a partner at Goldman Sachs is still one of the most coveted promotions on Wall Street, and those who make the cut represent a powerful network of well-connected dealmakers.The partnership, along with the bank's commitment to remaining a full-service investment bank despite post-crisis rules that make it more difficult to trade, have given it an edge over rivals such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which has a strong emphasis on wealth management.""Goldman is still run as a partnership, and delivers the entire firm,"" said Brad Hintz, a former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc chief financial officer and financial analyst who is now a business professor at the NYU Stern School of Business.The 146-year-old investment bank has ranked No. 1 in the global M&A league tables every year since 1997, with the exception of 2009 and 2010, when it ranked No. 2 behind Morgan Stanley, according to Thomson Reuters data.     This year, the bank advised on all the mega deals in pharmaceuticals, energy, beverages and now chemicals, where it is set to split $80 million to $100 million in DuPont advisory fees with Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N).Trailing Goldman Sachs in the global M&A league tables this year are Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N).NAVIGATING CONFLICTS  Goldman's ubiquitous role in finance prompted Rolling Stone magazine to famously declare in 2010 that the bank was ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity."" Its corporate clients, however, are generally happy to let it navigate potential conflicts of interest.In the case of DuPont, for example, Goldman has also been advising rival Syngenta AG SYNN.VX in its defense against a bid by Monsanto Co (MON.N).""Over time, companies have become more sophisticated so banks really need to differentiate themselves more,"" said Bob Hurst, a partner at private equity firm Crestview Partners who served as vice chairman of Goldman until June 2004 and head of its investment banking division from 1990 to 1999. Goldman has done that.""It has great coverage, is very relationship oriented on the long term and has great execution,"" Hurst said.The bank's prestige and partnership culture is enough to retain many bankers even at the prospect of higher pay at rivals or Silicon Valley startups.Among its peers, Goldman has consistently had a lower compensation to net revenue ratio than arch rival Morgan Stanley. ""When you are having beer with a Goldman partner, and you roll your eyes when he waxes lyrically about the partnership, you have to remember that this is key, you are expected to drop everything as a Goldman employee when there is a deal on deck,"" said Hintz.

After preferred shares are converted, Dow shareholders will own 52 percent of DowDuPont. * The merger will generate cost savings of about $3 billion in the first two years, with $1 billion in other savings possible.* The new board would have 16 members, with each company contributing eight directors.* DuPont expects 2016 sales growth to be ""challenging,"" due to economic weakness in agriculture and emerging markets. It plans to slash about 10 percent of its work force and take a pretax charge of $780 million. * The three-way split is likely to be 18 to 24 months after the deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016.* The biggest of the three new companies by revenue would be   material sciences, catering to the packaging, transportation and infrastructure industries. Major competitors would be Germany's BASF, Honeywell and 3M. This company's combined 2014 revenue was about $51 billion on an adjusted basis. * The specialty products company will sell materials to the electronics and communications industries as well as to the safety and protection sectors.

Loeb, who supports the merger, questioned whether the deal was rushed to be completed before the expiration of a standstill agreement this weekend that had barred him from publicly speaking about Dow, the WSJ reported.  Directors on Dow's board supported the deal and Liveris in comments provided to Reuters. Raymond Milchovich, one of the two directors Loeb nominated roughly a year ago, said: ""I have been fully aligned with the strategic decisions and direction the Board has taken, including our most recent agreement with DuPont – a highly synergistic transaction that will unlock significant shareholder value.""Milchovich told the WSJ: “Personally I think it’s almost laughable to say that anyone tried to engineer this date to the expiration of the standstill.""

215,"  Chemicals and seed producer DuPont's (DD.N) quarterly profit topped analysts' estimates as the company intensifies its cost-cutting efforts ahead of its merger with Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N).DuPont said on Tuesday it was looking to cut its costs in 2016 by $730 million from 2015-levels.The company's previous cost-reduction plan, launched under former CEO Ellen Kullman, had pegged cuts at $1.3 billion by the end of 2016 from 2013 levels.Both DuPont and Dow Chemical are streamlining their businesses, ahead of a merger that will create a company with an estimated combined market value of about $95 billion as of Monday's closing.""We are making progress on key initiatives, including further improving our cost structure and restructuring our organization to enhance our competitiveness,"" DuPont CEO Ed Breen said in a statement, adding that the merger was on track.DuPont's cost-cutting measures, including a planned 10 percent reduction in its workforce of about 54,000 employees, will add about 64 cents per share to the company's 2016 profit. The company said it expects full-year operating earnings of $2.95-$3.10 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding $622 million of restructuring and other charges, fourth-quarter operating profit was 27 cents per share, slightly above analysts' average estimate of 26 cents. The company said its cost-reduction efforts added 10 cents to its profit in the three months ended Dec.31.Net loss attributable to the company was $253 million, or 29 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $683 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.Net sales fell 9.4 percent to $5.3 billion.

The company had projected cost cuts of $700 million and annual savings of $900 million in December.""This plan will further simplify our organization into fewer, larger businesses with integrated R&D, engineering and manufacturing functions, accelerate decision-making and connect even more closely with our end-markets,"" DuPont CEO Ed Breen said on a call with analysts. The new cost-cutting program is expected to result in a 15 percent fall in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, including a $200 million reduction in corporate costs, he said.Breen emphasized that the cost-cutting program was a DuPont initiative and separate from the company's merger with Dow Chemical that will create a behemoth with an estimated combined market value of about $95 billion as of Monday's closing.""We have begun the process of addressing the requirements under various competition laws,"" Breen said on the call. Analysts have speculated that the deal will face intense regulatory scrutiny, especially over combining the two companies' agricultural businesses, though both Dow and DuPont executives have said that any asset sales required would likely be minor.DuPont's cost-cutting measures will add about 64 cents per share to the company's 2016 profit.The company said it expects full-year operating earnings of $2.95-$3.10 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. DuPont's forecast includes a 30 cents negative impact from a strengthening dollar.The company also said it expects its sales to fall in the low-single digits in percentage terms, hurt by slower growth in emerging markets, apart from weak farm demand.Excluding $622 million of restructuring and other charges, fourth-quarter operating profit was 27 cents per share, above analysts' expectations of 26 cents.Net sales fell 9.4 percent to $5.3 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $5.53 billion.DuPont shares were slightly up at $53.34.

218,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chemical maker DuPont (DD.N) will face 40 trials a year starting April 2017 involving plaintiffs who say they developed cancer from a toxic chemical used to make Teflon that leaked from one of the company’s plants in West Virginia. The schedule laid out by U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus in the Southern District of Ohio during a hearing Wednesday is aimed at pushing the parties closer to resolving more than 3,550 lawsuits. The outcome could have a material impact on Chemours Co (CC.N), since liability for litigation connected with the chemical C-8 was passed on to the firm spun-off by DuPont in 2015. The cases have been filed by individuals who say they developed one of six diseases linked to perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA or C-8, which was found in their drinking water. Their cases are consolidated before Sargus. The initial 40 trials will be selected from between 250 and 300 lawsuits brought by individuals who say they contracted kidney or testicular cancer from C-8.  ""People shouldn’t have to wait ten years for a trial,"" Sargus said, according to a transcript of the hearing.DuPont spokesman Dan Turner said the company was pleased plaintiffs would go to trial individually, rather than as a group, as plaintiffs’ lawyers had proposed. In the past, DuPont said ""mega trials"" would confuse jurors and be unfair to it.A lead plaintiffs' lawyer, Michael London, called Sargus' plan ""a good start."" The lawsuits center on claims DuPont used C-8 at a West Virginia plant for decades despite knowing it was toxic and had been found in nearby drinking water. While the cancer claims are moving forward to trial, DuPont has said in court filings that 90 percent of the litigation involves less deadly conditions such as high cholesterol and thyroid disease. To help estimate the aggregate value of individual suits in mass litigation, it is common to hold a series of bellwether, or test trials. The first C-8 bellwether ended in October with a $1.6 million verdict for a plaintiff who had kidney cancer. Four other trials are scheduled for 2016.  While DuPont was the named defendant, Chemours said it would cover DuPont’s liability for the first verdict. Chemours agreed to take on some of DuPont's legal liabilities when it was spun off from the company to house its performance chemicals segment.Chemours has said an unfavorable outcome from the lawsuits could have a ""material adverse effect"" on its finances.Chemours stock was little changed Thursday at $3.12 on the New York Stock Exchange.

""As most investors have been caught offsides at some or multiple points over the past eight months, the impulse to do little is understandable,"" Loeb wrote in the letter. ""We are of a contrary view that volatility is bringing excellent opportunities.""Loeb, who runs New York-based Third Point with $17 billion of assets under management, said ""we are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds and certain strategies. We believe we are well-positioned to seize the opportunities borne out of this chaos and are pleased to have preserved capital through a period of vicious swings in treacherous markets.""  Those investment opportunities, Third Point said in the letter, include bets based on corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions, including the combination of Dow Chemical Co. and E. I. du Pont de Nemours.""With the right management, structure, and a synergy target that looks conservative in light of the prospect for more sweeping change, we believe we have a compelling long term investment in Dow/DuPont,"" the letter said.

Monsanto Co's stock ended trading up 4.4 percent at $106 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, well below Bayer's $122 per share cash offer price, in a sign that it faces a tough task convincing the St. Louis-based company to sign off on the deal.Monsanto has said it would review the proposal. Some analysts have suggested Bayer might still have to pay more.""The price that has now been disclosed is at the upper limit and it is just about economical. Should it rise further, which is to be assumed, the takeover will become increasingly unattractive,"" said Markus Manns, a fund manager at Union Investment, Bayer's 14th biggest investorOther Bayer shareholders have also responded coldly to the company's pursuit, condemned by one Bayer investor as ""arrogant empire-building"" when news of the proposal emerged last week.The unsolicited proposal would be the largest all-cash takeover on record, according to Thomson Reuters data, just ahead of InBev’s $60.4 billion offer for Anheuser-Busch in June 2008.The move would also eclipse a planned combination of peers Dow Chemical and DuPont's agriculture units and comes just three weeks after Werner Baumann took over as Bayer CEO. Giving details for the first time, Bayer said on Monday it would offer $122 per share, a 37 percent premium to Monsanto's stock price before rumors of a bid surfaced. ""We fully expect a positive answer of the Monsanto board of directors,"" Baumann told reporters on a conference call, describing criticism from some investors as ""an uneducated reaction in the media"" when deal terms were not yet known, and driven by an element of surprise.Monsanto, which said last week it had a received an approach from Bayer but gave no details, declined to comment.Seven of Monsanto's top 20 investors declined to comment about Bayer's offer when contacted by Reuters. Others could not be immediately reached for comment. Antitrust experts see an overlap in the seeds business, particularly in soybeans, cotton and canola. Bayer's LibertyLink line of weed killers, plus crops that are resistant to it, are an important alternative for farmers suffering from weeds that have grown resistant to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide. Shares of Bayer, which had already fallen 14 percent since rumors of a bid emerged last week, ended trading down 5.7 percent on Monday to a new 2-1/2 year low of 84.42 euros.""FULL PRICE"" Global agrochemicals companies are racing to consolidate, partly in response to a drop in commodity prices that has hit farm incomes, and also due to the growing convergence between seeds and pesticides markets.ChemChina is buying Switzerland's Syngenta for $43 billion after Syngenta rejected a bid from Monsanto, while Dow and DuPont are forging a $130 billion business.With German rival BASF SE also looking into a possible tie-up with Monsanto, Bayer has moved to avoid being left behind.  Baumann rejected suggestions from some investors that Bayer should instead try to forge a joint venture with Monsanto, saying this would have tax disadvantages. Monsanto approached Bayer in March to express interest in its crop science unit, Reuters reported at the time. Among the possibilities discussed were an outright acquisition of the crop science unit and a joint venture, or other type of partnership between the two companies.Sources close to the matter have said BASF is unlikely to start a bidding war with Bayer. BASF declined to comment on Monday. But analysts say Bayer might still have to pay more to persuade Monsanto and its shareholders to sell up. That could be a problem, with some saying Bayer's proposal, at 15.8 times Monsanto's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the year ended Feb. 29, is already a stretch for the German company.  Berenberg analyst John Klein said Monsanto and its shareholders were likely to argue that based on 2017 EBITDA expectations, the bid would represent a multiple of only 14 times, compared with the nearly 16 times ChemChina agreed to pay for Syngenta     When pressed by analysts whether Bayer might sweeten its bid, Baumann said the offer reflected Monsanto's value. ""We are putting forward a very, very full price,"" he said.AMBITIOUS SYNERGIES Bayer said it would finance the bid with a combination of debt and equity, primarily a share sale to existing investors. Equity would account for about a quarter of the deal value.Equinet analyst Marietta Miemietz, who has a 'buy' rating on Bayer stock, said the extra debt appeared manageable but could limit Bayer's ability to invest in its healthcare business, which some analysts think needs a boost to its drugs pipeline. Baumann said Bayer would continue to develop its healthcare arm, which includes stroke prevention pill Xarelto and aspirin, the painkiller it invented more than a century ago. ""We are not feeding Peter by starving Paul here,"" he said, adding no asset sales were planned to help pay for the deal.Bayer also forecast synergies from a deal with Monsanto would boost annual earnings by around $1.5 billion after three years, plus additional future benefits from integrated product offerings - a reference to its push to combine the development and sale of seeds and crop protection chemicals.Berenberg analysts, who have a 'buy' rating on Bayer shares, described the synergies estimate as ""very ambitious"".

251,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. jury on Wednesday ordered DuPont  to pay $5.1 million to a man who said he developed testicular cancer from exposure to a toxic chemical used to make Teflon at one of its plants, according to a DuPont spokesman.It is the second time jurors in Ohio federal court have found against DuPont, which is facing more than 3,400 lawsuits from residents who say they contracted one of six diseases linked to perfluorooctanoic acid, known as PFOA or C-8, which is used to make products such as Teflon non-stick cookware.Following a five-week trial, jurors deliberated for less than a day before finding DuPont was negligent and awarding $5.1 million in compensatory damages to David Freeman, an Ohio resident who said he developed testicular cancer from his exposure to C-8 in drinking water. The jury also decided that DuPont had acted with actual malice, a finding that exposes the company to punitive damages, the amount of which will be determined at a proceeding starting Thursday.A DuPont spokesman declined to comment. While DuPont is the named defendant, a recent spin-off of its performance chemicals segment, Chemours Co, will cover its liability. A spokeswoman for Chemours, Cynthia Salitsky, said the verdict will be appealed.

252,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. jury on Wednesday ordered DuPont to pay $5.1 million to a man who said he developed testicular cancer from exposure to a toxic chemical used to make Teflon at one of its plants, according to a DuPont spokesman. It is the second time jurors in Ohio federal court have found against DuPont, which is facing more than 3,400 lawsuits from residents who say they contracted one of six diseases linked to perfluorooctanoic acid, known as PFOA or C-8, which is used to make products such as Teflon non-stick cookware. Following a five-week trial, jurors deliberated for less than a day before finding DuPont was negligent and awarding $5.1 million in compensatory damages to David Freeman, an Ohio resident who said he developed testicular cancer from his exposure to C-8 in drinking water. The jury also decided that DuPont had acted with actual malice, a finding that exposes the company to punitive damages, the amount of which will be determined at a proceeding starting Thursday.  A DuPont spokesman declined to comment. While DuPont is the named defendant, a recent spin-off of its performance chemicals segment, Chemours Co, will cover its liability. A spokeswoman for Chemours, Cynthia Salitsky, said the verdict will be appealed.

The same jury in Ohio federal court had awarded $5.1 million in compensatory damages on Wednesday to 57-year-old plaintiff David Freeman.It is the second trial in which a jury has found DuPont liable for claims involving exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid, known as PFOA or C-8, which is used to make products such as Teflon nonstick cookware, and it is the first time a jury has found that the company’s “actual malice” warranted an award of punitive damages.DuPont is the named defendant in more than 3,400 lawsuits brought by individuals who said they developed one of six diseases linked to C-8 that they say leaked from a DuPont plant in West Virginia. However, a recent spin-off of DuPont’s performance chemicals segment, Chemours Co, will cover its liability.  Chemours spokeswoman Cynthia Salitsky said in a statement Friday that the company ""retains its defenses"" to DuPont claims for indemnification for the judgments. Chemours shares were hit hard following the initial verdict earlier this week. But following the relatively modest punitive-damage verdict, Chemours shares surged 15.5 percent to $7.58 on Friday afternoon, and DuPont shares were up 2.5 percent at $63.46. A first trial ended last year with an award of $1.6 million in compensatory damages to a woman who had kidney cancer, and no punitive damages. The federal judge overseeing the litigation has ordered DuPont to prepare for 40 trials a year starting in April 2017 for plaintiffs with cancers blamed on C-8 exposure. A lawyer for the plaintiff, Mike Papantonio, said the punitive damages award appropriately reflected the jury's finding about DuPont's ""conscious disregard"" for residents near its West Virginia plant. ""Now, DuPont has to decide how many of these hits can they take,"" he said.  Chemours and DuPont both said they would appeal the verdict, which came in a so-called bellwether trial.

286,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. state attorneys general have joined a federal antitrust probe of the planned merger between DuPont and Dow Chemical Co, according to three people familiar with the matter, heightening risks to a deal that could help reshape the global farm industry.A separate group of state attorneys general are expected to join a probe of Bayer AG's $66 billion plan to buy Monsanto Co, one of the sources said.The involvement of the state attorneys general increases scrutiny of the mega deals and will complicate what are already expected to be tough and lengthy reviews by U.S. antitrust enforcers.About seven states, including California, have joined the probe of Dow's planned merger with DuPont, according to two people familiar with the matter. It was not yet clear how many states would join the Bayer-Monsanto merger investigation, one source said.The states are concerned that the companies may raise pesticide and herbicide prices for farmers following a merger, and have less incentive to compete to introduce better and cheaper products, two of the sources said.The sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media DuPont and Dow said in separate statements they expected to win approval for their deal. ""In the U.S., we are working constructively with federal and state regulatory authorities, elected officials and all agriculture stakeholders to show the pro-competitive benefits of the merger,"" the companies said.Bayer said in a statement it looked forward to ""working diligently with regulators to ensure a successful close."" Monsanto did not respond to a request for comment.While it is up to the Justice Department to decide whether to file a lawsuit to stop a merger, states provide information on how the mergers would affect their jurisdictions and conduct joint calls to gather data from the companies, as well as critics and supporters of the deals. The Justice Department, with help from states, sued in July to stop two of the year's most controversial deals - Aetna Inc's  plan to buy Humana Inc and Anthem Inc's  bid for Cigna Corp. Eleven states and the District of Columbia joined the federal government in the Anthem lawsuit while eight states and Washington, DC, joined the Aetna lawsuit.Chemical companies DuPont and Dow agreed in December to create a company worth $130 billion, with a plan to split into three companies with one specializing in agriculture, another in materials and a third in specialty products.The Dow deal with DuPont and Bayer's plan to buy Monsanto are two of four mergers in the business of selling farmers seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides. The others are ChemChina's plan to buy Syngenta AG and Potash Corp's  plan to buy Agrium Inc. A FOCUS ON ALTACOR, INTREPID The state probe of Dow's planned merger with DuPont is focused on the companies' overlap in pesticides used on high-value crops like almonds, pistachios, grapes and apples, two of the sources said.The insecticides in question are DuPont's Altacor and Dow's Intrepid, which are chemically different but which both fight insects that can kill or mar almonds, apples and other nuts and fruit.If allowed to combine, Dow and DuPont would also have 41 percent of the market for U.S. corn seeds and traits and 38 percent of the U.S. soybean seeds and traits market, according to a Morgan Stanley research report in February.The Bayer-Monsanto review will likely focus on the companies' overlap in cotton seed, a source said.The state attorneys general will also look at traits since Bayer licenses genetic traits that make seeds resistant to Liberty, a popular herbicide, while Monsanto licenses traits that make seeds resistant to Roundup, another popular herbicide.",2016-11-07,DD,"Mon Nov 7, 2016 | 5:02pm EST",U.S. states join Dow-DuPont merger probe -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/dow-ma-dupont-idUSL1N1D81VL?type=companyNews

288,"   By Diane Bartz and Olivia Oran | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. corporate dealmakers were likely to put major merger plans on hold as they assess whether U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his populist promises and a threat to block AT&T Inc's (T.N) purchase of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), or act more like traditional business-friendly Republican administrations.Trump's rhetoric and the personal nature of the campaign, which included little discussion of policy, left many uncertain about the new U.S. leader's plans, including how his administration will handle mega-mergers.Wall Street braced for a drop in deals, with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday projecting a 20 to 30 percent downside for earnings of banks that focus on merger and acquisition advice, and Jefferies saying that uncertainty about Trump's policy on trade, healthcare, taxes and energy could hamper underwriting activity and M&A globally.""I think a lot of deals will hit the pause button for a bit until we get some clarity on whether President Trump will moderate or be as disruptive as some expect,"" said a senior Wall Street banker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media.""It's going to be a tough environment for everything until we see how [Trump] behaves as a leader,"" the banker added.Trump said in October that AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio was an example of a ""power structure"" rigged against him and voters, and that he would block a deal.The gap between Time Warner shares and the implied value of AT&T’s cash and stock bid was over 23 percent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, compared to around 22 percent at Tuesday's close, indicating greater investor skepticism that the companies will be able to complete the transaction.  Still, some investors believed the man who considers himself business friendly would take a more moderate tone than in the campaign once he assumes office, as he did on Tuesday night in his acceptance speech.""We think Trump will be pretty good for merger and acquisition activity. As a general proposition, he is pro-business and pro-free market,"" said Roy Behren, portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Management.Other big pending U.S. deals also did not see sharp changes in their spreads on Wednesday morning, and the spreads of three pharmaceutical or health care-related deals that have encountered antitrust troubles, Aetna (AET.N)-Humana (HUM.N), Anthem (ANTM.N)-Cigna (CI.N) and Walgreens (WBA.O)-Rite Aid (RAD.N), actually narrowed, signaling investors may think they are more likely to close under a Trump administration. The president does not directly decide if a merger is illegal under antitrust law and the job is done by the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, which divide up the work of assessing mergers. If one of the agencies decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree.AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens on Wednesday said his company was looking forward to working with Trump and  ""optimistic"" regulators would approve the deal. Trump's policies and discussions ""about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T's goals,"" Stephens said at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York.Time Warner's shares were last down 1 percent to $86.71, after trading as low as $85.60, while AT&T shares were up just under 1 percent at $37.24. The Dow and S&P 500 were both over 1 percent higher in late afternoon trading. The election results mean ""increased risks"" for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said.""At the very least, there are going to be individuals put in place (by a Trump administration) that are going to make the deal a lot more challenging to complete,"" he added.   Trump's protectionist stance also raises the risk that some foreign corporations, including from China, may face higher hurdles in trying to take over American companies, dealmakers said.""If you were thinking about doing a cross-border deal six months ago you weren't considering things like potential trade barriers, protectionism and tariffs. These are things you have to at least develop a view on and factor into the risk assessment of doing an overseas deal now,"" said Johs Worsoe, MUFG’s head of investment banking & markets in the Americas.
