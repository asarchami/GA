0,"  Stars edge Kings at American Airlines CenterDALLAS -- Dallas Stars left winger Erik Cole capped a stellar December, scoring twice in a 3-2 win Tuesday against the Los Angeles Kings at the American Airlines Center. Cole finished December with eight goals, tying him for the team lead with center Tyler Seguin, who also scored in the victory.Cole scored twice in the second period for his second two-goal game in three games. He also scored a pair in a 4-1 win over the Nashville Predators on Friday, with both goals again coming in the middle frame.""Physically, he's dominated some of the game,"" Stars coach Lindy Ruff said of Cole's recent surge. ""He's got himself in the right spot.""Seguin had a goal and an assist for Dallas (20-12-7, 47 points). Center and captain Jamie Benn contributed two assists while Stars goaltender Kari Lehtonen stopped 23 shots to earn his 16th win.Centers Jeff Carter and Anze Kopitar each scored for the Kings (25-12-4, 54 points), who lost their fourth straight.""I thought we played really well,"" Kings coach Darryl Sutter said. ""We got a little bit of a bad break on the second goal. We're not scoring any goals right now. We easily could have won the last three. That's the way it goes."" The Stars finished 2-for-5 on the power play, their first home game with multiple power-play goals this season.""We did some good things (on the power play),"" Ruff said. ""On the rebound, (Alex) Chiasson threw a puck to the net that Tyler (Seguin) did a great job of putting it into the back (of the net).""Lehtonen squashed a bid by Carter to score on a tip-in at the right post at 7:50 of the opening period. Carter, however, would not be denied at 12:23 of the first when he scored his 13th, a 4-on-3 power-play goal. Stationed at the left post, a pass from center Mike Richards found Carter's stick and glanced off his right shoulder before landing in the back of the Dallas net.The Stars returned the favor with a power-play goal at 15:58 of the first from Cole, who collected the carom after the initial shot by rookie right winger Alex Chiasson was stopped by Kings goaltender Ben Scrivens and slipped it home to tie the game.Kopitar nearly drew the visitors ahead again at 17:13 of the first but his wrister from the slot rang off the crossbar.The Stars took their first lead at 12:13 of the second when Seguin scored a power-play goal from an impossible angle for his 20th. After a wrister by Chiasson from the left point went wide of the net, Seguin played the carom perfectly off the end boards and slipped the puck just inside the right post, sending it in off Scrivens' left pad. ""That's how goal scorers score goals,"" Scrivens said. ""They throw the puck. They find ways to score when it doesn't look like there's room. I've got to give credit to a good player too.""Dallas took a 3-1 lead at 15:16 of the second when Cole connected for his second of the game with a wrister from the top edge of the left circle. Six seconds earlier, Scrivens denied Cole in almost the same spot with his skate, but this time Cole finished over the Kings goaltender for his 10th of the season.Kopitar made it a one-goal game again when he beat Lehtonen short side with a wrister from the left circle 1:05 into the third period. Kopitar gained possession after the puck deflected off Benn and Kopitar finished with precision for his 13th.With 1:01 remaining, Scrivens left the ice for the extra attacker. Kings right winger Justin Williams had a great chance to force overtime with 24 seconds left but his shot was deflected and covered by Lehtonen.Scrivens stopped 29 shots for the Kings.NOTES: LW Daniel Carcillo, C Colin Fraser and D Alec Martinez were scratched by Los Angeles. ... Stars LW Ray Whitney, who missed Tuesday's morning skate due to illness, was the lone scratch for Dallas. It ended his string of 16 consecutive starts. ... Only six Stars -- C Jamie Benn, D Trevor Daley, C Vernon Fiddler, D Alex Goligoski, G Kari Lehtonen and D Stephane Robidas -- remain on the roster from Dallas' last New Year's Eve game on Dec. 31, 2011, against the Boston Bruns. ... G Ben Scrivens started in goal for Los Angeles. Rookie G Martin Jones started in the Kings' 1-0 loss to the Blackhawks in Chicago on Monday. ... Stars C Dustin Jeffrey was in the lineup for the first time since Dec. 12 at Nashville. Jeffrey was a healthy scratch the past eight games. ... RW Matt Frattin was in the Kings' lineup for the first time since Dec. 17 against the Edmonton Oilers. ...

The carrier recently selected a new reservations system.""It's really early in the merger but we are off to a great start,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker said during a conference call. ""We have a lot of work ahead."" American Airlines Group said on Tuesday it had a net loss of $2 billion, or $8.66 a share, in the fourth quarter, after charges of $2.4 billion tied to AMR Corp's emergence from Chapter 11 protection and merger costs.Still, excluding those charges, combined profit for AMR, American's former parent company, and US Airways, was $436 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $42 million. Adjusted profit was 59 cents a share, higher than the 55 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Reuters. The merger of American and US Airways was the fourth major union in the U.S. airline industry since 2008. American significantly pared costs in bankruptcy, and the merger gave its biggest unions equity stakes in the new company.Combined revenue grew 8.7 percent to $9.98 billion, better than the $9.9 billion expected by analysts.

30,"  * To end ticketing agreement effective Monday* To also end reciprocal frequent-flyer program* Merger with US Airways gives ""greater connectivity"" - spokesmanMarch 10 American Airlines said it planned to end agreements covering ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs with JetBlue Airways after its merger with US Airways gave it ""greater connectivity"" along the U.S. East Coast.American Airlines, which merged with US Airways in December to form American Airlines Group Inc, had a so-called interline agreement with JetBlue that allowed customers to buy connecting flights on each other's planes on one ticket.New York-based JetBlue has 80 percent of its operations in the U.S. Northeast. ""Through the merger with US Airways, American's network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement,"" American Airlines' spokesman Casey Norton wrote in an email to Reuters.Carriers enter into interline agreements because they allow them to offer more destinations without having to make large investments.The partnership with American Airlines was ""not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said at a JP Morgan conference in New York City on Monday. JetBlue, which has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, also said it expected unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, to rise 1-2 percent in the current quarter.American Airlines and JetBlue will not accept new interline ticket sales with each other from Monday, the companies said in a statement. The carriers also said customers using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs would no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, effective April 1.The frequent-flyer program agreement between the two includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.All American Airlines' ""AAdvantage"" miles or JetBlue's ""TrueBlue"" points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers' accounts and will not be affected, the carriers said.American Airlines Group also said its February load factor, or percentage of seats sold, fell to 78.4 percent from 78.7 percent a year earlier.American Airlines shares were down about 1 percent at $38.55 in early trading.

35,"  * Carrier to double flights from Washington area airport* New flights follow purchase of slots from American Airlines   (Adds aviation consultants' comments, closing share prices)By Karen JacobsMarch 24 Southwest Airlines Co will more than double its flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport this year with new nonstop routes to cities including Akron-Canton, Ohio; Indianapolis and Dallas Love Field, it said on Monday.The carrier also plans to add nonstop flights between Reagan National and Chicago Midway, Houston Hobby, St. Louis and other U.S. airports it serves.The new flights came about after Southwest bought takeoff and landing rights that formerly belonged to American Airlines Group at the airport near Washington. American agreed to divest the rights under a deal with the U.S. government that cleared the way for its merger late last year. With the additional access, Southwest will be increasing service at Reagan National to 44 daily departures from 17.New York-based JetBlue Airways also won takeoff and landing rights, or slots, at Reagan National from American, and said earlier this month it planned flights to markets including Charleston, South Carolina, and Hartford, Connecticut. The U.S. Justice Department stipulated that slots being sold should go to low-fare carriers to boost competition at Reagan National, a popular, gate-restricted airport that serves the political and business communities. The new flights from Southwest could bring lower fares between Washington and some big U.S. hub cities such as Chicago, said Robert Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, New York.""You've got nonstops in a market like Washington-Chicago where the majority of service is to O'Hare, and it's at a fairly high price so in that sense service to Midway undoubtedly will discipline the O'Hare market,"" Mann said.He said Southwest's service between Washington and Love Field would ""provide price discipline"" in the Dallas market considering that larger carriers like American fly to the D.C. area from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. SMALL CITIES TO LOSE SERVICE But Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant in Evergreen, Colorado, said the new service from Southwest and JetBlue in Washington will come at the expense of smaller markets that had their flights cut by American as a result of the divestitures. Cities that are losing daily nonstop flights to Washington from American include Savannah and Augusta in Georgia; Tallahassee, Florida; Little Rock, Arkansas, and Omaha, Nebraska. ""It's not going to be a sea change and a huge improvement,"" Boyd said.Southwest will add daily service between Reagan National and Chicago Midway; Nashville, Tennessee, and New Orleans on Aug. 10. At the end of September, Southwest plans three more roundtrip flights to Chicago Midway out of Reagan National, as well as two roundtrip flights to and from Tampa Bay, Florida.In early November, Southwest will start service to Akron-Canton, Dallas Love Field and Indianapolis, and add more nonstop flights between Reagan National and St. Louis and Houston Hobby airport.American's former parent, AMR Corp, and US Airways Group agreed to give up 52 pairs of takeoff and landing rights, or 104 slots, at Reagan National as well as gates at five other airports to settle an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department seeking to block their merger. The merger was completed in December.Southwest successfully bid for 54 slots at Reagan National, and it also acquired slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport that American agreed to sell.Shares of Southwest Airlines rose 0.8 percent to close at $23.37 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Other airlines closed higher, with American Airlines rising 1.9 percent to close at $36.80 and JetBlue up 0.2 percent at $8.53.

41,"   By Karen Jacobs | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) has been making inroads in the dogfight over the lucrative market for business travel between New York and London, but the newly merged American Airlines Group (AAL.O) is fighting back.Delta is hoping to attract customers through its new partnership with Virgin Atlantic, known for its high-tech and non-traditional approach to flying, and its own boosted profile in New York, where it expanded flights and renovated terminals.Now under new management, American is trying to bounce back from years of under-investment and market share losses, drawing from its recent merger with U.S. Airways.The New York-London route is popular with Wall Street executives who are willing to pay for the priciest seats and who often travel at the last minute. Eager for their business, airlines are using their best planes on the route and investing in upgrades such as satellite WiFi and seats that turn into flat beds.The alliances provide more flights under one banner, and better links to other U.S. and European cities. That convenience can win over corporate accounts, locking in lucrative business travelers.""This is a battle royale,"" said George Hamlin, an aviation consultant in Fairfax, Virginia. ""This is about who gets the greatest number of the passengers who pay the most money.""American and joint venture partner British Airways (ICAG.L) have an estimated 59 percent share of seats flown between the United States and London's Heathrow airport, compared with about 24 percent for Delta and Virgin, and United Continental Holdings Inc's (UAL.N) 14 percent share, according to a U.S. government filing by Delta and Virgin.IMPORTANCE OF NEW YORK London is the top international destination from New York and business-class fares can reach into the thousands of dollars, making the route one of the most profitable.For example, the highest possible business-class fare between John F. Kennedy airport and London Heathrow on any given day is about $18,200 round trip, according to Nick Fleetwood, a manager at Cook Travel in New York.While the airlines don't disclose New York-London revenue, their Atlantic routes, which include destinations other than London, account for significant income. Delta's passenger revenue from Atlantic service rose 3 percent to $5.7 billion last year, and the region supplied about 15 percent of its operating revenue. American's 2013 Atlantic revenue rose 10 percent to $3.8 billion, accounting for about 14 percent of overall revenue.Delta says corporate customer interest has increased since its Virgin venture formally began in January. While Virgin's hip image and planes fitted with mood lighting and futuristic bars are part of the lure, Delta is also aiming to win business travelers who previously shunned it because of its weak schedule to London Heathrow.Delta offered just three nonstop daily flights between New York's JFK airport and Heathrow before the tie-up. Starting next month, its venture with Virgin will operate nine nonstops between the New York area and London, and aim for flight times that are more convenient for business travelers.That compares with 17 daily flights between the New York area and London from American Airlines and British Airways.Delta-Virgin customers will also have greater choice flying to London from other parts of the United States as the two airlines fill holes in each other's route maps. ""Delta prior to this merger was a player but not to the extent that it will be able to compete now,"" said Goran Gligorovic, executive vice president with Omega World Travel, an agency that handles corporate contracts with airlines. ""The more reach an airline has, either with alliances, code-shares or its own service, the more interesting partner it becomes for any corporation,"" he said.FENDING OFF THE CHALLENGE American must work through labor problems, complete gate divestitures and meld computer systems following its exit from bankruptcy and merger with US Airways late last year. Now the world's largest carrier by traffic, American will refresh its fleet with hundreds of new planes over the next few years.American has put its flagship aircraft on the New York to London route: a new extended range Boeing 777-300 that has separate cabins for first and business class with fully reclining seats, as well as coach seats with power outlets and USB jacks. Late last year, American took an older 777 used on the route out of service to upgrade it with lie-flat seating, citing a need to be competitive with the Delta-Virgin venture.Once the top carrier at both LaGuardia and JFK airports, American lost its lead over the past decade. Meanwhile, Delta added flights and upgraded facilities at Kennedy and LaGuardia, United merged with Continental and built a fortress hub in Newark and JetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) expanded at JFK.American is now second behind Delta in passenger market share at LaGuardia, and ranks third at JFK, behind JetBlue and Delta, according to data for 2013 from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

United sank 9.3 percent to $41.78 and JetBlue was off 2.9 percent to $8.34.Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst and founder with Atmosphere Research Group, said United Continental needed to make improvements. United has been working to win back customers after system changes it made after its 2010 merger hurt customer service. ""It's clear that weather aside, United is not offering a product that travelers like and is losing market share,"" Harteveldt said. ""While United has made some improvements, it's still not strong enough.""United's first-quarter loss was $609 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $417 million. The company said during a conference call that it was taking actions to improve revenue that include better matching plane size to flight demand, and added it expected domestic unit revenue to rise 4 percent to 6 percent in the current period.American's first quarter results were aided by proceeds from sales of takeoff and landing rights at Reagan National Airport near Washington it had to make under an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. Harteveldt said American and Delta Air Lines  were ""firing on all cylinders,"" keeping costs under control and garnering more revenue from premium travelers.Delta on Wednesday forecast stronger than expected operating margin and unit revenue increase for the second quarter, sending its shares to a new year high above $37.00. On Thursday, its shares were up 0.6 percent to $37.30.

That deal, a record at the time, was due to be split equally between versions of the revamped A320neo family and the existing generation of Airbus medium-haul jets known as A320ceo.The transaction was so big that Airbus also originally agreed to arrange for half of the 260 jets to be supplied by leasing companies from planes already in the market, but the new data suggested it will supply some of the leasing quota itself.American has converted 30 orders for the A321neo, the largest version of the series, to the existing A321ceo. In addition, 41 aircraft that were originally due to have been supplied by leasing companies - 23 A321ceo and 7 A319ceo - now appear as direct purchases from Airbus. There was no immediate sign that this meant an increase in American's fleet expansion plans, which also include a large order from Boeing.The 2011 American deal forced Boeing to follow Airbus' strategy by revamping its 737 jets with new engines rather than waiting for a more ambitious redesign of its most-sold jet. The massive fleet overhaul was complex not only because of its size but because the airline was at the time under bankruptcy protection.Airbus sales chief John Leahy told Reuters last year some of the jets due to be supplied to the U.S. airline on its behalf by lessors would be supplied directly instead.The reshuffle came as U.S. leasing giant International Lease Finance Corp, which is due to be taken over by Dutch-based AerCap, cancelled orders for 9 A321ceo aircraft.Airbus's order tally was boosted by an internal sale of six A330 long-distance jets to its military division for conversion into aerial refuelling tankers.Airbus delivered 193 aircraft between January and April including six A380 superjumbos.

The FAA is working to clear residual smoke from the radar room to let air traffic controllers return to work.About 700 flights were canceled at Chicago airports, and limited arrivals and departures resumed more than three hours after the incident. At O'Hare, most flights in and out of the airport were delayed by more than an hour, according to the city's department of aviation.Local television showed long lines of jets backed up at O'Hare and queues of passengers re-booking flights.

Its current schedule includes 48 weekly flights to San Juan, Dallas/Forth Worth and New York.The International Airline Transport Association (IATA) says its member airlines have $4 billion in ticket revenue that they have been unable to repatriate due to delays in the South American nation's currency control mechanism.""Since we are owed a substantial outstanding amount ($750 million through March 2014) and have been unable to reach resolution on the debt, we will significantly reduce our flights to the country,"" an airline official wrote in an email. The company says it has worked in Venezuela for more than 25 years, and the country was the airline's first destination in South America.President Nicolas Maduro has threatened to kick out airlines that halt flights or restrict service. He recently attributed the problem to flights being rerouted to Brazil for the World Cup soccer championships. Venezuela's 11-year-old currency control system requires that airlines bill tickets in the bolivar currency. But it has provided only limited approval to repatriate those funds back into dollars.Air Canada recently cut flights to Venezuela because of security concerns, while Alitalia suspended services due to delays in repatriating revenue. The government last month reached a deal with six small airlines that agreed to reduced payment, and the economy vice-president said another $486 million would be released to the airline industry.Despite some advances, the airlines remain frustrated at the situation, an IATA spokesman said.Airlines for years priced tickets at the strongest official exchange rate, which has been devalued over the last 18 months.Starting in July, the government will allow airlines to repatriate revenue at a rate of around 50 bolivars per dollar, from roughly 11 bolivars currently.

The second quarter is typically a strong period for airlines because it includes some vacation travel.American Airlines, formed in the December 2013 merger of AMR Corp and US Airways Group, said it could take charges of up to $630 million in the period. It cited a charge of about $330 million tied to the sale of its portfolio of fuel-hedge contracts and an added $250 million to $300 million in charges related to its merger and other items.Shares of U.S. airlines were mostly higher in morning trading, with American Airlines up 1.9 percent at $41.01 and Southwest up 2.1 percent at $27.26. Delta was up 1.5 percent at $36.98, and United Continental was off 0.1 percent at $39.50.

Adds June forecast in second paragraph to show that the most recent previous outlook by the company was in June, not in April.)July 9 American Airlines Group slightly moderated its growth forecast on Wednesday for an important revenue measure for the second quarter, which is typically a strong period for carriers.Unit revenue, also known as passenger revenue per available seat mile, is expected to grow between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, American said in a statement. At the higher end of that range, that forecast is a touch lower than the company's outlook in June, which called for a rise of 5 percent to 7 percent. In April, American had expected unit revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent in the three months through June.

It earlier reported it had been picked by American Airlines to provide engines for 100 Airbus A320neo jets the airline has on order, in a deal worth $2.6 billion at list prices.When asked about media reports that easyJet was poised to order CFM engines to power 100 A320neo planes, Ebanga told Reuters CFM had made an offer to the low cost carrier, but that it was up to the airline to decide now. CFM competes with Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp, to supply engines for the A320neo.Ebanga highlighted CFM had provided the engines for easyJet's first Boeing planes and that the airline was its biggest customer for the CFM56-5B engine.""We have grown up with them, we hope the adventure will continue,"" he said. Executives at the briefing also said CFM was on schedule with testing and certification for its new Leap engine, with the first variant due to come into service in 2016, and that the company was working hard to ensure it was ready to increase production to 1,800 engines per year by 2020 from the current rate of 1,500.Executive Vice-President Cedric Goubet said the company was also looking to make improvements on the Leap engine further down the line, once it has come into service, using new technology such as lighter weight materials or additive manufacturing.""We will be ready at the relevant time to respond to a potential market demand in terms of further improvement of the engine after the entry into service,"" he said.The use of new composites on fan blades and other components means the Leap already shaves 1,000 pounds (450 kilogrammes) off the weight of a plane. Goubet said it should be possible to reduce the weight further by hundreds of pounds.

113,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  American Airlines has won regulatory approval to swap flight attendants' paper manuals for lighter Samsung tablets in a change that will save nearly $1 million a year, the company said on Wednesday.The move, which does not yet affect attendants at American Airlines Group Inc's (AAL.O) subsidiary US Airways, comes little more than a year after American's cockpit went paperless, and is one of many strategies that airlines have pursued to reduce weight and fuel costs. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and United Airlines (UAL.N) have also distributed smart devices to their pilots, and Delta plans to roll out an e-manual for flight attendants starting in October.American said its attendants already have the tablets, and those at US Airways will receive them after the combined company receives a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. The timing of that is uncertain.""Conserving fuel is important to an airline because it is a huge cost,"" said American Airlines spokesperson Andrea Huguely. American stock rose 1.63 percent Wednesday to close at $38.58.American and Delta see smart devices as a boon to cabin service, allowing attendants to see where premium customers are seated and direct more attention to them, the spokespeople said. Tablets also will simplify in-flight food and beverage sales.Delta is ""arming our flight attendants to help deliver more personalized customer assistance,"" said Kate Modolo, a Delta spokesperson. When American replaced roughly 35-lb pilot bags with 1.2-lb iPads, it said it would save $1.2 million in fuel costs annually. Switching to tablets from nearly 5-lb flight attendant manuals only will net the airline $650,000 a year. The remaining $300,000 in savings will come from reduced printing and shipping costs.Airlines are ""looking for lots of little things that together - $300,000 at a time - could add up to real money,"" said industry consultant Robert Mann. Since 2005, American Airlines has saved 1 billion gallons of fuel under a program called Fuel Smart, Huguely said.Initiatives have ranged from pilots using only a single engine during taxiing when this is deemed safe, to removing antiquated phones attached to the seat backs of old planes, saving weight.After years of losses, U.S. airlines have been profitable over the last four years.

122,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Oct 3 American Airlines Group plans to replace jets from its regional unit Envoy Air Inc out of Miami with larger ones from a Republic Airways Inc unit, leading to about 50 job cuts at Envoy.The move follows Envoy pilots' vote in March to reject a new labor contract including a wage freeze and increased healthcare costs. At the time, American said other regional carriers that fly under its American Eagle brand, such as Republic, would get more work from the world's largest airline.Envoy will roll back its Miami flights to 37 daily departures from 60 starting Dec. 18, according to a letter that Envoy Chief Executive Officer Pedro Fábregas sent to employees. American instead will contract larger 76-seat planes from Republic for these routes, mostly in and nearby Florida. The move highlights how U.S. airlines are distancing themselves from the small planes once widely used by their feeder carriers to pack in more passengers and increase fuel efficiency. Envoy anticipates cutting about 50 maintenance, management and support jobs in Miami as it relocates 11 of its 50-seat aircraft, some of which may replace smaller Envoy planes elsewhere that are to be retired.""The 50-seat aircraft are going, not just at American, but at every airline,"" said industry consultant Robert Mann. ""The fuel burn per seat per hour on a 50-seat jet is far higher (than on) a 70-seat replacement."" The larger planes also allow American to offer two cabin classes rather than one on these regional Miami routes, American spokeswoman Martha Thomas said. Thomas said that the Envoy pilots' contract rejection did not influence the change, adding that the airline was only matching ""the right planes for the right market.""While Envoy did not say it intended to fire any pilots, Mann said Envoy's fleet reduction may result in pilot furloughs, unless American hires them for its mainline fleet, which has occurred in the past.American stock rose about 6.8 percent to close at $36.23 Friday, although it was not immediately clear that the announcement caused the increase.

United, while projecting a more moderate unit revenue increase compared to last year, reported that third-quarter profit more than doubled. ""The general theme is that the revenue environment seems to be healthy still, demand remains strong and airlines still have pricing power,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore, noting that airlines industry-wide raised one-way fares by $2 last week.American Airlines, already the world's largest airline by passenger traffic, promised in an earnings call to outstrip its competitors by the end of 2015 as the carrier with ""industry leading"" profit margins before tax.While the Fort Worth-based carrier acknowledged a temporary drop in bookings the day after congressional hearings on the Ebola virus, it expects passenger revenue per available seat mile to grow by 2 to 4 percent in the current quarter, excluding the impact of cash being trapped in Venezuela, which has hurt U.S. airlines that operated there.Other airlines also downplayed Ebola threat's impact on bookings. ADDITIONAL ROWS American said it earned $1.66 per diluted share without special items - beating Wall Street's expectations - and net income of $942 million in the third quarter, a nearly 87 percent improvement on the combined incomes of American and U.S. Airways before they merged in December 2013.American expects its capacity to grow between 2 and 3 percent in 2015, while United anticipated growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Those figures are not directly comparable because the airlines forecast capacity in different ways. The forecasts parallel Delta's, which last week promised a roughly 2 percent growth in capacity next year. A large portion of the increase will come from the airlines fitting additional rows in their planes flying domestic routes without sacrificing legroom.""At this point we don't think they're growing too fast,"" Corridore said.Investors were somewhat less enthused about Southwest Airlines (LUV.N).

""Without a cost-effective pilot agreement in place, Envoy will not secure new jets and faces challenges in recruiting new pilots without the promise of a renewed fleet,"" he added.Envoy pilots rejected a labor contract in March. While baggage handlers, ticket and gate agents will keep their jobs, Envoy will likely fire some maintenance workers, according to a spokesperson at American who asked not to be named. It was not immediately clear how the news would impact flight attendants.One of American's other regional subsidiaries, Piedmont Airlines, will receive at least 20 of the transferred aircraft. Trans States Airlines and a second contractor yet to be announced will receive the remaining jets, the letter said.

142,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  American Airlines (AAL.O) Chief Executive Doug Parker said airlines should stop sharing profits with employees and improve wages instead, despite persistent pressure from his own workers to link part of their pay to the company's performance.In an interview, Parker, the head of the world's largest airline by passenger traffic, called profit-sharing outdated.  Competitors Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), United Airlines (UAL.N) and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) still tout the millions of dollars they give to employees each quarter.""They're bankruptcy-era contracts, and we're past those days,"" Parker said, adding that airlines offered profit-sharing in the last decade to make up for wage cuts. ""We should move back to what normal industrial companies do, which is pay people (what) they earn.""People prefer to have the certainty"" of wages, he said.American merged with US Airways a year ago and is in the process of negotiating contracts that cover workers from both airlines.While some work groups from US Airways, including ticket and gate agents, still have profit-sharing under their old contracts, American's refusal to share recent profits has frustrated workers at the carrier, which earned a record $942 million last quarter. Delta shared $384 million of profit with its workers last quarter, while Southwest paid employees $100 million on top of their wages. United, which does not share profits quarterly, doled out $190 million for 2013.Unions representing American's pilots and flight attendants have pressed hard for profit-sharing. They say it would put them on par with counterparts at other airlines and note that American's former contracts provided for it.Profit-sharing gives workers ""a feeling of being valued,"" said Leslie Mayo, a spokeswoman for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents workers at American. Last month, American's flight attendants narrowly rejected an agreement worth $193 million more than their current contract, in part because it did not include profit-sharing. The talks moved to arbitration, where APFA asked for the option to concede $50 million in wages per year in exchange for profit-sharing if another workgroup at American gets it.But the arbitrators rejected the request Saturday, giving American its first joint labor contract after the merger. Parker has expressed willingness to restore the millions of dollars that the flight attendants voted down, according to APFA.American's pilots are pushing for profit-sharing as well. In 2012, management offered them continued profit-sharing or pay increases in a temporary agreement through 2017. With the company still in bankruptcy, they chose the increases. Now American is offering a replacement deal that it says would give the pilots industry-leading wages, but without profit-sharing.The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's pilots, says the offer still leaves its members far behind their counterparts at Delta because of profit-sharing.American's leadership ""has listened to our concerns ... more than the previous management team,"" APA President Keith Wilson said, although negotiations have started to strain relations.""We don't want this hope dashed,"" he said.

145,"  American Airlines Group Inc said Tuesday that it plans to pay flight attendants an additional four percentage points on top of raises already averaging 10 percent, thanks to profits that have strengthened as oil prices have collapsed. In a letter to employees, Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker said ""very strong"" results for 2014 would allow the carrier to lock in substantial wage hikes for the flight attendants. Other work groups would also see improvements in their raises - once their respective contracts are ratified. Plummeting oil prices have slashed costs at the world's largest airline by passenger traffic, which is poised to save more than its competitors because it did not hedge against prices rising.Unions have called on Parker to tie employee compensation to the company's performance, but Parker has opposed profit-sharing, practiced by Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines.""There are many ways to share success, but when it comes to compensation, we believe it is best to reward (workers) with industry leading wage rates – not lower wages supplemented by compensation that varies with airline profitability,"" he wrote in the letter, obtained by Reuters.The pay increases show how seriously American views labor relations, which have often emerged as a stumbling block in other airline merger deals, as it joins its operations with US Airways a year into the carriers' merger. Hourly rates for flight attendants will be seven percent higher than those at Delta or United, Parker said in the letter. A separate letter from the airline cited an hourly rate of $24.18 for first-year flight attendants.Yet the announcement also placed American's other workers under pressure to conclude contracts, a prerequisite for their raises. The carrier hopes to avoid the fate of other merged airlines that struggled for years to reach deals for all their workers. Pilots are the next group up for a contract, and the company said in a third letter Tuesday that it had ended negotiations with them, leaving them to choose between a final offer or  arbitration as early as February 2015.The letter added that if pilots accept the offer prior to Jan. 3, higher pay rates would be effective retroactively as of Dec. 2, 2014, rather than after the agreement.The company's proposal would raise pilots' pay about 23 percent upon signing and then three percent for the next two years, compared to smaller gains they would get under an arbitrated contract, the company said in the letter.

151,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines formally launched bids Monday to wrest control of a key slot in Tokyo's Haneda Airport from Delta Air Lines as part of a fight among the carriers to stake out a greater presence in Asia.The two airlines have lobbied the U.S. Department of Transportation for months to rescind Delta's right to land at the airport in one of four daily times, or slots, allotted to U.S. carriers by an international agreement between the United States and Japan. Last month, the regulator agreed to review the situation, specifying Jan. 5 as the deadline for carriers to bid formally for the slot.Monday's applications by American and Hawaiian reflect the larger battle taking place for service to Asia. If either wins the slot, competition would increase over U.S. travelers to the region, where Delta and United Airlines are currently the leading U.S. carriers.American and Hawaiian allege that the incumbent, which won the right to fly from Seattle to Haneda in 2013, has underused the slot, planning limited winter service barely enough to prevent the slot from reverting to the regulator. They say they would serve Haneda more frequently than Delta and give U.S. travelers more options, with American vying to fly from Los Angeles and Hawaiian petitioning to fly from Kona International Airport in Hawaii.Delta earlier responded to the campaign by asking the Department of Transportation on Dec. 22 to drop its review. The petition said Delta is in ""full compliance"" with the conditions of the slot order, adding that the regulator gave it the slot ""indefinitely"" under those terms without specifying that it could revoke the grant if it so chose.In a testimony included with American's application, its Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Nocella wrote, ""Addressing the lack of any American service at all to Haneda is critical to American's Asia presence, enhancing our network to be competitive with United and Delta, and giving the traveling public meaningful choices."" ""Gaining access to Haneda heads the list of American's top international priorities,"" he added.The other three slots to Haneda, which is closer to Tokyo but has less foreign traffic than Narita International Airport, are operated by United Airlines from San Francisco, Hawaiian from Honolulu and Delta from Los Angeles.

152,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Jan 5 American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines formally launched bids Monday to wrest control of a key slot in Tokyo's Haneda Airport from Delta Air Lines  as part of a fight among the carriers to stake out a greater presence in Asia.The two airlines have lobbied the U.S. Department of Transportation for months to rescind Delta's right to land at the airport in one of four daily times, or slots, allotted to U.S. carriers by an international agreement between the United States and Japan. Last month, the regulator agreed to review the situation, specifying Jan. 5 as the deadline for carriers to bid formally for the slot.Monday's applications by American and Hawaiian reflect the larger battle taking place for service to Asia. If either wins the slot, competition would increase over U.S. travelers to the region, where Delta and United Airlines are currently the leading U.S. carriers.American and Hawaiian allege that the incumbent, which won the right to fly from Seattle to Haneda in 2013, has underused the slot, planning limited winter service barely enough to prevent the slot from reverting to the regulator. They say they would serve Haneda more frequently than Delta and give U.S. travelers more options, with American vying to fly from Los Angeles and Hawaiian petitioning to fly from Kona International Airport in Hawaii.Delta earlier responded to the campaign by asking the Department of Transportation on Dec. 22 to drop its review. The petition said Delta is in ""full compliance"" with the conditions of the slot order, adding that the regulator gave it the slot ""indefinitely"" under those terms without specifying that it could revoke the grant if it so chose. In a testimony included with American's application, its Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Nocella wrote, ""Addressing the lack of any American service at all to Haneda is critical to American's Asia presence, enhancing our network to be competitive with United and Delta, and giving the traveling public meaningful choices.""""Gaining access to Haneda heads the list of American's top international priorities,"" he added. The other three slots to Haneda, which is closer to Tokyo but has less foreign traffic than Narita International Airport, are operated by United Airlines from San Francisco, Hawaiian from Honolulu and Delta from Los Angeles.Hawaiian said in a Monday release that its Honolulu service has been ""by far the most ... successful"" of these routes and added that Kona is a top destination for Japanese travelers.It was not immediately clear by which date the Department of Transportation intends to issue its decision.

153,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal judge has significantly cut back US Airways Inc's $1.45 billion lawsuit accusing airfare information distributor Sabre Corp of charging inflated fees and suppressing competition in how flights were displayed.US Airways had sought under federal antitrust law to recoup three times the $317 million to $482 million it claimed to lose in overcharges and profit from Sabre's alleged illegal conduct over nearly seven years, from April 21, 2007 to March 31, 2014.But in a decision on Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan said US Airways, now part of American Airlines Group Inc, may pursue damages claims covering only from Feb. 23, 2011 to Oct. 30, 2012, when Sabre and American settled similar litigation.The judge said she will explain the reasons for her decision in a later opinion.In a regulatory filing, Sabre estimated the decision reduced US Airways' potential recovery of ""single damages"" by more than 75 percent. This indicated a maximum potential award of less than $362 million, after tripling.Sabre said it will fight the remaining claims. The Southlake, Texas-based company has said it set aside $347 million for its settlement with American. AMR Corp, which was American's parent, merged with US Airways in December 2013. American spokesman Matt Miller said the Fort Worth, Texas-based company is pleased that US Airways may proceed toward a possible trial.""Sabre's actions have stymied competition, limited choice and raised airline costs, all to the detriment of customers,"" he said.At issue are the fees that Sabre and other travel reservation systems collect from airlines such as US Airways to display flights for booking. US Airways said Sabre's anticompetitive practices impeded travel agents and others from using alternative means to book seats that could have saved money for the carrier and consumers.It said the practices also inhibited ""Choice Seats,"" a 2010 US Airways program that gave better seats to passengers willing to pay extra fees.Schofield said US Airways may seek damages for booking fee overcharges during the 20-month period in 2011 and 2012, and for Sabre's alleged conspiracy with rivals Travelport Worldwide Ltd and Amadeus to restrain competition. The judge rejected the carrier's effort to recoup lost profits over Sabre's alleged effort to thwart the Choice Seats program.In afternoon trading on the Nasdaq, American shares dipped 0.3 percent to $52.88, and Sabre jumped 1.8 percent to $19.86.The case is US Airways Inc v.

160,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) on Tuesday forecast billions of dollars in savings this year from tumbling fuel costs, but said a key measure of revenue will likely decline this quarter, in part from currency headwinds that are pinching foreign travelers' pockets.The world's largest carrier by passenger traffic said its 2015 costs will drop by $5 billion because of the oil glut, which has driven down global oil prices by more than 57 percent since June.While closing costly fuel hedges has prevented its peers from benefiting from the full price decline, American has no hedges in place and expects its fuel price to be an industry-leading $1.71 to $1.76 per gallon in 2015.It forecast a strong 13 percent to 15 percent pre-tax margin for the first quarter.Yet American's outlook on unit revenue disappointed Wall Street, sending its shares down 3.4 percent in mid-afternoon trading.  The carrier expects a 2 to 4 percent decline in unit revenue for the first quarter year-over-year, while competitors such as United Airlines (UAL.N) have said their unit revenue will be between negative 1 percent and 1 percent.Unit revenue ""is being pressured in a number of markets where capacity is growing faster than demand,"" American Airlines President Scott Kirby said during the company's quarterly call. Total system capacity in 2015 is expected to grow between 2 and 3 percent, the airline reported. But currency headwinds have hurt unit revenue too, Kirby said. The depreciation of foreign currencies has lowered revenue in countries where American sells tickets in the local tender, he said, adding that where its prices are listed in U.S. dollars, such as in Brazil, the cost of travel to the United States becomes more prohibitive to foreigners.""A 25 percent depreciation in the Brazilian currency is obviously going to have an elasticity effect,"" Kirby said. ""The currency impact is probably something a little less than 1 percent on (unit revenue)."" U.S. citizens account for about 50 percent of American's sales to and from Europe, a majority of its sales to and from China, but less than 30 percent of its sales to and from South America, a region where currencies have steadily weakened against the dollar.But Kirby noted a stronger dollar could encourage more U.S. citizens to travel abroad, helping make it ""an earnings positive"" overall.Excluding special items, American earned $1.52 per diluted share last quarter, topping analysts' estimates, and said it will pay a dividend of 10 cents per share in February.

They remain mostly unchanged since. While American Airlines has said the outcome will increase its costs by about $650 million in 2015, analysts view the news as a win for the airline, which appears to have earned the favor of its workers while locking in a joint contract faster than newly merged airlines often do.""APA will now focus on further engagement with American Airlines management to address ongoing shortcomings in our contract,"" APA President Keith Wilson said.A ""no"" vote would have sent the pilots and management to binding arbitration, which would have capped wage gains to zero percent for December 2014, 3 percent for January and an extra 13 percent a year later, per an agreement that the pilots union had accepted during the merger.

167,"  Feb 9 American Airlines Group Inc on Monday lowered its forecast for first-quarter profit margins due to the recent rise in oil prices, and its shares fell 3 percent.The carrier said it expected a pretax margin of 12 percent to 14 percent, down from its earlier forecast of 13 percent to 15 percent. The estimates exclude special items.Global oil prices have risen by more than 21 percent in the past two weeks, pushing estimated fuel costs for the quarter to between $1.81 and $1.86 per gallon, up from American Airlines' prior forecast of $1.71 to $1.76. Still, airlines are poised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars less in fuel costs than they did last year because global oil prices are down nearly 50 percent since June even after the recent rally. Fuel typically is an airline's largest variable cost, representing a third or more of operating expenses. American Airlines, the largest carrier by passengers since it merged with US Airways, said it still expected unit revenue to fall 2 percent to 4 percent this quarter.

168,"  Feb 9 American Airlines Group Inc on Monday lowered its forecast for first-quarter profit margins due to the recent rise in oil prices, and its shares fell 3 percent.The carrier said it expected a pretax margin of 12 percent to 14 percent, down from its earlier forecast of 13 percent to 15 percent. The estimates exclude special items.Global oil prices have risen by more than 21 percent in the past two weeks, pushing estimated fuel costs for the quarter to between $1.81 and $1.86 per gallon, up from American Airlines' prior forecast of $1.71 to $1.76. Still, airlines are poised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars less in fuel costs than they did last year because global oil prices are down nearly 50 percent since June even after the recent rally. Fuel typically is an airline's largest variable cost, representing a third or more of operating expenses. American Airlines, the largest carrier by passengers since it merged with US Airways, said it still expected unit revenue to fall 2 percent to 4 percent this quarter. The company said it filled 78.2 percent of its available seats for January, down 2.1 percentage points from a year earlier.American Airlines' stock was down 3 percent at $46.69 in early trading.

174,"  Gogo Inc (GOGO.O), an in-flight internet services provider, gave a full-year revenue forecast range that was largely above analysts' average expectation, driven by a surge in demand from commercial and business aviation clients.Shares of the company, which also reported a better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter, were up about 5 percent at $18.40 in premarket trading on Thursday.Gogo forecast revenue of $490-$510 million for the year ending Dec. 31, compared with analysts' average estimate of $491.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Gogo gets more than half of its revenue from offering services and selling equipment to commercial aircraft customers in North America, but has been expanding that service overseas as well.The company, whose customers include American Airlines (AAL.O), Virgin America and Air Canada ACb.TO has been spending more on the expansion, for connectivity fees and regulatory approvals. Gogo, which also has a business aviation business, said it expects to offer its services on 125 additional commercial aircraft outside North America this year, doubling its count from 85 at the end of 2014.Still most of the growth in the fourth quarter was powered by the more profitable business aviation business, where revenue from services exceeded that from equipment sales for the first time. Higher average monthly service revenue per aircraft in both its commercial and aviation businesses helped revenue rise 18 percent to $109.2 million in the quarter and beat Wall Street expectation of $106.3 million.The company, which has not reported a profit since going public in 2013, said its net loss widened to $24.1 million from $22.1 million a year earlier.

187,"  (Adds American Airlines comment, details, bylines)By Jeffrey Dastin and Tim AhmannMarch 27 A U.S. regulator tentatively said Friday that Delta Air Lines Inc can keep a slot at Tokyo's Haneda Airport if it flies there from Seattle daily, upsetting competitors that had asked for Delta's slot to grow their presence in Asia.The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) said after months of proceedings that Delta's Seattle-Haneda route benefited the traveling public by providing one-stop service to Haneda from several western cities and by promoting a diversity of U.S. gateways. A Japan-U.S. agreement limits U.S. carriers to four landing times at Haneda, currently allotted to Delta from Seattle and Los Angeles, United Continental Holdings Inc from San Francisco and Hawaiian Holdings Inc from Honolulu.The decision marks a stumbling block to the Asia ambitions of American Airlines Group Inc. The world's largest airline has said it needs Haneda service to better compete with United and Delta and to offer more choices to travelers, as Haneda is closer to downtown Tokyo than Narita International Airport, where American, Delta and United all fly. However, DOT chose Los Angeles-Haneda service by American as the tentative backup if Delta does not meet additional flying conditions. American and Hawaiian had charged Delta with limiting its winter Haneda service from Seattle to the minimum necessary before the slot reverted to DOT.""The DOT has agreed with us in recognizing the importance of daily, year-round service in the U.S.-Haneda market,"" American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said. ""American stands ready to provide that service to customers through our Los Angeles hub."" DOT said that without a Department-granted waiver, Delta's failure to fly Seattle to and from Haneda every day in the future would constitute a violation subject to enforcement, and failure to fly those routes two out of any seven days would automatically rescind its authority and activate American's backup service.Delta has committed to resuming daily service beginning on March 29, DOT said in its decision. ""In addition, the record shows that Delta has taken steps to strengthen its commitment to Seattle by growing its Seattle hub.""Delta said in a statement it will operate daily flights between the airports year-round.

195,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) on Friday reported first-quarter profit above analysts' expectations and pleased investors with capacity cuts to match weakening international demand.American earned $932 million last quarter, nearly double its profit a year earlier. It earned $1.73 per diluted share excluding special items, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.71, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.American's shares traded up almost 4 percent, reflecting bolstered investor confidence in the carrier, the world's largest after it merged in 2013 with US Airways.With foreign travelers' spending power hurt by the strong U.S. dollar and in some cases lower oil prices, American slashed more than 1,000 seats it had planned to add to international routes by postponing the delivery of four Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 aircraft to 2017 from 2016, with another 787 delivery delayed until 2018.American expects that will cut 2016 capacity by 0.6 percent. It still forecasts 2015 capacity up about two percent compared with 2014, driven more by domestic than international growth. Rivals Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) have also announced cuts for travel outside the peak summer season.American's President Scott Kirby said growing capacity and competition with Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) have driven down airfare in Dallas, where the two carriers have major hubs. Fort Worth, Texas-based American also expects passenger revenue per available seat mile, a unit that measures a plane's carrying capacity, will fall four to six percent this quarter, with the largest impact in the Pacific and Latin America. United expects an equivalent decline, which is ""likely to put pressure on Delta to deliver"" the smaller, two to four-percent drop it forecast, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note.American estimates its pre-tax profit margin will be 18 to 20 percent this quarter without special items, higher than Delta or United's forecasts.Cheap fuel has lowered U.S. airlines' expenses, although it has hurt demand from customers in oil-rich nations.  For the second quarter, unhedged American forecast it will pay between $1.84 and $1.89 per gallon of jet fuel, while United and Delta's forecasts are higher by 21 cents or more because of hedge losses.

205,"   By Alwyn Scott | MIAMI  MIAMI American Airlines Group Inc Chief Executive Doug Parker voiced concern on Sunday about the risk that capacity growth among airlines could depress profits, but told Reuters that in contrast with past cycles, the rise in capacity ""feels different.""Asked about investor concerns that capacity increases at U.S. airlines are starting to exceed growth in demand, Parker said, ""the real question is, is this a one-time catch up for fuel prices being lower or is this airlines behaving like airlines used to and just increasing capacity because times are good.""I don't know if we know the answer to that yet,"" Parker said on the sidelines of an International Air Transport Association (IATA) global airlines conference in Miami.    U.S. airlines have posted billion-dollar profits in the past year as fuel costs fell. Industry consolidation has also reduced the forces that caused past capacity growth and price wars. The issue has flared up recently however, after American vowed to stand its ground as rival Southwest Airlines Co increases capacity in Dallas.  The comments sparked selling of U.S. airline stocks on fears that the two will begin discounting fares to compete in Dallas. The Texas city is a hub for both airlines, though they are based at different airports there. Despite the concerns, Parker said that this round of capacity increases ""feels different"" because airlines and their financial backers have learned painful lessons from past cycles about the costs of adding capacity. ""I think everybody in the industry understands that,"" he said. In a separate interview on the sidelines of the gathering of over 200 airlines, Air Canada Chief Executive Calin Rovinescu said he sees minimal risk of a damaging rise in capacity. ""The industry has learned the errors of the past,"" he told Reuters. ""We're dealing with a more mature and experienced dynamic now.""He added: ""People were undisciplined in the past, but they will be more disciplined this time. However, we will see rational growth where it makes sense to do it. You can't have one-size fits all perspective on capacity."" Asked about Asia, Parker said American expects to expand through partnerships and organic growth. Competitor Delta Air Lines Inc said last month it is interested in forging alliances with carriers in Asia.Parker didn't suggest new partnerships, noting American alliances with Japan Airlines Co Ltd and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. He said those wouldn't preclude expanding American service in those markets, however.

""This is not a macro economic commentary on air travel demand,"" said Josh Freed, an American spokesman.

The two planes compete fiercely and account for most of the record backlog of orders at Boeing and Airbus. They are revamped versions of the plane makers' best-selling jets, equipped with new, fuel-efficient engines.

217,"  (Adds details on new hires and cancellations, American comment, background, byline)By Jeffrey DastinJuly 10 US Airways will become history on Oct. 17, as the carrier's flight reservations move over to American Airlines in one of the last steps in the creation of the world's largest airline.American Airlines Group Inc, formed by the two carriers' 2013 merger, said on Friday it will have a single website, reservations system and brand starting on Oct. 17. The last two flights on subsidiary US Airways are scheduled to leave at 9:55 p.m. local time on Oct. 16, from San Francisco to Philadelphia and from Phoenix to Denver. The company still must reach joint collective bargaining agreements with certain work groups and combine technical systems related to flight movement and dispatch.US Airways flights scheduled beyond Oct. 16 will gradually receive American-only flight codes starting on July 18. Travelers already ticketed on one of those flights will get an email in coming weeks with their new reservation information, the airline said. The change is not as simple as switching flight codes. The company must transfer thousands of customer reservations from US Airways' platform to the one used by American. The airline hopes a gradual approach will stave off technical errors. Competitor United Continental Holdings Inc  had flipped the switch on reservations and frequent flyer systems in a single day, which led to customer service delays.American said it canceled flights around Oct. 17 to make the transition easier. It has hired some 1,300 full-time and part-time reservation agents and 600 airport agents, who will fill in for US Airways employees who are being trained on new systems.""We have not spared any expense in order to ensure we have the quality we need for something like this,"" said American's Chief Integration Officer Maya Leibman.

222,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | July 23  July 23 At least two U.S. airlines have started hedging their fuel costs after a months-long hiatus. The early result: more losses.Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc have added new hedges against a rise in oil prices just months after bets last year cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. With U.S. crude prices falling 21 percent since early June, Southwest appeared to regret the decision.""We were concerned that market prices would continue to escalate, so we did add some positions for the second half of this year,"" Southwest's Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo said on an investor call Thursday.At July 20 prices, those hedges will cost Southwest $308 million when they settle this year. Through 2018, Southwest said its hedge book is $1.3 billion in the red, although that could change if prices rise.Contracts now cover 40 percent of its expected fuel use in 2016 and 2017, up from 10 percent and 30 percent covered, respectively, as of April, filings show. ""We're mostly focused now on working our current position off, burning that position off in the most cost-effective way,"" Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said on the call.Cheap oil has been a boon to airline profits, typically offsetting hedge losses because fuel comprises about a third of airlines' operating expenses. Southwest earned $608 million last quarter, and United posted a $1.19 billion profit. While hedging can insure against soaring fuel costs as it did for Southwest a decade ago, in recent months carriers that did not hedge such as American Airlines Group Inc have emerged as winners.The oil glut, which depressed prices more than 50 percent since June 2014, resulted in hedged airlines doling out cash to parties on the other side of the bets and paying to exit contracts before more losses piled on.When prices crept up this spring, locking in fuel prices again seemed smart until July trading reversed the rise. United has begun building a ""small"" hedge for 2016 and will be ""opportunistic"" when considering more, its Chief Financial Officer John Rainey told investors Thursday.By contrast, Delta Air Lines Inc has not ""materially"" changed its hedges since February, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said last week.""We've been kind of sitting back, watching the market,"" he said.Losses from old hedges are expected to cost United and Delta more than $200 million each this quarter.

The decline could continue until the second half of 2016, President Scott Kirby told investors FridayThe forecast bodes poorly for the U.S. industry, in part because Kirby attributed the drop to factors largely out of airlines' control.He said demand has taken a hit as the strong U.S. dollar lowers foreign travelers' spending power and as economies such as Brazil have weakened.

225,"   By Richard Cowan and Jeffrey Dastin | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The U.S. Transportation Department is investigating possible price gouging by the five biggest U.S. airlines while train service was disabled between New York and Washington following a deadly Amtrak crash in May, it said on Friday.The regulator sent letters on Friday asking each carrier to detail average fares along the route before, during and after the crash. It demanded an explanation for price increases, if any, and asked the airlines whether they communicated with each other about those fares, which might signal collusion.The review involves Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), all of which said they were cooperating with the probe.American and United added they were confident that no wrongdoing would be found, while Delta said it did not increase prices but instead lowered some of its highest fares by nearly 50 percent following the crash.""These airlines have allegedly raised fees beyond what you would ordinarily expect in the Northeast Corridor at a time when the Amtrak line was shut down,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters on Friday. The probe comes at a difficult time for U.S. airlines, already the subject of a Justice Department investigation into whether they worked together illegally to keep fares high by signaling plans to limit flights. Consumers are also showing signs of dissatisfaction after carriers recently squeezed more seats onto planes and added new ancillary fees, increasing the cost of air travel.The new probe will have to account for ticket prices being a computer-automated response to demand, industry consultant Robert Mann said. Reservation systems displayed high fares simply because all the cheaper ones had been purchased. ""You had a runaway bookings situation because of the unfortunate incident,"" Mann said.Delta and American said they added seats to accommodate more passengers, and Delta allowed previously ticketed Amtrak customers fly for free. Eight people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia. Amtrak traffic between Washington and New York City was shut down for six days as a result.Foxx said the investigation comes after Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy contacted the Obama administration with concerns over consumer protection.The Transportation Department has authority to stop any illegal practice by the airlines, according to Foxx, although it was not immediately clear what punishment could result from the investigation.

261,"   By Hugh Bronstein | BUENOS AIRES  BUENOS AIRES American Airlines (AAL.O) has stopped accepting Argentine pesos to pay for tickets due to currency controls that make it hard to convert receipts into U.S. dollars, the carrier said on Wednesday. Foreign businesses operating in Argentina have long complained that they cannot send their profits home due to protectionist controls enacted by President Cristina Fernandez, who will step down on Dec. 10 after two terms in office. ""We have not reduced our flights, although we currently do not have inventory available for purchase in Argentine pesos due to repatriation issues,"" American Airlines said in a statement.  The business-friendly mayor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, won Sunday's presidential election against a candidate from Fernandez's party. Macri vows to ditch Fernandez's currency and trade controls as part of his push toward free markets.""We look forward to working with the central bank and the new government on this matter,"" American Airlines said in a  statement. The airline operates 27 flights per week from Buenos Aires to the United States, increasing to 35 weekly in high season.The situation mirrors the one in Venezuela, where airlines have about $3.7 billion in ticket sales trapped because of the socialist nation's 12-year-old currency control system, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in June.""There is a risk that Argentina is headed down the same path as Venezuela. Both countries top a list of misguided policies and decisions that we are engaging governments across the region to reverse,"" Tony Tyler, IATA's chief executive officer, said in a speech in Puerto Rico this month. IATA, the trade association for about 260 airlines around the world, would like to talk about policy changes with Macri.""We are seeking to meet the new government as soon as it is in office to find a solution that will preserve connectivity and the vital economic benefits it brings,"" Tyler said.Alfonso Prat-Gay, a former foreign exchange chief at JPMorgan (JPM.N), is to be Macri's finance minister. Argentina's official peso ARS=RASL was at 9.675 per dollar on Wednesday, 57.3 percent stronger than the black market rate at which many local transactions are made.Under Fernandez, the central bank intervenes to keep the official rate strong. Macri says he will allow the two rates to converge.American Airlines Group Inc shares dipped 3 cents to $41.20.

273,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK While airlines are in no rush to pass on fuel savings to passengers brought by the collapse in oil prices, the Houston travel market has left them little choice.Airlines serving the U.S. oil capital have resorted to steep discounts to lure newly budget-conscious energy executives back into the air, according to an analysis of ticket prices provided exclusively to Reuters.Crude's 70-percent drop in the past 19 months has made the Houston travel market a rare point of downward pressure on airline revenues. Its value, including flights, conventions and related services, was estimated at $2.8 billion in 2014 in a report for the Texas governor's office.The ticket data offers more detail than carriers have disclosed about the challenges they face at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the ninth busiest globally by take-offs and landings, according to Airports Council International's 2014 ranking.On average, round-trip business and first class tickets to London sold in September 2015 were 14 percent cheaper than a year earlier, at about $4,600, according to the latest figures from fare clearinghouse Airlines Reporting Corporation.Tickets to Calgary, a gateway to northwestern Canada's vast oil fields, plummeted 59 percent to $1,020.And prices for tickets to top drilling gateways Lagos, Dubai and Scotland's Aberdeen fell 22 percent, 23 percent and 31 percent, respectively.     ""It's a combination of fewer people traveling and not as many people flying business class,"" said Gary Pearce, chief commercial officer for travel management company ATPI's energy and shipping unit.""Companies are re-negotiating terms with anybody that provides a service to them,"" he added, such as asking airlines to sell lower fares or waive clauses on minimum bookings.Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips and BP PLC, which has its U.S. headquarters in Houston, declined to comment for this story.  BIGGEST LOSER The oil slide has largely helped U.S. airlines, reducing one of their biggest expenses and adding hundreds of millions of dollars to their bottom lines.However, they have forfeited a large chunk of the gain because of fuel hedges they bought as protection against crude rising. Houston's example is another reminder that cheap oil cuts more than one way.United Continental Holdings Inc said last week that it doubled its adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $934 million from a year ago. But slack business in Houston will reduce its passenger revenue as a portion of flight capacity by 1 percent in the first quarter, the airline said. Chicago-based United is the most affected because it schedules more than 80 percent of Bush Intercontinental's flights. About 10 percent of United's flight capacity originated from Houston according to this week's schedules, aviation data and analytics company OAG said.Other airlines adjusting to the oil slump include Delta Air Lines Inc, which recently stopped flights from its Minneapolis hub to Dickinson, North Dakota, near the Bakken shale oil formation.Alaska Air Group Inc reported on an investor call last week that its energy-related sales were ""fairly stable"" because roughly the same number of workers needed to fly to oil-rich Prudhoe Bay to operate drills and pipelines there, despite lower production.Airlines Reporting Corporation, owned by a group of North American airlines, declined to provide data on Prudhoe Bay flights and other routes that were dominated by a single carrier and therefore market sensitive.  LEISURE FARES DOWN Cheap oil has not only lowered corporate travel spending. Greater Houston's 6.5 million residents are cutting back on leisure trips, too.The average low leisure fare is down 25 percent from Houston while only down 20 percent overall in the United States, according to a mid-January analysis of the top domestic routes by Harrell Associates, shared with Reuters.Fares have fallen nationwide, not just in Houston, because lower fuel costs have let the largest airlines chop their fares in stiff competition with budget rivals like Spirit Airlines IncStill, the lowest refundable last-minute fares from Houston are down 11 percent, but up 5 percent nationwide, Harrell Associates data showed.United said last week it is scrapping plans to grow its Houston operation by 2 percent in 2016 and keeping capacity steady instead.The airline declined additional comment for this story but noted that in January 2015 it shrunk its Houston-Calgary operation to three flights per day from four.The airline's loss could be a gain for budget rival Southwest Airlines Co, which in October started its first international flights to Latin America from nearby Houston Hobby Airport. (Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Joseph White and Tomasz Janowski)",2016-01-28,AAL,"Thu Jan 28, 2016 | 4:13am EST","In U.S. oil capital Houston, no cheap fuel bonanza for airlines",http://www.reuters.com//article/ual-houston-idUSL2N15A1NC?type=companyNews
274,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK American Airlines' (AAL.O) president on Friday said it is too early to tell if the rapidly spreading Zika virus will impact travel, but so far the airline has seen no material change to flight bookings. American Airlines Group Inc, the world's largest airline, and other U.S. carriers are facing mounting concern about the mosquito-borne virus as investors mull a slump in demand to the Caribbean and other tourist hotspots.""Zika is not airborne, so there is not a danger of it being transmitted between passengers,"" American's President Scott Kirby said on a call with investors Friday. ""As a result, you wouldn't expect it to have as big an impact as something like SARS.""Zika, linked to birth defects in thousands of babies in Brazil, could nonetheless become a challenge for American. Kirby said flight sales to Brazil on the airline, which has the widest Latin American network among U.S. peers, had fallen to about 2.0 percent of its revenue from 6.1 percent in roughly the past two years. While airlines have yet to report a bookings drop because of Zika, a warning from the World Health Organization that four million people in the Americas could get the virus has exacerbated jitters for the travel industry, hurt by outbreaks of SARS and Ebola in years past.""People incrementally are starting to pay a little more attention to Zika than they were before,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel. ""(They) freak out when it comes to airlines.""New York-traded airline stocks .XAL dropped 3.1 percent Thursday, which analysts attributed to Zika fears and an uptick in oil prices, before rebounding 1.4 percent in Friday afternoon trade. American saw the sector's biggest stock decline Friday with shares falling more than 1.0 percent. It forecast a passenger unit revenue decline in the first quarter between 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, not accounting for any potential Zika impact.On Thursday, shares of another top U.S. airline in the Caribbean, JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), tumbled more than 6.0 percent even though it reported no measurable impact from the virus.

275,"  (Adds executive quote)By Jeffrey DastinNEW YORK Jan 29 American Airlines'  president on Friday said it is too early to tell if the rapidly spreading Zika virus will impact travel, but so far the airline has seen no material change to flight bookings.American Airlines Group Inc, the world's largest airline, and other U.S. carriers are facing mounting concern about the mosquito-borne virus as investors mull a slump in demand to the Caribbean and other tourist hotspots.""Zika is not airborne, so there is not a danger of it being transmitted between passengers,"" American's President Scott Kirby said on a call with investors Friday. ""As a result, you wouldn't expect it to have as big an impact as something like SARS."" Zika, linked to birth defects in thousands of babies in Brazil, could nonetheless become a challenge for American. Kirby said flight sales to Brazil on the airline, which has the widest Latin American network among U.S. peers, had fallen to about 2.0 percent of its revenue from 6.1 percent in roughly the past two years.While airlines have yet to report a bookings drop because of Zika, a warning from the World Health Organization that four million people in the Americas could get the virus has exacerbated jitters for the travel industry, hurt by outbreaks of SARS and Ebola in years past. ""People incrementally are starting to pay a little more attention to Zika than they were before,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel. ""(They) freak out when it comes to airlines.""New York-traded airline stocks dropped 3.1 percent Thursday, which analysts attributed to Zika fears and an uptick in oil prices, before rebounding 1.4 percent in Friday afternoon trade. American saw the sector's biggest stock decline Friday with shares falling more than 1.0 percent. It forecast a passenger unit revenue decline in the first quarter between 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, not accounting for any potential Zika impact.On Thursday, shares of another top U.S. airline in the Caribbean, JetBlue Airways Corp, tumbled more than 6.0 percent even though it reported no measurable impact from the virus.""Short-term especially, these stocks will react,"" Hackel said, recalling the sharp, if short-lived selloff in October 2014, when highly contagious Ebola was reported in the United States.American is offering pregnant customers, who appear most vulnerable to the virus, and their companions refunds for tickets to Zika-impacted regions.

295,"  (The Sports Xchange) - The Oklahoma City Thunder are a step away from the Western Conference semi-finals.They showcased their superior talent and athleticism once again, leading wire-to-wire in a 119-108 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday at the American Airlines Center.Oklahoma City has not trailed since its Game 2 loss and it now enjoys a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Thunder has a chance to close it out in Game 5 on Monday at home.Dallas faces long odds to overcome the series deficit, as only nine teams in NBA history have come back to win a best-of-seven playoff series after trailing 3-1.The Thunder were in control of Game 4 all night, never getting truly threatened by the Mavericks. Dallas had brief spurts to stay within striking distance, pulling within single-digits multiple times in the second half, but Oklahoma City always answered and had a multi-possession lead in the final minutes.Enes Kanter led the charge for the Thunder with 28 points. Russell Westbrook had 25 points and 15 assists, and Kevin Durant finished with 19 points on seven-for-20 shooting. Durant was ejected from the game with less than a minute left after the officials called him for a ""Flagrant two."" Durant had been trying to block a shot by Mavs guard Justin Anderson, but swiped across the rookie's head instead of the ball.The ejection came on the heels of Dallas coach Rick Carlisle complaining about Durant and the Thunder for ""nonbasketball physical escalations"" in Game 3.For the Mavs, Dirk Nowitzki led the team with 27 points on 12-for-21 shooting. Raymond Felton and Wesley Matthews each scored 19 points. Dallas had an early blow when Deron Williams (sports hernia) returned to the starting lineup, but lasted only 89 seconds before re-aggravating his injury.But the Mavs didn't go away quietly and showed fight.The most telling moment early on came at the 11:31 mark in the second quarter. Thunder guard Randy Foye threw the ball away and into the hands of reserve Anthony Morrow on the bench. Mavs center Salah Mejri went to retrieve the ball from Morrow, who played a game of keep-away with Mejri before tossing it toward an official. That didn't sit well with Mejri or guard J.J. Barea, and a light scuffle and words were exchanged between the two teams.Officials spent about six minutes reviewing the incident and decided to slap the Thunder bench with a delay of game penalty, and issued technical fouls to Mejri and Westbrook.Mejri had a solid night for the Mavs, but it was cut short when he exited in the fourth quarter with a right hip injury.

""This was done at my request, because it didn't seem right to me that I should be the only person at American with an employment contract,"" Parker said in a letter to employees.""The contract protected me against a number of things that I don't think I should be protected against – such as if I get fired or if unhappy shareholders gain control of the American board,"" he added. Parker's compensation structure was changed in May last year.

301,"  Faksa helps Stars take Game 1 vs. BluesDALLAS -- Radek Faksa definitely likes Game 1 of a playoff series. For the second consecutive series, the Dallas rookie scored the game-winning goal to open the series as the Stars defeated the St. Louis Blues 2-1 in in the second-round series on Friday at American Airlines Center.Faksa scored the eventual winner with 4:44 remaining in regulation when he tapped in a rebound after Blues goaltender Brian Elliott denied the initial shot by Ales Hemsky.""I had the speed wide, and (Faksa) made a great play to me,"" Hemsky said. ""Unfortunately it didn't work out, but (Faksa) had the rebound.""Faksa also scored in Game 1 of the first-round series against Minnesota, also delivering the game-winner in a 4-0 win to open that series on April 14.""I'm very excited after every goal, maybe too excited,"" Faksa said. ""It's just part of the game, enjoying every game in the NHL. Just a big excitement for me. It just feels great.""Kari Lehtonen stopped 31 of 32 shots and Antoine Roussel also scored for Dallas. Game 2 is Sunday afternoon in Dallas.""Yeah, I thought we played a good game,"" Stars coach Lindy Ruff said. ""Our energy was good. I thought our energy got better as the game went on. I thought we skated well, I thought we defended well. I thought we were physical. It's a good start to the series for us."" Kevin Shattenkirk scored for the Blues.""They outplayed us,"" Blues captain David Backes said. ""They deserved to win this one.""The best chance of the opening period came with 4:19 remaining when Robby Fabbri and Troy Brouwer had a 2-on-1.

Janmark was attempting to score his first playoff goal, but Elliott denied him a second time in the game with a glove save.Dallas lost veteran winger Patrick Eaves to a lower-body injury early in the third period. Eaves was struck with a shot by Stephen Johns from the right point and left the ice slowly. Eaves immediately adjourned to the Dallas dressing room for treatment.""He didn't finish the game and we'll probably find out more tomorrow,"" Ruff said of Eaves.St. Louis tied it with 8:28 remaining when Shattenkirk scored on a one-timer from the left point that beat Lehtonen far post after receiving a pass from Colton Parayko.""As crazy as Game 1 is, you'd like to steal it on the road,"" Shattenkirk said.

311,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Airlines' efforts to help the U.S. government manage long airport security lines are not sustainable, the chief executive of American Airlines Group Inc said in an interview.American, Delta Air Lines Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc have each added $4 million to what they typically spend on workers who stock bins at checkpoints and take care of tasks other than screening, which is handled by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA).This, however, is not a solution to waits that have caused more than 70,000 of American's customers to miss flights this year, CEO Doug Parker said Wednesday in New York.The TSA must add enough staff to handle checkpoints on its own during peak travel times, he said. Recently, the agency has relied on airlines to handle some of its non-screening work.The remarks underscore airlines' concern that fewer people will book flights if lengthy airport waits continue.""I checked into Dallas-Fort Worth on the way out here, and we have - it appeared - at least as many American Airlines employees standing out in front of security helping move the lines as there are TSA agents,"" he said. ""That's neither right nor sustainable."" Parker said a staffing shortage at the TSA, not fuller planes, has caused the crisis.A spokesman for TSA declined to comment.The TSA had aimed for 25 million people to sign up for a pre-vetting service such as ""PreCheck"" that moves travelers through checkpoints three times as fast, and it cut agents accordingly. But only about 10 million travelers have enrolled, and screening lapses prompted the TSA to reduce its practice of pulling regular fliers into those fast lanes. This year, the TSA projects it will screen 15 percent more people than in 2013, with 12 percent fewer agents. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1sMaHZu)Parker said the TSA has been responsive, reallocating funds to hire 768 more agents, though more are needed.One benefit that may come of the crisis is new technology at airports, he said. The TSA worked with Delta and Atlanta Airport to open two lanes that automate the distribution of bins at a checkpoint, a practice in place in Europe. Peter Neffenger, the head of TSA, said the lanes were about 30 percent more efficient.Parker said the lanes let travelers go around those held up in security: ""We’re all waiting for this one person who... left their cell phone in their pocket, and that doesn't happen anymore.""American, the world's largest airline, is working with major airports to roll out the automated lanes, Parker said. He declined to specify which ones.

322,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Four U.S. carriers have won tentative approval to launch daytime U.S. flights to Tokyo's Haneda airport as early as this fall, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Wednesday.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines Group Inc, Hawaiian Holdings Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc would gain the rights for flights that depart or land in the day at Haneda, which is closer to Tokyo than Narita International Airport, the department said in a statement. U.S. business travelers and tourists prefer to be at airports in the day.Prior to a U.S.-Japan agreement in February, U.S. carriers could only leave and land in Haneda at late hours in the night.Approvals were given to Delta for flights from Los Angeles and Minneapolis, Hawaiian from Honolulu, American from Los Angeles, and United from San Francisco. Except for Minneapolis, the cities already had night-time flights to Haneda.A final decision will be issued after a public comment period, the department said. Service must begin within 90 days after the decision. The Transportation Department said in a written order that if Delta scaled back its Minneapolis flight plans, the government would cancel the authority and give the flight to American in Dallas.Other airlines have questioned if there was enough traffic to support a Minneapolis route. The department rejected requests for Haneda flights from Dallas by American Airlines, Newark by United and Delta from Atlanta.American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said in an email that the carrier was disappointed that the Dallas flight was not approved and it was considering all options. The airline could file objections to the decision before it is final.In 2010, the Transportation Department selected Delta's Detroit-Haneda service proposal for night-time service, but after less than two years in operation it was canceled in 2012 and moved to Seattle. Delta discontinued the Seattle flight in 2015, saying it was not commercially feasible.  (Reporting by David Shepardson.

335,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) has hired the No. 2 executive at rival American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Scott Kirby, to be its president, the companies said on Monday.The move, effective immediately, is the latest attempt by United's reshuffled board and new Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz to shape a new strategy and boost the airline's stock price. United has lagged other U.S. carriers in on-time arrivals and profit margins, though its results have recently improved.United's shares rose more than 1 percent in after-market trading. American's fell nearly 2 percent.In a letter to employees, Munoz called Kirby's hiring the ""culmination"" of his forming a new leadership team.""This move will allow me to sharpen my own focus as CEO on the core mission of driving United's overall strategy, business innovation and financial performance,"" he said.Industry experts welcomed United's move.  ""United has lacked intellectual rigor,"" said consultant Robert Mann. ""Scott going over there will absolutely shake up the place.""Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said United ""got themselves a star player.""  Earlier this month, United appointed a new chief financial officer and new chief commercial officer, each with airline industry expertise. The company came under pressure from activist investors in the spring to name airline veterans to its board who could guide Munoz, a former railroad executive who took the helm of United in September 2015. At American, Chief Operating Officer Robert Isom will replace Kirby as president, the airline said in a news release.The management change stemmed from succession planning and the conclusion that ""it would not be able to retain its existing executive team in their current roles,"" after ""conversations regarding career expectations,"" the airline said.A filing by American showed the airline agreed to pay Kirby a cash severance of $3.85 million and to accelerate the vesting of his stock. The timeline that led to Kirby's move was not immediately clear.A United spokeswoman said the appointment followed several conversations between Kirby and Munoz, 57.Industry watchers said a chance to become CEO of United may have attracted Kirby, 49, to the role. At American, board director John Cahill said in a statement on Monday he looked forward to the ""leadership for many years to come"" of CEO Doug Parker, 54. Reporting to Kirby at United will be Chief Commercial Officer Julia Haywood and Chief Operations Officer Greg Hart.

343,"  EditorsNote: changes to ""Thurdsay"" in first noteCracknell, Niemi lift Stars past Ducks in openerDALLAS -- The Stars' potent offensive tandem of Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin accounted for only one point, but Adam Cracknell and Antti Niemi stepped up in Dallas' 4-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Thursday in the season opener at American Airlines Center.Cracknell had a goal and an assist, and Niemi stopped 33 of 35 shots.Signed this summer to provide depth, Cracknell assisted on the game-winning goal by Antoine Roussel early in the third period. Cracknell, who started the game on the fourth line before moving up to the third line, where he picked up both of his points, delivered an insurance tally later in the frame.""I thought he did a lot of good things,"" Stars coach Lindy Ruff said of Cracknell. ""Obviously, the goal and the assist were great. I thought he got himself in the right spot a lot of times. With the absence of some of our players, he really did a nice job for us tonight.""Lauri Korpikoski scored a goal and Dan Hamhuis added an assist in their Stars debuts.Stephen Johns also scored in the first period for Dallas, which had only one shot in the opening 20 minutes. Andrew Cogliano scored both goals for Anaheim, his ninth career multi-goal game.""I think we were in the game,"" Cogliano said. ""We minimized and did a good job against their better players. We gave them a couple goals, easier goals in terms of being in front of net, and we weren't getting those.""Dallas scored first when Johns tapped in a Patrick Eaves pass 3:40 into the game. Eaves beautifully threaded a cross-ice pass from the left side through the Anaheim crease, and Johns got his stick inside of Cam Fowler's right skate to poke the puck past goaltender John Gibson.Anaheim tied it with 5:51 remaining in the first when Cogliano collected his own rebound to score a short-handed goal. The Ducks had four power plays in the first period, two coming on a double minor on Jordie Benn for high-sticking, but were 0-for-4 with the man advantage and finished 0-for-5.""You can't give up three goals from the top of your crease,"" Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said. ""We didn't have coverage, and they scored three goals from in tight.""Dallas regained the lead 2:43 into the second period when Korpikoski, who was signed on Monday, scored on a one-timer from the edge of the left circle after Devin Shore fed him a backhand pass from the slot.Korpikoski then flicked a quick wrist shot into the back of the net, beating Gibson far post. The Stars had two great chances to put some distance between themselves and the Ducks later in the second period, but a Jason Spezza one-timer from the left circle found the left goalpost with 6:03 remaining and Gibson denied Seguin at close range less than a minute before second intermission.Cogliano briefly tied the game at 2-2 with his second of the game 1:01 into the third period, beating Niemi on a one-timer from the slot after a Jiri Hudler turnover inside the Dallas zone.The Stars quickly answered when Roussel knocked in Cracknell's backhand pass 22 seconds later. Cracknell's pass traveled through the crease, and despite not striking the puck cleanly, Roussel still was able to score.""I think it's just trying to get that momentum back (after they score),"" Cracknell said of his assist. ""That's our role. (Roussel) made a good yell, I knew he was back door, and I just whacked it over there. He's a guy who is going to work hard for that puck.""Cracknell then made it a two-goal game with 10:23 remaining when he tapped in a Radek Faksa pass.Gibson stopped 16 of 20 shots.NOTES: The Ducks scratched RW Emerson Etem, D Korbinian Holzer and D Clayton Stoner.

344,"   By Alana Wise and Rachit Vats  American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) shares dipped on Thursday after the carrier said cheap airfares and higher wages will squeeze profits in the current quarter.American, the world's largest airline, said it expects its adjusted pretax margin to fall in the fourth quarter. Late on Thursday afternoon, the airline's shares were down 0.5 percent at $40.59, after falling as much as 3 percent. The company reported that net income fell by more than half in the third quarter from a year ago to $737 million, or $1.40 per share, partly as the result of $452 million provision for income taxes. The company nonetheless beat analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said the airline's 4 percent to 6 percent margin, excluding items, would put the company at the bottom of the industry. Fort Worth, Texas-based American said a weaker British pound has dampened sales to British travelers in dollar terms.At the same time, budget carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) are fighting larger airlines for a fixed number of travelers to Europe - charging less per ticket and hurting American's revenue.American forecast that unit revenue, which compares sales to how many seats the airline flies and how far it flies them, will decline between 1 percent and 3 percent in the fourth quarter from the year prior. New labor contracts are increasing costs as well. Deals with the airline's reservation agents, dispatchers and mechanics will help push unit costs up between 8 percent and 10 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, excluding fuel and other charges. Not included are costs associated with flights contracted out to regional airlines.American pointed to some bright spots. Revenue from Latin America had improved and company officials said they expect that to continue. Through 2017, the group said it will be able to eliminate a number of redundant positions resulted from its 2013 merger with US Airways, through attrition by early retirement and buyouts, rather than layoffs.

Late on Thursday afternoon, the airline's shares were down 0.5 percent at $40.59, after falling as much as 3 percent. The company reported that net income fell by more than half in the third quarter from a year ago to $737 million, or $1.40 per share, partly as the result of $452 million provision for income taxes. The company nonetheless beat analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said the airline's 4 percent to 6 percent margin, excluding items, would put the company at the bottom of the industry. Fort Worth, Texas-based American said a weaker British pound has dampened sales to British travelers in dollar terms.At the same time, budget carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) are fighting larger airlines for a fixed number of travelers to Europe - charging less per ticket and hurting American's revenue.American forecast that unit revenue, which compares sales to how many seats the airline flies and how far it flies them, will decline between 1 percent and 3 percent in the fourth quarter from the year prior. New labor contracts are increasing costs as well. Deals with the airline's reservation agents, dispatchers and mechanics will help push unit costs up between 8 percent and 10 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, excluding fuel and other charges. Not included are costs associated with flights contracted out to regional airlines.American pointed to some bright spots. Revenue from Latin America had improved and company officials said they expect that to continue. Through 2017, the group said it will be able to eliminate a number of redundant positions resulted from its 2013 merger with US Airways, through attrition by early retirement and buyouts, rather than layoffs.

348,"  Martinez scores in OT as Kings top Stars for 1st winDALLAS -- After an 0-3 start, the Los Angeles Kings hit the ice at American Airlines Center Thursday night with a sense of urgency. And thanks to Alec Martinez scoring the game-winner 1:20 into overtime, the Kings left town with a 4-3 victory against the Dallas Stars.Martinez ended the game with a wrist shot from the slot, which landed just inside the near post. After a brief review to determine whether Tanner Pearson had interfered with Stars goaltender Kari Lehtonen, who stopped 35 of 39 shots in a losing effort, the goal was deemed valid.""It was just a breakout,"" Martinez said of his game-winner. ""Those other two guys (Pearson and Toffoli) worked it up the ice. (Toffoli) made a really good play to me in the slot. I believe (Pearson) was in front with a good screen. I was really just a beneficiary of all that.""However, one person Martinez's clinching goal didn't agree with was Stars coach Lindy Ruff.""I think it's a terrible call at the end of the game. I thought our goaltender was interfered with, I thought he was elbowed in the head before the puck went in the net,"" Ruff said. ""(It's) terrible. Somebody is going to have to explain to me why that goal counts. I want an explanation.""Jeff Carter and Pearson each had a goal and an assist for the Kings (1-3-0), who also got a goal from Nic Dowd. Petr Budaj stopped 17 of 20 shots. Jason Spezza had a goal and an assist and Tyler Seguin two assists for Dallas (2-1-1), which also got goals from Jamie Benn and Radek Faksa. Spezza forced overtime with 2:07 remaining in regulation with wrist shot from the left circle which beat Budaj top shelf on his short side. Dallas had an extra attacker after Lehtonen left the ice with 2:40 remaining.The Stars lost two forwards to injury in the game -- Patrick Eaves and Patrick Sharp -- both in the second period. Eaves sustained a lower-body injury late in the middle frame and did not return for the third period.Sharp was experiencing concussion-like symptoms after the Kings Brayden McNabb sent him head-first into the boards 3:34 into the second period. Sharp did not return to the ice after going through the NHL's concussion protocol. ""Sharp, he'll be out,"" Ruff said. ""I don't know what the timeframe is. Eaves will be evaluated (Friday) morning. He took a shot, and couldn't finish the game either.""Los Angeles struck first when Dowd scored with the Kings on the power play 8:18 into the game. After Tom Gilbert fed him the puck, Dowd maneuvered out of the edge of the left circle, drawing out Lehtonen and Dowd finished with a wrist shot from the slot inside the near post.And even though his Kings found the win column for the first time this season, Los Angeles coach Darryl Sutter didn't see much different in this game, other than the outcome. ""That's pretty much the way we played for other than one period this season except (tonight) we got a break to win,"" Sutter said.Dallas tied it with 8:20 remaining in the first period when Faksa beat Budaj with a wrist shot from the right circle. Budaj was attempting to clear the puck from the Kings zone when it deflected off Spezza, who then fed Faksa for the equalizer.Los Angeles regained its lead when Carter scored on a wrist shot from the high slot 1:24 into the second period. Carter's precision strike beat Lehtonen far post, sailing in over his glove and making it 2-1.The Stars got even five minutes into the middle frame when Benn converted with Dallas on the power play. Benn beat Budaj top shelf on his short side with a wrist shot from the left circle which sailed under the crossbar before hitting the top right corner of the Kings net.Los Angeles took a 3-2 lead into the second intermission after Pearson scored with 26.7 seconds remaining in the second. Lehtonen denied Pearson's initial attempt with a pad save, but Pearson slipped the puck inside the near post to make it 3-2.NOTES: The Kings scratched D Matt Greene, C Jordan Nolan and RW Teddy Purcell. ... The Stars scratched D Jordie Benn, RW Jiri Hudler (flu) and D Patrik Nemeth. ... Kings G Petr Budaj made his first start of the season. The start, the 267th of Budaj's career, was his first since Feb. 12, 2016 at the New York Rangers. ... Stars G Kari Lehtonen was making his second start of the season. ...

351,"  (Corrects paragraph 9 to say fire started on right side, not left)By Timothy MclaughlinCHICAGO Oct 28 The engine of an American Airlines jet caught fire as the aircraft was about to depart Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday, prompting the crew to abort takeoff and evacuate passengers via emergency chutes, authorities said.No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred just hours before a similar, unrelated mishap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the landing gear of a FedEx  cargo plane collapsed, sparking a fire that was quickly extinguished.The company later said the FedEx pilots were safe.American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down an O'Hare runway at about 2:30 p.m. CDT (1930 GMT) when the right-side engine of the twin-engine jet burst into flames, authorities said.Footage from Chicago's ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed the idled plane on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from its right side and  emergency slides deployed on the left side. Passengers milled about watching the blaze as fire trucks pumped water on the flames. Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner for airport operations, said the mishap could have been much worse.The plane was fully loaded with 43,000 pounds (19,504 kg) of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Sampey told a news conference later.""So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing,"" he said. ""This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later.""Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. The Federal Aviation Administration initially said the pilot aborted takeoff after reporting a blown-out tire.The airline said seven passengers and one flight attendant were taken to a hospital for evaluation of minor injuries.Inside the aircraft after it came to a stop, frantic passengers shouted at each other to hurry while making their way down the aisle to an emergency exit slide, as seen in a video  posted on Facebook by Hector Gustavo Cardenas, who was on the plane. The incident forced the closure of at least three of the airport's eight runways, the city Aviation Department said.By about two hours after the incident, the airport had experienced 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.comAs the mishap unfolded, tower controllers at O'Hare began ordering inbound aircraft to abort their landing approaches and ""go around,"" initially closing all runways so emergency vehicles could reach the stricken aircraft, according to audio recordings of the main tower frequency posted by the website liveatc.net.Asked by the pilot of one inbound plane to explain the maneuver, a tower controller is heard on the recordings saying: ""Vehicles have rights to all the runways right now because an American engine burst into flame on the rollout.""Operations later resumed on the north side of O'Hare airport, one of the world's busiest, according to web tracking sites and a live feed of tower conversations from liveatc.net.(Reporting by Timothy McLaughlin in Chicago; Additional reporting by Rory Carroll in San Francisco; Jeffrey Dastin in New York and Tim Hepher in Hong Kong; Writing and additional reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by James Dalgleish and Tom Brown)",2016-10-29,AAL,"Fri Oct 28, 2016 | 9:20pm EDT",CORRECTED-UPDATE 5-American Airlines jet catches fire on takeoff at Chicago airport,http://www.reuters.com//article/chicago-airplane-idUSL1N1CY21D?type=companyNews

354,"   By David Shepardson and Alwyn Scott | WASHINGTON/SEATTLE  WASHINGTON/SEATTLE A fire on an American Airlines passenger plane as it was taking off from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport last week was sparked when the right engine broke apart, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Friday.    The investigative update shed new light on a rare ""uncontained"" engine failure, in which pieces escaped the engine housing, that has been the talk of aviation circles since the incident on Oct. 28.Pilots applied brakes to the Boeing 767-300 jetliner bound for Miami and aborted the takeoff of Flight 383. The engine failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire under the right wing. The incident led to emergency evacuation of 161 passengers and nine crew, but no serious injuries.The plane, built in 2003, experienced the failure about 6,550 feet (2,000 meters) after beginning its take-off and came to a full stop at 9,225 feet (2,800 meters), about 27 seconds after the engine failure, the NTSB said in an interim report.Investigators looking for what caused the General Electric CF6-80 engine to fail are focusing on a high pressure turbine disk that broke apart. One piece hit a UPS warehouse facility, about 3,000 feet (900 meters) from the runway, after slicing through a portion of the wing and traveling over the fuselage. The majority of the disk was recovered, and during laboratory inspection showed features consistent with fatigue cracking, the NTSB said. The disk had gone through 10,984 cycles, or take-offs and landings, and had a life limit of 15,000 cycles. Review of the engine maintenance and manufacturing records and processes was continuing, the NTSB said, adding that additional examinations of the disk would focus on the cracking.GE said the engine was manufactured in 1998. The failed disk was made of Inconel 718, an alloy used in aviation for decades, GE said. The CF6 engine is used on current Boeing 767 freighters and the KC-46 tanker used to refuel military planes in flight. Uncontained aircraft engine failures are rare. GE said it had not suffered an engine failure caused by a problem with the Inconel 718 disk in more than 30 years. The CF6-80C2 has been in service for more than 30 years and has an in-flight shutdown rate of 0.004 percent over 400 million hours of flight.The rotating disk ""operates in one of the most harsh environments of a jet engine, especially at aircraft take-off,"" GE said in a statement.  American Airlines declined to comment.The fire prompted 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights within two hours, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.

360,"   By Alberto Alerigi | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Brazil's competition regulator Cade said on Monday that a deal between LATAM Airlines LAN.SN, British Airways and Iberia (ICAG.L) could have a negative impact on routes between Brazil and Europe.Chile-headquartered LATAM signed joint business agreements in January to deepen its ties with American Airlines Group (AAL.O) and IAG's British Airways and Iberia, all members of the Oneworld Alliance.If cleared by competition authorities, the agreements would help the airlines coordinate schedules and prices for flights, similar to the North Atlantic revenue-sharing agreement which already exists between IAG and American Airlines.In a statement published in Brazil's Official Gazette, Cade's superintendency-general said it would appeal against the deal before the top decision-making tribunal of the competition watchdog.  ""The superintendency believes this concentration has the potential to generate competitive problems in the market for air transportation of passengers between Brazil and Europe, especially on the routes Sao Paulo-London and Sao Paulo-Madrid,"" Cade said in a statement on its Web site. It added that the companies already have 70 to 80 percent of the market between Sao Paulo and London, and 50 to 60 percent between Sao Paulo and Madrid. Cade said that new competitors were unlikely to enter these routes under such conditions and the existing level of competition was not sufficient to alleviate its concerns.The companies officially notified authorities of the deal on June 6, after which Cade has up to 330 days to take a decision. LATAM said in a statement that it would continue collaborating with authorities to demonstrate that the agreement would help improve connections for passengers across the region. It said it was confident it could prove to the Cade tribunal that the deal would provide benefits to passengers and the economy.

369,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has bought shares in the four biggest U.S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc.The investments mark an unexpected reversal for Berkshire, which has avoided the airline sector for nearly two decades after a troubled investment in the former US Air Group, a forerunner to American.They also expand Berkshire's bet on the U.S. economy, and in particular transportation. Berkshire already owns the BNSF railroad and the NetJets luxury plane unit, and in January paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts.According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire as of Sept. 30 owned 21.8 million American shares worth $797 million, 6.3 million Delta shares worth $249.3 million, and 4.5 million United shares worth $237.8 million.Buffett told CNBC television that Berkshire later invested in Southwest, and was disclosing that stake to avoid misleading investors into believing he was avoiding the carrier.It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in the airlines.Shares often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur.Buffett usually handles larger Berkshire investments such as Kraft Heinz Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp.His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as BNSF, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.The airline investments are ""really important for investor confidence"" in that sector, said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York. Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.In after-hours trading, American shares rose 3.8 percent, Delta 3.4 percent, Southwest 3.3 percent and United 2.2 percent.U.S. airlines have benefited in recent years from lower fuel costs, labor peace, higher fees from checked bags and other once-free services, and reduced competition through mergers.Such factors helped the four largest U.S. carriers post a record $21.7 billion combined profit in 2015, and command more than two-thirds of the domestic market. WRIGHT BROTHERS, WRONG INVESTMENT Berkshire had ventured into airlines in 1989 when Buffett bought $358 million of USAir preferred stock, but he quickly regretted that investment.In 1997, he told Berkshire shareholders he had misjudged how USAir would ""increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits.""Eleven years later, Buffett felt no better, calling airlines a capital-intensive business that earned little or no money.""A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,"" he wrote in his February 2008 shareholder letter. ""Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down."" Buffett nonetheless admitted to having sold the USAir stock, in 1998, at a ""hefty gain.""Orville Wright died in 1948, more than 44 years after he and his brother Wilbur flew their plane at Kitty Hawk, N.C.American and Delta said they welcomed Berkshire as an investor, and American said it ""reinforces our view that our industry has fundamentally changed in a profound and lasting way.""Southwest declined to comment. United had no immediate comment.Berkshire on Monday also disclosed other portfolio changes.It slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc by roughly two-thirds to 13 million shares. Berkshire had begun paring its stake in the world's largest retailer earlier this year, after more than a decade of ownership.Separately, Berkshire reduced its stake in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, and exited an investment in Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc.

374,"  Nov 28 American Airlines Group Inc and Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd have dropped their bid to coordinate prices and flight schedules, according to a filing submitted to the U.S. Transportation Department on Monday.The decision comes after the department tentatively denied the airlines' request earlier this month. Air travelers would have few remaining competitive options if the alliance were expanded, ""given the scale of the resulting joint business,"" the Transportation Department had said.The carriers submitted their application in June 2015, several months before American started flights between the United States and Australia. The partners had been marketing flights on routes that the other did not offer, and requested immunity from U.S. antitrust law in order to coordinate their operations going forward. The existing ""codeshare"" marketing arrangements remain in place, Qantas said in a statement. Explaining the reason for the application withdrawal, American said, ""When the Department of Transportation issued its (tentative ruling) it was clear it would take longer than the 14 days they gave us to respond, and the DOT refused to give us an extension to fully demonstrate the benefits of our position."" The airlines said they were disappointed with the U.S. decision. They maintained that their enhanced alliance would have benefited consumers and pointed to the approval for other airlines to coordinate prices on flights between the United States and Australia.The carriers will now consider their positions separately before determining their next move, Qantas said.

375,"   By Alana Wise | NEW YORK  NEW YORK American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) will cut nearly 25 percent of its flights to Cuba in 2017, a company spokesman said on Thursday, attributing the move to travel demand rather than the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president.Starting in mid-February, American, the world's largest airline, will offer one trip a day instead of two from Miami to Holguin, Santa Clara and Varadero, reducing its daily service to 10 round-trip flights from the current 13, spokesman Matt Miller said in a telephone interview.The airline also hopes to lower capacity on three of the seven routes it operates to Cuba. It plans to use a 128-seat aircraft between Miami and Holguin instead of a 160-seater, and hopes to contract out flights to Camaguey and Cienfuegos to a regional carrier that would use 76-seat aircraft, pending U.S. regulatory approval. The regional partner is Republic Airways Holdings Inc (RJETQ.PK). ""This was done purely to remain competitive in the market,” Miller said. ""We can't speculate on what the next administration may do."" Airlines are generally expected to perform poorly when entering a previously restricted market, but American's decision to prune its Cuban itinerary two months after starting service may come as a surprise in light of the industry's enthusiasm to fly to the Communist-run island. ""If American can't earn the profit that it requires from these routes, they're going to cut back on the flying. It's as simple as that,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group.  Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, threatened on Monday to end the recent rapprochement between the United States and its former Cold War foe unless Havana was willing to ""make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole."".The United States and Cuba began normalizing relations in December 2014 after 18 months of secret talks and have since restored full diplomatic ties.  They reached a memorandum of understanding that allowed U.S. airlines to start scheduled flights to Cuba this year after a half-century hiatus. President Barack Obama's administration has eased travel restrictions for U.S. citizens, although general tourism remains illegal. Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress oppose ending the decades-long trade embargo against Cuba.
