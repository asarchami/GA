0,"  Rafael Cabrera-Bello again made the most of his chance to impress playing partner and Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley by firing a seven-under-par 65 to move two shots clear after the second round at the Qatar Masters on Thursday.The Spaniard, who also led last week's Abu Dhabi Championship after two rounds before finishing fourth, hit eight birdies and covered the back nine in 31 to move to 13 under for the tournament.""I don't think 13 is an unlucky number for around this course,"" Cabrera-Bello, seeking a third European Tour victory, said on the European tour website (www,europeantour.com). ""I'm really happy, really pleased, and everything's going good - I'm enjoying myself.""I like playing in short sleeves a lot, I like a little bit of breeze, I like seeing palm trees, I like seeing sun around the courses. It does remind me a lot from the Canaries, and I start playing at the end of the year here, and I don't feel that I've left home, so that's why I enjoy it so much.""

1,"  Veteran Raymond Floyd will be a vice-captain on this year's American Ryder Cup team, U.S. captain Tom Watson said on Tuesday.Floyd, 71, won four majors, including two U.S. PGA Championships, during a decorated career.Eight-times major winner Watson had previously announced that twice U.S. Open champion Andy North would be a vice-captain.The Ryder Cup will be played at Gleneagles, Scotland from September 26-28.Europe are defending champions in the biennial event, which the U.S. have not won in Europe since 1993, when Watson previously was captain. Watson selected Floyd as a player back then.""What Raymond brings is experience and respect of the players,"" Watson said in making the announcement at Riviera Country Club, site of this week's Northern Trust Open.""When these players look at Raymond, they know he's been there, they know he's been successful.""You look at Raymond's eyes, you never saw his eyes waver... His eyes had a focus you like to see and the way he played the game, every shot counted, and that's the type of guy I wanted taking care of my back.Floyd played in eight Ryder Cup teams, compiling a 12-16-3 record, and he captained the 1989 side who tied with Europe. ""I'm flattered obviously and it's going to be a thrill for me to be back,"" Floyd said via telephone.Floyd said he had never met several likely players on the team, but he did not believe that was a problem.""Our responsibilities are to see that (the players) are comfortable (and) if there are any questions they have to be comfortable coming to us,"" he said.Floyd was an assistant on Paul Azinger's winning American team in 2008. There is no limit on how many assistants a captain has. Davis Love had four when he captained the American team two years ago and Watson said he might add another one.Either way, Watson does not think any inspirational speeches will be necessary, considering the U.S. surrendered a four-point point lead on the final day to lose two years ago.""The main motivation is the fact we lost the last one. We had a big lead and we lost it. If that's not enough motivation for the players of the 2014 Ryder Cup team, we're spinning our wheels,"" he said.""What a crushing defeat. What a pit that left in my stomach for several days afterwards."" Watson refuted suggestions that he and his assistants will be too old to relate to the players.""These players know that Raymond, Andy and myself have been there,"" he said. ""We know what Ryder Cup pressure is about.""The age difference is like a professor. You go to learn from a professor. You know he has the experience and the knowledge and that's what we bring as captain and vice-captains to the Ryder Cup.""The top nine players on a points list after the PGA Championship in August will automatically make the U.S. team and will later choose three others.Jimmy Walker, who has won three times this season, heads the current U.S. standings from Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson.Watson said he would lead a group of American players to Gleneagles after the British Open in July.(Reporting By Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, Editing by Ed Osmond)",2014-02-11,R,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 2:40pm EST",Floyd named U.S. Ryder Cup vice-captain,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-ryder-us-idUSBREA1A1RV20140211?type=companyNews
2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to rate Ryder System Inc.'s  (Ryder) 5 1/2-year, $350 million senior unsecured notes 'A-'. Fitch does not  believe there will be a material impact on Ryder's leverage as a result of the  issuance, as proceeds are expected to be used to refinance term debt outstanding  and for general corporate purposes. A full list of rating actions is at the end  of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The expected rating is equalized with the ratings assigned to Ryder's existing  senior unsecured debt as the new notes will rank equally in the capital  structure. The equalization of Ryder's unsecured debt with its long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company's 100% unsecured funding profile.  Ryder's ratings reflect its established market position in the truck leasing  business, its operating consistency, strong liquidity and funding profile,  relatively low leverage, and solid capitalization. Rating constraints include  the company's pension burden, cyclicality inherent in used vehicle pricing and  the commercial rental business, and the regulatory impact on business trends.  Ryder currently has a Stable Outlook, which reflects Fitch's expectation for  continued economical access to the capital markets through market cycles, strong  liquidity, solid capitalization, and earnings growth in 2014 driven by an  increase in full-service lease activity and organic growth in supply chain  solutions. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch believes positive rating action is likely limited over the medium  term, positive rating momentum could result from greater revenue diversification  and lower leverage.  Negative rating action could be driven by a decline in earnings and/or free cash  flow beyond Fitch's expectations which yields an increase in leverage beyond the  targeted range and/or indicates a weakened competitive position in the industry.  Additionally, deterioration in asset quality, an inability to realize residual  values on used vehicles, a material increase in non-earning vehicles, and/or a  decline in liquidity could result in negative rating action.  A material shift to secured funding could affect the notching between the  long-term IDR and the unsecured debt rating.  Established in 1933 and headquartered in Miami, Florida, Ryder is one of the  world's largest providers of highway transportation services. As of Dec. 31,  2013, the company had 161,100 vehicles in its full-service and commercial rental  fleet and generated $6.4 billion of revenue during 2013. Ryder's stock is listed  on the NYSE under the ticker 'R'. Fitch expects to assign the following rating:  Ryder System's Inc.:  --$350 million senior unsecured notes due 2019 'A-'. Fitch currently rates Ryder System's Inc. as follows: --Long-Term IDR 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial Paper rating 'F2';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

3,"  May 25 Ryder System Inc's shares could rise 30 percent in a year as the truck rental company continues to attract first-time leases and expands its out-sourced maintenance services, Barron's financial newspaper said in its latest issue.Ryder looks likely to grow its earnings at a double-digit clip over the next few years, while the S&P 500's earnings growth has recently slowed to near zero, the newspaper said. (on.barrons.com/1Rg0j3w)First-time leases are contributing about a third of the growth of leases overall, the company's biggest money maker, Barron's said. Wall Street expects Ryder's earnings to grow 17 percent this year, to $6.50 a share, and to top $8 in 2017, Barron's said. A rise to $125 per share in a year would put Ryder's shares at about 17 times forward earnings, where the S&P 500 trades now, the newspaper said. That is assuming that estimates stay put and Ryder, which has topped estimates in each quarter over the past three years, merely meets them, Barron's said.

9,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long- and Short-Term  Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) at 'A-'/ 'F2',  following the completion of its fleet leasing peer review. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT The ratings are supported by Ryder's established market position in the truck  leasing business, growing market share in the logistics and supply chain  solutions (SCS) business, good asset quality, relatively consistent operating  performance through various cycles, appropriate leverage, solid liquidity, and a  largely unsecured funding profile. Rating constraints specific to Ryder include the company's pension obligation,  which can have an impact on balance sheet leverage, and customer concentrations  in the SCS segment. Rating constraints applicable to the broader truck leasing  sector include cyclicality inherent in used vehicle pricing and the commercial  rental business and potential regulatory impact on business trends.  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation for continued economic access to  the capital markets through various market cycles, limited sensitivity to rising  interest rates, strong liquidity, appropriate leverage, and continued earnings  growth over the Outlook horizon, driven by growth in full-service lease and  contract maintenance revenue, as well as increased penetration in the supply  chain outsourcing business. Asset Quality Mean Reversion Expected Ryder's asset quality and equipment valuation metrics are strongly influenced by  the general condition of the domestic economy. Net accounts receivables  write-offs were 1.43% in 2015, and modestly higher than the five-year average of  1.06% and which Fitch believes remains relatively low. Mean reversion is  expected in the medium term, as Fitch views asset quality performance at current  historical lows as unsustainable. That said, write-offs are not expected to  approach peak levels experienced in 2009. The company reported average gains on the sale of trucks, tractors, and trailers  of 23.8% between 2011 and 2015. Gains on sales of equipment have been elevated  in recent years given strong demand by buyers to purchase pre-2010 engines.  Sales gains in the first-half of 2016 (1H16) declined 45.6% year-over-year,  reflecting lower used vehicle pricing, offset by higher sales volume. Fitch  expects gains on sale will continue to moderate in the medium- to longer-term  given normalization of used vehicle pricing from historical highs.  Relatively Consistent Operating Performance Ryder reported 6% operating revenue growth in 1H16, reflecting higher revenue  across all operating segments, partially offset by a negative impact from  foreign exchange. Pre-tax income decreased 6% to $205.5 million in 1H16, due to  lower commercial rental revenue and reduced gains on used vehicle sales,  partially offset by higher full-service lease results, lower insurance costs in  dedicated transportation solutions (DTS), and increased pricing, new business,  and increased volumes in DTS and SCS.  This translated into annualized pre-tax return on assets of 3.7%, which is  modestly below the five-year average of 4%. Fitch expects operating performance  to remain relatively consistent in 2H16, supported by growth in full-service  leasing, tight management of fleet inventories, and controlling costs amid a  weaker environment for rentals, and lower used vehicle prices. Fitch believes interest rate sensitivity is relatively limited for Ryder as  rental contracts are typically short term and increased funding costs can be  passed through to the full-service lease customers. However, there is a slight  lag on the leasing side given that contracts are typically intermediate-term;  however, Ryder seeks to mitigate this by issuing term debt in an attempt to  match-fund that portion of the business. Appropriate Leverage Ryder has an articulated long-term leverage target, defined as managed  debt-to-equity including the present value of capital lease obligations of  2.25x-2.75x. Managed leverage amounted to 2.75x, as of June 30, 2016, which is  within the target but modestly higher than the average of 2.54x since 2011, as  capital expenditures have been funded with increased borrowings in recent years.  For leasing companies, Fitch focuses on managed debt-to-tangible equity in its  analysis of leverage. On this basis, leverage amounted to 3.51x as of June 30,  2016, which is consistent with the average of 3.59x since 2011.  Ryder's pension obligation is viewed as having a potential negative impact to  the company's leverage profile given the accumulated net pension equity charge  (after tax) of $577 million, which was due to the underfunded status (79% as of  end-2015) of its defined benefit plans. Even so, Fitch expects leverage to  decline toward the midpoint of Ryder's articulated range by end-2016, driven by  retained earnings generation and lower capital expenditures. Fitch believes  Ryder's leverage metrics are appropriate for its current ratings, and  incorporate the expectation that Ryder will scale or pull-back on repurchase  activity, as necessary, to manage leverage within its long-term target. In December 2015, Ryder reinstated its antidilutive share repurchase program,  which allows the company to repurchase up to 2 million shares of common stock in  periodic, open-market transactions. In 1H16, the company repurchased a total of  321,718 shares at an average price per share of $68.05. We do not expect further  material repurchases of common stock given that managed leverage is already near  the top of Ryder's articulated range.   Solid Liquidity Profile Fitch views Ryder's liquidity as solid, supported by the substantial cash  generating capability of the operating lease portfolio. While free cash flow  (FCF) generation was negative for 6M16, this is attributable to the firm  investing primarily in full-service lease assets which are expected to generate  meaningful cash earnings. When lease and/or rental demand declines, the firm has  historically managed its fleet down quickly, resulting in positive FCF and an  ability to de-lever, as was observed during the recent financial crisis.  In addition, corporate credit facilities serve as a source of contingent  liquidity. Ryder has a $1.2 billion global revolving credit facility provided by  a syndicate of 12 banks, which also serves as a backstop to its commercial paper  issuance. Borrowing availability under the facility amounted to $425 million, as  of June 30, 2016. Based on unrestricted cash of $66 million and estimated  annualized operating cash flow of $1.5 billion, Ryder would have sufficient  liquidity to address near-term debt maturities of $1.1 billion in the next 12  months.  Continued Funding Flexibility Ryder is predominately funded through unsecured debt, which represented around  92% of total funding as of June 30, 2016. This is viewed positively by Fitch, as  available unencumbered assets improve balance sheet flexibility in times of  market stress. Sale-leaseback transactions and capital leases represented 8% of  total funding. Borrowings from these sources have been modest, but remain  important for Ryder, as they provide additional funding diversity. The company has demonstrated strong access to various funding sources through a  variety of market cycles. In 1H16, Ryder issued $300 million of unsecured  medium-term notes maturing in November 2021. The proceeds from the issuance were  used to repay maturing debt and for general corporate purposes. Fitch believes  Ryder will continue to opportunistically access the capital markets to maintain  funding diversity and optimize pricing. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch believes positive rating actions are limited over the medium term.  However, positive rating momentum could develop over the longer term from  greater revenue diversification, stronger liquidity, and lower tangible balance  sheet leverage.  Conversely, negative rating actions could be driven by an increase in tangible  balance sheet leverage resulting from a decline in earnings and/or free cash  flow beyond Fitch's expectations, or a substantial pension charge which inflates  leverage meaningfully beyond the targeted range for an extended period. In  addition, deterioration in the firm's competitive position, weaker asset quality  metrics, an inability to realize residual values on used vehicles, a material  increase in non-earning vehicles, and/or a decline in liquidity could also  result in negative rating actions.  Established in 1933 and headquartered in Miami, FL, Ryder is one of the world's  largest providers of highway transportation services. The company's stock is  listed on the NYSE under the ticker 'R'. Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows:  Ryder System, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'.

Fitch Affirms Ryder System's Ratings at 'A-/F2' Following Peer Review; Outlook  Stable Fitch Ratings, New York, 10 October 2016: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-  and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) at  'A-'/ 'F2', following the completion of its fleet leasing peer review. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of  this release.

Fitch  expects gains on sale will continue to moderate in the medium- to longer-term  given normalization of used vehicle pricing from historical highs.  Relatively Consistent Operating Performance Ryder reported 6% operating revenue growth in 1H16, reflecting higher revenue  across all operating segments, partially offset by a negative impact from  foreign exchange. Pre-tax income decreased 6% to $205.5 million in 1H16, due to  lower commercial rental revenue and reduced gains on used vehicle sales,  partially offset by higher full-service lease results, lower insurance costs in  dedicated transportation solutions (DTS), and increased pricing, new business,  and increased volumes in DTS and SCS.  This translated into annualized pre-tax return on assets of 3.7%, which is  modestly below the five-year average of 4%. Fitch expects operating performance  to remain relatively consistent in 2H16, supported by growth in full-service  leasing, tight management of fleet inventories, and controlling costs amid a  weaker environment for rentals, and lower used vehicle prices.

Managed leverage amounted to 2.75x, as of June 30, 2016, which is  within the target but modestly higher than the average of 2.54x since 2011, as  capital expenditures have been funded with increased borrowings in recent years.  For leasing companies, Fitch focuses on managed debt-to-tangible equity in its  analysis of leverage. On this basis, leverage amounted to 3.51x as of June 30,  2016, which is consistent with the average of 3.59x since 2011.  Ryder's pension obligation is viewed as having a potential negative impact to  the company's leverage profile given the accumulated net pension equity charge  (after tax) of $577 million, which was due to the underfunded status (79% as of  end-2015) of its defined benefit plans. Even so, Fitch expects leverage to  decline toward the midpoint of Ryder's articulated range by end-2016, driven by  retained earnings generation and lower capital expenditures. Fitch believes  Ryder's leverage metrics are appropriate for its current ratings, and  incorporate the expectation that Ryder will scale or pull-back on repurchase  activity, as necessary, to manage leverage within its long-term target.

In 1H16, the company repurchased a total of  321,718 shares at an average price per share of $68.05. We do not expect further  material repurchases of common stock given that managed leverage is already near  the top of Ryder's articulated range.   Solid Liquidity Profile Fitch views Ryder's liquidity as solid, supported by the substantial cash  generating capability of the operating lease portfolio. While free cash flow  (FCF) generation was negative for 6M16, this is attributable to the firm  investing primarily in full-service lease assets which are expected to generate  meaningful cash earnings.

Conversely, negative rating actions could be driven by an increase in tangible  balance sheet leverage resulting from a decline in earnings and/or free cash  flow beyond Fitch's expectations, or a substantial pension charge which inflates  leverage meaningfully beyond the targeted range for an extended period. In  addition, deterioration in the firm's competitive position, weaker asset quality  metrics, an inability to realize residual values on used vehicles, a material  increase in non-earning vehicles, and/or a decline in liquidity could also  result in negative rating actions.  Established in 1933 and headquartered in Miami, FL, Ryder is one of the world's  largest providers of highway transportation services. The company's stock is  listed on the NYSE under the ticker 'R'. Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows:  Ryder System, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction.
