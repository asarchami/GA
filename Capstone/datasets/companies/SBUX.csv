5,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) on Thursday reported that sales at established restaurants in its U.S.-dominated Americas region cooled more than analysts expected in its latest quarter as online shopping kept more consumers at home and reduced their visits to its coffee bars.With fewer shoppers going to all types of stores to buy gifts, Starbucks executives said sales at its cafes open at least 13 months softened, particularly in DecemberNevertheless, the world's biggest coffee chain boosted its fiscal 2014 earnings per share forecast to a range of $2.59 to $2.67, from $2.55 to $2.65 previously, sending shares up more than 1 percent to $74.15 in after-hours trade.Global sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 5 percent, versus analysts' average estimate for a 5.9 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix.

SHIFT TO ONLINE SHOPPING Expectations had been muted ahead of the release of Starbucks' results, in part because the Seattle company has been on a growth tear that many analysts said could not go on forever.In a conference call with analysts, Starbucks Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Schultz predicted that December 2013 would go down as the turning point in the way consumers shop.""People spent much more time on the web than ever before,"" Schultz said.Overall U.S. online sales in the period between November 2 and December 23 grew 10 percent compared with a year earlier, according to data firm comScore (SCOR.O). ShopperTrak last week said U.S. shopper traffic at brick and mortar stores fell 14.6 percent during the holiday season.Schultz pointed to the Americas region's 4 percent traffic increase in the latest quarter as proof that Starbucks would successfully weather the change - in large part because online sellers can't replicate the experience of having a croissant and coffee at one of its shops.Starbucks' net earnings increased 25 percent to $540.7 million, or 71 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended on December 29.Excluding a litigation credit of 2 cents a share, Starbucks' profit matched Wall Street's average estimate of 69 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

12,"  By Jane WardellSYDNEY Feb 23 The world's top economies agreed on Sunday to develop stricter rules on cross-border taxation to close loopholes that have allowed multinationals such as Starbucks Corp, Google Inc, Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc to avoid paying taxes.The Group of 20 endorsed a set of common standards for sharing bank account information across borders with automatic exchange of information among its members to take effect by the end of 2015.""Some multinational companies aren't paying their fair share of tax anywhere,"" Australian Finance Minister Joe Hockey, who hosted the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Sydney, said at the close of the gathering. ""We want a global response.""Reports of profit shifting by companies away from high tax countries to more relaxed tax regimes have sparked public inquiries in the United States and Britain.Global tax evasion could be costing more than $3 trillion a year according to researchers from Tax Justice Network, while as much as $32 trillion - twice the size of U.S. gross domestic product - could be stashed away in tax havens.Tightening tax loopholes has gained urgency in the aftermath of the global financial crisis when developed nations' efforts to avert economic meltdown left them with gaping budget holes and record debt. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has targeted fiscal consolidation as a key part of its growth strategy for the G20, but that will be hard to achieve if tax bases are eroded further.Corporate tax evasion is also a challenge for poor countries, which typically have the least developed tax systems and enforcement. Around $160 billion each year fail to reach developing nations because of multinationals' tax avoidance, according to a recent report by Christian Aid. That is more than they receive in aid from rich nations.The push on tax reform at the Sydney G20 meeting was firmly backed by Washington and Australia and the United States signed a deal on the eve of the meeting under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act that targets ""non-compliant"" taxpayers using foreign bank accounts.Tightening the tax rules would prevent so-called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting by multinationals that exploit gaps and mismatches in national tax rules to make profits ""disappear"" from high tax regimes and shift to low tax locations. ""What we are doing is not to say, well, we need to close down Bermuda,"" Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, told reporters.""There will be a neutralisation of these types of schemes and that is what we are doing and that where we think we can succeed, because if you try to dictate to countries what they have to do domestically, if you try to impede on their sovereignty, you cannot succeed.""French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said he intended to make Europe a leader in such efforts with France ready to sign agreements with Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, within the next few weeks. Divisions remain within the G20 on issues such as whether technology companies should be taxed at the source country, where the customer is and value is created, or at the residence country, where the product originated. But Australia's Hockey said there was consensus that companies had to pay.The push also has some business support.""The Amazons of the world that operate in other countries don't pay taxes in Australia and don't employ people in Australia; those things concern me,"" said Richard Goyder, Chief Executive of Australian retail giant Wesfarmers Ltd and president of the B20 Australia forum of business leaders that liaises with the G20.The OECD standard builds on U.S. rules, which ask foreign financial institutions to report on all accounts held by U.S. citizens, or pay a punitive 30 per cent withholding on all U.S. income.Quentin Grafton, a professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra, welcomed the G20 commitment, but warned that achieving a global standard would be difficult given tax havens like Bermuda and Ireland are not part of the grouping.""This is a win-lose proposition, so that makes it a difficult proposition,"" he said. ""Those countries that will lose out will try and oppose it.""Grafton said the OECD has been trying for more than a decade to bring about tax reform and the next test would come in September when it reports on planned actions.",2014-02-23,SBUX,"Sun Feb 23, 2014 | 3:51pm EST","RPT-G20 agrees on push to close tax loopholes, make multinationals pay",http://www.reuters.com//article/g20-australia-tax-idUSL1N0LS0DF20140223?type=companyNews

40,"  WARSAW May 9 Restaurant operator AmRest, the eastern European and Russian franchisee for brands including KFC, Burger King, and Starbucks, swung to a first-quarter profit as rising sales and new outlets outweighed the disruption caused by the crisis in Ukraine.Warsaw-listed AmRest, which has 78 restaurants in Russia out of its total of 745, said on Friday it made a quarterly net profit of $2.82 million compared with a loss in the same period last year.It said it was affected by the fall in the Russian rouble this year, as well as more general concerns about the tensions in Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists and western sanctions on Russia. But the impact of that was off-set by higher sales and new restaurants, the company said. It opened 13 new outlets in Russia in the 12 months to March this year. ""Russia is one of the largest markets for AmRest.

41,"   By Adrian Croft and Tom Bergin | BRUSSELS/LONDON  BRUSSELS/LONDON The European Commission raised pressure on Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg over their corporate tax practices, saying it was investigating deals the countries have cut with Apple, Starbucks and Fiat.The EU is looking at whether the countries' tax treatment of multinationals, which help to attract investment and jobs that might otherwise go to where the companies' customers are based, represent unfair state aid.Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the international political agenda in recent years following reports of how companies like Apple and Google use convoluted structures to slash their tax bills. ""In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes,"" Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said on Wednesday.  Governments have promised to rewrite the rules that govern international tax, but experts said the European Commission would struggle to challenge deals Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had agreed under existing rules.Apple said on Wednesday it has not received any selective tax treatment from the Irish authorities, while Starbucks said it complied with all tax rules. Fiat declined comment. The Irish government said it was confident that it has not breached state aid rules and will defend its position vigorously. Eric Wiebes, the Dutch Secretary of State for Finance said he was confident the investigation would find the country had not broken EU rules. A spokesman for the Luxembourg finance ministry declined comment.Sheila Killian, assistant Dean in the Accounting & Finance department of the University of Limerick, Ireland, said the naming of individual companies represented a more aggressive stance from the Commission. ""It’s upping the ante from the EU’s point of view,"" she said.TRANSFER PRICING The Commission said it was looking at whether the pricing for transactions between company subsidiaries - known as transfer pricing - that were approved by the Irish, Luxembourg and Dutch tax authorities, and which allowed the companies to reduce their tax bills, were selective and thereby represented unfair incentives.While the Commission has often forced countries to change tax rules which it deemed would distort intra-bloc trade, a Commission spokesman was unable to name any successful challenges to a country's transfer pricing decisions. Killian said existing international tax rules gave companies wide flexibility in choosing transfer prices. ""It’s almost impossible to prove that the transfer pricing is any way favourable ... but in launching a high-profile investigation, it puts a spotlight on those companies' tax affairs, which acts as a deterrent to companies against engaging in aggressive tax planning,"" she said.Philip Kermode, Director, Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, speaking to an Irish parliamentary hearing on Wednesday said that in principle the companies could be forced to repay money if they were deemed to have received state aid.However, Chas Roy-Chowdhury, Head of Taxation, at accounting group ACCA, said that scenario was unlikely. It was more likely, he said, that the Commission would issue an unflattering report which might encourage the three countries to take a stiffer line with multinationals in future.COMPLEX STRUCTURES  The Commission said it was investigating the tax treatment of Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV, which operates a coffee roasting plant in Amsterdam.The Dutch operation buys raw coffee beans from an affiliate in Switzerland and sells roasted coffee to operating units across Europe. It also receives fees from subsidiaries for the right to use the Starbucks brand.    Starbucks told a UK parliamentary investigation in 2012 that the deal it received in the Netherlands allowed it to enjoy a ""very low"" tax rate.A U.S. Senate probe last year revealed that Apple had sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profits from tax by using Irish companies that had no tax residence anywhere.    Apple in the United States entered into deals with the Irish subsidiaries whereby the Irish units received the rights to certain intellectual property that were subsequently licensed to other group companies.This arrangement ensured almost no tax was paid in countries such as Britain or France and helped the group achieve an effective tax rate of just 3.7 percent on its non-U.S. income last year, its annual report shows - a fraction of the prevailing rates in its main overseas markets.Ireland resisted considerable pressure from Germany and other countries to change its tax regime as part of an EU bailout during the financial crisis.The Commission is also looking at a ruling the Luxembourg tax authorities gave to Fiat Finance and Trade Ltd, which lends money to other Fiat companies.Almunia added the Commission had started a preliminary investigation into so-called “patent box” tax breaks by a number of EU countries, under which profits derived from patents faced tax rates of as low as 5 percent.

COMPLEX STRUCTURES The Commission said it was investigating the tax treatment of Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV, which operates a coffee roasting plant in Amsterdam.The Dutch operation buys raw coffee beans from an affiliate in Switzerland and sells roasted coffee to operating units across Europe. It also receives fees from subsidiaries for the right to use the Starbucks brand.Starbucks told a UK parliamentary investigation in 2012 that the deal it received in the Netherlands allowed it to enjoy a ""very low"" tax rate.A U.S. Senate probe last year revealed that Apple had sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profits from tax by using Irish companies that had no tax residence anywhere.Apple in the United States entered into deals with the Irish subsidiaries whereby the Irish units received the rights to certain intellectual property that were subsequently licensed to other group companies.This arrangement ensured almost no tax was paid in countries such as Britain or France and helped the group achieve an effective tax rate of just 3.7 percent on its non-U.S. income last year, its annual report shows - a fraction of the prevailing rates in its main overseas markets.Ireland resisted considerable pressure from Germany and other countries to change its tax regime as part of an EU bailout during the financial crisis.The Commission is also looking at a ruling the Luxembourg tax authorities gave to Fiat Finance and Trade Ltd, which lends money to other Fiat companies.Almunia added the Commission had started a preliminary investigation into so-called ""patent box"" tax breaks by a number of EU countries, under which profits derived from patents faced tax rates of as low as 5 percent.

43,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON/BRUSSELS  LONDON/BRUSSELS The European Commission raised pressure on Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg over their corporate tax practices, saying it was investigating deals the countries have cut with Apple, Starbucks and Fiat.The EU is looking at whether the countries' tax treatment of multinationals, which help to attract investment and jobs that might otherwise go to where the companies' customers are based, represent unfair state aid.Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the international political agenda in recent years following reports of how companies like Apple and Google use convoluted structures to slash their tax bills.Governments have promised to rewrite the rules that govern international tax, but experts said the European Commission would struggle to make any challenge to the deals Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had agreed under existing rules.Apple said on Wednesday it has not received any selective tax treatment from the Irish authorities, while the Irish government said it was confident that it has not breached state aid rules and will defend its position vigorously. Fiat declined to comment and Starbucks was not immediately available.  Sheila Killian, assistant Dean in the Accounting & Financedepartment of the University of Limerick, Ireland, said the announcement, naming individual companies, represented a more aggressive stance from the Commission.""It’s upping the ante from the EU’s point of view,"" she said.The Commission said it was looking at whether the pricing for transactions between company subsidiaries - known as transfer pricing - that were approved by the Irish, Luxembourg and Dutch tax authorities and which allowed the companies to reduce their tax bills, were selective and thereby represented unfair incentives.But Killian said international tax rules gave companies wide flexibility in choosing transfer prices and so the legal hurdles the Commission faced were substantial. ""It’s almost impossible to prove that the transfer pricing is any way favourable ... but in launching a high-profile investigation, it puts a spotlight on those companies' tax affairs, which acts as a deterrent to companies against engaging in aggressive tax planning,"" she said.A Commission spokesman denied the aim of the investigation was to act as a deterrent. He was unable to name a single case where the Commission had successfully challenged a country's transfer pricing decisions. TAX DEALS Starbucks told a UK parliamentary investigation in 2012 that it received a tax deal in the Netherlands which allowed it to enjoy a ""very low"" tax rate, while a U.S. Senate probe last year revealed that Apple had sheltered tens of billions of dollars in profits from tax by using Irish companies that had no tax residence anywhere.    Apple in the United States entered into deals with the Irish subsidiaries whereby the Irish units received the rights to certain intellectual property that were subsequently licensed to other group companies, helping ensure almost no tax was reported in countries such as Britain or France.    Apple's Irish arrangement helped it achieve an effective tax rate of just 3.7 percent on its non-U.S. income last year, its annual report shows – a fraction of the prevailing rates in its main overseas markets.The Group of 20 leading nations has launched a drive to develop new rules to tackle abusive transfer pricing and other forms of corporate profit shifting.

Dunkin' Brand Group Inc also has said it expects ""modest increases in coffee prices"" at its Dunkin' Donuts restaurants.Starbucks' more than 7,100 company-owned U.S. stores will raise the price of some drinks by 5 to 20 cents on June 24. For example, the cost of grande (16 oz) and venti (24 oz) brewed coffee will increase 10 to 15 cents in most markets. The coffee chain characterized the drink price increases as limited, saying they would affect fewer than 20 percent of customers.     The price increase for some drinks, including grande brewed coffees, are the first in almost 4 years.

There also will be no price increases on food at this time, the company said.Separately, the Seattle-based chain is boosting the price of  Starbucks-brand whole bean and ground coffee sold in supermarkets and other stores by an average of 8 percent on July 21.

The futures price has since fallen more than 20 percent, to a four-month low at $1.6655 per lb on Thursday, as Brazil's harvest got under way.

49,"   By Annika Breidthardt and Ingrid Melander | LUXEMBOURG  LUXEMBOURG The European Union on Friday moved to close a loophole that has allowed multinational companies to reduce their tax bills by exploiting differences in national tax rules, ending months of negotiations and potentially boosting EU states' tax revenues.Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot issue in industrialised nations. Campaigners have drawn support from public anger at companies avoiding taxes at a time of austerity. ""The aim is to close a loophole that currently allows corporate groups to exploit mismatches between national tax rules so as to avoid paying taxes on some types of profits distributed within the group,"" finance ministers said in a statement.The change in the so-called parent-subsidiary directive addresses ""hybrid loan arrangements"", a combination of equity and debt often used as a tax-planning tool.Some member states classify profits from such tools as a tax-deductible debt; others do not. That has prompted some multinational companies to open subsidiaries in other member states so they pay little or no tax. ""Using an (EU) directive that was based on common sense - avoid double-taxation - a few cunning devils had managed to pay no tax at all,"" French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said, welcoming the move. ""That will mean a bit more money in state coffers, which as you know we're quite keen on.""All EU tax law requires unanimity among member states, and getting all states on board has been an uphill struggle. Europe has been torn between the demands of small countries fiercely resisting change to low-tax regimes that attract foreign investment, and others wary of driving away big employers.Earlier this month, the European Commission increased pressure on Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg over their corporate tax practices, saying it would investigate deals they cut with Apple(AAPL.O), Starbucks (SBUX.O) and FiatFIA.MI. Member states will have until the end of 2015 to turn the change into national law.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the EU should go even further and tackle what he said was the growing abuse of patent boxes -- countries adopting lower taxation for companies to commercialise their patents and R&D.Governments which offer them say they encourage innovation and high-value jobs in research and development. Critics see the scheme as government-sanctioned tax avoidance.  ""We have to decisively move forward on this in Europe or we will not live up to our own expectations,” he told reporters.In another move towards more cooperation on tax issues, the Swiss government reaffirmed on Friday its willingness to abolish some corporate tax regimes, such as the different treatment of domestic and foreign revenues. Disagreements over corporate taxation have strained relations between the EU and Switzerland for almost a decade.""In return, the EU member states confirm their intention to lift corresponding countermeasures as soon as the regimes in question have been abolished,"" it said.

This store and all other Starbucks locations in Colombia will be the Seattle-based company's first to serve only locally sourced coffee.Starbucks is the world's largest buyer of Colombia high-grade arabica coffee in the world, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz told Reuters in a telephone interview.

The last few years, though, have been rocky.  Heavy rains and a replanting program that took many trees out of production drastically cut Colombia's coffee crop in 2008.

Alsea said its profits were hurt by additional financing costs involved in its purchase of a restaurant business from retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico. The company raised more than $500 million in a secondary offer to help pay for the acquisition. Alsea said revenue rose 36.2 percent to 5.2 billion pesos.Alsea shares closed down 0.38 percent at 46.67 pesos on Monday, before the company reported its results.

57,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI The latest food scandal in China is spreading fast, dragging in U.S. coffee chain Starbucks, Burger King Worldwide Inc and others, as well as McDonald's products as far away as Japan.McDonald's Corp and KFC's parent Yum Brands Inc apologized to Chinese customers on Monday after it emerged that Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had supplied expired meat to the two chains.On Tuesday, Starbucks said some of its cafes previously sold products containing chicken originally sourced from Shanghai Husi, a firm that was shut down on Sunday by local regulators after a TV report showed staff using expired meat and picking up meat from the floor to add to the mix.A Tokyo-based spokesman at McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. Alternative supplies of chicken have been found in Thailand and China, he added. The company's shares briefly fell as much as 1.4 percent to a 15-month low before closing down 0.4 percent.China's food watchdog said it ordered regional offices to carry out spot checks on all firms which had used Shanghai Husi products, and would inspect all of parent OSI's sites around China to see if enough has been done to ensure food safety. It said the case could be handed over to the police.The regulator's Shanghai branch said in a statement on Tuesday it had demanded production, quality control and sales records from OSI. It added it already ordered McDonald's to seal over 4,500 boxes of suspected meat products and Yum's Pizza Hut to seal over 500 boxes of beef.Fast-food chain Burger King and Dicos, China's third-ranked fast food chain owned by Ting Hsin International, said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets. Pizza chain Papa John's International Inc said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier. FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick. Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years, and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards.  China is McDonald's third-biggest market by number of restaurants and Yum's top market by revenue. McDonald's is due to report quarterly earnings later on Tuesday.The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online among the country's influential 'netizens', with some users spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished.The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight early this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011.Starbucks said on its Chinese microblog site that it had no direct business relationship with Shanghai Husi, but that some of its chicken acquired from another supplier had originally come from Husi for its ""Chicken Apple Sauce Panini"" products. This had been sold in 13 different provinces and major cities. The company added that all the products had already been removed from its shelves. Burger King said in a Weibo statement posted late on Monday that it had taken off its shelves all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi Food and had launched an investigation.Dicos said it pulled all ham products supplied by Shanghai Husi, and would stop serving its ham sandwich product for breakfast. ""We will continue to carry out a probe into Shanghai Husi Food and its related firms, to understand whether or not it followed national regulations,"" Dicos said in a statement.Swedish furniture firm IKEA [IKEA.UL], which has in-store food outlets, said on Weibo that Shanghai Husi had previously been a supplier, but had not provided the firm with products since September last year. Domino's Pizza Inc and Doctor's Associates Inc's Subway brand, which were named in online reports as being supplied meat from Shanghai Husi, said their outlets in China did not use meat products from the firm.Yoshinoya-parent Hop Hing Group Holdings Ltd, Japanese convenience store FamilyMart Co Ltd and Chinese chain Wallace urged diners not to worry, and said they did not currently use any products from Shanghai Husi.

Coffee futures prices are notorious for their volatility but this year, the benchmark contract on ICE Futures U.S. has been more wild than usual.Starbucks benefited from  a 2-1/2-year downtrend that bottomed out in late 2013. But in late January, an unprecedented drought in top grower Brazil took the entire coffee industry by surprise as the benchmark contract nearly doubled in price within three months to a 26-month high above $2 per lb in April. The contract has since fallen and finished the April-June quarter down about 5 percent.

68,"   By Solarina Ho | TORONTO  TORONTO Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons, which has offered only one coffee blend in its 50-year history, hopes to lure new coffee drinkers and fend off rivals such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) with the launch throughout North America of its new dark roast blend.Tim Hortons, which announced the move on Thursday, may also increase prices to tackle rising costs and competition from U.S. rivals expanding in Canada.""Looking at the coffee market, I would suggest that, given the degree of cost increases, that we are looking at prices going up sometime in 2015,"" Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO chief executive Marc Caira said on Thursday.Tim Hortons, which says it serves nearly 8 out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada, outlined a plan in February to kick-start growth and improve returns by fine-tuning its menu to encourage more spending, improving service and opening new restaurant formats.Last week, the chain reported market-beating quarterly growth that showed its strategy, which includes higher priced and new menu items, is paying off. Still, traffic declined for the ninth consecutive quarter in Canada and is flat in the United States. Caira expects the new dark brew, which will also be available for home brewing in formats such as Keurig Mountain Inc's single serve pod, to contribute to results, but he declined to give details. The alternative brew was first sold late last fall in Columbus, Ohio and London, Ontario, and then in the province of Quebec in June. It will be offered at all 4,496 restaurants across Canada and the United States starting Friday.""There's about 38 to 40 percent of coffee drinkers that are looking for a darker roast,"" said Caira. ""Those are very intriguing numbers for us ... If we weren't pleased with the (initial) numbers, we wouldn't be launching it."" INFLATION PRESSURE Caira, a former top Nestle SA executive who took over at the Canadian chain a little more than a year ago, plans to tackle inflationary pressure from higher coffee bean prices and labor costs by cutting waste and improving efficiencies.""The last thing that we want to do is arbitrarily increase prices,"" said Caira, but he conceded the chain will likely raise prices in 2015. He could not say what products might be affected. Caira said the company was also working with Ottawa to address labor shortages in some parts of Canada following tighter rules on hiring temporary foreign workers in the restaurant industry. ""There must be flexibility in the system to address labor issues in certain parts of the country,"" Caira said.He added that in some markets there are not enough people to work in the company's restaurants.""That is a fact proven out by number,"" he said. ""In those cases, there's a need for this program."" (Additional reporting by Euan Rocha.

69,"  TAMPA Fla. The rally of java generosity began on Wednesday morning at a Starbucks in Florida, when one patron offered to buy an iced triple grande latte for the next customer in the drive-through line.Then the next wanted to pay it forward. And the next.The apparently spontaneous chain of kindness continued for about 11 hours, a store manager said, totaling 457 transactions by the time it ended around 6 p.m., with nearly everyone paying for someone's drinks, just not their own.""It was just somebody wanting to do a nice thing,"" said Celeste Guzman, a shift supervisor at the Starbucks,  located near a busy shopping mall in St. Petersburg, Florida. She wasn't sure how the chain had ended, but said baristas understood that some people didn't want to or couldn't afford to participate.Inspired by local media reports, customers were rallying again at the store on Thursday morning. Someone bought a $40 gift card to share with the drive-through line.

70,"  TAMPA, Fla. Aug 21 The rally of java generosity began on Wednesday morning at a Starbucks in Florida, when one patron offered to buy an iced triple grande latte for the next customer in the drive-through line.Then the next wanted to pay it forward. And the next.The apparently spontaneous chain of kindness continued for about 11 hours, a store manager said, totaling 457 transactions by the time it ended around 6 p.m., with nearly everyone paying for someone's drinks, just not their own. ""It was just somebody wanting to do a nice thing,"" said Celeste Guzman, a shift supervisor at the Starbucks,  located near a busy shopping mall in St. Petersburg, Florida.She wasn't sure how the chain had ended, but said baristas understood that some people didn't want to or couldn't afford to participate. Inspired by local media reports, customers were rallying again at the store on Thursday morning. Someone bought a $40 gift card to share with the drive-through line. By mid-morning, the chain had reached 100 customers, nearly as many as participated in a similar effort at the store several months ago, when 141 customers paid it forward.""We've had a wealth of people trying to come in and be generous,"" Guzman said.

The company will consolidate roasting of its reserve offerings, including Geisha and Jamaica Blue Mountain, in the facility, which will house a store, a tasting room and a cafe devoted to its reserve coffees.  The new roastery is expected to give Starbucks the potential to expand its reserve lineup from 15 to 30 offerings. Some recent Starbucks reserve coffees sell for $15 to $50 for an 8-ounce package.Starbucks also plans to open at least 100 reserve-only cafes globally over the coming five years. It declined to give more details. ""We plan to take this super premium experience to cities around the world,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in a statement.

75,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Kenny G, the best-selling jazz musician who once played at President Bill Clinton's inaugural ball, wakes up every morning to Starbucks.The saxophonist doesn't drink coffee. Instead, the man whose real name is Kenny Gorelick obsessively checks the company's stock price. Gorelick was one of the first investors in the Seattle-based chain. He was introduced to Starbucks chief Howard Schultz through an uncle, before the company went public, and soon bought a stake. Shares are up more than 12,000 percent since beginning public trade. That success helped spark a stockpicking habit that consumes his attention as his music earning potential is eaten away by digital music, which pays less than physical album sales, and online piracy.These days, Gorelick spends his mornings in front of his computer screen, trading blocs of shares of the approximately 30 companies in his portfolio. Over the last decade, he has earned about as much money from stock trading as from music, he said. “Most people in the music business don’t make as much money as we used to,” said Gorelick, who topped the contemporary jazz sales charts for several years running in the 1990s and whose 2010 album cracked jazz's top ten. “You have your 1 percent of Beyonce and U2, who are playing stadiums, who are going to make tons of money. I’m going to put myself in the normal category of a music person who has been successful.”Gorelick, who holds a degree in accounting from the University of Washington, keeps his assets in two main accounts: one for his own trading and one that is overseen by Todd Morgan, a founder of Los Angeles-based firm Bel Air Investment Advisors.Morgan said that it was common for his clients, all of whom must meet the firm's $20 million minimum in investable assets, to keep a portion of their portfolios for stock trading. ""We encourage them that if they are active traders to open an account away from us. Why get in the middle of it?"" Morgan said.Wealthy investors with more than $1 million in their accounts are unusual in their affection for trading individual shares, according to data from E*Trade and other brokers. Wealthy investors are the most likely to prefer individual shares, with 30 percent or more of portfolios invested in single company positions, according to a study from E*Trade Financial. Smaller accounts, meanwhile, tend to keep roughly 20 percent of total portfolios in individual stocks, a figure that has dropped since 2008 with the rise of index funds and low-cost exchanged traded funds that track the performance of the broad market. Picking stock winners is not easy. Only 30 percent of professional fund managers outperformed the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index over the last decade, according to data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. Yet individual shares do have advantages, advisers say, including the ability to defer tax liabilities during an investor's lifetime and favorable tax treatment for their heirs. Wealthy investors who trade a portion of their own accounts may also be able to increase the diversity of their portfolios.GROWTH STOCK PICKER Gorelick has been more fortunate than other musicians when it comes to the income he's lost to streaming and digital downloads. His 2010 album, ""Heart and Soul"", sold nearly 12,000 copies in its first week, with an unusually high 86 percent of sales coming in higher-priced compact discs, according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan, which tracks music purchases. His next solo album is due later this year. As far as stock performance goes, ""I have a good batting average but I'm definitely not perfect,"" Gorelick said. He asks people he considers smart about what is happening in their fields. If he comes across a company that looks promising, he watches it for a while, reading coverage of the companies and doing other research, and then might buy on a dip.One of his biggest recent winners was a stake in Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc, one of the world's largest fertilizer exporters. He heard about the company from a friend in Canada. The friend was a successful stock picker and that ""made his advice easy to follow,"" Gorelick said. He watched the stock for two months, and bought significantly when it dipped one day to around a split-adjusted $30 per share in 2010.The shares shot up to a split-adjusted $62 per share the following year as the company fought off unsolicited takeover bids. Gorelick sold on the way back down, at $60 and below. ""I made a lot of money on that stock,"" he said.Nearly the opposite happened with his stake in biotech Dendreon Corp, recommended by a friend. Gorelick began buying shares around $35 in early 2011. Not long afterward, the company announced that sales of its prostate cancer vaccine Provenge were not meeting expectations. Gorelick sold for less than $5 a share. It now trades at less than $2 per share. ""I don't listen to tips from friends as much anymore,"" Gorelick joked. Gorelick still has ""a fair amount"" of his original shares in Starbucks Corp and watches the stock price every day, he said. Yet he tries to keep himself from getting caught up in every change of the ticker. ""I can get emotional in my music, and try to make more sense when it comes to trading,"" he said.

77,"   By Solarina Ho | TORONTO  TORONTO McDonald's Corp is making its McCafe ground coffee available in Canadian grocery stores this month, the fast-food giant said on Tuesday, part of its broader campaign to win market share in a country long dominated by rivals like Tim Hortons Inc and Starbucks Corp.The competition to woo Canadian coffee drinkers has intensified in recent years, while rivals have pushed into McDonald's territory by expanding their own breakfast and lunch menus in order to attract new customers and drive up spending per visit.""Everybody's trying to scramble for customers,"" the chief executive of McDonald's Canada, John Betts, told Reuters.Tim Hortons, which claims to brew nearly eight out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada, last month announced a new coffee blend, marking its introduction of a second blend after 50 years in business.Betts says that since taking over operations in Canada in 2008, his focus has helped McDonald's double its market share in coffee and triple its coffee sales. McDonald's launched the McCafe brand in Canada in 2011.""You might say it's the thing that turned our business around here, in Canada,"" said Betts. ""We've had double-digit growth on a compounded basis over the last five years at breakfast time, in terms of traffic and sales. That's a significant category growth for us.""Betts, who started as a part-time worker at McDonald's 44 years ago, said in his six years in Canada, McDonald's has grown its share of the coffee market while opening only a handful more restaurants, compared with the hundreds opened by competitors.But with 78 percent of coffee drinking done at home, according to the Canadian Coffee Association, there's a bigger market that McDonald's wants to tap into. McDonald's Canada is partnering with Kraft Canada to sell its bagged medium roast ground coffee, as well the single-serve formats for Tassimo and Keurig in grocery stores.The world's largest fast-food chain began testing McCafe grocery sales in the United States last year and will launch nationwide in the United States in early 2015. The push into grocery stores comes as sales at established restaurants at McDonald's globally have declined. The company has been grappling with internal missteps, brutal competition and shifting consumer preferences.  But Betts said Canada is one of McDonald's top-performing markets, and it is still seeing ""significant positive momentum"" in growth, though he declined to provide data.In Canada, McDonald's restaurants have had to address tougher government restrictions on bringing in temporary foreign workers following an outcry over perceived abuses of the system.Betts said McDonald's was working with franchisees to adapt to changes, though he said that there were labor challenges in parts of the country.

Over the summer, Sazaby approached the world's biggest coffee chain about selling its ownership stake in Starbucks Japan, Starbucks said in a statement.There are roughly 1,050 Starbucks cafes in Japan, which Starbucks said will be its second-largest market in terms of revenue from its coffee shops.Despite Japan's economic difficulties, those shops have profit margins that are among the highest in the world, Starbucks executives said on a conference call with analysts. Starbucks also has opportunities to add more shops, expand product sales through grocery and food service channels and to boost the company's relatively small share of canned coffee and other ready-to-drink products that are popular in Japan, they added.Sazaby will begin tendering shares beginning on Sept. 26. The purchase price for Sazaby's 39.5 percent stake is 965 yen per share, for a total of 55 billion yen (about $505 million). When that transaction is completed, Starbucks will have a controlling 79 percent interest in Starbucks Japan.Shortly afterward, Starbucks will begin to buy the remaining 21 percent ownership interest held by public shareholders and option holders of Starbucks Japan's common stock for a purchase price of 1,465 yen per share, for a total of 44.5 billion yen (about $408.5 million).

86,"  MEXICO CITY Oct 22 Mexican restaurant operator Alsea, which runs Starbucks, Domino's Pizza and Burger King franchises, on Wednesday said its third-quarter profit was flat compared to a year ago as new acquisitions were offset by higher interest payments.The company reported a profit of 185 million pesos ($13.782 million) in the July-September period, compared with a profit of 184 million pesos in the same period a year earlier.Alsea said revenue rose 39.7 percent to 5.701 billion pesos, principally because of the inclusion in its results of the purchase in May of Vips chain. Sales at stores open more than a year increased 2 percent. The company said that the cost of financing increased to 91 million pesos, from 38 million pesos in the third quarter last year, while operating expenses rose because Alsea opened new stores across Latin America.

94,"   By Foo Yun Chee and Tom Bergin | BRUSSELS/LONDON  BRUSSELS/LONDON A tax deal the Netherlands cut with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) may be illegal state aid, European Union regulators said on Friday, part of a crackdown on members attracting investment by helping companies to avoid tax.Luxembourg, Ireland, Malta, Belgium, Cyprus and Gibraltar are also facing scrutiny over tax deals they have struck with multinational companies.The inquiries have overshadowed the early days of the new European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg for more than two decades, and intensified calls among lawmakers and EU countries for a more harmonised tax system in the 28-country bloc.The European Commission said it suspects the Dutch tax ruling allows Starbucks, the world's biggest coffee chain, to lower its taxable profit, and thereby its tax bill, in a way that is at odds with accepted accounting rules.""The Commission’s preliminary view is that the advanced pricing arrangements in favour of Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV constitutes state aid,"" the EU executive said.Deputy Finance Minister Eric Wiebes said that the Starbucks deal ""is fully in line with international transfer pricing standards, is consistent with the policy framework applied by the government in its efforts to create an attractive business climate"".   Starbucks said it was confident EU regulators would  conclude that it had not received a selective advantage.COFFEE BEANS The Commission said the Dutch tax authority had allowed a Starbucks subsidiary called Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV to declare a taxable profit equal to a percentage of its costs, but also allowed the company to exclude most of its costs when making the calculation.  This was partly achieved by excluding the cost of coffee beans. The Dutch justified this, saying the beans remained the property of another Starbucks subsidiary. However, the Commission noted the beans appeared on Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA's balance sheet. In 2012, the company's Chief Financial Officer told a UK parliamentary hearing that the Dutch tax deals were ""an attractive reason"" to be based in Amsterdam. ""It is a very low tax rate.... they do offer very competitive tax rulings,"" Troy Alstead said.If the EU investigation finds Starbucks did receive an unfair advantage, the company could be forced to repay unpaid tax but the amounts are unlikely to be large.

102,"   By Luc Cohen | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Starbucks Corp has this year bought coffee beans from China at its highest volume ever, shipping data show, reflecting the country's burgeoning role as bean supplier amid supply concerns among traditional exporters.The world's biggest coffee chain imported nearly 14,000 bags of arabica beans from China into the United States in the first nine months of 2014, more than five times last year's total, according to data from shipping intelligence firm PIERS, which aggregates cargo manifest details from customs data.That is a fraction of total coffee imports by Starbucks - also the leading overall importer - from across the globe in the January-September period, but the company's purchases represent more than half of China's coffee imports in the United States.The jump this year from less than 2,600 60-kg bags in 2013 partly reflects growth in Starbucks' nascent retail business in China, where a growing urban population is drinking more coffee.Some of the beans are roasted in the United States and then shipped back to China for sale in the fledging consumer market, a spokeswoman said in an email. The rest are included in blends available globally, she said.Starbucks two years ago launched its first operation in Yunnan, China's main coffee-growing province, but does not have a roasting facility in Asia, she said. Nestle SA has been active in the region for decades.

CEO Ernesto Alvarez said China is not a reliable high-volume supplier, but that its beans are an option when they are available.Yunnan is unlikely to catch up with output in top grower Brazil's Minas Gerais state anytime soon, but the inflow comes as some roasters look for alternative supplies as drought and disease threaten output in Brazil and Central America. China's coffees have also begun to catch the eye of the U.S. specialty market.""Given what's going on in Central America with leaf rust and the drought in Brazil, you want to look at other options,"" said Craig Holt, owner of Seattle-based Atlas Coffee Importers, which caters toward specialty U.S. roasters.Holt has never purchased Chinese coffee before, but plans to travel to the country's Yunnan province in December after sampling a coffee that he described as clean, bright and free of defects.In 2014, the United States is on track to import almost 75,000 60-kg bags from China, more than 2013 and up from an average of 5,700 bags a decade ago, according to U.S. International Trade Commission data.

Some of those beans will be brewed and sold alongside food prepared by James Beard Award-winning chef Tom Douglas, while others will be packaged for sale in more than 1,500 existing Starbucks shops around the globe.Schultz plans to open a second ""Star R"" branded Reserve roastery and tasting room in Asia in 2016. He also promises to add 100 reserve-only coffee shops in the coming years. ""This is an opportunity for us to educate our core customer and new customers about the exotic nature of these rare, small-lot coffees,"" said Schultz, who added that he was inspired by fictional chocolate factory owner Willy Wonka to ""take people on a magical coffee ride.""The CEO says he does not track the moves of his small rivals, which have been reaping millions of dollars in venture funding from high-profile investors such as Google Ventures, TSG Consumer Partners and Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter Inc  and Square. Those purveyors have won over the likes of Los Angeles-based  photographer Jesse DeFlorio, 26, who frequently buys chestnut praline lattes and other flavored coffee drinks at Starbucks.He has not visited the new Reserve facility but said it would not be his first choice when he is plunking down $5 for a super premium brew.For that, DeFlorio said, ""I would pick any of the third-wave coffee companies.""

110,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 08 (Fitch) According to Fitch Ratings, Starbucks Corporation's  (Starbucks: Fitch IDRs 'A-/F2') five-year plan to accelerate profitable growth  is more than achievable. Based on Fitch's preliminary estimates, which  conservatively assume annual capex of roughly 7% of revenue and the maintenance  of Starbucks' 35%-45% dividend payout target, cumulative free cash flow (FCF)  could exceed $7 billion over the next five years.    On Dec. 4, Starbucks detailed a well-articulated plan to increase annual revenue  to nearly $30 billion from $16.4 billion by the end of fiscal 2019. The company  also outlined a strategy to grow cost of goods sold and G&A expense at a slower  rate than revenue. The run-rate of cost of goods sold is expected to be reduced  by a cumulative $1 billion over the next four years due to efforts around supply  chain, sourcing, waste, product mix, and other items.   Fitch expects revenue growth to continue to benefit from favorable global coffee  consumption trends and further strengthening of the Starbucks' brand while being  driven by the company's multiple sales platforms. Starbucks is experiencing  system-wide net new unit growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range, further  expanding into food across the lunch and evening day parts, growing in consumer  packaged goods, and launching mobile order-and-pay nationally in 2015. The  launch of the Starbucks Reserve super-premium brand and the company's ahead of  the curve progress in digital are examples of how it is protecting its strong  brand equity. Meanwhile, the acquisition of the remaining 60.5% share of Starbucks Coffee  Japan, Ltd will add just over $1 billion of annualized revenue. Annual revenue  growth of at least 10% due to mid-single-digit same-store sales and global new  unit development along with the addition of supply chain savings, reduced  overhead, and working capital efficiency should result in double-digit operating  income growth, margin expansion and improved operating cash flow.   Fitch views Starbucks' strategy favorably but believes some operating risks  exist, including increased competition in global coffee and service-related  challenges caused by advance mobile ordering and continued expansion in food.  Credit risk, however, continues to be minimal due to the company's strong 'A-'  credit profile and balanced financial strategy.  Ratings reflect Starbucks' low-risk financial structure, ample liquidity,  improving profitability, significant scale, market leadership, and strong brand  equity. At Sept. 28, 2014, Starbucks had 21,366 stores globally and, as part of  its five-year plan is targeting more than 30,000 by the end of fiscal 2019. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 28, 2014, total adjusted  debt-to-operating EBITAR (rent-adjusted leverage) was 2.1x and operating  EBITDAR-to-gross interest expense plus gross rents was 4.5x. Excluding the $2.8  billion one-time fiscal 2013 charge and corresponding fiscal 2014 payment  related to the Kraft Foods Group, Inc. arbitration matter, operating income  increased 25% to $3.1 billion and FCF totaled $1.4 billion.  Fitch expects rent-adjusted leverage to remain in the low 2.0x range in the near  term. However, total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR remained near or below  2.0x due to above-average same-store sales trends and cash flow growth, and  continued strong FCF generation would warrant a positive rating action.  Fitch currently rates Starbucks as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Bank Credit facility 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Starbucks had approximately $2 billion of total  debt at Sept. 28, 2014.

In October, Starbucks said the early re-launch of its popular Pumpkin Spice Latte seasonal drink failed to heat up business at its U.S. cafes in the quarter that ended Sept. 28.Last month, Starbucks announced it would add beer and wine, lunch and evening food selections and roll out mobile ordering in a bid to jolt U.S. traffic.

121,"  (Adds market background)NEW YORK Jan 22 Starbucks Corp has fixed the price it will pay for most of its coffee beans this year after going on a buying spree late last year when prices were under pressure, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said on Thursday.The move reflects a strategy by major coffee buyers to protect against potential spikes in arabica coffee prices amid concerns over prolonged dry weather in top grower Brazil and the impact of leaf disease in Central America.Maw said Starbucks has now fixed prices on 94 percent of its coffee needs for 2015 after buying a ""significant"" amount of coffee in the last six weeks of 2014. The company said in October it had covered two-thirds of its bean needs for 2015. The purchases came as the price for front-month arabica coffee on ICE Futures U.S. fell as low as $1.64 a lb on Dec. 31 from more than $1.90 a lb in late November. Maw said that, over the last year, Starbucks has tended not to buy coffee when the price exceeded $1.90 a lb.He has not seen any indication that bean supplies have been disrupted, but opportunity buying under $1.90 might indicate the world's roasters are preparing for a sustained period of high prices. That level is well off the 2-1/2-year highs above $2.20 seen in October last year, but is still well above historic averages.""We don't see or hear anything that indicates a slowdown in supply,"" Maw said. ""Everything indicates that the coffee market is still healthy in origin.""

But as investors digested the details of the program it became more clear that the ECB was accomplishing exactly what it intended to.""This is really the bazooka people had been looking for in the past years,"" Lebovitz said.He said the sectors most likely to gain from the ECB move would be ""anything that benefits from a stronger European economy,"" with bank and other cyclical stocks leading.Banks led gains on Thursday with the S&P 500 financials  up 2.45 percent.

134,"  * Indexes on track to break three-week streak of losses* GE shares edge up after results, Starbucks rallies* Oil higher, but on track for another negative week* Futures up: Dow 34 pts, S&P 2 pts, Nasdaq 3.5 ptsBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Jan 23 U.S. stock index futures edged up on Friday, following a sharp rally in the previous session that returned the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to positive territory for the year and put major indexes on track to break a three-week streak of declines.* Thursday's advance came after the European Central Bank detailed a bond-buying program to boost the region's sagging economy and fight deflation. The program was larger than expected and will last through September 2016.* The rally took the S&P 500 above its 50-day moving average, a metric of near-term momentum that the benchmark index hasn't closed above since Jan. 8. * With the ECB stimulus details known, U.S. corporate earnings will likely be the primary driver of trading over the next few weeks. With 15 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, 73.7 percent have topped earnings expectations while 53.9 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue.* General Electric Co posted a rise in fourth-quarter earnings, boosted by its power-generating turbines and jet engines divisions, though sales fell in its oil and gas unit.  Shares of the Dow component rose 0.5 percent before the bell.* Starbucks Corp rose in premarket trading a day after the coffee chain reported same-store sales growth that was better than expected in its Americas region. * Crude oil prices will continue to be in focus, with additional uncertainty coming in the wake of the death of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah. While the country's oil policies are expected to be unchanged, the commodity has been extremely volatile of late, with its value dropping by more than half over the past six months. Oil rose 1 percent Friday but is on track for its 15th negative week out of the past 17.* While the drop in crude prices is seen pressuring the profits of energy shares this quarter, it could lift stocks in the transportation, retail and industrial sectors.* For the week, the Dow is up 1.7 percent, the S&P 500 is up 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq is up 2.5 percent. All three are coming off three straight negative weeks.Futures snapshot at 6:49 a.m.: * S&P 500 e-minis were up 2 points, or 0.1 percent, with 110,429 contracts changing hands.* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.5 points, or 0.08 percent, in volume of 17,603 contracts.* Dow e-minis were up 34 points, or 0.19 percent, with 16,275 contracts changing hands.(Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2015-01-23,SBUX,"Fri Jan 23, 2015 | 7:04am EST","US STOCKS-Futures tick up after rally, indexes set for strong week",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-usa-idUSL1N0V20L920150123?type=companyNews
135,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Wednesday that its 12,123 U.S. shops would begin offering coconut milk on Feb. 17, as it seeks to keep pace with soaring demand for non-dairy and non-soy milk alternatives.  Starbucks began offering soy milk in 1997. Consumer tastes have since evolved, driving strong demand for other non-dairy  alternatives made from products such as coconuts, hemp, rice, almonds and other nuts. The move from the world's biggest coffee chain also comes as smaller rivals such as Peet's Coffee and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf also offer non-soy dairy milk alternatives.    Starbucks declined to name its coconut milk supplier. As it does with soy milk, Starbucks will add a 60 cent charge to drinks made with coconut milk. U.S. retail sales of non-dairy, non-soy milk alternatives are expected to nearly double to almost $2.4 billion by 2019, according to research firm Euromonitor International. Those gains appear to be coming at the expense of cow and soy milk. Euromonitor expects U.S. dairy milk sales, which were $14.7 billion in 2014, to fall about 11 percent to around $13.2 billion by 2019.   Soy milk sales, which hit $577 million last year, are expected to drop 30 percent from that level in 2019, according to Euromonitor. (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles.

141,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Bill Rigby | LOS ANGELES/SEATTLE  LOS ANGELES/SEATTLE Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Howard Schultz has deftly navigated thorny issues such as gay marriage, gun control and Congressional gridlock, but his move to weigh in on U.S. race relations has brewed up a social media backlash.The world's biggest coffee chain kicked off the discussion when it published full-page ads in major U.S. newspapers earlier this week with the words ""Shall We Overcome?"" at center page and ""RaceTogether"" and the Starbucks logo near the bottom. Employees behind the counter were also given the option of writing ""Race Together"" on customers' coffee cups to help initiate dialog amid simmering racial tensions in the United States. The issue flared following the August shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old male by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, and reignited with the subsequent police-involved deaths of other unarmed black men in New York City, Madison, Wisconsin, and elsewhere. The campaign, however, has been met with snark and skepticism on social media, with many complaining the company was overstepping it boundaries with a campaign on sensitive cultural topics that had no place in the coffee shop's lines.

""Because we're willing to jump into the deep end of the pool ... I think others will follow us.""

148,"  (Adds Starbucks comment)By Jim FinkleBOSTON, March 17 Health insurer Premera Blue Cross said on Tuesday it was a victim of a cyberattack that may have exposed medical data and financial information of 11 million customers, in the latest serious breach disclosed by a healthcare company.Premera said the attackers may have gained access to claims data, including clinical information, along with banking account numbers, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data in an attack that began in May 2014.It is the largest breach reported to date involving patient medical information, according to Dave Kennedy, an expert in healthcare security who is chief executive of TrustedSEC LLC.About 6 million of the people whose accounts were accessed are residents of Washington state, where customers include employees of Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp  and Starbucks Corp, according to Premera. The rest are scattered across every U.S. state. The insurer said it has so far uncovered no evidence to show that member data was ""used inappropriately.""Medical records are highly valuable on underground criminal exchanges where stolen data is sold because the information is not only highly confidential but can also be used to engage in insurance fraud.""Medical records paint a really personal picture of somebody's life and medical procedures,"" Kennedy said. ""They allow you to perpetrate really in-depth medical fraud."" A Starbucks spokesman told Reuters that Premera notified the coffee chain on Tuesday that Starbucks may have been affected by the attack. A representatives from Amazon did not respond to requests for comment, and a representative at Microsoft declined comment.Although a breach at Anthem disclosed earlier this year and another large one disclosed last year by hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc involved larger numbers of records, those companies said they believed the attackers did not access medical information.The Premera breach was uncovered on Jan. 29, the day that insurer Anthem Inc disclosed a cyber attack involving records of some 79 million members in Blue Cross Blue Shield plans across the country. Premera spokesman Eric Earling said the two attacks were unrelated and that his company independently identified its breach.Still, experts expect that other healthcare companies will find that they have been breached as the latest attack prompts them to look for intrusions.""I think other insurance providers are compromised today and we still don't know it. More and more are going to disclose attacks,"" Kennedy said.Premera hired FireEye Inc to investigate the matter and is also working with the FBI.The attack affected Premera Blue Cross, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, and affiliated brands Vivacity and Connexion Insurance Solutions.

But JD.com still trails far behind Alibaba in Chinese e-commerce. Alibaba's high profile since its record-breaking $25 billion U.S. listing in September is a huge lure for brands looking to enter or raise their presence in China, which some analysts estimate as the world's biggest online shopping market.""Imported goods have always been huge sellers on JD.com, and this massively expands the range of products available to Chinese consumers,"" said Leo Li, who oversees JD Worldwide, in an e-mail to Reuters.

We're playing the long game with our partners."" JD.com, backed by Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings Ltd , also said it launched with eBay Inc a programme to allow Chinese shoppers to buy select goods from U.S. eBay sellers.A spokeswoman for eBay confirmed the partnership.Shares of JD.com, which markets itself as a seller of authentic goods, have risen 44 percent since the beginning of the year. Alibaba's stock price, on the other hand, has fallen 18 percent in the same period.Analysts have expressed concern over counterfeits on the world's largest e-commerce firm's platforms, as well as lacklustre earnings and investor excitement wearing off after the initial public offering.

In January, Starbucks had said it had locked in prices for 94 percent of its 2015 coffee needs.  Maw said this resulted in coffee costs for fiscal 2015 that were below average market prices.""Our coffee team's patience around coffee pricing paid off,"" he said, noting that the company's buying team waited out spikes above $1.90 a lb.

That included a 2 percent increase in traffic, which was an acceleration from the 1 percent gain posted in the prior quarter.Shares in Starbucks were up $2.19 to $51.62 on the news.

169,"  (Adds details)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS May 5 EU regulators will miss a June deadline to decide whether tax deals granted by individual member states to companies including Apple and Starbucks are legal because they lack some data, the EU's antitrust chief said on Tuesday.The investigations launched last year centre on Luxembourg's tax rulings for carmaker Fiat Chrysler and online retailer Amazon, as well as coffee chain Starbucks Corp's deal with the Netherlands and iPhone maker Apple's Irish arrangements, and whether they are paying a fair share of tax.European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who had previously set a second quarter deadline for her decision, said it was taking longer than expected to get the relevant information. ""It is clear that obtaining information is both challenging and time consuming. We do not necessarily get the information the first time or the second time. Therefore we will not meet the first deadline to be done by the end of the second quarter. We will do our best,"" Vestager told lawmakers in the European Parliament.""I will not give deadlines for the finalisation of these cases,"" she added. The European Commission can order authorities to recover unfair state aid, which in the case of the four companies could run to millions of euros. Apple in a regulatory filing last week said a negative decision could have a material impact.Vestager said Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic have yet to provide details of the companies granted tax rulings between 2010 to 2013. The EU competition authority asked all 28 EU countries for information on the issue in December last year as part of a broader probe into corporate tax avoidance.Vestager said she was reviewing the information provided by trade unions accusing U.S. fastfood chain McDonald's of avoiding taxes in a deal with Luxembourg to see whether it merited an investigation.The Commission is also investigating Belgium's tax arrangements for multinationals.

177,"  (Adds link to graphic, analyst comment)June 8 McDonald's Corp posted a smaller-than-expected drop in worldwide sales at established restaurants in May after a lift from value meal deals in Europe helped offset continued weakness in the United States, its top market for profit.The world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue is fighting to lure back customers lost to slower service, more nimble rivals and increasing consumer demand for fresh, less-processed food.Shares of the world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue inched up 0.2 percent to $95.39 in midday trading.Global sales at McDonald's restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in May, marking a full year of monthly sales declines. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a decline of 0.9 percent. European sales were up a better-then-expected 2.3 percent.The biggest boost came from the United Kingdom, which served up strong results from its ""Great Taste of America"" campaign, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a client note.Germany and France each were up slightly after promoting ""everyday value"" and premium food. Analysts had expected sales in Europe to rise just 0.6 percent. U.S. same-restaurant sales disappointed, dropping 2.2 percent in May. Traffic to its domestic restaurants fell again as rivals, ranging from sandwich chain Chick-fil-A to burrito seller Chipotle Mexican Grill, continued to pick off customers. Analysts had expected a decline of 1.7 percent.McDonald's USA is running a variety of tests aimed at luring back customers. Those tests include extended breakfast hours, custom burgers and new food such as breakfast bowls made with kale and spinach. Frustrated franchisees are clamoring for the company to trim and simplify its massive menu, which they blame for service slow-downs that turn off diners. May sales were off 3.2 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region, less than analysts' estimate for a 3.8 percent drop. Japan and China, which are still grappling with fallout from food safety scandals, weighed on APMEA results.McDonald's new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook recently said the fast-food giant would join other companies that only report quarterly same-store sales. June will be the final monthly sales report for the chain.Most major U.S. restaurants and retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Starbucks Corp, report only monthly same-store sales.Those companies say monthly sales reports add costs and put too much emphasis on short-term performance.

Same-store sales jumped a bigger-than-expected 8 percent in the Americas unit for the fiscal third quarter ended June 28. New drinks like the ""Flat White"" and the limited-time ""S'mores Frappuccino"" as well as breakfast sandwiches and bistro boxes helped perk up sales in the region.  Starbucks' Americas unit, which includes the United States, Canada and Latin America, contributes the majority of company revenue.Starbucks said its new mobile order and pay technology is boosting sales and profit at the roughly 4,000 U.S. cafes where it has been introduced. The technology has the potential to lure in customers who may have been turned off by long lines and waiting times.  ""In those stores where mobile order and pay has been deployed, lines are shorter, service is faster and in-store operations are more efficient,"" said Chief Executive Howard Schultz, who added that the service will be available nationwide in time for the important winter holiday season.Starbucks is also testing smaller-format express stores and delivery in the United States.

Seattle-based Starbucks separately said its board had  authorized the buy back of an additional 50 million shares under its ongoing stock repurchase program.

200,"   By Rodrigo Campos  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their largest weekly drops since March on Friday as slowing global growth dragged commodity-related stocks lower while an earnings-fueled drop in Biogen took down the biotech sector.Biogen (BIIB.O) more than halved its revenue growth forecast for 2015 and its stock lost 22 percent to close just above $300. Stocks in the energy and materials sectors weighed heavily on the market after weaker-than-expected economic data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth. Oil prices hit their lowest since March.""You got underwhelming revenue growth on balance and then you layer on top of that concern over a global economic slowdown, that becomes self-fulfilling,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said of the stock market weakness.Amazon (AMZN.O) was the bright spot on Friday, rising more than 20 percent at one point and closing up 10 percent at $530.50. The online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit and its market cap ballooned to $247 billion, making it the tenth-largest U.S. company by market value.However, Amazon's spike highlighted the thinning of leadership in the S&P 500. Gains on the index so far this year can be attributed to Amazon and just three more companies. At the close of trading on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 163.39 points, or 0.92 percent, to 17,568.53, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 22.5 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,079.65 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 57.78 points, or 1.12 percent, to 5,088.63.For the week, the S&P fell 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq slid 2.3 percent in their largest weekly drops since the last week of March. The 2.9 percent fall on the Dow was the largest for any week since January. Selling in stocks accelerated after a report from the Wall Street Journal said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments. Second-quarter S&P 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts' profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months' earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.Dow component Visa (V.N) ended up 4.3 percent at $74.80 after the credit and debit card company's results handily beat expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,246 to 831, for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,144 issues fell and 660 advanced for a 3.25-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 13 new 52-week highs and 54 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 200 new lows.Some 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.6 billion so far this month.

The jump catapulted Amazon's market value to about $270 billion, overtaking Wal-Mart.Metal prices hit multi-year lows as weaker-than-expected data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth while oil prices neared four-month lows. The three major indexes were poised to end the week in the red as Biogen's 19 percent slump weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 and dragged down other health stocks.Adding to the day's pressure, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments, the Wall Street Journal reported.Second-quarter S&P 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts' profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.RBC Capital Markets said investors were treating disappointing stocks harshly. While only 20 percent of companies have missed expectations, below the 23 percent over the past three years, there was a 3.5 percent selloff versus the 2.4 percent seen historically, a note said. Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months' earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.""We are not going to see a lot of earnings growth in the second half of the year as the economic data hasn't been very strong,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.""The fall in commodities is also a concern that global growth is slowing and that ties into U.S. growth too.""Data on Friday showed new U.S. single-family home sales fell in June to their lowest level in seven months and May's sales were revised sharply lower.

206,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Olivia Oran  Aug 7 Coca-Cola Co is nearing a deal to buy a minority stake in U.S. organic juice company Suja Life LLC, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, as the soft drink giant tries to identify the next big hit with consumers.Carbonated beverages have suffered from slow growth in recent years as consumer sentiment shifts toward healthier beverages. Coca-Cola's investment would value Suja, a start-up that counts Hollywood celebrities as investors, at around $300 million, the sources said.The deal, which gives Coca-Cola the option to buy the remainder of Suja in three years, would strengthen the Atlanta-based company's hold on the cold-pressed juice sector and better position it to compete against PepsiCo Inc's  Naked Juice brands. It would be Coca-Cola's second investment in the sector, following the purchase of Odwalla in 2001. The sources asked not to be identified because the investment is not yet public. Representatives for Coca-Cola and Suja did not respond to requests for comment. Based in San Diego, Suja makes juices and smoothies under cold pressure to kill harmful bacteria and preserve nutrients and taste. It sells its drinks through SujaJuice.com, Amazon.com Inc and at health food stores and national grocery chains.Suja was founded in 2012 by entrepreneurs Annie Lawless, Eric Ethans, Jeff Church and James Brennan. Its investors include Alliance Consumer Growth Partners and Evolution Media Partners, as well as actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Jared Leto and Sofia Vergara. Coca-Cola created a venture and emerging brands division in 2007 to find and invest in growth opportunities. It has invested in firms such as Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water.Similar venture-capital style deals include Starbucks Corp's  $30 million purchase of juice company Evolution Fresh in 2011 and WhiteWave Food Co's investment in juice brand Daily Greens earlier this year.

207,"   By Lisa Baertlein  David Israel's four-year old company, Pop Gourmet, has a deal to sell snacks at Starbucks and a sought-after licensing agreement with uber-hip sriracha seller Huy Fong Foods, but it is his prison time that makes the brand stand-out in a crowded field. Starbucks Corp, which helped popularize Kind bars and other snack brands, recently began selling Pop Gourmet in 3,400 U.S. stores. The company, which sells sweet, savory and low-cal snacks, soon expects to expand its line-up of Huy Fong sriracha-flavored popcorn, potato chips and croutons with hummus and mayonnaise. It also sells Huy Fong dry seasoning in grocery stores as well as sriracha ketchup. Pop Gourmet's 2015 sales are forecast to roughly triple from around $5 million last year, said Israel, who has attracted $11 million from investors.They include former federal prosecutor Ron Neubauer, who first refused to meet with Israel, then changed his mind after reviewing his court case. Neubauer has put in $300,000 and convinced a half dozen friends to follow. ""People love the story,"" said Israel, 54, who owned a chain of pawnshops when he was ensnared in a prosecution stemming from several Seattle-area robberies in the early 1990s. Israel maintains that he was not involved. He spent several years and more than $1 million fighting the charges. In 2003, he pleaded guilty while maintaining his innocence. ""I was tapped out,"" said Israel, who since has declined Neubauer's offer to help clear his name. ""It's not where I want to focus my energy. It's part of my fabric,"" said Israel, who dreamt up his business plan while in prison. The Seattle-based snack shop debuted in June 2011 with ""the ultimate original big house,"" inspired by an inmate concoction of microwave popcorn, breakfast cereal, melted M&M's, peanut butter and marshmallows. ""People used to stand in line to get this stuff,"" said Israel, who served time from August 2003 to June 2007 and now offers jobs and guidance to former inmates.  Neubauer says he expects the company, which has nationwide grocery distribution and offers several products with sought-after natural, gluten-free and non-GMO labels, to get gobbled up by a bigger player.There were 10 merger and acquisition deals in the snack category in just the first six months of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.An initial public offering seems off the table as China's cooldown spooks U.S. markets. Still, Pop Gourmet rival Amplify Snack Brands Inc, known for its SkinnyPop product, has said it will soon be on the acquisition trail after raising $270 million in its August IPO.

208,"   By Lisa Baertlein | Sept 15  Sept 15 Yum Brands Inc's <YUM.N > Taco Bell chain next week will debut a new restaurant concept that dumps the drive-thru and brings on the booze as it seeks to appeal to hip, young city dwellers and fend off popular rival Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.The first of the chain's new Taco Bell Cantina restaurants will open in Chicago's hipster Wicker Park neighborhood on Sept. 22, with a second later this month in San Francisco.The Wicker Park restaurant will serve beer, wine, sangria and twisted freezes - frozen drinks spiked with rum, vodka or tequila. The San Francisco outlet will serve beer and wine only. The Cantina restaurants, like Chipotle's roughly 1,900 restaurants, will have open kitchens. The Cantina restaurants also will offer a tapas-style menu of shareable appetizers during designated hours each evening, in addition to the standard Taco Bell menu.Chipotle already offers alcohol at about 1,000 restaurants. Most of those sell both beer and margaritas, while some sell only beer. The move from Taco Bell comes as U.S. restaurant chains experiment with new ways to add sales and lure customers.Taco Bell, which recently had a huge hit with its Doritos Locos tacos, debuted a Chipotle-like ""Cantina"" menu a few years ago and is testing a separate urban taco concept called U.S. Taco Co in Huntington Beach, California. On other fronts, 75 Starbucks Corp cafes offer that chain's ""evenings"" menu that includes craft, local and regional beer, wine and small plates of food. Starbucks goal is to have ""evenings"" in roughly 2,000 Starbucks locations by 2019.Taco Bell, which now has more than 6,000 restaurants, plans to add 2,000 new restaurants by 2022. It did not say how many new or remodeled restaurants would become Taco Bell Cantinas.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2015-09-15,SBUX,"Tue Sep 15, 2015 | 8:00am EDT",Taco Bell joins fast-food booze bandwagon with new U.S. eateries,http://www.reuters.com//article/yum-tacobell-alcohol-idUSL1N11K2G120150915?type=companyNews
209,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Starbucks Corp on Tuesday said its sales-boosting Mobile Order & Pay service is now available in all of its nearly 7,500 U.S. company-operated shops, a nationwide roll-out completed about three months ahead of schedule.The expansion includes some 3,400 cafes - including those in major cities such as San Francisco, Boston, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. - and extends the service to Android mobile device users. Mobile Order & Pay is a feature on the Starbucks app, which the company says has 16 million active users on Apple and Android devices in the United States. Up until now, the app could only be used in-store to pay for a purchase. The new service allows users to place orders and pay for them from a remote location, and then pick up the order at the store.Adam Brotman, Starbucks' chief digital officer, said the coffee chain refined a variety of features before the expansion.  Those help customers customize food and beverage orders, check local inventories for the availability of product and accurately calculate pick-up times. ""We're hearing (from users) that is creating a whole bunch of new occasions"" to visit Starbucks, Brotman said. In particular, he said, it makes it easier for time-crunched workers and parents to drop in and for speech- and hearing-impaired customers to customize orders. Starbucks, which declined to say how much the new feature has increased sales, plans to introduce it in select company-owned stores in the United Kingdom and Canada in October, Brotman said. Licensed stores in places such as restaurants, hotels and transit stations in the United States and elsewhere will follow.At the end of the latest quarter, Starbucks had          7,457 company-operated stores in the United States, as well as 1,006 in Canada and 476 in the United Kingdom. It had 4,888 licensed stores in the United States.Starbucks tested Mobile Order & Pay in Portland, Oregon, last December. It released it across the Pacific Northwest in March and gradually expanded its reach.  In July, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said Mobile Order & Pay was bolstering sales and profit at the roughly 4,000 U.S. cafes where it was available. He said the  technology had the potential to lure customers who may have been turned off by long lines and waiting times.""Lines are shorter, service is faster and in-store operations are more efficient"" at cafes where the service is available, Schultz said at the time.

210,"   By Francesco Guarascio | BRUSSELS, Sept 22  BRUSSELS, Sept 22 Finance ministers of euro zone's major economies renewed on Tuesday their commitment to curb multinational corporations' tax avoidance and called for more consistent rules to reduce ""harmful"" tax competition.Multinational companies have long been in the sights of European Union authorities because of the way they can legally reduce their bills by basing themselves in low-tax centres.Ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Spain agreed that more coordination at EU level are needed to prevent corporations from shifting profits to countries where they pay lower taxes.""We need collective rules to tackle harmful tax competition and aggressive tax planning,"" French finance minister Michel Sapin told European lawmakers in a joint hearing in the EU Parliament in Brussels.His call was echoed by his counterparts from Germany, Italy and Spain. ""Harmful tax competition increases profits in one state but compromises them in other states, preventing them from getting legitimate tax revenues,"" Italy's finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan said. These calls come as Europe's Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is urging EU finance ministers to agree on sharing information about specific arrangements with corporations, known as tax rulings, at their next regular meeting on October 5.Tax rulings provide companies with information about their future tax bills when they settle in a country. ""This in itself is neither illegal nor problematic but, if misused, tax rulings can facilitate or even encourage aggressive tax planning, resulting in a serious loss of revenue for member states,"" Moscovici said in his blog.The EU is investigating the tax arrangements of Amazon  and Fiat in Luxembourg, Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands and may start new investigations.""Tax rulings should no longer be implemented to allow harmful tax planning,"" German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers in the joint conference organised by a special committee set up in the European Parliament to tackle harmful tax rulings. As a disincentive against future aggressive tax deals, Moscovici wants states to set up a mechanism next year to  automatically exchange data on deals struck with corporations. He is also pushing for the disclosure of arrangements made up to at least 5 years ago.The Commission, the EU executive, also plans to launch a new proposal next year on a ""common consolidated corporate tax base"" (CCCTB) for multinational companies.The plan will have a first phase where only a common tax base would be introduced.

211,"  (Adds details on cafe counts and expansion plans, byline)By Lisa BaertleinLOS ANGELES, Sept 22 Starbucks Corp on Tuesday said its sales-boosting Mobile Order & Pay service is now available in all of its nearly 7,500 U.S. company-operated shops, a nationwide roll-out completed about three months ahead of schedule.The expansion includes some 3,400 cafes - including those in major cities such as San Francisco, Boston, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. - and extends the service to Android mobile device users.Mobile Order & Pay is a feature on the Starbucks app, which the company says has 16 million active users on Apple and Android devices in the United States. Up until now, the app could only be used in-store to pay for a purchase. The new service allows users to place orders and pay for them from a remote location, and then pick up the order at the store. Adam Brotman, Starbucks' chief digital officer, said the coffee chain refined a variety of features before the expansion.  Those help customers customize food and beverage orders, check local inventories for the availability of product and accurately calculate pick-up times.""We're hearing (from users) that is creating a whole bunch of new occasions"" to visit Starbucks, Brotman said. In particular, he said, it makes it easier for time-crunched workers and parents to drop in and for speech- and hearing-impaired customers to customize orders. Starbucks, which declined to say how much the new feature has increased sales, plans to introduce it in select company-owned stores in the United Kingdom and Canada in October, Brotman said. Licensed stores in places such as restaurants, hotels and transit stations in the United States and elsewhere will follow.At the end of the latest quarter, Starbucks had          7,457 company-operated stores in the United States, as well as 1,006 in Canada and 476 in the United Kingdom. It had 4,888 licensed stores in the United States.Starbucks tested Mobile Order & Pay in Portland, Oregon, last December. It released it across the Pacific Northwest in March and gradually expanded its reach.In July, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz said Mobile Order & Pay was bolstering sales and profit at the roughly 4,000 U.S. cafes where it was available.

217,"   By P.J. Huffstutter | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 1 Starbucks Corp will switch to using only eggs laid by cage-free chickens at its North American locations within five years, the company told Reuters on Thursday.The company said it has been steadily working on making the switch since it began buying cage-free eggs in 2008.The pledge follows similar moves by McDonald's Corp, Burger King Corp and food services company Sodexo SA . It is happening as North American egg suppliers are slowly starting to rebuild flocks after the worst bird flu outbreak in U.S. history. ""While there is still work to be done across the industry to increase supply to address market conditions, we are committed to working with our suppliers toward our goal to be 100 percent cage-free by 2020,"" Starbucks said in a statement.Cage-free eggs are produced by hens free to moved around inside a barn, as opposed to conventional eggs produced by hens that are packed in cages with other bird. The overall shift to phase out eggs laid by caged hens is expected to increase competition for limited supplies of cage-free eggs. It carries higher costs that may, at least initially, sting farmers. Starbucks set the 2020 deadline last Friday, when it updated its ""Animal Welfare-Friendly Practices"" on its company web site, a company official said.The Starbucks updated practices document can be found at: here(Reporting by P.J.

232,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of Starbucks Corporation (Starbucks; NASDAQ: SBUX) to 'A/F1' from  'A-/F2'. Fitch has also assigned an 'A' rating to the company's new bank credit  facility. The Ratings Outlook is Stable. A full list of Starbucks' ratings is  provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade reflects that Starbucks has exceeded Fitch's expectations related to  top line growth and margins while consistently maintaining strong credit  metrics. Moreover, the company continues to generate industry leading comparable  sales and good operating cash flow growth. For the year ended Sept. 27, 2015,  lease-adjusted leverage was 2.0x, down from 2.2x at the end of fiscal 2013. FCF  (CFO less capex and dividends) was approximately $1.5 billion or about 8% of  revenue. Fitch expects total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR (defined as  total debt plus 8x gross rent-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rent) to  approximate current levels in fiscal 2016 and 2017 while FCF is projected to  exceed $1 billion in both years. Robust Operating Trends Starbucks robust operating trends are being enabled by mid to high single-digit  comp growth, increased points of distribution as the company opens new units and  expands via the grocery channel, and effective management of coffee cost over  90% of fiscal 2016 requirements currently locked in at slightly favorable  year-over-year prices. Starbucks is also successfully executing a five-year plan  detailed in December 2014. The plan entails increasing annual revenue to nearly  $30 billion and expanding margins by slowing G&A expense growth and reducing the  run-rate of cost of goods sold by a cumulative $1 billion.  Global comparable sales (comps) have risen 5% or more for 23 consecutive  quarters and net units have increased at a high single-digit rate. Comps  increased 7% in the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, 2015 with transactions up 3% and  average ticket rising 4%. Cash flow from operations has increased at a 17% CAGR  since 2010 to $3.7 billion in 2015 due mainly to double-digit operating earnings  growth and margin expansion.  Balanced Financial Strategy Starbucks has maintained strong financial discipline. Cash flow priorities are  to invest in its business and return cash to shareholders. The company has  maintained a dividend pay out to earnings in line with its 35% - 45% target and  has been prudent with share repurchases, funding buybacks mainly with internally  generated cash.  Strong Brand Equity, Leadership Starbucks market leadership in coffee, highly-respected brands, growing food,  tea and juice menu offerings, and ability to engage customers with the My  Starbucks Rewards program and mobile payment systems should help the company  continue to generate mid to high single-digit comp growth over the near-term.  Moreover, increased distribution within grocery and other retail outlets helps  strengthen Starbucks brand equity and customer loyalty. Food currently  represents approximately 20% of sales in U.S. stores and is contributing 2% - 3%  to comps. The company rolled out the final phase of Mobile Order & Pay  nationally across company-owned stores in September 2015 and expects to continue  to deploy the capability in key markets globally. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions are as follows: --Revenue grows 11% - 12% in 2016 and 2017 driven by 6% - 7% comps and  high-single-digit net unit growth; --Modest EBITDA margin expansion in fiscal 2016 and 2017 due to gross margin  expansion and slightly lower G&A expenses; --Annual free cash flow (FCF) exceeds $1.0 billion annually; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR remains stable in the 2.0x range in  2016 and 2017.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action in the near term is not anticipated. However, a public  commitment to maintaining total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR in the  mid-1.0x range and a continuation of currently strong operating trends could  result in an upgrade.  A negative rating action would be considered if total adjusted debt-to-operating  EBITDAR is sustained above the 2.0-2.2x range due to a more aggressive financial  strategy, meaningful deceleration in comp growth, or material margin  contraction. Materially lower than expected FCF could also contribute to a  negative action. LIQUIDITY Starbucks had an estimated $2.4 billion of liquidity at Sept. 27, 2015  consisting of $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments and full  availability under a $750 million revolver expiring January 2020. Starbucks  increased the size of its revolver to $1.5 billion in November 2015. The terms  of the new facility, which is scheduled to expire Nov. 6, 2020, are  substantially the same as the old facility, including a minimum fixed charge  coverage ratio of 2.5x. Amounts outstanding under the company's $1 billion  commercial paper (CP) program are backstopped by available commitments under the  revolver. There was no CP outstanding at Sept. 27, 2015.  At Sept. 27, 2015, approximately 50% of Starbucks cash and investments were held  in foreign subsidiaries. Fitch generally views offshore cash as not readily  accessible due to a general reluctance at many firms to repatriate because of  incremental tax cost. However, Starbucks utilized a significant portion of its  offshore cash to finance the acquisition of the remaining 60.5% share of its  Japanese joint venture during fiscal 2015. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has upgraded Starbucks' ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'A' from 'A-'; --Short-term IDR to 'F1' from 'F2'; --Commercial paper to 'F1' from 'F2'. Fitch has also assigned an 'A' rating to Starbucks' new bank credit facility. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

236,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Dec 8 Taking coffee maker Keurig Green Mountain Inc private will give JAB Holding Co an opportunity to press for higher margins and even increase prices for the single-serve K-Cups used in about 21 million U.S. homes, analysts and industry bankers said.JAB said on Monday it would buy Keurig for $13.9 billion, its biggest acquisition in a quest to build a global coffee powerhouse to better compete with Switzerland's Nestle SA . The announcement prompted comparisons on Wall Street between JAB's strategy and that of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev , though some industry watchers were sobered by the high price paid for Keurig, which is struggling with competition in single-serve pods and a failed product launch.While some of the more immediate benefits of a deal would come from JAB's heightened leverage in sourcing coffee beans, the bigger opportunity lies in the greater profit of distributing JAB's expanding portfolio of brands, including higher-end ""craft"" names like Peet's Coffee & Tea, Caribou and Stumptown Coffee Roasters, analysts and bankers said.Some of those brands already produce K-Cups for Keurig machines under licensing agreements, but as company-owned brands those arrangements would provide higher margins.Overall, Keurig's dominance of the U.S. single-serve market is a clear competitive advantage, said Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Athlos Research. ""They (JAB) can handle the brand strategy, the partner strategy, any way they want.""JAB could also raise prices on pods, especially since Keurig will be privately held and face far fewer requirements to disclose how it runs its business, Feeney said. As a result, partners who have licensing agreements with Keurig to make the pods, such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin' Brands Group , would not know how much Keurig is making from those deals and could find it harder to demand a greater cut. FILTER OR ESPRESSO? Whether Keurig will help JAB make greater inroads in Europe at the expense of Nestle remains a question, industry experts said, particularly in the single-serve market where Nestle serves espresso-style drinks rather than the American-style K-Cup which more closely resembles filter coffee. ""I suspect they would need a modified machine,"" said Robert Waldschmidt, a research analyst at investment bank Liberum.Others see room for more filter-style coffee in Europe.""Every meeting you go to, there is still a pot of coffee on the table that's not espresso,"" said one industry banker who was not involved in the deal. ""There's a lot of people drinking Americanos in Europe. There should be a market for this machine."" While significant risk exists that brands like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts could cut ties with Keurig once it is owned by JAB and opt for other partners to manufacture branded pods, analysts and bankers said it was unlikely.""These are significant streams of cash flow to these companies,"" Feeney said. ""It's not trivial for them to say 'OK we'll just do this ourselves.'""Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment.

241,"  Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) forecast current-quarter earnings below Wall Street estimates and reported slower growth in Asia than many had hoped, sending its shares down nearly 4 percent in extended trade despite a strong holiday performance.   Investor expectations are usually high for the company after a more than 46 percent run-up in its stock in 2015, and Starbucks is betting heavily on China expansion despite some signs of cooling growth in the Asian market.The company's shares slipped to $56.35 in extended trade from a close of $59.03.Global sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 8 percent in the first quarter, while it rose 9 percent in the Americas division, its largest. Both handily beat analysts' estimates.But sales in Europe were hit on a drop in tourists following the November Paris attacks and the strong dollar, which also hurt sales in its Asia/Pacific region, Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson said on an earnings call.Sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 5 percent in Asia/Pacific in the first quarter ended Dec. 27, missing the 6.10 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. ""The concern is that some of this is related to a general slowdown in China which, if part of a longer term trend, could harm company earnings,"" Carter Harrison, analyst at research firm Conlumino said.

242,"  Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) forecast current-quarter earnings below Wall Street estimates and reported slower growth in Asia than many had hoped, sending its shares down nearly 4 percent in extended trade despite a strong holiday performance.   Investor expectations are usually high for the company after a more than 46 percent run-up in its stock in 2015, and Starbucks is betting heavily on China expansion despite some signs of cooling growth in the Asian market.The company's shares slipped to $56.35 in extended trade from a close of $59.03.Global sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 8 percent in the first quarter, while it rose 9 percent in the Americas division, its largest. Both handily beat analysts' estimates.But sales in Europe were hit on a drop in tourists following the November Paris attacks and the strong dollar, which also hurt sales in its Asia/Pacific region, Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson said on an earnings call.Sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 5 percent in Asia/Pacific in the first quarter ended Dec. 27, missing the 6.10 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.

248,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to  Starbucks Corporation's (Starbucks; NASDAQ: SBUX) proposed $500 million  aggregate issuance of fixed-rate five-year senior unsecured notes. At Dec. 27,  2015, Starbucks had approximately $2.3 billion of total debt. A full list of  Starbucks' ratings is provided at the end of this release. The notes will be issued under Starbucks' Aug. 23, 2007 indenture and will rank  equally with existing senior unsecured debt. Terms include a change of control  triggering event provision. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS Robust Operating Trends:  Starbucks robust operating trends are being enabled by mid to high single-digit  comp growth, increased points of distribution as the company opens new units and  expands via the grocery channel, and effective management of coffee costs.  Starbucks has locked in nearly all of its 2016 coffee needs at slightly  favorable year-over-year prices and is beginning to price its needs for 2017.  Global comparable sales (comps) have risen 5% or more for six consecutive years,  and net units have increased at a high single-digit rate. Comps increased 8% in  the first quarter ended Dec. 27, 2015 with transactions up 4% and average ticket  rising 4%. Fitch projects comps will increase 7% in fiscal 2016. Balanced Financial Strategy:  Starbucks has maintained strong financial discipline. Cash flow priorities are  to invest in its business and return cash to shareholders. The company has  maintained a dividend pay out to earnings in line with its 35% - 45% target and  has been prudent with share repurchases, funding buybacks mainly with internally  generated cash.  Starbucks good operating performance and balanced financial strategy has  resulted in strong credit metrics that are in line with Fitch's expectations.  For the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended Dec. 27, 2015, total adjusted  debt/operating EBITDAR (defined as total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating  EBITDA plus gross rents) was 2.0x and operating EBITDAR/gross interest expense  plus rent was 4.7x. Fitch expects leverage to remain near current levels for  fiscal 2016.  Strong Brand Equity, Leadership Starbucks market leadership in coffee, highly-respected brands, growing food,  tea and juice menu offerings, and ability to engage customers with the My  Starbucks Rewards program and mobile payment systems should help the company  continue to generate mid to high single-digit comp growth over the near-term.  Moreover, increased distribution within grocery and other retail outlets helps  strengthen Starbucks brand equity and customer loyalty. Food currently  represents approximately 20% of sales in U.S. stores and is contributing 2% - 3%  to comps. The company rolled out the final phase of Mobile Order & Pay  nationally across company-owned stores in September 2015 and expects to continue  to deploy the capability in key markets globally. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Starbucks include: --Revenue grows 11% - 12% in 2016 and 2017 driven by 6% - 7% comps and  high-single-digit net unit growth; --Modest EBITDA margin expansion in fiscal 2016 and 2017 due to higher gross  margins and slightly lower G&A expenses; --Annual free cash flow (FCF) exceeds $1 billion annually; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR remains stable in the 2.0x range in  2016 and 2017.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action in the near term is not anticipated. However, a public  commitment to maintaining total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR in the  mid-1.0x range and a continuation of currently strong operating trends could  result in an upgrade.  A negative rating action would be considered if total adjusted debt-to-operating  EBITDAR is sustained above the 2.0-2.2x range due to a more aggressive financial  strategy, meaningful deceleration in comp growth, or material margin  contraction. Materially lower than expected FCF could also contribute to a  negative action. LIQUIDITY Starbucks had an estimated $3.9 billion of liquidity at Dec. 27, 2015 consisting  of $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and full availability under a  $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Nov. 6, 2020. Approximately $1.3  billion or 48% of Starbucks cash and investments, which totalled $2.7 billion,  was held in foreign subsidiaries. Terms of the facility include a minimum fixed  charge coverage ratio of 2.5x. Amounts outstanding under the company's $1  billion commercial paper (CP) program are backstopped by available commitments  under the revolver. At Dec. 27, 2015, there was no CP outstanding.  FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch currently rates Starbucks Corporation as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default (IDR) 'A'; --Bank credit facility 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'.

249,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly net revenue on Thursday as higher sales of snacks and non-fizzy beverages such as Gatorade in North America helped reduce the impact of a strong dollar.PepsiCo increased its annual dividend to $3.01 per share from $2.81 and said it would return about $7 billion to shareholders this year, with about $3 billion through buybacks.However, the company forecast 2016 adjusted earnings below many analyst estimates, citing a strong dollar and the exclusion of its Venezuelan business from its financial statements.Revenue from PepsiCo's North American beverages business rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, accounting for 31.5 percent of total revenue.Wells Fargo Securities said in a pre-earnings note that its research showed that PepsiCo's beverage sales in U.S. convenience stores rose 3.2 percent in the quarter, helped by aggressive pricing and ""solid"" sales of Gatorade and Starbucks (SBUX.O) ready-to-drink coffee, which Pepsi distributes.PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said warmer-than-usual weather also helped the company's drinks business.""Gatorade does well when the temperature's above normal,"" she said on a conference call with analysts.Higher prices and reduced pack sizes helped boost revenue by 2 percent in the company's North America snack foods business, which includes Frito-lay and Doritos chips. ""Pricing in North America is a key bright spot for PEP,"" Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic wrote in a note.PepsiCo, whose shares were down 1.3 percent at $96.33 in morning trading, reduced the size of its Frito's promotional potato chip bags in the United States last year, but retained pricing.Traditional rival Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit on Tuesday, helped by sales of smaller cans and bottles, aggressive cost-cutting and lower commodity costs.Frito-Lay North America and the North America beverage business were the only two PepsiCo units to report higher revenue in the quarter. Net income attributable to PepsiCo rose 31 percent to $1.72 billion, or $1.17 per share in the period.Excluding items, the company earned $1.06 per share, in line with analysts estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net revenue fell 7 percent to $18.59 billion, but beat analysts average estimate of $18.51 billion.PepsiCo forecast 2016 adjusted earnings of $4.66 per share. This was short of the average I/B/E/S estimate of $4.76, although it was not immediately clear if the figures were strictly comparable.PepsiCo said it expected organic revenue growth of about 4 percent in 2016.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Graphic:  Coca-Cola and Pepsico earnings    (here)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Ted Kerr)",2016-02-11,SBUX,"Thu Feb 11, 2016 | 10:30am EST",UPDATE 4-PepsiCo revenue beats estimates as sales rise in North America,http://www.reuters.com//article/pepsico-results-idUSL3N15Q2OU?type=companyNews

The new program will award points for every dollar spent, a change that is sure to spark complaints from customers who are used to accumulating points with frequent purchases of drip coffee and other lower-cost items from the Seattle-based chain.The widely anticipated change to the Starbucks Rewards program in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico comes as airlines and other companies have been tweaking their rewards programs to make them generally less-generous to consumers. Starbucks customers now earn one ""star"" per purchase and may redeem 12 stars for a free food and drink item. Starting in mid-April, customers will get two stars for every $1 spent but need 125 stars to get a free item. Matthew Ryan, Starbucks global chief strategy officer, said the change was not a way to weaken Starbucks' rewards program. The vast majority of Starbucks customers will earns rewards at the same pace they do today and the total percentage of revenue that Starbucks will provide as rewards will remain constant, Ryan said.  However, he acknowledged that the change will affect a small minority of the more than 11 million active users of Starbucks' reward program. About 1 percent of the chain's total transactions now come from ""check-splitters,"" customers who request two or more transactions in a single visit to earn stars more quickly, Ryan said.

261,"   By Maria Sheahan | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Dunkin' Donuts is on a drive to win customers from Starbucks after the rival coffee and snacks chain changed its loyalty scheme to favor higher spending customers over frequent buyers. Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), told Reuters he expected some Starbucks (SBUX.O) customers to be angered by the move, creating an opportunity for his company's doughnut and coffee shops to win them over. ""We feel excited about the change to Starbucks' loyalty program,"" he said in an interview during a trip to Frankfurt.""We've been targeting customers with $5 gift cards,"" he added, while declining to quantify the possible impact on the Dunkin' Donuts business.Under Starbucks' previous rewards program, customers earned redeemable points for every purchase, whereas the new program awards points for every dollar spent, putting customers who buy cheaper items at a disadvantage. Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said after Starbucks' announcement last month that its customers would have to spend $62.50 to receive their first beverage reward, compared with $40 under Dunkin' Donuts' loyalty program.He estimates customer defections from Starbucks could add roughly 0.25 to 0.4 percentage points to sales growth at Dunkin' Donuts, excluding new outlets. That would be a welcome boost for Dunkin' Donuts, which saw same-store sales in the United States slip by 0.8 percent last quarter, as the launch of all-day breakfast by McDonald's (MCD.N) and value-meal offers by rivals lured customers away.British-born Travis, who previously held executive positions at video rental chain Blockbuster and pizza group Papa John's (PZZA.O), also said his group was eyeing growth in Europe.The Canton, Massachusetts-based company added a net 55 Dunkin' Donuts franchise stores across Europe in 2015, bringing the total there to 221. In Germany, where it has 70 outlets, Dunkin' aims to add about 20 a year, said Travis, who drinks seven cups of coffee a day.He also said he was confident Dunkin' could make its business in Britain work, where it has had a rough start after announcing in 2013 a return to the market nearly two decades after exiting.

265,"   By Joyce Lee and Hooyeon Kim | SEOUL  SEOUL South Korea's coffee shop craze is frothing over.In fashionable retail and commercial districts of southern Seoul, nearly one in every two buildings boasts a coffee shop - evidence of a boom that has delivered dizzying growth for the likes of Starbucks and local chains.But now the market is getting even more crowded, as convenience stores such as 7-Eleven offer 1,000 won (87 cents) cups, and smaller players are feeling the heat.""We declared an emergency situation, gathered all employees eight times to debate strategies,"" Moon Chang-ki, CEO of mid-priced coffee chain Ediya, the country's largest operator by location with about 1,800 stores, told reporters recently. ""If we sell at that price, our store owners won't earn any margins."" To compete, Ediya says it has instead focused on improving the quality of its coffee, and actually raised prices last year. Other chains have responded to growing competition by cutting back on store numbers and staff, or expanding overseas.The number of chain and stand-alone coffee shops in South Korea more than tripled to about 49,600 in 2015 from 12,400 in 2011, according to Korea Contents Media - far faster than overall consumption of coffee, which Koreans have been drinking for decades.With more than 17,000 coffee shops in a city of over 10 million, or about 17 per 10,000 people, Seoul has more coffee shops per capita than Starbucks' hometown Seattle, at 15 per 10,000, or San Francisco, at 14.7, according to city of Seoul data and research providers FindTheHome and FindTheCompany.PEAK COFFEE South Korea's per capita coffee consumption has nearly doubled since 1990 to 2.3 kg (5 lb) per person, according to the International Coffee Organization - still roughly half the 4.5 kg that Americans consume. Revenue growth at coffee chains in the country slowed to about 8 percent in 2014, however, from more than 20 percent annually between 2008 and 2012, analysts say. While the number of new coffee shops in Seoul increased, so did closures, according to city data.Brewed coffee sales at 7-Eleven, run by Lotte Shopping's Korea Seven Co Ltd, jumped 88 percent in 2015 after it introduced drip coffee early last year costing about a dollar, almost one-fifth the cost of an average Starbucks cup.McDonald's Corp stores cut coffee prices to 1,500 won from 2,100 won early last year, and have seen sales of the beverage almost triple, the company told Reuters.By contrast, local chain Cafe Droptop, with about 225 shops, cut about 20 percent of its workforce at the end of 2015. Another chain, Coffine Gurunaru, with about 100 shops, incurred combined operating losses of 2.5 billion won ($2.2 million) in 2013 and 2014 after being profitable in the previous two years, filings show.""Even fried chicken restaurants and pubs are adding coffee, trying to be a cafe, while espresso machines are spreading in offices,"" said Lee Kyung-hee, who heads the Korea Business Strategy Institute, a consultancy. ""The coffee industry is fighting a war without borders."" GOING ABROAD Starbucks entered the market in 1999, and is widely credited with starting the country's habit for splurging on higher-quality coffee and creating a cafe industry SK Securities said was worth about 2.5 trillion won ($2.2 billion) in 2014. Starbucks Coffee Korea, a 50-50 joint venture between the world's biggest coffee chain and South Korean hypermarket operator E-Mart, now has 860 stores, putting the country behind only China and Japan as the company's biggest markets in Asia, with sales more than doubling between 2011 and 2014.It posted a 20 percent increase in net profit to 30.77 billion won in 2014, the most recent year for which results are available, on revenue of 617 billion won, up 28 percent. But with industry growth slowing, some chains have been pushing abroad.Caffe Bene, which reached 932 domestic stores in 2014 before trimming back to 850 at the end of March, posted a 3.3 billion won net loss in the first three quarters of 2015, according to the latest public data. Last month, a joint venture between Singapore's Food Empire and Indonesia's Salim Group acquired a 38 percent stake in Caffe Bene, becoming the second biggest shareholder after South Korean private equity fund K3 Equity Partners.The chain said it was looking to expand in Southeast Asia to drive growth.Zoo Coffee, with 65 domestic shops, has opened about 200 franchise stores in China since entering the country in 2013 and in December announced a tie-up with China's giant Dalian Wanda Group to open 50 stores per year there. Cafe Droptop in November opened its first overseas outlet in Shanghai.

267,"   By Lisa Baertlein  Starbucks Corp on Thursday posted quarterly cafe sales that missed analysts' growth estimates for every region where it operates and issued a disappointing full-year forecast, sending its shares down about 4 percent.The world's largest coffee chain said global sales at cafes open at least 13 months rose 6 percent in the fiscal second quarter ended March 27, compared with the year-ago period. Analysts had expected an overall same-cafe sales gain of 6.7 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Starbucks is one of the industry's best performers, delivering steady growth by entering new markets and finding diverse ways to boost revenue. Even with the sell-off, the stock was trading at $58.20 after hours, near its all-time high of $62.57 on Oct. 1.Sales at established cafes in the Americas region grew 7 percent, after rising 9 percent in the first quarter. Starbucks, which is investing in mobile ordering and payments to win more business, recently irked some customers by tweaking its popular loyalty program to give rewards based on dollars spent rather than number of purchases.""We may see some noise in Q3 comps as customers react to the new changes of the program,"" Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson told analysts on a conference call after earnings were released. Program membership grew 16 percent year-over-year to 12 million in the United States, Starbucks said.The China/Asia Pacific region (CAP), where Starbucks has expanded aggressively in recent years, posted 3 percent sales growth.Company executives said Starbucks' China business remains strong even as the economy there cools. The inclusion of results from slower-growing Japan weighed on the results, they said. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) had sales growth of 1 percent. ""This was in an extremely challenging consumer, economic, geopolitical environment across the region,"" Johnson said.Analysts had expected gains of 4.6 percent from CAP and 3.4 percent from EMEA. Seattle-based Starbucks narrowed its full-year profit forecast to $1.88 to $1.89 per share, from a previous range of $1.87 to $1.89. Analysts' estimates were at the top end of that range, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Second-quarter net income was $575.1 million, or 39 cents per share, matching the average of analysts' profit estimates complied by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Yet, the stock is not too far from the record high it hit in October.It has risen 16 percent from its 2016 low touched on Feb. 8, staying more expensive than shares of Dunkin Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).""We remain convinced that Starbucks' digital platform, including the rapidly growing Mobile Order & Pay, continues to be a significant competitive advantage and long-term sales driver,"" BTIG analysts wrote in a note.""We see any near-term sales disruption as minor compared to the significance of the program,"" BTIG analysts wrote. Starbucks irked some customers by tweaking its popular loyalty program, giving rewards based on dollars spent rather than number of purchases.

The company gets about two-thirds of its total revenue from the region.Investors had likely expected an increase of 8 percent, Nomura analysts said.Starbucks has been investing in digital initiatives such as Mobile Order & Pay, which lets customers place orders and make payments through an app and pick their orders up from an outlet.  The bet seems to be paying off.Mobile Order & Pay usage doubled in the second quarter, with the company processing 8 million transactions per month.""We believe Starbucks mobile platform is truly in a league of its own,"" analysts at Wells Fargo Securities said.

Yet, the stock is not too far from the record high it hit in October.It has risen 16 percent from its 2016 low touched on Feb. 8, staying more expensive than shares of Dunkin Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).""We remain convinced that Starbucks' digital platform, including the rapidly growing Mobile Order & Pay, continues to be a significant competitive advantage and long-term sales driver,"" BTIG analysts wrote in a note.""We see any near-term sales disruption as minor compared to the significance of the program,"" BTIG analysts wrote. Starbucks irked some customers by tweaking its popular loyalty program, giving rewards based on dollars spent rather than number of purchases.  Growth in sales at Starbucks cafes in the Americas open for at least a year slowed to 7 percent in the quarter from 9 percent in the first quarter. The company gets about two-thirds of its total revenue from the region.Investors had likely expected an increase of 8 percent, Nomura analysts said.Starbucks has been investing in digital initiatives such as Mobile Order & Pay, which lets customers place orders and make payments through an app and pick their orders up from an outlet.  The bet seems to be paying off.Mobile Order & Pay usage doubled in the second quarter, with the company processing 8 million transactions per month.""We believe Starbucks mobile platform is truly in a league of its own,"" analysts at Wells Fargo Securities said. Consumers are increasingly using their smartphones to shop and they are eating out more regularly, and Starbucks is in a pole position to capitalize on these trends, the analysts said.Of the 29 brokerages covering Starbucks shares, 24 have a ""buy"" or higher rating, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""The court finds it probable that a significant portion of the latte-consuming public could believe that a 'Grande' contains 16 ounces of fluid."" Henderson did not rule on the case's merits. He dismissed three of the plaintiffs' eight claims against Seattle-based Starbucks, as well as their request for injunctive relief.Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges on Monday said the company believes the lawsuit is without merit and is prepared to defend itself against the remaining claims. He also said that if a customer is not satisfied with how a beverage is prepared, ""we will gladly remake it.""Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment.The case is Strumlauf et al v.

304,"  (Adds details on cafes)By Lisa Baertlein and Sruthi RamakrishnanJuly 11 Starbucks Corp will raise the wages of all workers in its U.S. stores this autumn, after being accused by employees of ""extreme"" cutbacks in work hours at its American cafes.The world's biggest coffee chain will increase base pay for all U.S. workers and store managers at company-operated stores by at least 5 percent starting Oct. 3, Chief Executive Howard Schultz said in a letter to employees on Monday.Starbucks, which recently announced price increases for some drinks, also will double the annual stock reward to hourly employees who have worked at company-operated stores for at least two years.Combined, the steps will result in a wage hike of 5 percent to 15 percent for all employees at company-operated stores, Starbucks said. More than 12,800 people, including many self-identified Starbucks workers, have signed an online petition alleging that  staffing hour reductions are battering employee morale and hurting service. Starbucks recently introduced potentially labor-saving technology that allows customers to order and pay for drinks and other products via mobile phones and other devices.Beyond worries about customer service and morale, commenters on the online petition said they were not getting enough hours to make ends meet or to afford Starbucks benefits, including healthcare and college tuition reimbursement.CEO Schultz said the company would address scheduling concerns. ""You have my personal commitment that we will work with every partner (employee) to ensure you have the hours you need,"" he said.The company, which has been grappling with cooling sales growth at its popular cafes, has repeatedly said there is no nationwide reduction in labor hours at the chain. Schultz did not directly reference the petition or employee concerns about labor hour cuts in his letter on Monday. ""Howard Schultz did not acknowledge or validate the labor crisis in the stores,"" said petition author Jaime Prater, a Los Angeles-area Starbucks barista. ""Until that is addressed, or simply acknowledged, my job isn't finished.""The Seattle-based company, which has a reputation for offering better pay and benefits than many other chains, said that about 150,000 workers in roughly 7,600 U.S. company-operated cafes will be affected by the change.

The result follows a 45.8 percent decline in profit in the first quarter, after which the company said it would face significant challenges in the second quarter.For the first-half, Tingyi said profit fell 64.75 percent to $70 million while revenue dropped nearly 14 percent. Hong Kong-listed Tingyi is partner to PepsiCo Inc in fruit juice drinks and Starbucks Corp in ready-to-drink coffees for the Chinese market. Last week, bigger rival Want Want China Holdings Ltd  posted a marginal rise in first-half profit as price competition intensified due to destocking and slowing economic growth in China.Shares of Tingyi closed down 1.3 percent ahead of the results.

334,"  Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Thursday its doughnut chain will partner with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to launch a line of bottled coffee beverages in the United States, its first foray into the ready-to-drink coffee market dominated by rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).The Dunkin' Donuts chain operator said the beverages, set to launch in early 2017, will be manufactured, distributed and sold by Coca-Cola. The bottled iced coffees, which will include milk and sugar in a variety of flavors, will be sold at supermarkets, convenience stores and in Dunkin' Donuts shops.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Dunkin' Brands Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters that the new venture will appeal to existing customers and also build brand recognition. ""Some of our Dunkin' consumers were drinking other people's products because we weren't there,"" Travis said.     The cold beverages, like the packaged coffees Dunkin' Donuts already sells through various retail channels, also are expected to introduce consumers to the chain's flavor profile. That can help build interest in the brand as it expands into new U.S. markets, Travis said. Dunkin' will split net profits from the sales of ready-to-drink coffee sold outside its shops with U.S. Dunkin' Donuts franchisees, with the highest revenue-producing operators receiving the largest percentage of that share. Starbucks, which has sold canned and bottled coffee drinks in North America since 1994, controls about 97 percent of the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee market in a 50-50 partnership with PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N). (bit.ly/2dcRuvU)Starbucks reaped more than $2.1 billion from its division that includes packaged drink and coffee sales during the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, 2015.  Travis declined to forecast sales for Dunkin's ready-to-drink products.Dunkin' has partnered with Coca-Cola since 2012 to serve Coke beverages at its coffee chains in the United States and certain other countries.

335,"   By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo | CHANGSHA, China/BEIJING  CHANGSHA, China/BEIJING Property speculators in China are looking for the next big thing beyond the country's major cities. And they may have found it in the inland city of Changsha.Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen have been the hottest property markets for most of the year, although smaller places such as the coastal city of Xiamen have been heating up too. Now there are signs the wave is reaching further inland.Until now, Changsha's home prices have been one of the lowest among central provincial capitals due to ample land supply, a more leisurely economy compared with its bustling coastal cousins and subdued local demand.But prices have jumped in recent months, catching many local property agents by surprise.""Prices have risen 2,000 yuan ($299.84) per square meter on average in the past two months. That's almost a 30 percent rise from July,"" said Hu Yi, marketing manager at Central Courtyard, a residential project in Changsha targeting mid- to high-end buyers.The sharp price rises in many cities are raising some uncomfortable memories of the last big run up in home values, which resulted in a property bust earlier this decade.China's southern boomtown of Shenzhen, with tight land supply and a fast-growing tech industry, has led the rally for most of the year. But it lost its top slot in August to the second-tier city of Xiamen where prices were up more than 40 percent from a year earlier.Prices rose in 64 of 70 major cities from the previous month, the highest in two years, government data shows.There are even flickers of life in Zhengdong, a district of the inland city of Zhengzhou that became a symbol of China's property excesses because of rows of empty housing developments.China property investment is also rising. Shortly after the August home price data was released, a parcel of land sold for a record price in southern China, the Shanghai Securities News reported.Mortgage demand is driving loan growth in July and August. Indeed, the value of new mortgage loans is almost 70 percent of the value of total property sales in 2016 so far, the highest since mid-2009, UBS analysts said, citing figures from data provider CEIC.The government wants to keep the property sector as a driver of economic growth as other areas splutter, so has an incentive to allow healthy price rises. Still, some are concerned.The central bank's chief economist, Ma Jun, was quoted earlier this month calling for steps to ""curb excessive bubbles"" in the property sector. UBS Chief China Economist Wang Tao said it was time the government tightened credit conditions for homebuyers.The price gains are a ""self fulfilling prophecy,"" she said. ""You buy when everyone is buying, that's the mantra. But at one point, prices are too high to find anyone to buy from you, and returns from rent are too low.""The government's ""primary concern"" should be to ""limit the liquidity"" in the property market, Rosealea Yao, an economist at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing said after the price data was released.When China's property market saw similar price gains a few years ago, 47 cities imposed restrictions on home prices. This time around only half a dozen have done so, she said.One factor driving speculators into the property market is moribund stocks. Benchmark indexes .SSEC .CSI300 have fallen 13-15 percent this year, although some of China's commodities markets are rallying strongly.CHANGSHA'S SPECULATORS  After Xiamen, the inland city of Hefei saw the second-biggest price gains in August, as out-of-town investors from Shanghai swooped in. Now property speculators complain that even Hefei is too expensive, so they are searching for the next opportunity and have found Changsha, agents and buyers said.Chen Xiaochuan, marketing manager with local residential property project Xiang-Shore Park said speculators make up about a third of homebuyers in Changsha.They are mainly from first-tier cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, property agents said, but are also from Hefei, where home prices have doubled since the start of the year.""They saw what happened in Hefei and thought to themselves, maybe Changsha will be the next Hefei,"" Chen said.Despite claims by some property agents that the inventory of empty homes is dropping to record lows in Changsha, empty-looking apartment buildings are still a common sight.China Index Academy data shows there are 126,945 homes, or 13.46 million square meters, sitting empty in Changsha. ""I came here alone, but met many fellow Hefei property buyers along the way,"" 40-year-old Hefei businessman Zhou, who only gave his surname, said as he listened to a sales pitch for a new development. Zhou said he already owns three properties in Hefei and some in Nanjing and Hangzhou, two cities near the east coast.GHOSTLY NO MORE? In Zhengzhou, the first Starbucks cafe in the Zhengdong district opened this month, surrounded by empty, shiny office towers and residential blocks.The shop manager said business would pick up in coming months, thanks partly to the cafe's proximity to three residential property projects.One of them is The Park, a high-end project developed by a subsidiary of Haima Automobile Group SZ.000572.""We have already bought an apartment here, and we are looking to buy a second one,"" a woman who goes by her last name Wang told Reuters just outside of project's sales office.Home prices in Zhengdong district have risen two-thirds this year to 25,000 yuan ($3,747.56) per square meter on average, sales manager Xu Zhou said. That is still less than half of Shenzhen's average price of $8,104.""We see a flux of buyers from people outside of Zhengzhou, especially those from smaller cities in the same province,"" Xu said, who apologized for his raspy voice, which he said was due to one too many sales pitches.And for Zhang Liyang, a sales manager at Greenland Group's HK.600606 Zhengzhou office, the price surge in the past few months came as a surprise, which meant missed opportunities as she was entitled to employee discount rates.""Even we didn't expect the prices to go up this much,"" she said.

348,"  * Tata Motors board to meet on Monday to discuss Q2 results* Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman in board coup last month* Tata drags shareholders of group cos into fight against Mistry* Mistry tried to streamline corporate governance at TataBy Aditi Shah and Abhirup RoyMUMBAI, Nov 14 Tata Motors, owner of Jaguar Land Rover and makers of India's cheapest car, will on Monday become the latest piece of the Tata empire to be dragged into a battle over its future, in a test case for parent Tata Sons' efforts to tighten control.The $100 billion Tata group has been mired in a public spat with former holding company chairman Cyrus Mistry since last month, when he was abruptly ousted from the top job - an acrimonious tussle that has revived debate around India's corporate governance and Tata's complex structure. Removing him from individual group companies, however, has been trickier, and Mistry is still at the helm of several key Tata boards, including Tata Motors, whose board meets on Monday, and Tata Steel - among the best known units of the sprawling salt-to-software group.""Tata Motors ... generates a substantial profit and revenues, so it is important for Tatas to have control over the board,"" said Shriram Subramanian, managing director of InGovern Research Services, a firm advising institutional investors.Tata on Thursday wrenched Mistry out of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), 73 percent controlled by the group and the conglomerate's star performer. But it has struggled with other subsidiaries where ownership is closer to 30 percent. Boards at Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals voted to keep Mistry as chairman last week.The board of Tata Motors will meet later on Monday to consider second-quarter earnings before those are reported later in the day. Directors of Tata Global Beverages, which co-owns and runs Starbucks coffee stores across India, meet on Tuesday.If the Tata Motors board does not oust Mistry, Tata Sons will have to turn to shareholder meetings. Tata Sons has already called for extraordinary general meetings across its companies to remove Mistry as a director, including Indian Hotels Co , Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Motors. Tata Sons has blamed Mistry's abrupt exit on what it called breach of trust and poor performance, accusing him of eroding shareholder value. It has also said Mistry tried to reduce the role of Tata Sons, controlled by a series of charitable trusts.Mistry has argued he tried to create internal barriers for better governance - a move that would reduce Tata trusts' involvement in operational issues of group companies, which he said should be controlled by their own boards of directors.The Tata trusts collectively own about two thirds of Tata Sons.""A philanthropy running a commercial business creates its own paradoxes,"" said Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy advisory, in a note about the feud.Tata Sons on Sunday said it was ""crucially important"" for the board members, including independent directors, to consider the future of Tata companies and its stakeholders. A spokesman declined to comment further.(Additional reporting by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Euan Rocha and Stephen Coates)",2016-11-14,SBUX,"Mon Nov 14, 2016 | 1:40am EST",Key week for Tata tussle as Mistry faces Tata Motors board,http://www.reuters.com//article/tata-sons-management-idUSL1N1DD0AZ?type=companyNews
349,"   By Aditi Shah | MUMBAI  MUMBAI The board of Tata Global Beverages (TAGL.NS), which co-owns and runs Starbucks (SBUX.O) coffee stores across India, has replaced  Cyrus Mistry as its chairman, the first Tata group company to depose him since his removal last month from the helm of parent holding company Tata Sons.Mistry said in a statement the manner in which he was replaced as chairman of Global Beverages was ""inaccurate and illegal,"" intensifying the high-profile power struggle at the Tata group.In a boardroom coup last month Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company for the $100 billion steel-to-software Tata empire in which Mistry's family hold a minority stake. Patriarch Ratan Tata is now back in charge as a bitter public row ensues.Despite being removed as chairman of Tata Sons, and now Tata Global Beverages, Mistry still remains chairman of some of the group's major companies like Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) and Tata Steel (TISC.NS), where Tata Sons does not have majority ownership.   Tata Sons has called shareholder meetings at these companies to get Mistry ousted from those boards. The group last week dismissed Mistry as chair of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS), where Tata Sons has a stake of over 70 percent.In the case of Tata Global Beverages, seven out of 10 directors on the board voted for Mistry's ousting and appointed Tata veteran Harish Bhat in his place.  Mistry's office questioned the accuracy and legality of his removal in a statement saying ""The Tatas continue to demonstrate the lack of respect for due process of law.""A Tata Sons spokesman said the process at Tata Global Beverages was completely legal.  MISTRY'S RECORD Earlier on Tuesday Mistry sought to defend his record at Tata Sons, saying in a statement that allegations that he oversaw rising expenses and impairment provisions were ""another brazen attempt to mislead the public and shareholders.""Mistry alleged that one reason for a rise in expenses under his tenure was because Tata Sons was bearing some costs on behalf of Ratan Tata, while impairments and writedowns were due to legacy issues.He was responding to Tata Sons' statement last week, which criticized his performance and accused him of being responsible for rising expenses and impairment provisions and falling dividends. ""The challenges the group faced could not be wished away,"" Mistry's statement said, detailing the challenges that he had inherited as chairman.Mistry also said in the statement that the group had paid the expenses of Ratan Tata, when he was chairman emeritus of Tata Sons and also chair of the Tata trusts, which amounted to about 300 million rupees ($4.4 million) in 2015 and included his use of corporate jets and office costs.When Ratan Tata retired in 2012 the board of Tata Sons decided to support an office and facilities for him, a Tata Sons source said, adding that Mistry and the other directors had signed the document detailing this provision. Mistry's statement also said the impairments at Tata Sons were due to legacy issues, largely relating to Tata Teleservices Ltd [TATASL.UL], and that Mistry had focused on building reserves and resources to handle the writedowns.

351,"  * Shares slump 8 pct after lower-than-expected profit* Weak performance from luxury unit Jaguar Land Rover* Analysts see recovery driven by launches of new vehicles* Results come amidst power struggle at Tata group   (Updates with details, background, quote)MUMBAI, Nov 15 Tata Motors shares skidded on Tuesday after second-quarter profit missed estimates by a wide margin due to a weak performance at its Jaguar Land Rover unit, although analysts said they expect earnings to improve in the months ahead. The results, out late on Monday, come amid a power struggle between Tata group holding company Tata Sons and its former chairman Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted last month but remains the chairman of Tata Motors.Traders said, however, that with no clear outcome on the tussle expected for a while, that Tuesday's 8 percent share decline was entirely earnings-driven. Hedging losses and a one-time provision related to new customer quality programmes at Jaguar Land Rover saw the automaker's overall net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 come in at 8.5 billion rupees ($125.3 million).That was better than a loss a year earlier but well below the 27.4 billion rupees profit expected by analysts. But the launch of new models from Jaguar Land Rover, such as the Jaguar F-Pace, is expected to drive growth in vehicle sales for the rest of the financial year.""JLR margins, adjusted for all one-offs and hedging losses, were below the level expected from the currency boost. That said, a strong model cycle and theoretically strong margin picture from benign currency provides comfort,"" analysts at Jefferies said.Independent directors at Tata Motors gave Mistry a tacit nod, but stopped short of an outright endorsement, or picking sides in the power struggle within India's largest conglomerate,Tata Global Beverages, which co-owns and runs Starbucks coffee stores across India, will be the next company in the Tata conglomerate to report results later on Tuesday.

Since then both Mistry and Tata Sons have been involved in a war of words blaming each party for problems in the $100-billion salt-to-software Tata conglomerate.The Tata Steel board, in a statement, also said on Friday that it would hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Dec. 21 to remove Mistry and independent director Nusli Wadia as directors on the board. Mistry was removed earlier this month as chairman of Tata Global Beverages (TAGL.NS), which co-owns and runs Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores across India, and as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS), India's biggest software company and a cash cow of the group. A source close to Mistry said in a statement that removing him as chairman of Tata Steel was a ""new low"" in the corporate governance standards of the Tata group and said representatives of Tata Sons were behind the decision.O P Bhatt, independent director on the board of Tata Steel and former head of State Bank of India [SBINY.UL], has been elected as chairman of the board of Tata Steel until the outcome of the EGM, the company said. ""The board appointed the independent director as the chairman keeping in mind principles of good corporate governance,"" it said.Tata Consultancy Services, as well as Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), which owns the Jaguar Land Rover brand, and Indian Hotels Co Ltd (IHTL.NS), which runs the Taj group of hotels, have also called for EGMs in December to remove Mistry as directors of their companies. Tata Sons had criticized Mistry's performance and accused him of being responsible for rising expenses and impairment provisions and falling dividends.Mistry sought to defend his record at Tata Sons in a statement on Nov. 15 and said allegations that he oversaw rising expenses and impairment provisions were ""another brazen attempt to mislead the public and shareholders.""

357,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to hamper growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said.    Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive.The company's shares were down 2.5 percent at $57.02 on Friday as investors worried that the exit of one of Wall Street's most regarded CEOs would spell trouble for the company.Analysts, however, downplayed these concerns.""Howard can't be in that position forever,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Reuters.Hottovy said the timing of the handoff made sense because the company had a strong management team and Johnson had more retail experience than the market was giving him credit for.Johnson worked with Schultz for nearly two years and has been on Starbucks' board since 2009. He also has a strong technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N), which sets him up to lead Starbucks at a time when the company is looking to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology.""Johnson appears to have been an important behind-the-scenes contributor to Starbucks' post-recession turnaround, and his background in technology should position him well,"" Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a research note. To be sure, the last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged.  Schultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. ""Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note.Starbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) and Panera Bread Co (PNRA.O) to follow suit.The mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. Starbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of at least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note that Schultz's plans to ""premiumize"" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive.The outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world, which analysts said was a worthwhile endeavor.Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia.The company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo.

358,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan  Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.Schultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's ""social impact agenda"" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.Starbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.""Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,"" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.""We're in a much better position on every level,"" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the ""Great Recession,"" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.Many of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. ""The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,"" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. The announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.  Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.  Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).On a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the ""merchant gene.""""Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,"" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. ""I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,"" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's.Traffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.The company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. ""He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,"" a spokeswoman said.

359,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Starbucks Corp Chief Executive and co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers.  Schultz in April will move into the role of executive chairman to focus on opening 1,000 new ""Reserve"" brand stores and adding Reserve bars to 20 percent of its traditional cafes, which now number 25,000 around the globe.  Starbucks also envisions as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. Schultz's transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities.""Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,"" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America.Its Reserve projects are ""a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,"" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore.Reserve stores will be about twice the size of typical stores and exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. The first are planned for Seattle and Chicago.  The new Reserve stores and Roasteries will serve wine, beer and spirits and bake their own pastries from Princi, a boutique Italian bakery and Starbucks partner.  Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more at Reserve cafes, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually.Schultz told attendees at the company's investor meeting on Wednesday that the halo from Reserve will make Starbucks a more compelling destination while providing an antidote to customers spending more of their time and money online.""If Starbucks was a 20-chapter book, I still think we're in chapter 4 or 5,"" said Schultz.     Starbucks already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities, including New York, Chicago and Atlanta. Reuters recently visited a Reserve bar on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 ""flights"" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. Twenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand.""I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,"" said Sauer, who showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. ""If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it,"" she said. ""I think people want it, too.”The new Reserve stores could boost Starbucks' revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown.Seattle-based Starbucks debuted the first Roastery in its hometown two years ago, spending a reported $20 million on the  15,000-square-foot industrial-chic playground for coffee enthusiasts. The Shanghai Roastery, which will be twice that size, is slated to open in about a year, with Manhattan to follow about six months later. But as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. ""There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,"" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

361,"  Peet's Coffee & Tea, a longtime rival to Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), said on Friday it will invest $58 million to open a new coffee roasting facility in Suffolk, Virginia, to support its expanding business in an increasingly competitive environment.The move from Peet's comes as Starbucks is making significant investment to stave off competition from upscale, independent coffee shops, such as Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Intelligentsia Coffee. Peet's owns Stumptown and has a majority stake in Intelligentsia.Peet's Chief Executive Dave Burwick told Reuters the new plant will create 135 new jobs and support the company's expanding business, which includes operating cafes and selling packaged coffee via grocery stores.Burwick welcomed the news that Starbucks Chief Executive and co-founder Howard Schultz will focus on building a new ultra-premium ""Reserve"" brand after he steps down as CEO in April 2017. ""We like it. The more interest there is in super-premium coffee, the more opportunities Peet's will have,"" Burwick said. Peet's new 175,000-square-foot facility will more than double current capacity, said Chief Operating Officer Shawn Conway.Burwick also said Peet's estimated sales will total $800 million this year, double what they were when Joh. A. Benckiser - the investment holding company of the Reimanns, the German billionaire family associated with Reckitt Benckiser - took Peet's private after buying the company in October 2012.
