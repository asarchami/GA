1,"  April 30 Telecom network provider Level 3 Communications Inc raised its forecast for 2014 adjusted EBITDA growth and free cash flow after reporting a much better-than-expected quarterly profit.Level 3 Communications shares rose 8 percent in premarket trading.The company said it now expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to grow 14-18 percent, up from its previous forecast of an 11-14 percent growth due to higher revenue from its core network services.Level 3 also raised its free cash flow forecast to $250 million-$300 million from $225 million-$275 million.The company operates and leases out fiber-optic communications networks to telecom carriers for voice and data communication. Its content delivery unit targets video distributors and online portals and competes with Akamai Technologies Inc  and Limelight Networks Inc.Level 3 reported its second quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a 6 percent rise in core network service revenue, after years of losses since 2009. The company posted net profit of $112 million, or 47 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $78 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue increased 2 percent to $1.61 billion. Analysts on an average had expected earnings of 27 cents per share on revenue of $1.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Level 3 undertook a cost-cutting program last year, which included job cuts.The Federal Communications Commission is weighing rules that will allow content delivery companies to charge more from companies such as Netflix for faster Internet speeds, which could open up further revenue streams for companies like Level 3.Level 3 shares were trading at $40.20 before markets opened on Wednesday.

2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) assigned to Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT) and its wholly owned  subsidiary Level 3 Financing, Inc. (Level 3 Financing) to 'B+' from 'B'. In  addition Fitch has upgraded specific issue ratings assigned to LVLT and Level 3  Financing as outlined at the end of this release. The Rating Outlook has been  revised to Stable.  Approximately $8.4 billion of LVLT's consolidated debt as of  March 31, 2014 is affected by Fitch's actions.   KEY RATING DRIVERS --LVLT is clearly operating within its 3x to 5x net leverage target.  Fitch  expects further strengthening of LVLT's credit metrics during the remainder of  2014 as the company benefits from anticipated EBITDA growth, free cash flow  (FCF) generation and debt reduction.  Fitch foresees LVLT leverage will approach  4.7x by the end of 2014 and under 4x by the end of next year.   --The company is poised to generate sustainable levels of FCF (defined as cash  flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends).  Fitch  anticipates LVLT FCF generation during 2014 will approximate 4% of consolidated  revenues, growing to 7.5% of revenues by year-end 2016.  --LVLT's revenue mix transformation is proceeding. The company's operating  strategies are aimed at shifting its revenue and customer focus to become a  predominantly enterprise-focused entity.  --The operating leverage inherent within LVLT's business model positions the  company to expand both gross and EBITDA margins.  The upgrade of LVLT's ratings is supported by the continued strengthening of the  company's credit profile since the close of the Global Crossing Limited (GLBC)  acquisition, positive operating momentum evidenced by expanding gross and EBITDA  margins, and ongoing revenue growth within the company's Core Network Services  (CNS) segment and its position to generate meaning FCF.   Consolidated leverage as of the LTM period ended March 31, 2014 declined to  4.95x marking an improvement from 5.17x, 5.85x, and 8.1x as of years-ended 2013,  2012, and 2011, respectively. Fitch foresees LVLT leverage will further improve  to 4.7x by the end of 2014 and to under 4x by year-end 2015.   Fitch believes the company's ability to grow high-margin CNS revenues coupled  with the strong operating leverage inherent in its operating profile positions  the company to generate consistent levels of FCF. LVLT generated approximately  $93 million of FCF during the LTM period ended March 31, 2014. In addition to  LVLT's positive operating momentum driving EBITDA growth, additional factors  such as interest expense savings derived from capital market activities  completed during 2013 ($60 million of annual cash interest savings) and on-going  operating cost optimization efforts (including 2013 head-count reductions)  position the company to grow FCF during the ratings horizon.  Fitch anticipates  LVLT FCF generation during 2014 will approximate 4% of consolidated revenues  growing to 7.5% of revenues by year-end 2016.  Based largely on LVLT's strategy to invest in metropolitan facilities (which  extend its on-network footprint and overall network depth) to carry more  communications traffic on its network, the company derives strong operating  leverage from its cost structure and network, enabling it to enhance margins.  Additionally, the company's improving revenue mix can further strengthen its  operating leverage and contribute to higher gross and EBITDA margins. LVLT's  gross margin increased 170 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis during  the first quarter of 2014.  In addition, EBITDA margin increased 400bps,  demonstrating the strong operating leverage inherent in LVLT's operating  profile.     LVLT's enterprise segment continues to drive overall revenue growth within CNS.   LVLT's operating strategies are aimed at shifting its revenue and customer focus  to become a predominantly enterprise-focused entity. The process started with  the GLBC acquisition. LVLT's network capabilities, in particular its strong  metropolitan network, along with a broad product and service portfolio  emphasizing IP-based infrastructure and managed services, provide a solid base  on which to grow its enterprise segment revenues. Fitch believes that revenue  growth prospects within LVLT's CNS segment stand to benefit from the transition  among enterprise customers from legacy time division multiplexing (TDM)  communications infrastructure to Ethernet or IP VPN infrastructure based in  internet protocol.  Fitch anticipates that enterprise revenues will account for  approximately 69% of CNS revenues by the end of 2015.  Enterprise-segment  revenues expanded by 10.4% on a year-over-year basis during the first quarter  (11.2% on a constant currency basis).  Importantly, revenue churn improved 10bps  year-over-year during the first quarter to 1.5%.     Overall, Fitch's ratings incorporate LVLT's weaker competitive position and lack  of scale relative to larger and better capitalized market participants. The  ratings for LVLT reflect the company's strong metropolitan network facilities  position relative to alternative carriers, as well as the diversity of its  customer base and service offering, and a relatively stable pricing environment  for a significant portion of LVLT's service portfolio. Fitch believes that LVLT's liquidity position is adequate given the rating, and  that overall financial flexibility is enhanced with positive FCF generation.   The company's liquidity position is primarily supported by cash carried on its  balance sheet, which as of March 31, 2014 totaled approximately $607 million,  and expected FCF generation. LVLT does not maintain a revolver, which limits its  financial flexibility in Fitch's opinion. LVLT does not have any significant  maturities scheduled during the remainder of 2014.  LVLT's next scheduled  maturity is not until 2015 when approximately $475 million of debt is scheduled  to mature or convert into equity. RATING SENSITIVITIES What Could Trigger a Positive Rating Action: --Consolidated leverage maintained at 4x or lower; --Consistent generation of positive FCF, with FCF-to-adjusted debt of 5% or  greater; --Positive operating momentum characterized by consistent core network services  revenue growth and gross margin expansion.  What Could Trigger a Negative Rating Action:  --Weakening of LVLT's operating profile, as signaled by deteriorating margins  and revenue erosion brought on by difficult economic conditions or competitive  pressure; --Discretionary management decisions including but not limited to execution of  merger and acquisition activity that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the  absence of a credible de-leveraging plan.  Fitch upgrades the following with a Stable Outlook: LVLT: --IDR to 'B+' from 'B';  --Senior unsecured notes to 'B/RR5' from 'B-/RR5'.  Level 3 Financing, Inc.: --IDR to 'B+' from 'B'; --Senior secured term loan to 'BB+/RR1' from 'BB/RR1'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BB/RR2' from 'BB-/RR2'.

7,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: U.S. Telecom and Cable Stats Quarterly  (First-Quarter 2014)  here CHICAGO, June 30 (Fitch) Level 3 Communications, Inc.'s (LVLT) merger with TW  Telecom, Inc. increases LVLT's scale and focus on high margin enterprise account  revenues while increasing the company's overall competitive position and ability  to capture incremental market share, according to Fitch Ratings' 'U.S. Telecom  and Cable Stats Quarterly' .  LVLT remains committed to operate within its 3x to 5x net leverage target. The  enhanced scale and ability to generate meaningful free cash flow (FCF) resulting  from the transaction reinforces Fitch's expectation of further strengthening of  LVLT's credit profile. Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile USA are reportedly nearing a transaction in which  Sprint will acquire T-Mobile for approximately $32 billion. Fitch believes a  Sprint/T-Mobile union would improve the network densification required for a  higher speed wireless offering, but would also likely add further integration  challenges to Sprint's already lengthy network migration plans. Regulatory  approval remains a substantial hurdle for this potential transaction and  predicting the outcome of a regulatory review is difficult given the current  regulatory climate. However, regulatory approval of the merger would likely  require substantial concessions and related divestitures to address public  interest concerns and antitrust issues. Fitch's 'U.S. Telecom and Cable Stats Quarterly' provides a summary of operating  performance, credit metrics, and liquidity positions of the companies in the  telecommunications sector of Fitch's rating universe over the past four years,  as well as key credit strengths and concerns as of the end of 1Q'14.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+/RR1' rating to  Level 3 Financing, Inc.'s proposed senior secured term loan (Tranche B 2022 Term  Loan) under its existing senior secured credit facility.  Level 3 Financing is a  wholly owned subsidiary of Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT).  The Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) for both LVLT and Level 3 Financing is 'B+' with a Positive  Rating Outlook.  LVLT had approximately $8.4 billion of consolidated debt  outstanding on June 30, 2014.   Proceeds generated from the Tranche B 2022 are expected to be used to fund the  cash utilized to fund, in part, the cash consideration of LVLT's previously  announced acquisition of TW Telecom, Inc. (TWTC). The terms of the Tranche B  2022, including the security and guaranty structure are expected to be  substantially similar to the existing Tranche B-III 2019 term loan and the  Tranche B 2020 term loan. Overall, LVLT expects to issue $3 billion of debt, including Level 3 Escrow II,  Inc.'s $1 billion issuance of 5.375% senior notes due 2022, which will be used  to pay the cash consideration of the TWTC acquisition and repay outstanding TWTC  indebtedness. Pro forma for the TWTC acquisition, Fitch estimates LVLT will have  approximately $11.5 billion of debt. The transaction is subject to shareholder  approval (vote scheduled for Oct. 28, 2014) and customary regulatory approvals  including the FCC and other U.S. and state regulatory agencies. The U.S.  Department of Justice previously approved LVLT's pending acquisition of TWTC on  Sept. 8, 2014.  LVLT anticipates the transaction will close by year-end 2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The TW Telecom, Inc. (TWTC) acquisition increases LVLT's scale and focus on  high-margin enterprise account revenues while increasing the company's overall  competitive position and ability to capture incremental market share; --The acquisition is clearly in line with LVLT's strategy to shift its revenue  and customer focus to become a predominantly enterprise-focused entity. --LVLT remains committed to operate within its 3x to 5x net leverage target. The  enhanced scale and ability to generate meaningful free cash flow (FCF) resulting  from the transaction reinforces Fitch's expectation for further strengthening of  LVLT's credit profile.  --The company is poised to generate sustainable levels of free cash flow (FCF;  defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends).  Fitch anticipates LVLT FCF generation during 2014 will range between 4% and 4.5%  of consolidated revenues on a stand-alone basis, growing to nearly 10% of  revenues by year-end 2016 on a pro forma basis.  --The operating leverage inherent within LVLT's business model positions the  company to expand both gross and EBITDA margins.  LVLT leverage strengthened to 4.7x as of the LTM ended June 30, 2014, reflecting  a decrease from 5.2x as of year-end 2013 and 5.4x as of the LTM ended June 30,  2013. Fitch expects LVLT leverage on a stand-alone basis will approach 4.5x by  the end of 2014. Fitch continues to expect LVLT's credit profile will strengthen  as the company benefits from anticipated EBITDA growth, FCF generation and cost  synergies related to the TWTC acquisition. Consolidated leverage on a pro forma  basis is 5.1x before consideration of any operating cost synergies and declines  to 4.7x after factoring in $200 million of anticipated operating cost synergies. The TWTC acquisition improves LVLT's ability to generate consistent levels of  FCF. Fitch anticipates LVLT FCF generation during 2014 will range between 4% and  4.5% of consolidated revenues on a stand-alone basis before growing to nearly  10% by year-end 2016 on a pro forma basis. The company has generated  approximately $147 million of FCF through the LTM ended June 30, 2014. Fitch  believes the company's ability to grow high-margin core network services (CNS)  revenues coupled with the strong operating leverage inherent in its operating  profile position the company to generate consistent levels of FCF. The TWTC acquisition is in line with LVLT's strategy to shift its revenue and  customer focus to become a predominately enterprise-focused entity. TWTC's  strong metropolitan network supports LVLT's overall strategy. Pro forma for the  transaction, LVLT's revenue from enterprise customers increases to 70% of total  CNS revenue from 66%. From a regional perspective North America CNS revenue  would increase to 78% of total CNS revenue, up from approximately 71%. LVLT's network capabilities, in particular its strong metropolitan network,  along with a broad product and service portfolio emphasizing IP-based  infrastructure and managed services provide the company a solid base to grow its  enterprise segment revenues. Fitch believes that revenue growth prospects within  LVLT's CNS segment stand to benefit from the transition among enterprise  customers from legacy time division multiplexing (TDM) communications  infrastructure to Ethernet or IP VPN infrastructure based on Internet protocol.   Fitch believes that LVLT's liquidity position is adequate given the rating, and  that overall financial flexibility is enhanced with positive FCF generation. The  company's liquidity position is primarily supported by cash carried on its  balance sheet which as of June 30, 2014 totaled approximately $637 million, and  expected FCF generation. LVLT does not maintain a revolver, which limits its  financial flexibility in Fitch's opinion. LVLT has no significant maturities  scheduled during the remainder of 2014. LVLT's next scheduled maturity is not  until 2015 when approximately $475 million of debt is scheduled to mature or  convert into equity. RATING SENSITIVITIES What Could Lead to a Positive Rating Action: --Consolidated leverage maintained at 4x or lower; --Consistent generation of positive FCF, with FCF-to-adjusted debt of 5% or  greater; --Positive operating momentum characterized by consistent core network service  revenue growth and gross margin expansion.  What Could Lead to a Negative Rating Action:  --Weakening of LVLT's operating profile, as signaled by deteriorating margins  and revenue erosion brought on by difficult economic conditions or competitive  pressure; --Discretionary management decisions including but not limited to execution of  merger and acquisition activity that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the  absence of a credible de-leveraging plan.

10,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings will maintain the 'BB+/RR1' issue rating  on Level 3 Financing, Inc.'s (Level 3 Financing) proposed senior secured term  loan that is expected to be used to refinance the company's existing equivalent  sized tranche B term loan due January 2022. Level 3 Financing is a wholly owned  subsidiary of Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT). The Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) for both LVLT and Level 3 Financing is 'B+' with a Positive Outlook. LVLT  had approximately $11.5 billion of consolidated debt outstanding on March 31,  2015.  The terms of the new credit facility, including the security and guaranty  structure are expected to be substantially similar to the existing Tranche B  2022 term loan. Outside of an expected reduction of interest expense related to  this transaction, LVLT's credit profile has not substantially changed.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --LVLT remains committed to operate within its 3x to 5x net leverage target. The  enhanced scale and ability to generate meaningful free cash flow (FCF) resulting  from the TW Telecom, Inc. (TWTC) acquisition reinforces Fitch's expectation for  further strengthening of LVLT's credit profile. --The TWTC acquisition increases LVLT's scale and focus on high-margin  enterprise account revenues while increasing the company's overall competitive  position and ability to capture incremental market share; --The acquisition is clearly in line with LVLT's strategy to shift its revenue  and customer focus to become a predominantly enterprise-focused entity. --The company is poised to generate sustainable levels of FCF (defined as cash  flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends). Fitch anticipates  LVLT FCF generation will grow to nearly 10% of revenues by year-end 2016 on a  pro forma basis.  --The operating leverage inherent to LVLT's business model positions the company  to expand both gross and EBITDA margins.  Consolidated leverage, pro forma for the TWTC acquisition, is 4.6x before  consideration of any operating cost synergies and declines to 4.3x after  factoring in $200 million of anticipated operating cost synergies. LVLT leverage  increased year-over-year to 5.6x on an actual basis as of March 31, 2015 as a  result of the effect of acquisition financing. Fitch continues to expect LVLT's  credit profile will strengthen as the company benefits from anticipated EBITDA  growth, FCF generation and cost synergies related to the TWTC acquisition.  The TWTC acquisition improves LVLT's ability to generate consistent levels of  FCF. Fitch anticipates LVLT FCF generation will grow to nearly 10% by year-end  2016 on a pro forma basis. The company has generated approximately $324 million  of FCF through the LTM ended March 31, 2015. Fitch believes the company's  ability to grow high-margin core network services (CNS) revenues coupled with  the strong operating leverage inherent to its operating profile position the  company to generate consistent levels of FCF. The TWTC acquisition is in line with LVLT's strategy to shift its revenue and  customer focus to become a predominately enterprise-focused entity. TWTC's  strong metropolitan network supports LVLT's overall strategy. Pro forma for the  transaction, LVLT's revenue from enterprise customers increases to 72% of total  CNS revenue from 68%. From a regional perspective, North America CNS revenue  would increase to 79% of total CNS revenue, up from approximately 73%. LVLT's network capabilities, in particular its strong metropolitan network,  along with a broad product and service portfolio emphasizing Internet protocol  (IP)-based infrastructure and managed services provide the company a solid base  to grow its enterprise segment revenues. Fitch believes that revenue growth  prospects within LVLT's CNS segment stand to benefit from the transition among  enterprise customers from legacy time division multiplexing (TDM) communications  infrastructure to Ethernet or IP VPN infrastructure based on IP. Fitch believes that LVLT's liquidity position is adequate given the rating, and  that overall financial flexibility is enhanced with positive FCF generation. The  company's liquidity position is primarily supported by cash carried on its  balance sheet which as of March 31, 2015 totaled approximately $567 million (pro  forma for the redemption of 9.375% senior notes due 2015), and expected FCF  generation. As of Dec. 31, 2014, $63 million of cash was denominated in  Venezuelan bolivares. LVLT does not maintain a revolver, which limits its  financial flexibility in Fitch's opinion. LVLT's maturity profile is manageable  within the context of FCF generation expectations and access to capital markets.  As expected, LVLT converted approximately $333 million outstanding principal  remaining on its 7% convertible senior notes due 2015 into approximately 12  million shares of LVLT common.  The company does not have material scheduled  maturities during the remainder of 2015, and the next scheduled maturity is not  until 2018 when approximately $300 million of debt is scheduled to mature. RATING SENSITIVITIES What Could Lead to a Positive Rating Action: --Consolidated leverage maintained at 4x or lower; --Consistent generation of positive FCF, with FCF-to-adjusted debt of 5% or  greater; --Positive operating momentum characterized by consistent core network service  revenue growth and gross margin expansion.  What Could Lead to a Negative Rating Action:  --Weakening of LVLT's operating profile, as signaled by deteriorating margins  and revenue erosion brought on by difficult economic conditions or competitive  pressure; --Discretionary management decisions including but not limited to execution of  merger and acquisition activity that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the  absence of a credible de-leveraging plan.

She declined to say how long the incident lasted or which customers were involved. Downdetector.com, which measures network outages based on customer complaints and other data, said that carriers affected included AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Sprint Corp, Comcast Corp, T-Mobile US Inc  and Level 3 itself, with problems lasting an hour or more. T-Mobile CEO John Legere told customers on Twitter that the outage was linked to ""a third party landline voice provider impacting all carriers"" and noted that Level 3 fixed the issue in a later Tweet. A Comcast spokesman confirmed the outage and said it affected a small number of customers who were dialing toll free numbers and that its own toll free line for Xfinity customers was unaffected.

21,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer  Default Ratings (IDRs) of CenturyLink Inc. (CenturyLink) (NYSE: CTL) and its  subsidiaries on Rating Watch Negative. The rating action affects approximately  $19.9 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016. Fitch has affirmed the Long-Term IDRs of Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT) and  its wholly owned subsidiary Level 3 Financing, Inc. (Level 3 Financing) at 'BB'.  The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The rating action affects approximately $11  billion of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016. See the full list of rating actions at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Acquisition of LVLT: CenturyLink and LVLT have a definitive agreement whereby  CenturyLink will acquire LVLT in a cash and stock transaction; LVLT's existing  debt will remain outstanding. The cash portion of the transaction, which is  approximately 60%, will be financed by approximately $7 billion in incremental,  senior secured debt as well as cash on hand at both companies. The transaction  is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2017, following  customary shareholder and regulatory approvals.  Fitch views CenturyLink's acquisition of LVLT positively from a strategic  perspective. The two companies combined will create the second largest  enterprise service provider in the U.S. and should benefit from the enhanced  scale and operating synergies over time. Post-acquisition, CenturyLink will also  have an extensive international network.  The Negative Watch for CenturyLink's IDR reflects the increase in leverage pro  forma for the transaction. Fitch estimates that at the end of 2018, the first  full year following the expected close of the transaction, gross leverage will  approximate 3.9x. As currently proposed, the transaction would potentially lead  to a one-notch downgrade for CenturyLink to 'BB' and a Stable Outlook. Based on  a potential one-notch downgrade of the IDR to 'BB', Fitch would also downgrade  CenturyLink's senior unsecured debt one notch. The one-notch downgrade is  consistent with Fitch's notching treatment of issue ratings with 'RR4'  recoveries, reflecting a rating at the same level as the IDR. Resolution of the Rating Watch will be based on an evaluation of a number of  factors, including Fitch's further analysis of CenturyLink's final,  post-acquisition capital structure, an assessment of CenturyLink's financial  policies, the execution risks associated with the integration of LVLT, and the  effect of conditions placed on the transaction by the regulatory approval  process. LVLT's affirmation reflects the proposed structure of the transaction. A new  holding company (HoldCo) will be formed and become the parent of LVLT. The  Holdco is expected to guarantee the acquisition financing at CenturyLink and the  stock of LVLT is expected to also secure the new financing at CenturyLink. The  existing LVLT capital structure will remain in place and LVLT will not provide a  guarantee to the HoldCo or to the acquisition debt. To fund the transaction, CenturyLink has $10.2 billion in secured financing  commitments, including a $2 billion revolver. The remaining $8.2 billion of  other secured facilities includes financing for debt maturing at CenturyLink  prior to the expected close of the transaction. The secured financing is  expected to be guaranteed by existing CenturyLink subsidiaries (including Embarq  Corporation ), except for Qwest Corporation (QC), and by HoldCo. LVLT and QC  are expected to pledge stock to secure the facilities. Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Following the close of the transaction, Fitch  anticipates linking the IDRs of CenturyLink and LVLT based on the strong  operational and strategic ties.  Deleveraging Expected: Following the close of the transaction, Fitch expects  CenturyLink to delever at a moderate pace through EBITDA growth and debt  repayment; however, Fitch does not expect the company to approach its 3.0x net  leverage target in the three year period following the close of the transaction. KEY ASSUMPTIONS For CenturyLink, Fitch's key assumptions within the agency's rating case  include: -- Fitch's base case assumes the data centers are sold as of Jan. 1, 2017 and  thus reflects a full year loss of revenue and EBITDA. Although the LVLT  acquisition is expected to close around Sept. 30, 2017, the forecast assumes it  closes towards the end of fiscal 2017. LVLT's operations are fully incorporated  starting in fiscal 2018. --Fitch assumes CTL revenues will decline 2% or less in 2016 and 2017, before  stabilizing in 2018. --Fitch's forecast cost synergies slightly below synergies expected by  CenturyLink and integration expenses in line with CenturyLink's expectations. --The company benefits from $9.6 billion of unused NOLs from LVLT starting in  2018. --Fitch assumes additional one-time cash taxes related to the data center sale  are paid in 2017. --Share repurchases are suspended while the company deleverages back to its net  leverage target.  For LVLT, Fitch's key assumptions within the agency's rating case include: --The base case assumes a continuation of a rational pricing environment and  stable macro-economic conditions.  --LVLT is largely successful in capitalizing on operating leverage to expand  growth in gross margin and EBITDA margin during the forecast period. --CNS revenue growth ranging between 2% and 3% driven by continued strong growth  within the company's North American Enterprise segment. --LVLT's network access margin (gross margin) growing to over 67% by year-end  2017. --Capital expenditures will approximate 15% of consolidated revenues. --Free cash flow (FCF) generation exceeding 11.5% and 13.5% of revenues during  years ended 2016 and 2017, respectively. --Debt levels are expected to remain relatively consistent. RATING SENSITIVITIES What Could Lead to a Positive Rating Action: Should CenturyLink's IDR be downgraded one notch to 'BB', Fitch does not  anticipate a positive action within a 12- to 18-month rating horizon. To return  to the 'BB+' IDR, Fitch would expect CenturyLink to maintain leverage at 3.0x or  lower while consistently generating positive FCF in the mid-single digits.  Additionally, the company will need to demonstrate consistent revenue growth,  stable or improving margins, and no extensive delays in reaching expected cost  synergies.  What Could Lead to a Negative Rating Action:  Negative rating actions could result from a weakening of CenturyLink's operating  results, including deteriorating margins and revenue erosion brought on by  difficult economic conditions or competitive pressure. Additionally, should  CenturyLink's IDR be downgraded one-notch to 'BB', negative rating actions could  result from discretionary management decisions including, but not limited to,  execution of merger and acquisition activity that increases leverage beyond 4.5x  in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan. LIQUIDITY CenturyLink's total debt was $19.9 billion at June 30, 2016, and readily  available cash totalled $137 million (cash excludes $54 million in foreign bank  accounts). Financial flexibility is provided through a $2 billion revolving  credit facility that matures in December 2019. As of June 30, 2016, there were  no borrowings outstanding on the facility.  Fitch believes CenturyLink has the financial flexibility to manage upcoming  maturities due to its FCF and credit facilities. In 2016, maturities only  consist of $11 million of term loan amortization payments. Maturities amount to  approximately $1.5 billion and $196 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  The principal financial covenants in the $2 billion revolving credit facility  limit CenturyLink's debt to EBITDA for the past four quarters to no more than  4.0x and EBITDA to interest plus preferred dividends (with the terms as defined  in the agreement) to no less than 1.5x. QC has a maintenance covenant of 2.85x  and an incurrence covenant of 2.35x. The facility is guaranteed by certain  material subsidiaries of CenturyLink.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has placed the following CenturyLink ratings on Rating Watch Negative: CenturyLink --Long-Term IDR 'BB+';  --Senior unsecured $2 billion RCF 'BB+/RR4';  --Senior unsecured debt 'BB+/RR4'. Embarq Corp. --IDR 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-/RR2'. Embarq Florida, Inc. (EFL) --IDR 'BB+'; --First mortgage bonds 'BBB-/RR1'. Qwest Communications International, Inc. (QCII) --IDR 'BB+'. Qwest Corporation (QC) --IDR 'BB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-/RR2'. Qwest Services Corporation (QSC) --IDR 'BB+'. Qwest Capital Funding (QCF) --Senior unsecured notes 'BB+/RR4'. Fitch affirms LVLT's ratings as follows: LVLT: --IDR at 'BB';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BB-/RR5'.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction.
