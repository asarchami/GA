Large oil companies are tightening spending after a decade of double-digit increase in budgets as oil prices stagnate and project costs rise. National Oilwell said on a conference call on Monday that its day rates had come under pressure with demand slowing.Rival Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc warned last week that the next two years could be a tough environment for offshore drillers.National Oilwell booked $2.33 billion in new orders for oilfield equipment in the first quarter, down from $3.04 billion a year earlier. Barclays had expected capital equipment orders worth $3.5 billion for the company for the first quarter, while JP Morgan Securities had expected $2.59 billion.National Oilwell's rig technology business, which makes equipment to automate well construction and management, accounts for half of its total revenue.

National Oilwell's shares fell 2 percent in morning trading as the warning overshadowed the company's better-than-expected profit that was driven by higher margins, especially in its rigs business.U.S. oil and gas producers are turning their attention to lucrative shale fields in North America, boosting demand for land rigs, even as they shun more-expensive deepwater projects.Still, National Oilwell booked $3.4 billion in new orders for oilfield equipment in the second quarter ended June 30, higher than the $3.15 billion a year earlier.

The business accounts for nearly half of the company's revenue. National Oilwell's overall operating margins rose to 18 percent from 16.5 percent.The strength in the company's businesses that make hydraulic fracturing equipment, drill bits and a host of other equipment was indicative of growth in North American drilling activity, analysts said.""Any positive momentum in North America will bode well for National Oilwell Varco and would provide upside to current estimates as long as offshore new builds do not slow down a lot from here,"" William Blair & Co analysts said in a note.Net income attributable to the company rose 17 percent to $619 million in the quarter.

A nearly 25 percent drop in oil prices since June has also raised the possibility of a further capital expenditure cuts.Orders in National Oilwell's rig systems segment, which accounts for nearly half its total revenue, fell to $1.34 billion in the third quarter from $3.31 billion a year earlier. Revenue from the business, which makes rigs and drilling components, could remain relatively flat in the fourth quarter, the company warned on a post-earnings conference call.""The large drop off in orders is going to cause concern among the investment community,"" William Blair analyst Brandon Dobell wrote in a note to clients.Falling prices have forced oil companies to review certain low-margin projects, posing a risk to oilfield service providers. ""Looking forward, we are closely monitoring the potential impact of lower oil prices on our markets,"" Chief Executive Clay Williams said in a statement on Thursday.EARNINGS BEAT STREET Revenue in National Oilwell's rig systems segment jumped 29 percent to $2.66 billion in the quarter, helped by the spike in shale drilling activity in North America, which has stayed resilient despite weak oil prices. Land drillers Nabors Industries Ltd and Patterson-UTI Energy Inc reported a jump in revenue last week, helped by the increased drilling activity.National Oilwell's total revenue rose 17 percent to $5.59 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $5.45 billion.Net income attributable to the company rose 10 percent to $699 million, or $1.62 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30.On an adjusted basis, National Oilwell reported an operating profit of $1.76 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.54, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The Houston-based company's stock clawed back some of its early losses and was down about 1.9 percent at $71.32 at 12:30 p.m. ET on the New York Stock Exchange.Up to Wednesday's close, National Oilwell's shares had gained 1.5 percent this year, underperforming the 5 percent rise in the broader S&P 500 Oil & Gas Equipment Services Index .

11,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Dec 24 oAs falling oil prices have ripped through energy stocks this year, five U.S. corporate spin-offs in the sector have not escaped the share price carnage and face a tougher road to recovery than more-established companies.Shares of three of the newly independent companies have tumbled more than 60 percent each since separating this summer: Paragon Offshore Plc, Noble Corp's spin-off of drilling assets; Civeo Corp, which provides oilfield ""man camps"" and split from Oil States International ; and Seventy Seven Energy, an oilfield services firm that had been part of Chesapeake Energy.Their small sizes, recent debuts as independent companies, and, in some cases, positions in niche energy businesses, put the spin-offs at a disadvantage as oil hovers at five-year lows, analysts say.""They don't have a track record,"" said Mike Breard, an energy stock analyst for Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.  ""You feel better buying something you know when you're trying to catch a falling knife."" A Reuters survey released on Monday projected an oil  recovery in the second half of 2015. Even if that does materialize, ""these companies are smaller in market cap, and investors are likely to buy larger, more liquid shares initially,"" said James West, an analyst at Evercore ISI.California Resources Corp, Occidental Petroleum's  former California exploration assets, became a public company only in the past month. But its shares have dropped about 30 percent. The S&P Energy Index is off 19 percent from its June peak. While the most beaten-up shares ""could rebound the best,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg says, spin-off stocks will likely languish ""until (oil) prices show a steady improvement that the market thinks is going to hold up for a while.""Energy spin-offs have lagged those of other sectors, with shares rising 12 percent on average one year after splitting from their parents, compared with a 22 percent average increase across industries, according to a study released this month from The Edge Consulting Group. Some stock watchers are wary of painting spin-offs with the same brush. Shares of National Oilwell Varco's products distributor spin-off, Now Inc, are off about 14 percent since regular trading started, versus a 44 percent drop for chief rival MRC Global.Now Inc has benefited from a relatively strong balance sheet, said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Jeffrey Hammond.Paragon's heavy debt load and less-desirable drilling assets have made it particularly susceptible to the oil price drop, said Christian Ledoux, senior portfolio manager at South Texas Money Management.""While it might not go back to its IPO price, (the stock could) more than a double,"" he said.

17,"   By Swetha Gopinath | April 28  April 28 National Oilwell Varco Inc is slowing down its share buyback program to preserve cash for acquisitions, driven by the need for consolidation in an industry beset by low crude prices.The largest U.S. oilfield equipment maker is in talks over several potential deals, its chief executive said on Tuesday, which would add to two acquisitions already completed this year.""We are currently slowing our share repurchases in view of the potential acquisition candidates coming into sharper focus,"" Clay Williams said on a conference call with analysts after the company reported first-quarter results.National Oilwell's $3 billion share buyback program has begun at a blistering pace, with just $900 million remaining under a three-year program announced last September. As of March 31, the company had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. But a 44 percent drop in global crude prices   since June has prompted oil producers to scale back spending, weighing heavily on demand for oilfield services and equipment.National Oilwell's first-quarter revenue was lower than analysts had expected and the company forecast declining revenue for the next few quarters. Its shares fell as much as 8 percent to $50.18. For an acquisitive company such as National Oilwell, which has spent more than $13 billion on acquisitions in the last 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data, the downturn could throw up some bargains.""These downturns provide pretty extraordinary opportunities to deploy capital, to kind of reposition ourselves for the next upturn,"" Williams said.

26,"   By Swetha Gopinath  The most significant bankruptcy of the current oil downturn has shone a spotlight on what is perhaps the most oversupplied corner of the energy world: the market for offshore rig services.Samson Resources Corp, an independent oil producer bought just four years ago for $7.2 billion, said in its late Wednesday filing for creditor protection that a 60 percent crude price slide CLc1 LCOc1 had upended its business.In the offshore space, restructurings and asset sales are widely seen as likely and some chief executive officers are now openly talking about acquisitions.Paragon Offshore Plc PGN.N, which has an outdated fleet, said on Thursday it has hired Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a well-known restructuring firm, and the investment bank Lazard.And Vantage Drilling Co, which has a hefty debt load, has also said it retained financial adviser Lazard to explore options. Vantage did not provide additional comment.Leaders of Transocean Ltd (RIG.N) RIGN.VX, Noble Corporation Plc (NE.N) and Rowan Companies Plc (RDC.N) say they are now on the prowl - to both eliminate competition in a saturated rig market and to pick up new rigs at bargain basement prices. Talk of offshore consolidation - rare in a sector that saw its last big deal in 2011, when Ensco Plc (ESV.N) bought Pride International - comes as executives see prices staying low for a long time, meaning even less work for rigs.   ""We believe we are the natural consolidator,"" Transocean Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen said at the Barclays energy conference last week. ""The industry needs to consolidate, and so we're certainly looking and just waiting.""Thigpen, who recently took his new post after being chief financial officer at highly acquisitive National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N), seems to be steering Transocean in a new direction.   Insiders say the Switzerland-based company lost its technological edge and hesitated to invest after the deadly 2010 explosion of its Deepwater Horizon rig leased for BP Plc's (BP.L) Macondo well.    In a distressed industry, buyers may find cheap targets. Second-hand rigs are going for half the price of building a new rig, which can run to $600 million.Consolidation would also allow buyers to scrap older rigs faster. Rental rates for new rigs bring in about $375,000 a day, almost 50 percent more than old rigs.Vantage, along with Pacific Drilling SA (PACD.N), has a young fleet that would be valuable to larger rivals Transocean or Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (DO.N) - both of which are saddled with old rigs, said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager of the Westwood Small Cap Value fund. The average age of Pacific and Vantage's fleets is three years, compared with 16 years across the industry, said Leslie Cook, a consultant at Quest Offshore Resources.Pacific spokeswoman Amy Roddy acknowledged the company's rigs are attractive but said ""we do not have a plan or desire to be taken over.""Diamond may have the most financial flexibility to make an acquisition because the company does not have to set aside money for new rig payments, said Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai.Diamond, which did not comment, has just one ultra-deepwater rig on order, while Transocean has seven.Any buyers are more likely to save dwindling cash balances and take out whole companies in stock rather than pay cash for individual assets, even those of bankrupt companies, analysts said.

The dividend cut was expected to improve future net cash flow by about $615 million per year, Chief Executive Clay Williams said in a statement on Monday. The company forecast a 20 percent fall in first-quarter revenue from the fourth quarter. This would imply a first-quarter revenue of about $2.16 billion, based on fourth-quarter revenue of $2.70 billion.National Oilwell, which laid off more than 21 percent of its employees in 2015, said in February that the oil price slump would weigh on its order book for the ""foreseeable future"" as customers clamp down on spending.
