0,"  * Will look at other financing channels if necessary-CEO* Will buy more overseas retail, entertainment brands-CEO* Fosun, Prudential to launch China real estate ventureBy Kazunori TakadaSHANGHAI, Jan 22 Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd reassured investors on Wednesday that it has enough cash on hand to fund the 1 billion euro ($1.35 billion) purchase of the insurance arm of a Portuguese state bank and it will continue to buy foreign assets to expand its overseas reach.Rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Fosun's debt under review for a possible downgrade, citing uncertainties over its funding plan for the purchase of the insurance unit of Caixa Geral de Depositos SA which comes after a series of investments last year.Liang Xinjun, chief executive of Fosun, declined to disclose its funding plan for the deal, but said the company has enough cash on hand to pay for it. ""Our own balance sheet is fully capable of paying for it, but we will also consider other funding channels,"" he told Reuters in an interview, adding the firm saw strong growth in profit last year which will help its balance sheet. The 2013 financial results have not yet been published.Fosun had 20 billion yuan ($3.31 billion) in cash as of 2012 and 10 billion yuan of securities assets which it could sell if needed, Liang said.Liang was speaking after announcing a plan to launch a real estate joint venture with Prudential Financial Inc which will target urban projects in China. The companies did not give a size for their investment, but said without elaborating that they also expect to work together on real estate projects outside of China. The real estate venture is the latest move by Fosun which is aiming to become a Chinese version of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc by using insurance investments as a base to fund long-term investments in larger companies.Fosun's chairman, Guo Guangchang, said the Prudential deal ""marks a solid step for Fosun to develop Warren Buffet's model.""Co-founded by Guo, Liang and two classmates from Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University in 1992 with capital of just $4,000, Fosun initially set up as a market research firm. It then moved into the pharmaceutical business in 1997 before expanding further into areas like steel, retail, mining and insurance. Both Guo and Liang are ranked among China's top billionaires, according to Forbes.Fosun, which is headquartered in Shanghai, is currently bidding to acquire French resort company Club Mediterranee SA , after paying $725 million for One Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York last year. It also obtained a 9.5 percent stake in Greece's largest jewellery retailer Folli Follie    in 2011. Liang said Fosun will continue to buy overseas assets in sectors such as retail, entertainment and finance to be brought over to the Chinese market.""In the future, while continuing our investment on luxury brands, we will also consider brands of experimental consumption and retail financing,"" he said.Fosun also holds stakes in China's Yongan Property Insurance Co, Hong Kong-based Peak Reinsurance Co, and has formed a private equity venture with U.S. buyout firm the Carlyle Group LP.",2014-01-22,PRU,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 5:39am EST",UPDATE 1-China's Fosun says has enough cash to fund Portuguese insurance deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/fosun-prudential-idUSL3N0KU25L20140122?type=companyNews

5,"   By Tim McLaughlin | March 26  March 26 Bets on financial companies and Europe's beat-up economy helped maintain a decade-long winning streak at the Delaware Extended Duration Bond Fund rolling in 2013.The $603 million Delaware fund recently received the U.S. Lipper 2014 Excellence in Fund Management award. It swept Lipper's 3-year, 5-year and 10-year categories for corporate debt BBB-rated funds.The fund has been the top dog in a field with some big stars, including Dan Fuss, whose track record at Loomis Sayles has earned him the nickname ""The Buffett of Bonds.""""The fixed income team at Delaware has done an outstanding job delivering top performance in a field crowded with talent,"" said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Lipper Americas Research. He also cited Mark Kiesel at Pimco as a tough competitor.Tjornehoj said the Delaware fund dives into longer maturities and emerges with terrific results.""Relative to many of its peers, it's not the smoothest ride for investors,"" Tjornehoj said. ""But over the long run, they've actually delivered less volatility than the fund's benchmark while still beating it substantially by almost two percentage points per year over the last ten years.""The Delaware fund can also be contrarian, not unlike a stock picker who looks for value in places that other investors flee, said Tom Chow, senior vice president and chief investment officer of corporate credit at Delaware Investments. The company is part of Macquarie Group Ltd.""We know what's in the benchmark. But we don't just invest in names in the benchmark. We do our own homework,"" Chow said. In the fiscal year ended July 31, the fund had plenty of exposure to Europe, despite its instability. The fund benefited from investments in Spanish telecommunications provider Telefonica and Italian wireless operator Wind Telecom  as it focused on industries with defensive credit characteristics, such as steady cash flow.""Credit markets are a fascinating place,"" Chow said. ""There are all shades of colors, rather than black and white. It's what keeps things interesting.""The fund's average annual return over the past 10 years was 8.3 percent as of March 25, easily beating the 5.15 percent return on the Barclays Long U.S. Corporate Index. The fund's net expense ratio is 0.96 percent on an annual basis.As an investor in corporate debt, the fund looks for stability and consistency, Chow said.""We don't necessarily need growth for the company to meet their obligations to us,"" Chow said. The fund says it takes a bond-by-bond approach to find undervalued issuers but stays away from debt with unattractive risk-return profiles.Over the past year, the fund saw strength in the financial sector. Bonds of U.K.-based bank Lloyds TSB Bank Plc  and U.S. insurance companies American International Group Inc  and MetLife Inc helped lift the fund's performance. Another U.S. insurance provider, Prudential Financial Inc, also boosted the fund's results, according to disclosures to investors.TEAMWORK OFFSETS RISK  The fund is supported by what Chow describes as a flat organization of 85 people. Portfolio managers, traders and researchers work together constantly to protect the fund from being whipsawed by risk.They have conversations about bond credit quality daily, if not hourly, Chow said.As the U.S. economy stabilizes, Chow has been watching how some corporate management teams become more preferential toward stock investors versus debtholders. Examples include borrowing money at historically low interest rates to repurchase company stock or for corporate takeovers.Those kinds of moves can boost shareholder value and won't likely become a problem for debtholders in A-rated companies, even if the economy sours or operations encounter headwinds. But companies with higher leverage and less resources may not be as resilient, Chow said.""If operations slow down, you generate less cash. That can turn into a problem for bondholders,"" he said.During the 2013 fiscal year, the fund was hurt by exposure to Barrick Gold Corp, the world's biggest gold miner. A 28 percent dive in bullion prices caught producers by surprise, putting balance sheets under stress.Delaware bond funds, including the extended duration fund, sidestepped some of Barrick's problems by being nimble.""We actively managed the funds' positions in these holdings, periodically increasing the funds' exposure at lower prices while reducing the funds' allocations as the securities began to recover,"" Delaware Investments said in its annual report to bond fund investors.

12,"   By Linda Stern | NEW YORK, July 16  NEW YORK, July 16 Is there a target on the back of my dress? Because it feels like there is a target on the back of my dress.It was painted there by the financial services industry, which has grown hyper-aware of the fact that women have a lot of money and are about to have a lot more.According to a 2009 study from the Boston College's Center on Wealth and Philanthropy, women will inherit 70 percent of the money that gets passed down over the next two generations, and that excludes the increasing amounts they earn on their own. Women already own more than half of the investible assets in the United States.Companies like Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, Prudential Financial Inc and TD Ameritrade are studying the investing behavior of women, in the hopes of winning more of our dollars.They know that when a husband dies, his widow often switches money managers.Indeed, the Certified Financial Planning Board of Standards is trying to lure more women to the business of financial advice.Sallie Krawcheck, who ran Merrill at Bank of America, recently bought a women's network and started a mutual fund that seeks to invest in companies led or heavily influenced by women.Last week, Barclay's Bank PLC moved in the same direction, creating a Women in Leadership index and related investments.It's great to be wooed, but it's also scary to be the focus of a great marketing effort. It could all end badly if the industry simply pink-washes inferior financial products.Here are a few bits of advice for women and Wall Street, as they circle each other warily: QUESTIONS There will be questions. Women are infamous in some financial advisory circles because we ask so many more questions than men. That is good. Do not invest in something you don't understand. Advisers who want us to invest in complex products and services need to be willing to explain them clearly and simply.FEMALE ADVISERS NOT NECESSARY We don't need our advisers to be women. It's not like going to a gynecologist. A male financial adviser is fine with me, as long as he's competent, straightforward and good with my money. We also don't need pink folders for our statements or ladies' investment products. We like green, and want the products and services that will secure our money and make it grow.Funds that invest in women-led companies may do well in the future; there's some research that diverse boards govern winning companies. But women and men should be cautioned not to be over-dependent on niche funds and not to overpay for them.KEEP COSTS LOW Women control most household income and tend to be price and budget conscious. So don't try to win us with high-priced mutual funds when there are less expensive ones that do the job. Don't charge us a lot to recommend a generic plain-vanilla index fund portfolio we could find on our own.WOMEN, WORRY LESS Survey after survey reveal that women are more afraid of managing money than men (which is not the same thing as being worse at it) and they are more afraid of market risks than are men.Women keep a lower proportion of their money in stocks than men do, even though women live longer and the stock market has long proven itself to be the best place for long-term investors to keep money.ADVISERS, WORRY MORE A good adviser won't prey on those fears; she or he will help female clients overcome their worries and invest in low-cost products that balance risks and rewards.And if they don't? There's another new company out there that is explicitly targeting women investors.  It's called FireMyAdvisor.com.

14,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to $600  million of senior unsecured notes issued by Prudential Financial, Inc. (PFI).  The Rating Outlook for PFI is currently Positive.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are equivalent to the ratings assigned to PFI's existing senior  unsecured notes, and reflect standard notching based on Fitch's rating criteria. Fitch expects proceeds from the debt issuance to be used for general corporate  purposes including funding debt maturing in 2015. As a result, Fitch's view of  financial leverage is not impacted by this issuance.   PFI's balance sheet fundamentals remain consistent with rating expectations, and  recent financial performance has been strong.  The ratings assigned to PFI and  its subsidiaries continue to reflect the company's very strong competitive  position in the U.S. and Japanese life insurance markets. The Positive Outlook reflects PFI's improved operating and earnings profile,  which has benefited from recent acquisitions and improved market conditions.   Recent financial performance has exceeded rating expectations, and has led to a  material improvement in key credit metrics associated with interest coverage.   Fitch expects PFI's ability to sustain recent improvement in financial  performance, and progress on reducing financial leverage could lead to an  upgrade within the next 12-24 months. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Reduction in financial leverage to 28% or below;  --GAAP interest coverage remaining in the 8x-10x range (based on pre-tax  adjusted operating earnings);  --Stated NAIC RBC ratio remaining near current levels;  --TFC ratio at or below 1.3X;  --Japan's solvency margin ratio remaining above 700%; --No deterioration in the creditworthiness of PFI's Japan business.  Triggers that could result in a downgrade include:  --Financial leverage above 35%;  --Total financing and commitments ratio above 1.5x;  --GAAP interest coverage ratio below 5x;  --Stated NAIC RBC ratio below 400%; --Japan's solvency margin ratio below 600%. Fitch has assigned the following rating:  Prudential Financial, Inc. --$350 million of 2.35% senior notes due 2019 'BBB+'; --$250 million of 4.60% senior notes due 2044 'BBB+'.

36,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Prudential Financial,  Inc.'s (PFI) 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR).  In addition, Fitch has affirmed  the 'A+' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating assigned to Prudential  Insurance Company of America and certain other affiliated insurance companies.  The Rating Outlook is Positive.   A full list of ratings can be found at the end  of this release.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations of PFI and its affiliates' (collectively referred to as PFI)  ratings reflect the company's strong balance sheet fundamentals, and very strong  competitive position in the U.S. and Japan life insurance markets.  PFI's strong  positions relative to competitors provide significant scale advantages  associated with expense efficiencies, spread of risk, and access to  distribution.  Primary rating concerns include challenges associated with ongoing low interest  rates, weak macroeconomic conditions in Japan that may hinder growth in earnings  and revenue, and leverage metrics that have improved over the past year but  remain high relative to the positive outlook.   Fitch views the statutory capital adequacy of PFI's insurance subsidiaries as  strong.  At year-end 2014, PFI reported a combined risk based capital (RBC)  ratio for its U.S. insurance subsidiaries of 502%. PFI's two Japanese insurance  subsidiaries, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar, reported solvency margin ratios  of 772% and 937%, respectively. Fitch expects statutory capital will be maintained at current levels over the  near term subject to further clarity on pending prudential standards associated  with PFI's designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) as a  systemically important financial institution (SIFI). PFI has maintained a strong liquidity profile at both the holding company and  insurance subsidiary levels. Holding company liquidity has benefited from an  increasingly diverse stream of cash flows sourced from domestic and  international insurance operations, as well as non-insurance operations (namely  asset management). PFI targets minimum net holding company cash at $1.3 billion. PFI's financial leverage has trended down over the past year to approximately  29%, but remains high relative to the positive outlook. Total leverage as  measured by total financing and commitments ratio (TFC) is above average at  approximately 1.3x. The Positive Outlook reflects PFI's improved operating and earnings profile in  recent years, which has benefited from recent acquisitions and improved market  conditions.  Recent financial performance has exceeded rating expectations, and  has led to a material improvement in key credit metrics associated with interest  coverage and cash flow.  Fitch expects PFI's ability to sustain recent  improvement in financial performance and make further progress on reducing  financial leverage could lead to an upgrade within the next 12-18 months.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: sustained reduction  in financial leverage to 28% or below; GAAP interest coverage remaining in the  8x - 10x range (based on pre-tax adjusted operating earnings); stated NAIC RBC  ratio remaining near current levels; TFC ratio at or below 1.3X; Japan solvency  margin ratio remaining above 700%; and no deterioration in the creditworthiness  of PFI's Japan business, including a downgrade in Japan's sovereign rating.  Triggers that could result in a downgrade include: financial leverage above 35%;  TFC above 1.5x; GAAP interest coverage ratio below 5x; stated NAIC RBC ratio  below 400%; and Japan solvency margin ratio below 600%. The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if PFI fails to reduce financial  leverage to 28% or below by mid-year 2016. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Positive Outlook:  Prudential Financial, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior notes at 'BBB+'; --Junior subordinated notes at 'BBB-'.  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --CP at 'F2'.

39,"  (Corrects executive name in fifth paragraph to ""Nitin"" from ""Nitish"")MUMBAI, March 22 India's Edelweiss Asset Management has bought J.P. Morgan Asset Management's India unit, the two firms said on Tuesday, in the latest example of consolidation in the country's fragmented, but reviving, mutual funds industry.Neither firm disclosed the terms of the deal, but two sources familiar with the transaction said J.P. Morgan's business was valued at around 2 percent of assets under management, or 1.4 billion rupees ($20.99 million).Investments into mutual funds by domestic retail investors have surged as a period of low inflation is pushing individuals to search for alternatives to traditional physical assets such as gold and real estate.That is raising expectations of more deals among India's more than 40 asset managers, especially by foreign players looking to exit given the relatively small size of their operations. ""It's the right opportunity, and it gives us critical size,"" Nitin Jain, CEO of Global Asset and Wealth Management at Edelweiss Group told Reuters.""A lot of retail savings are moving towards the mutual fund space, and that's a big theme we are playing for."" With the acquisition of J.P. Morgan's assets under management of 70.8 billion rupees ($1.06 billion), Edelweiss more than quadruples its domestic funds business, bringing its total assets to 87.6 billion, according to a statement by Edelweiss.About 35-40 percent of J.P. Morgan Asset Management's assets were invested in equities, while the rest was is debt, and the Indian firm will absorb the U.S. firm's around 70-strong team, Jain added. Mutual funds in India have seen net inflows of 2.07 trillion rupees in the current financial year, with 822.52 billion rupees  going into equity funds alone.The fortunes of India's asset management sector have revived since 2014, when stock markets started a powerful rally, ending years of scant retail interest in mutual funds.India's mutual funds industry has already seen a slew of deals, including Prudential Financial Inc's purchase of Deutsche Asset Management's India unit last year.

47,"  (Adds Prudential spokesman comment, paragraph 9)By Lindsay DunsmuirWASHINGTON, June 3 Major insurers American International Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc  would be required to hold enough capital to head off risks to the U.S. financial system as part of a regulatory shakeup of the insurance industry proposed by the Federal Reserve on Friday.The U.S. central bank gained regulatory authority over the two systemically important insurance companies and 12 insurance firms that own banks as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law designed to strengthen U.S. oversight of Wall Street.Under the proposals, insurance firms that own banks will also face a new set of capital standards. Details on capital requirements for the two types of insurers overseen by the Fed have yet to be determined.The proposals, which have been five years in the making, seek to force the companies to have enough capital on hand to ward off excessive borrowing or insolvency and prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. AIG and Prudential have been deemed ""too big to fail"" because of the outsized threat they pose to financial stability.For them, the Fed proposes a consolidated approach with firms' assets and liabilities categorized into segments based on potential risk with those that pose a higher threat requiring more capital against them.Under a separate proposal, they would also have to comply with new corporate governance and risk-management standards including undergoing regular liquidity stress testing, providing comprehensive cash flow projections and developing contingency funding plans should there be a liquidity crunch. They would also need to maintain a 90-day liquidity cash buffer. Both companies' stocks were little changed following the release of the proposals. AIG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A Prudential spokesman said in a statement: ""We view this as a positive step forward that recognizes the underlying economics of our businesses.""As insurance companies that own banks are generally less complex and have fewer international activities, the Fed plans a ""building block"" approach in which they would aggregate the capital across a firm's different units to calculate a single requirement. The proposed two-tier framework for the separate types of firms ""reflects the different risks they pose to the safety and soundness of depository institutions and to the financial system more generally,"" Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said in a statement.He added that the central bank had adopted such an approach to avoid unnecessary compliance costs on those who pose the least risk.The Fed currently oversees roughly one quarter of the $8 trillion U.S. insurance industry.MetLife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, was previously categorized as systemically important, but a federal judge struck down that designation in March.

60,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Prudential Financial,  Inc.'s (PFI) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior debt ratings to 'A' and  'A-', with a Stable Outlook, respectively, from 'A-' and 'BBB+'. In addition,  Fitch has upgraded the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating assigned to  Prudential Insurance Company of America and certain other affiliated insurance  companies to 'AA-' from 'A+', with a Negative Outlook. A full list of ratings  can be found at the end of this release.  The IFS ratings encompass PFI's insurance companies operating in the U.S. and  Japan, which are considered ""core"" based on Fitch's criteria, and are rated on a  consolidated basis. The Negative Outlook reflects the consolidated group's large  exposure to Japan, whose sovereign rating is 'A'/Negative Outlook. A downgrade  of Japan's sovereign rating would likely result in the downgrade of PFI's IFS  ratings.  The Rating Outlook pertaining to PFI's holding company ratings is Stable, and  reflects Fitch's view that a downgrade of the IFS ratings triggered by a Japan  sovereign downgrade would not impact PFI's holding company ratings as directly.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of PFI's ratings reflects a sustained improvement in the company's  business and earnings profile in recent years, as it has benefited from recent  acquisitions in the U.S. and internationally.  Further, PFI has made material  progress in recent years to reduce both total and financial leverage, and it is  expected that the company will continue to take steps to further reduce leverage  across the organization over the intermediate term.  PFI's very strong business profile considers the company's market-leading  positions in several major life insurance segments in the U.S. and Japan which  provide PFI significant scale advantages associated with expense efficiencies,  spread of risk, access to distribution, and the ability to invest in its  businesses. Organic and acquisition related growth in recent years has improved  diversification and stability of earnings, revenues, and risk, and has  materially reduced the company's exposure to more volatile businesses, such as  U.S. variable annuity and run-off long-term care businesses.  A key rating sensitivity in recent years has been PFI's persistently high levels  of financial and operating debt used throughout the organization. Over the past  four years, PFI has reduced total debt by almost 30% on an absolute basis, and  financial leverage ratio has declined to approximately 26% at Sept. 30, 2016,  based on Fitch's methodology. Fitch expects PFI to make further progress  reducing outstanding debt and anticipates that financial leverage will decline  further over the intermediate term.  Based on PFI's improved earnings profile and reduced financial leverage, the  company's interest coverage metrics have improved in recent years to levels  consistent with current rating expectations. The level and diversification of  subsidiary cash flows to the holding company for debt service has improved, with  meaningful dividends sourced from domestic insurance, international insurance,  and asset management.   PFI's ratings continue to reflect the company's strong statutory capitalization.  Over the near term, we expect the U.S. insurance subsidiaries to maintain  consolidated risk-based capital ratios in the 500% range, which is consistent  with rating expectations. The U.S. insurance subsidiaries' capital adequacy  based on Fitch's Prism capital model is scored at ""Strong"", which is somewhat  below rating expectations. Further, we expect PFI's Japanese insurance  subsidiaries to maintain regulatory capital ratios in excess of rating  expectations, with solvency margin ratios above 800%. Fitch expects statutory  capital will be maintained at current levels over the near term subject to  further clarity on pending prudential standards associated with PFI's  designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) as a  systemically important financial institution (SIFI).  PFI's Japan life insurance business accounts for over 40% of total company  earnings. While the earnings profile of this business has been very favorable  and provides strong diversification for the combined organization, the business  is exposed to continued weak macroeconomic conditions. The exposure to Japan  also includes the company's investment concentration in Japan's government  bonds, which are vulnerable to further downgrade of the Japan sovereign rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch views PFI's ratings as partially constrained by Japan's sovereign rating,  and does not envision PFI's ratings being set at levels more than two notches  higher than the Japan sovereign. Thus, a one-notch downgrade of Japan's  sovereign to 'A-' would likely result in a one-notch downgrade of the 'AA-' IFS  ratings to 'A+'. Fitch's criteria allow for some compression of traditional  notching when a sovereign constraint is applied, so a one-notch sovereign  downgrade would likely result in an affirmation of PFI's holding company  ratings. Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: sustained reduction  in financial leverage to 20% or below; GAAP interest coverage in the 12x-14x  range (based on pre-tax operating income); stated regulatory capital ratios in  the U.S. and Japan remaining near current levels; Prism capital score of ""Very  Strong""; and total financing and commitments ratio (TFC) ratio at or below 0.8x. Triggers that could result in a downgrade include: GAAP ROE below 10%; financial  leverage above 30%; TFC above 1.5x; stated NAIC RBC ratio below 450%; Japan  solvency margin ratio below 700%; Prism capital score below ""Strong""; and GAAP  interest coverage ratio below 8x.

61,"  NEW YORK U.S. insurer Prudential Financial (PRU.N) is investigating whether Wells Fargo (WFC.N) employees signed up customers for its life insurance policies without their knowledge, a spokesman said on Saturday.Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission.Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers.Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products. According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission.In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates.The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September.""We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course,” Hoffman said in a statement. The three managers say they were fired in November for trying to escalate their discoveries internally within Prudential.Hoffman said they were fired for, ""appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential’s business with Wells Fargo and Prudential’s decision to examine sales of the MyTerm product."" A spokeswoman for Wells said the bank was investigating any alleged misconduct. ""As we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn’t ask for, we will make it right,"" Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank said in a statement.The lawsuit and the Prudential investigation were first reported by The New York Times.
