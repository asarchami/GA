0,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to weigh in on a dispute between POM Wonderful LLC and Coca-Cola Co. over Coke's labeling of a product marketed as pomegranate blueberry juice.POM Wonderful has accused Coke of falsely labeling and advertising the juice product, saying the beverage giant misled consumers into believing the drink, marketed under the Minute Maid brand, consisted primarily of pomegranate and blueberry juices.POM, which produces its own pomegranate-based juice products, says the drink contained mainly apple and grape juices.The court said in a brief order issued on Friday that two justices, Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito, will not participate in the case. A lower court ruled in favor of Coca-Cola. In May 2012, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that POM may have standing to pursue some state law claims against Coca-Cola.The 9th Circuit upheld the lower court's judgment in favor of Coca-Cola on other federal law claims. POM sought Supreme Court review of that part of the decision. The legal question is whether the 9th Circuit was wrong to conclude that POM, as a private party, could not make its complaint under a federal trademark law when the product in question was regulated under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.The Obama administration filed a brief urging the court not to hear the case, although government lawyers said there were some problems with the court of appeals' rationale in deciding the case.

7,"  * SodaStream shares up on takeover speculation* Experts say Coke could take larger stake in Green Mountain* Make-at-home soda market still small* Green Mountain deal marks Coke's return to in-home soda making   (Adds comment by industry expert, comment by SodaStream, industry background, closing share prices)By Lisa BaertleinFeb 6 Coca-Cola Co's $1.3 billion investment in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc puts pressure on at-home soda leader SodaStream International Ltd  to bolster its position through a partnership or merger with the likes of a PepsiCo Inc or Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.Coke's move on Wednesday to buy 10 percent of the maker of the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer and exclusively sell Coke products on its upcoming cold drink machine  is fueling speculation that the world's largest soda company could eventually buy the rest of Green Mountain, which would spur other deals in the sector, analysts said.The Coke deal eliminates SodaStream's ""best potential partner and creates a new level of competition,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Van Winkle said in a note.Shares of SodaStream rose 7.2 percent to close at $38.35 on the Nasdaq on Thursday, buoyed by takeover speculation.Soft drink makers - who have seen U.S. soda sales decline since 2005 - are warily watching trends such as at-home soda making and so-called water enhancers, such as Kraft Foods Group's Mio brand. They are unlikely to let a rival  get too far out in front, analysts said.""It's tit-for-tat"" with Coke and Pepsi, said Bevmark Consulting Chief Executive Officer Tom Pirko. Pepsi last year shot down rumors that it had approached Israel-based SodaStream with a $2 billion buyout offer.Pepsi declined to comment for this story and Dr Pepper Snapple did not respond to requests for comment.SodaStream said in an email that it viewed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as ""further recognition that custom carbonation is the future of the ... at-home carbonated beverage industry.""While some industry experts hailed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as historic or groundbreaking, Pirko called it a tentative step for Coke, which in the late 1980s launched a home and office soda machine called BreakMate.BreakMate fizzled after the machines were plagued by problems and consumers realized it cost less to buy two-liter bottles of soda at the store.""People shouldn't misjudge this as a revolution in the soft drink business,"" Pirko said of the Coke-Green Mountain deal.     Coke is ""testing the temperature of the water to see if they want to dive in."" Coke has made a handful of bite-by-bite acquisitions - including Honest Tea - to expand the types of drinks it offers.ONE-WAY EXCLUSIVITY While companies such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc have deals to provide coffee pods for the Keurig coffee machine, Coke took the extra step of investing in Green Mountain as it prepares to launch its single-serving cold drink machine as soon as October. Coke drink pods will be exclusive on Green Mountain's new machine, but Green Mountain's machine will use products from other drink makers.The investment decision from Coke ""causes us to wonder if this could be the first step in ultimately acquiring a larger stake in (Green Mountain),"" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a client note. Shares of Green Mountain closed 26.2 percent higher at $102.10 on Thursday. They jumped more than 50 percent in extended trade on Wednesday after the Coke deal was announced.The gains prompted some short sellers to make fresh bets that Green Mountain's stock price would drop. Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, shorted Green Mountain at $128 a share on Wednesday evening.""It is uncertain that the home soda market is all that large and whether it is taking market share,"" said Kass.""The heaviest users of SodaStream use it for sparkling water, as the flavor market and usage has been slow to develop,"" Kass said in a note to clients.John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, called the Coke-Green Mountain deal a win-win, saying it gives the soda company a new avenue for growth with new technology that is cutting-edge and cool.UNPROVEN MACHINE But skeptics point out that Green Mountain's cold drink machine is still unproven, that the price consumers will pay for pods has not been announced, and that Coke's main challenge is to tempt consumers with new, premium drinks.""In our opinion, one of Coke's problems ... is not routes-to-market but innovation in the bottle,"" Stifel analyst Mark Swartzberg said in a client note.Another Stifel analyst, Jim Duffy, estimated SodaStream's global retail sales at about $100 million annually. That suggests Coke's potential retail sales on Green Mountain's new cold beverage machine would make just a small contribution to its net revenue, which was $12 billion in the third quarter.

8,"  * Initial jobless claims decline more than expected* Twitter slumps after results; LinkedIn off after the bell* Green Mountain surges on deal with Coca-Cola* Indexes up: Dow 1.22 pct, S&P 1.24 pct, Nasdaq 1.14 pctBy Rodrigo CamposNEW YORK, Feb 6 U.S. stocks posted their best day of the year on Thursday after a drop in applications for unemployment insurance boosted confidence in the economy and Disney's results overshot expectations.The rally came ahead of the widely-followed payrolls report for January due Friday, which some are expecting to be affected by the extreme weather that hit much of the United States. December's number was a much-lower-than-expected 74,000 and an upward revision wouldn't be a surprise.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 20,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 331,000. While the data has no direct bearing on January's employment report it bodes well for the jobs market and the overall economy. ""Investors recently have been choosing to look at the glass half empty data and not focus on the positives,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.""Bad weather causes cancellations, flight problems, business closings. I'm hoping we get an upward revision to the December (payrolls) number tomorrow, but if we get a lousy number I'm not going to crawl under a rock.""Recent soft data added to jitters about growth in China and a selloff in emerging market currencies and stocks. But a near 6 percent decline on the S&P 500 from its record high last month to the session low Wednesday was seen by some as a buying opportunity, as earnings continue to grow.Walt Disney was the most recent bellwether to beat expectations as its profit topped estimates, sending its shares up 5.3 percent to $75.56. Disney led gains on both the Dow industrials and S&P 500. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 188.3 points or 1.22 percent, to 15,628.53, the S&P 500 gained 21.79 points or 1.24 percent, to 1,773.43 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 45.57 points or 1.14 percent, to 4,057.122.It was the largest daily percentage gain for the S&P 500 and Dow since mid-December. However, the S&P was on track for its fourth consecutive negative week, a streak not seen since July-August of 2011.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, surged 26.2 percent to $102.10. Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain's new cold drink machine. Coke shares gained 1.1 percent to $38.03 while home beverage device maker SodaStream International rose 7.2 percent to $38.35.The Nasdaq also received a boost from Akamai Technologies , which soared 20.6 percent to $57.18 after forecasting better-than-expected results.Bucking the bullish trend, Spirit AeroSystems shares fell 19.6 percent to $26.51. The major supplier of components to Boeing and Airbus, reported a quarterly loss on charges tied mainly to the Boeing 787 program.After the closing bell, LinkedIn shares fell 8 percent following its results and outlook.About 6.9 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.9 billion average of the past five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.On the NYSE, advancing issues outnumbered those falling by a ratio of more than 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, more than nine issues rose for every five that fell.Other economic data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in December as exports fell, which could see the advance fourth-quarter growth estimate trimmed.

10,"   By Angela Moon | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A surge in bets that shares of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters would rise sharply by the end of the week has raised suspicions, coming as it did just hours before news of a partnership deal with Coca-Cola (KO.N).Green Mountain GMCR.O said late Wednesday Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and would help launch Green Mountain's new cold-drink machine, planned for release as soon as October.To be successful, many of the bets - call options conferring the right to buy Green Mountain shares at a specific price before midnight Friday - required the shares to rise to $90 or $95, roughly a 12 percent to 18 percent increase over two days.The shares, which closed at $80.88 on Wednesday before the announcement, were up 26.5 percent at $102.29 on Thursday afternoon. Earlier they traded as high as $110.50.""We noticed the out-of-the-money ones which were definitely a bit suspicious. To wait until the last minute before some sort of announcement to buy something that expires so soon, that does raise an eyebrow,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.A call option with a ""strike"" price significantly higher than that of the underlying stock is described as being out of the money. ""It's safe to say that if they bought (the contracts) anytime yesterday, they easily made over 1,000 percent near the open today,"" Detrick said.The total volume of call options, which generally convey bullish expectations for a stock, surged in Green Mountain on Wednesday, jumping to 53,681 contracts from a recent daily average of about 13,000 contracts, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.The $95 strikes closed on Wednesday at 46 cents per contract. Since one contract accounts for 100 shares of a stock, a purchase of 1,000 call options would cost about $46,000. Those options were trading on Thursday at $10.10 per contract, which would make 1,000 calls worth about $1.01 million. Among the biggest open interest changes were in the $90 strike call, which added 2,688 contracts to bring open interest to a total of 4,553 contracts, and the $95 calls, where volume of 1,695 contracts brought open interest to 2,475, according to Trade Alert.Suspicious activity in options market ahead of major announcements is not new. While some of the bets could be pure speculation, regulators have been increasing their surveillance of suspicious action prior to big announcements.The CBOE's Department of Market Regulation ""does review unusual trading activity on a regular basis,"" a CBOE spokesperson said, but it does not comment on any specific situations. A spokesperson for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined comment.

11,"  * SodaStream shares up on takeover speculation* Experts say Coke could take larger stake in Green Mountain* Make-at-home soda market still smallBy Lisa BaertleinFeb 6 Coca-Cola Co's $1.3 billion investment in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc puts pressure on at-home soda leader SodaStream International Ltd  to bolster its position through a partnership or merger with the likes of a PepsiCo Inc or Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.Coke's deal to buy 10 percent of the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer and exclusively sell Coke products on its upcoming cold drink machine is fueling speculation that the world's largest soda company could eventually buy the rest of Green Mountain, spurring other deals in the sector, analysts said.The Coke deal eliminates SodaStream's ""best potential partner and creates a new level of competition,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Van Winkle said in a note.Shares of SodaStream were up 9.8 percent at $39.30 on Thursday afternoon on the Nasdaq, buoyed by takeover speculation. Representatives from Pepsi, Dr Pepper Snapple and SodaStream did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pepsi had last year shot down rumors that it had approached Israel-based SodaStream with a $2 billion buyout offer.Soda sales have been declining in the United States since 2005, and Coke has made a handful of bite-by-bite acquisitions - including Honest Tea - to expand the types of drinks it offers.While companies such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc have deals to provide coffee pods for the Keurig, Coke took the extra step of investing in Green Mountain as it prepares to launch a single-serving cold drink machine as soon as October. That move from Coke ""causes us to wonder if this could be the first step in ultimately acquiring a larger stake in (Green Mountain),"" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a client note.Shares of Green Mountain were up 26.8 percent at $102.56 in afternoon trading, after jumping more than 50 percent in extended trade on Wednesday after the Coke deal was announced.The gains prompted some short sellers to make fresh bets that Green Mountain's stock price would drop.""It is uncertain that the home soda market is all that large and whether it is taking market share,"" said Douglas Kass, president of hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management. Kass said he shorted Green Mountain stock at $128 a share on Wednesday night.""The heaviest users of SodaStream use it for sparkling water, as the flavor market and usage has been slow to develop,"" Kass said in a note to clients.John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, called the Coke-Green Mountain deal a win-win, saying it gives the soda company a new avenue for growth with new technology that is cutting-edge and cool.But skeptics point out that Green Mountain's cold drink machine is still unproven and that Coca-Cola's challenge has been to come up with new drinks to tempt customers - not to  find ways to tempt them with higher-priced, premium drinks.""In our opinion, one of Coke's problems ... is not routes-to-market but innovation in the bottle,"" Stifel analyst Mark Swartzberg said in a client note.Another Stifel analyst, Jim Duffy, estimated SodaStream's global retail sales at about $100 million annually. That suggests Coke's potential retail sales on Green Mountain's new cold beverage machine would make just a small contribution to its revenue, which was $12 billion in the third quarter.

12,"   By Angela Moon | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 6 A surge in bets that shares of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters would rise sharply by the end of the week has raised suspicions, coming as it did just hours before news of a partnership deal with Coca-Cola.Green Mountain said late Wednesday Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and would help launch Green Mountain's new cold-drink machine, planned for release as soon as October.To be successful, many of the bets - call options conferring the right to buy Green Mountain shares at a specific price before midnight Friday - required the shares to rise to $90 or $95, roughly a 12 percent to 18 percent increase over two days.The shares, which closed at $80.88 on Wednesday before the announcement, were up 26.5 percent at $102.29 on Thursday afternoon. Earlier they traded as high as $110.50.""We noticed the out-of-the-money ones which were definitely a bit suspicious. To wait until the last minute before some sort of announcement to buy something that expires so soon, that does raise an eyebrow,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.A call option with a ""strike"" price significantly higher than that of the underlying stock is described as being out of the money. ""It's safe to say that if they bought (the contracts) anytime yesterday, they easily made over 1,000 percent near the open today,"" Detrick said.The total volume of call options, which generally convey  bullish expectations for a stock, surged in Green Mountain on Wednesday, jumping to 53,681 contracts from a recent daily average of about 13,000 contracts, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.The $95 strikes closed on Wednesday at 46 cents per contract. Since one contract accounts for 100 shares of a stock, a purchase of 1,000 call options would cost about $46,000. Those options were trading on Thursday at $10.10 per contract, which would make 1,000 calls worth about $1.01 million. Among the biggest open interest changes were in the $90  strike call, which added 2,688 contracts to bring open interest to a total of 4,553 contracts, and the $95 calls, where volume of 1,695 contracts brought open interest to 2,475, according to Trade Alert.Suspicious activity in options market ahead of major announcements is not new. While some of the bets could be pure speculation, regulators have been increasing their surveillance of suspicious action prior to big announcements.The CBOE's Department of Market Regulation ""does review unusual trading activity on a regular basis,"" a CBOE spokesperson said, but it does not comment on any specific situations. A spokesperson for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined comment. A spokesperson at Green Mountain did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In addition, the company reported earnings on Wednesday, and expectations headed into the report was for a move of about 15 percent in the shares.

While the data has no direct bearing on January's employment report, as it falls outside the survey period, it bodes well for the jobs market and the overall economy.

I'm hoping we get an upward revision to the December (payrolls) number tomorrow, but if we get a lousy number I'm not going to crawl under a rock.""The recent soft data added to jitters about growth in China and a selloff in emerging market currencies and stocks. But a near 6 percent decline on the S&P 500 was seen by some as a buying opportunity, as earnings continue to grow.Walt Disney was the most recent bellwether to beat expectations as its profit topped estimates, sending its shares up 5.4 percent to $75.61. Disney led gains on both the Dow industrials and S&P 500.

The company said net profit, excluding restructuring and other one-off items, rose to 293 million euros ($400.42 million) last year above an average forecast of 279 million euros in a recent Reuters poll.CC HBC buys syrup concentrate from Coca-Cola and then bottles and distributes the U.S. group's drinks in 28 countries in Europe and Nigeria.Volume dropped 1 percent to 2.061 billion unit cases, at the high end of market expectations, as austerity in Greece and Italy was partly offset by growth in emerging markets, such as Russia and Nigeria. Operating profit was stable at 454 million euros, as significant cost savings offset currency losses. CC HBC said operating profit margin improved for the first time in the past three years.""Based on these results and against the backdrop of continuing economic difficulties and volatility in our territories, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead,"" CCH HBC's Chief Executive Dimitris Lois said in a statement. The bottler reiterated its outlook for free cash flow of about 1.3 billion euros in 2013-2015.Seeking to improve access to capital markets, CC HBC left debt-laden Greece for tax-stable Switzerland and moved its primary listing to London last year.The company proposed a dividend of 0.354 euro per share from 0.34 in 2012.The company's shares trade 20.5 times estimated 2014 earnings compared to a multiple of 16 for Coke's biggest bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises.",2014-02-14,KO,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 3:03am EST",Coca Cola HBC posts first profit rise for three years,http://www.reuters.com//article/cocacolahbc-idUSL5N0LJ0M220140214?type=companyNews

26,"   By Shadia Nasralla and Michael Georgy | CAIRO  CAIRO A militant Islamist group has warned tourists to leave Egypt and threatened to attack any who stay after February 20, raising the prospect of a new front in a fast-growing insurgency in the biggest Arab nation.The Sinai-based Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis group, which claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed two South Korean tourists and an Egyptian on Sunday, made the statement on an affiliated Twitter account.""We recommend tourists to get out safely before the expiry of the deadline,"" read the tweet, written in English, which Egypt's prime minister said on Tuesday aimed to undermine the political process begun after an army takeover in July.Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has said that it does not post statements on social media sites, but statements that appeared on the Twitter account in the past have afterwards surfaced on jihadist websites which the group says it does use.Islamist militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the army deposed Islamist president Mohamed Mursi seven months ago, but Sunday's attack on a tourist bus marks a tactical shift to soft targets that could devastate an economy already reeling from political turmoil.State television quoted Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi as saying Ansar was a threat to tourists. It aimed, he said, to derail the roadmap to elections unveiled by the army when Mursi's fall provoked the bloodiest internal crisis in Egypt's modern history.Ansar has said it was behind Sunday's suicide bombing near the resort of Taba, which revived memories of an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s including a 1997 bloodbath at Luxor, when 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians were killed at a pharaoh's temple.TOURISTS SCARED On Monday, Germany's foreign ministry changed its travel advice, telling travellers to be cautious about going to Egypt. It specifically discouraged travel to the Nile Delta outside the urban centers of Cairo and Alexandria and to the Nile Valley south of Cairo to north of Luxor.Egypt's Western allies had hoped the uprising that toppled president Hosni Mubarak in 2011 would bring political and economic stability to a country at the heart of the Arab world.Instead, turmoil has gripped the nation of 85 million, which has a strategic peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal, a vital global shipping lane.In another sign of instability, an explosion wounded four Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai on Tuesday, state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported on its website. Tourism was a major employer and accounted for more than 10 percent of gross domestic product before the revolt. Visitors are again sharply down since army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi deposed Mursi, Mubarak's successor.Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, Egypt's most active Islamist militant organization, has threatened to topple the interim government installed by Sisi, who is expected to run for president.The Egyptian state and militants are old foes. Islamist-leaning soldiers assassinated President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981 mainly because of his peace treaty with Israel. It took Mubarak years to put down the 1990s insurgency which targeted senior government officials and foreign visitors, gutting tourism.Ansar enjoys tacit support from at least some of the marginalized Bedouin community and smugglers in the Sinai. This has enabled them to survive several army offensives in the largely lawless peninsula.""Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis poses the most formidable security threat in current-day Egypt,"" said Anthony Skinner, Middle East and North Africa director at risk analysis firm Maplecroft. ""This is not only reflected in the attack on the tourist bus in Taba last weekend, but also in the series of bombings in the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions.""In one of the boldest attacks claimed by Ansar, a car bomb killed 16 people at a security force headquarters in the Delta city of Mansoura on December 24. The attack was claimed on the same Twitter account before jihadist sites carried the statement.While security forces have crushed Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood, a political movement that had forsworn violence decades ago, Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has become more brazen.The group has extended its reach beyond the Sinai to cities including Cairo, where it claimed responsibility for an assassination attempt on the interior minister.The group also said it was behind the shooting death of an Interior Ministry general.""This statement, if genuine, would add tourism quite explicitly to the target set already outlined by Ansar, which includes security forces and economic interests of the state and the army,"" said Anna Boyd, an analyst at London-based IHS Jane's.An army source told Reuters that the latest attacks were a reaction to a military offensive which was hurting militants. ""They are breathing their last breath,"" he said.(Additional reporting by Omar Fahmy, Asma Alsharif and Yasmine Saleh; Editing by Giles Elgood, David Stamp and Alastair Macdonald)",2014-02-18,KO,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 1:02pm EST",Egyptian militants warn tourists to leave or face attack,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-egypt-militants-warning-idUSBREA1H0GW20140218?type=companyNews

It will make larger cups of coffee as well as the smaller espressos, popular in Europe, for which the brand is already known.The $8 billion global single-serve coffee market is one of the fastest-growing areas of an otherwise tepid packaged-food industry. Nestle has about 35 percent of the market globally, but its presence in the United States is dwarfed by Green Mountain's Keurig system, which controls more than three quarters of the market.""We'll watch it like we watch all of them,"" Green Mountain Chief Executive Brian Kelley told Reuters at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference in Boca Raton, Florida.Other rival brewers include the MyCafe from Bunn, the Tassimo from Kraft Foods Group KRFT.O and Starbucks Corp's (SBUX.O) Verismo. Green Mountain is planning new machines as well. This fall, it will launch Keurig 2.0, which uses both single-serve ""K-Cups"" and larger-sized ""K-Carafe"" packs that brew 28 ounces of coffee.""We want a brewer on every counter and we want a beverage for every occasion of the day,"" said Kelley, who added that only 20 percent of people in the United States have a single-cup coffee maker. Keurig personal brewers range in price from about $100 to $180. The list price for Nespresso's basic VertuoLine will be $299 and a version with a milk frother will cost $349.TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N) earlier this month sued Green Mountain, alleging it attempted to illegally maintain a monopoly over the pods used in its new Keurig coffee brewers due to be released later this year.TreeHouse and several other companies have made and sold pods for Keurig machines since some patents expired in 2012. ""We think (the lawsuit) is without merit,"" Kelley told Reuters.Separately, Green Mountain plans to launch a machine later this year that makes cold beverages, and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) has signed on as its first partner.

Waller, 55, joined Coke in 1987 from Deloitte.""Gary's a great guy, he's been a great CFO. He doesn't just know the numbers, he can describe the company's strategy as well as an operating guy,"" said Kevin Dryer, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds LLC.The announcement from the world's biggest soda company came hours after rival PepsiCo was hit with a renewed push from billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz to split its challenged North American beverage business from its more robust snacks operation. Coke and PepsiCo are grappling with declining soda sales in the United States, as increasingly health-conscious consumers opt for alternatives like bottled water and tea.Coca-Cola's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, is scheduled to speak at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Florida, on Friday. Some conference attendees expect Kent to discuss Coke's plans to refranchise some of its bottling operations following the 2010 acquisition of its North American bottler, which was aimed at cutting costs, speeding innovation and turning around a sagging market. PepsiCo did a similar deal.While Coke and Pepsi have traditionally moved together on major initiatives, they are currently out of step. Coke has been open about its plan to ultimately franchise its North American bottler, while PepsiCo has not. PepsiCo says it has carefully weighed a variety of corporate changes, ranging from a spin-off of North American beverages to the sale of some bottling operations.It has said that its current structure was best for shareholders since the interplay between North American snacks and beverages benefit its overall business.Coke's shares closed up 0.5 percent at $37.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.",2014-02-20,KO,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 5:23pm EST",UPDATE 1-Coca-Cola CFO Fayard to retire,http://www.reuters.com//article/cocacola-cfo-idUSL3N0LP50B20140220?type=companyNews

32,"  Feb 20 Nelson Peltz has resumed his call to break up PepsiCo Inc less than a week after the maker of Pepsi-Cola and  Lay's potato chips said it would not spin off its North-American beverage business.The snack and drink giant confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP sent a 37-page letter to its board of directors on Wednesday.Peltz has been urging PepsiCo to spin off the beverage  business and focus on its billion-dollar snack brands Lays, Cheetos and Doritos.PepsiCo, like rival Coca-Cola Co, has been battling  declining soda sales in developed markets, especially the United States, as health-conscious consumers reach for non-carbonated beverages such as juices and health drinks.Wednesday's letter outlined why Trian still thinks PepsiCo should spin off its beverage business, the Journal reported. () ""PepsiCo's management and board of directors have spoken clearly on this issue and are fully aligned with our strategy outlined last week,"" a PepsiCo spokesman said in an email to Reuters.Trian, which says it owns about $1.2 billion in PepsiCo stock, also informed the company that it will begin meeting with shareholders ""immediately"" and might conduct public shareholder forums as it tries to galvanize investor support for a split, the newspaper reported. Trian was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.PepsiCo, in its response to Trian's letter, said, ""Our focus is on delivering results for our shareholders, not new, costly distractions that will harm shareholder interests."" Peltz had also urged PepsiCo to create a snack food giant by acquiring Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International, but dropped that push after winning a seat on the Mondelez board last month.Last week, after reporting a better-than-expected profit, PepsiCo's Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said, ""Decoupling our beverage and snack businesses in North America would significantly reduce our relevance to our customers.""The company had said its decision not to spin off the business was taken after an exhaustive review that involved external consultants and bankers.""We are confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value as an integrated food and beverage company,"" PepsiCo said on Wednesday.",2014-02-20,KO,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 1:06am EST",Peltz revives bid to split PepsiCo,http://www.reuters.com//article/peltz-pepsico-idUSL3N0LP1TT20140220?type=companyNews
33,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) and the debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its  subsidiaries as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F1'.  Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Senior shelf at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable. Coca-Cola had  approximately $37.1 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, 2013. The Rating Outlook revision to Negative is due to Fitch's concern with  Coca-Cola's high gross leverage that has been elevated by substantial commercial  paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's gross leverage is weak for the rating category  at 2.8x on a total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis at the end of 2013, up from  2.4x a year ago. Coca-Cola's CP balance remains substantial at $16.9 billion at  the end of 2013, a slight increase of $700 million in the past year. This  compares to $12.9 billion in 2011. The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its U.S.  cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which the company  has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola maintains a comparable  cash balance along with its committed bank lines to provide backup to its CP  borrowings. At the end of 2013, Coca-Cola's liquidity position of $26.6 billion  consisted of $17.1 billion of cash, $3.1 billion of short-term investments, and  $6.4 billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving  credit facility. Fitch views the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's CP program and  lower its net leverage to 1.26x as a key mitigating factor. However, the vast  majority of the company's cash is offshore, making it costly to repatriate if  necessary. Additionally, the CP mix is slightly less than 50% of the firm's  overall capital structure which Fitch believes increases Coca-Cola's financial  risk. Despite the company's good liquidity and on-going market access, the higher  sustained levels of CP and the uncertainty of when Coca-Cola could use cash to  reduce CP balances remain a concern. Coca-Cola has indicated that $20 billion is  the upper limit for its CP program. Fitch believes Coca-Cola should advance a  longer-term definitive plan to address its large CP balance with any reduction  in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels resulting in lower  gross debt. Following its late 2013 refinancing, nearer-term debt maturities in  2014 were reduced. Coca-Cola also used a portion of the proceeds to term-out CP  as CP balances at the end of the third quarter 2013 had risen to $18.8 billion.  Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturities include $1 billion coming due in 2014 and  $3.5 billion maturing in 2015. KEY RATING DRIVERS Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global  beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has 17 $1  billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid,  and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's  beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in  the U.S., growing scrutiny over artificial sweeteners and modest CSD growth in  other developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market  strength in developing, higher-growth geographies with low per capita  consumption characteristics that should provide an important longer-term offset. Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently generate  considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF). For  2013, Coca-Cola generated $10.5 billion and $3 billion (after adjusting for  dividends) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, after generating $10.6 billion and  $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012.  Coca-Cola has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net share repurchases  in 2014, after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. Fitch expects  Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be at least in the $3.5 billion range driven in part  by reduced pension contributions. Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the past with  top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix and  improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global macroeconomic pressure,  higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial sweeteners and weather-related  issues made volume growth more challenging during 2013. Coca-Cola reported that  global volume grew 2%, below the lower end of its long-term financial targets of  3%-4% for worldwide volume growth. Reported revenue and operating income grew 3%  and 6%, respectively, when excluding the impact of structural changes, which is  at the low end of its 6%-8% target for operating income growth. As such, the  global economic recovery remains challenging, negatively affecting consumer  spending, with pockets of volatility across emerging market regions. Reflecting  these challenges, Coca-Cola announced an incremental $1 billion productivity  savings by 2016 that will be primarily redirected for increased media  investments to support the brand, which Fitch views favorably. Ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions given the company's  transaction history. Coca-Cola has material flexibility to engage in smaller  acquisitions through its cash balances and free cash generation. Fitch views the  new 10-year agreement with Green Coffee Mountain Roaster's for $1.25 billion as  a positive for Coca-Cola's operating profile. The shifting secular trends within  the soft drink industry make this investment essential to create an additional  avenue for growth. This provides a defensive position against at-home  competitive threats and enables opportunities for new consumption occasions  across an emerging distribution channel.  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola  Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low  at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the  notes issued by Coca-Cola. RATINGS SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead Fitch  to affirm the ratings with a Stable Outlook include:  --Coca-Cola develops a definitive plan to reduce CP balances and gross debt.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --If Coca-Cola's ratings are negatively affected by a large debt-financed  acquisition or share repurchase program, a reduction in cash and cash  equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP balances, and/or the lack of  a plan to reduce gross leverage over the longer term.  In addition, further negative pressure from increased declines with CSD volumes  in the U.S., greater than expected volatility in emerging market regions,  aggressive excise taxes increases in multiple regions, shift in focus from  pricing to volume, and margin erosion from channel mix shifts could also affect  ratings. Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --CP 'F1'. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

40,"  MEXICO CITY Feb 26 A string of recent acquisitions helped to boost fourth-quarter sales volumes at Coca-Cola Femsa, Latin America's biggest Coke bottler, but the cost of financing the deals led to a 29 percent drop in earnings.Shares of the joint venture of Coca-Cola Co and Mexican retailer Femsa fell nearly 4 percent after it reported results on Wednesday.Without revenue from the newly acquired businesses, sales dipped because of weak consumer spending in Brazil and Mexico and poor weather, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino told analysts on a conference call.To pare down debt, he said, the company will trim its investment this year to between $600 million and $700 million from roughly $800 million in 2013. Projects slated for this year include work on new plants to expand production in Colombia and Brazil.The company reported a profit of 3.066 billion pesos ($234 million) for the quarter, down from 4.320 billion pesos a year earlier. Financing expenses more than tripled to 1.9 billion pesos from 611 million pesos as net debt increased more than six times to 45.2 billion pesos.Most of the debt increase was to fund acquisitions in Brazil, Coke Femsa said.A decline in the value of the peso against the U.S. dollar also drove up financing costs, since about one-fifth of the company's debt is in dollars. ""We want to reduce our debt,"" Trevino said on the call, explaining it was important for the company to maintain its credit ratings so it could continue to place new debt easily.Coke Femsa has been on a buying spree. Last year it acquired bottlers in Mexico, the Philippines and Brazil.Coca-Cola Co has been selling some bottling operations in the United States. Trevino said Coke Femsa might be interested in such deals in the future, but its focus for now is in Latin America and the Philippines. The recent acquisitions helped Coke Femsa report an 8.5 percent jump in revenue to 43.24 billion pesos and higher sales volumes for Coke, bottled water and juices.But excluding the new revenue from the acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico, sales volumes slipped 1.1 percent.Coke Femsa expects sales volumes in Mexico to drop between 5 and 7 percent this year as a result of a tax of 1 peso (8 cents) per liter on sugary drinks implemented last year.The company has increased prices by 16 percent to include the tax and may raise them again in the middle of this year, Trevino said.Shares of Coke Femsa were down 3.7 percent at 126.10 pesos in afternoon trading.",2014-02-26,KO,"Wed Feb 26, 2014 | 2:23pm EST","UPDATE 3-Mexico's Coke Femsa's sales rise, profit drops on acquisitions",http://www.reuters.com//article/mexico-cokefemsa-idUSL1N0LV10J20140226?type=companyNews

42,"  By Christine MurrayMEXICO CITY Feb 27 Mexico's Femsa  said on Thursday fourth-quarter profit halved from strong year-ago levels due to higher financial costs at its bottling joint venture co-owned by Coca-Cola Co.The bottler and convenience store retailer said profit fell 48 percent to 4.99 billion pesos ($381 million) in the three months to end-December, from 9.66 billion pesos a year earlier.This was largely due to a large one-off gain it made from its stake in Dutch brewer Heineken a year earlier, but also the cost of financing a string of acquisitions, mostly in Brazil, at its Coca-Cola Femsa joint venture. Femsa's financial expenditures almost tripled from 853 million pesos to 2.46 billion pesos.Shares at Coke Femsa, which is co-owned with U.S. beverage group Coca-Cola Co, are down more than 40 percent from an all-time high in April after weak consumer spending in Brazil coincided with a new sugary drinks levy in Mexico designed to curb rising obesity.At the group level, revenue rose 11 percent to 70.5 billion pesos, driven by strong sales at convenience store division Femsa Comercio. Despite slumping consumer confidence and retail sales in  No.1 market Mexico, the division which runs convenience stores under its Oxxo brand opened 511 new stores in the quarter and total sales increased 13.5 percent from the year-earlier quarter.Chief Financial Officer Javier Astaburuaga told analysts on a call that he expected to open more than 1000 new stores in 2014. He added that same-store sales would trend toward the mid single-digit range so long as the economic environment improves as the year progresses.Mexico's economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter as industry ground to a halt and the pace of services growth dropped. Retail sales in Mexico saw their fastest drop in a year in December.Astaburuaga said total capital expenditure at the group level could reach $1.35 billion this year, with $850 million going to Coca-Cola Femsa.Shares in Monterrey-based Femsa rose 2.07 percent by 1215 EST to 115.22 pesos per share.",2014-02-27,KO,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 1:34pm EST",UPDATE 2-Mexico's Femsa 4th-qtr profit halves on financial costs,http://www.reuters.com//article/mexico-femsa-idUSL1N0LW17X20140227?type=companyNews

44,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) has signed a deal to supply beverages to Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) first China resort, breaking The Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) quarter century monopoly over beverage supply to the U.S. theme park operator.PepsiCo and its partner in China, Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), will exclusively provide beverages to the Shanghai Disney Resort, its first on mainland China which is set to open at the end of 2015, PepsiCo, Disney and Tingyi said in a joint statement on Thursday.Coca-Cola has had a long-standing tie-up with Disney, while it has been at least 25 years since PepsiCo last sold its beverages through the theme park chain, a Dubai-based PepsiCo spokesman said.The deal is only a tiny segment of China's 421 billion yuan ($68.74 billion) soft drink sector, but marks a blow for PepsiCo against Coke in the highly competitive market, where both brands are coming under increasing pressure from Chinese rivals and changing consumer tastes for local flavors.""I wonder what kind of message it sends to Coke globally. Even though the Disney park is only one small thing, China has massive room to grow for the Disney brand. Tying up this deal could mean good things going forward,"" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.Disney said it currently has no plans to ink similar deals with PepsiCo to supply its other resorts, although it is ""actively pursuing opportunities in a variety of different sectors,"" Murray King, vice president of public affairs for the Shanghai Disney Resort, said. The PepsiCo spokesman said he could not comment on whether PepsiCo and Disney planned other tie-ups. Disney has a further 11 theme parks and 44 resorts around the world, according to its official website.PEPSI VS COKE Coca-Cola edges the China market with a 15.7 percent share of China's soft drinks market in 2012, ahead of PepsiCo's 4.5 percent share by off-trade volume, according to data from Euromonitor. China's soft drinks sector is worth around 421 billion yuan ($69.12 billion). Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has also hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N).Coca-Cola remains the soft drinks supplier for Disney resorts outside mainland China. It is the beverage provider for Disney's 11 parks in the United States, Hong Kong, France and Japan, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said.""The Coca-Cola Company and The Walt Disney Company share a long-standing partnership that dates to the first Disney television show in 1950 and the first Disneyland theme park in 1955. Today, our global partnership with Disney is as strong as ever,"" she added in emailed comments to Reuters. Though it retains the biggest market share in China, but local rivals are catching up. Pepsi's partner in the market, Taiwanese Tingyi, raised its market share from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 12.8 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor.Tingyi and PepsiCo beverages will be the sole range of drinks sold at the Shanghai park, a Tingyi spokesman said. All three companies declined to put a value on the deal.The key question for Pepsi is if it can leverage its tie-up with Disney outside the limits of the resort, said Cavender.""If they can do more Disney-themed adverts elsewhere I can see this benefiting them a lot, and the fact Disney switched from Coke to Pepsi here could mean big things for the years ahead in other markets too,"" he said.

49,"  * Pepsi pledge follows similar action by Coca-Cola* Oxfam campaigning directed at top 10 food and drink firms* Land rights are sensitive subject in sugar-grower Brazil* Pepsi ranked 4th in Oxfam survey of responsible brandsMarch 18 PepsiCo, the world's No. 3 food and beverage company, committed on Tuesday to take steps to stop illegal land seizures by suppliers of raw materials such as sugar and palm oil as it tries to improve social and environmental standards.The pledge follows a similar commitment by Coca-Cola  last year and comes in response to a campaign by development group Oxfam that is pushing top food and drink companies to improve ethical standards among suppliers in poor countries. The industry has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years over sourcing of raw materials, attracting criticism on issues ranging from child labour on cocoa farms to the impact of palm oil plantations on rain forests.PepsiCo said in a statement it had worked with Oxfam and other external experts on a new policy to prevent suppliers displacing any legitimate landowners.As demanded by Oxfam, PepsiCo also gave details about the amount of soy, palm oil and cane sugar it buys and the main countries that it sources those raw ingredients from, including Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, India and Thailand. ""These supply chains are incredibly opaque. The companies themselves don't even know where the sugar is coming from. It forces them to ask where their suppliers are getting it from,"" Chris Jochnick, director of Oxfam's private sector work, said.Oxfam said PepsiCo would audit its top sugar supplier Brazil in 2014, followed by Mexico, Thailand and the Philippines by the end of 2016, with a particular focus on making sure local communities give consent before their land is sold for farming. PepsiCo also pledged to source all of its cane sugar from sources certified as sustainable by 2020 and said it would work with suppliers in Brazil and Thailand to that end.Native land rights are a sensitive subject in Brazil and tensions between farmers and Indians have run high since the government evicted 7,000 farmers and their families from an Indian territory last year, starting violent protests.Oxfam has ranked the top 10 food and drink companies according to their policies on issues it deems as critical to sustainable agriculture: the rights of women, small-scale farmers and farm workers, as well as water, land, climate change and transparency.PepsiCo came joint fourth with Mondelez International  in the latest ranking, behind Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola, while General Mills  replaced Associated British Foods in last place.

57,"  SYDNEY Australia's Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA) (CCL.AX) forecast core earnings to fall about 15 percent in the first half of 2014 on weak domestic consumer spending and rising costs in Indonesia, sending its shares sliding to a 4-1/2 year low.The food and beverage company also said it has started a review of its business strategy under the group's new managing director, Alison Watkins, who came to the job six weeks ago.The downbeat forecast comes after CCA in February booked an 83 percent decline in annual net profit, its worst profit in 20 years. The CCA forecast for the decline in 2014 first-half profit refers to earnings before interest, tax and significant items, which was A$373.9 million in the first half of 2013.""The grocery channel continues to be challenging with aggressive pricing activity which has limited CCA's ability to recover cost increases while consumer demand in the non-grocery channel has been soft in the first quarter and there has been a mix shift to lower margin customers,"" Watkins said in a statement.

68,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Adam Jourdan  Strong sales volume growth in China helped The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) beat quarterly revenue estimates as lower-priced, smaller soda bottles and juices attracted more price and health-conscious shoppers in the world's second largest economy.Case volumes in China rose 12 percent in the first quarter of the year, boosted by marketing campaigns around the key Chinese New Year holiday shopping period, helping drive a global two percent rise in volumes.Brazil, India and Russia also saw strong volume sales growth.Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), has been battling falling soda sales in developed markets such as the United States, where its soda sales last year were the lowest since 1995.Analysts said a focus on smaller, lower priced products in China was helping target consumers in fast-growing, smaller cities, where demand is outstripping larger urban centers.""Our newly architected packaging portfolio in China is really working with the smaller packs and the new price points,"" Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent said on an earnings call after the results.A greater focus on health among Chinese consumers also increased sales volumes of the Coca-Cola's Minute Maid Pulpy juice drink brand by 8 percent in the period.Analysts cautioned the strong China results were partly due to weak growth in the first quarter of last year, when volumes were up just one percent due to a slowing economy and rising competition from local rivals.Some Chinese consumers said the smaller sizes were cute as well as convenient. ""The mini Coca-Cola is adorable, I love the small packaging,"" said a microblogger on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo site. Coca-Cola does not break out China sales separately. The business falls under its Asia-Pacific region, the company's second-biggest market by revenue, which accounted for 13 percent of overall sales in 2013.WORLD CUP BOOST Coca-Cola is looking to leverage this year's soccer World Cup in Brazil, where it is a key sponsor, to help revive soda sales which fell one percent globally for the quarter. Its soda brands include Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta.A World Cup-linked campaign has already helped the Brazilian and China markets, the firm said in a statement.Coca-Cola, which plans to invest $8 billion in China in the five years to 2017, accounted for 16 percent of the soft drinks market in 2012. The sector is worth an estimated 487.4 billion yuan ($78.33 billion) this year, according to consultants Euromonitor. The growth in China contrasts with flat sales in North America, the company's biggest market, where an unusually cold winter and a shift away from fizzy drinks suppressed demand. European sales fell 4 percent.Coke said in February it is looking to cut costs by $1 billion annually through productivity improvements by 2016, and would redirect much of the savings into increased advertising and marketing.NEW VENTURES Coca-Cola has also been looking to diversify away from its soda business.The company bought a 10 percent stake this year in Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O - known for its K-cup coffees - to help compete in the home soda-making market, dominated by Israel-based Sodastream International Ltd (SODA.O). The partnership is looking to develop machines to dispense cold drinks such as juices and teas. Coke owns the Minute Maid juice and Honest Tea brands.RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said Coke's global volume growth was ""impressive"" in a quarter marked by harsh weather, a strong dollar and the effects of tensions between Russia and United States.""From here, we believe volumes will continue to accelerate,"" Modi wrote in an analyst note.However, Coca-Cola was cautious, saying unfavorable currency rates would create a seven percent ""headwind"" for both second-quarter and 2014 full-year results.The company's net income attributable to shareholders fell eight percent to $1.62 billion, or 36 cents per share, from $1.75 billion a year earlier.Excluding items, earnings were 44 cents per share, matching the average analyst estimate.Revenue fell 4 percent to $10.58 billion, slightly ahead of analyst estimates of $10.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's shares rose around 4 percent on Tuesday, bringing them back to where they were about a year ago.

74,"   By Luciana Lopez | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), said on Wednesday that safety is a major priority for the rail industry, after a recent spate of accidents raised concerns about how to transport oil safely.""I can tell you that's all they're thinking about,"" the investor said in an interview with Reuters.""We're going to move a lot of crude in this country, and we have to learn how to do it very safely,"" he added.He added that the delay in the construction of the Keystone pipeline was unlikely to prompt additional purchases of tank cars at Berkshire railroad unit BNSF.Earlier this year the railroad said it plans to buy its own fleet of up to 5,000 new crude oil tank cars with safety features that exceed the latest industry standards.Oil by rail has surged in recent years, helped by a boom in North Dakota. Traffic is now running 10 percent ahead of last year at this time, with BNSF accounting for roughly a third of U.S. oil-by-rail traffic.But recent accidents have underscored the dangers of transporting the volatile fuel by train, with Canada now planning to phase out older tank cars to improve safety. COCA-COLA COMPENSATION PLAN Buffett also said, in an interview with CNBC the same day, that he thinks Coca-Cola's (KO.N) equity compensation plan was excessive, but that Berkshire Hathaway abstained in a shareholders vote.Earlier on Wednesday, Coca-Cola said 83 percent of shareholders approved the plan. Critics, most notably activist investor David Winters, said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders too much.As of December 31, Berkshire owned 400 million shares of the company, just over 9 percent of the shares outstanding. Buffett said he and partner Charlie Munger did not want to vote against the plan because he did not want to show disapproval of management, adding that he has enormous respect for Coca-Cola's chief executive, Muhtar Kent.""I love Coke, I love the management, I love the directors, so I didn't want to vote 'No,'"" Buffett said. ""It's kind of un-American to vote 'No' at a Coke meeting. I didn't want to express any disapproval of management but we did disapprove of the plan. The plan compared to past plans was a significant change.""Buffett said he has no intention of selling any Coca-Cola shares.The Coca-Cola board of directors ""respects Mr. Buffett's philosophical stance on equity-based compensation,"" the board said in a statement. ""We greatly respect his views and look forward to continuing our productive relationship with him for many years to come,"" the statement added.Nonetheless, Buffett said that investor activism is getting stronger.""The CEOs are terrified of activists. I can tell you that,"" Buffett said. ""They are all talking to investment bankers and lawyers and saying, 'What do we do about this?'""He denied he had soured on his enormous investment in IBM (IBM.N), and said Berkshire bought some more shares this year, although the purchases did not come after IBM's most recent earnings report. He said he would not rule out future IBM stock buys.Buffett was in New York for lunch with an anonymous bidder who paid $1,000,100 to win last year's ""Power Lunch with Warren Buffett"" auction benefiting San Francisco's Glide Foundation.His New York visit comes ahead of the company's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 3.

79,"  (Adds revenue, background)MEXICO CITY, April 30 Mexican Coke bottler Coca-Cola Femsa on Wednesday said its first-quarter profit fell 5 percent after it paid more on debt from recent acquisitions in Brazil, but revenue increased.The company reported a profit of 2.310 billion pesos ($177 million), down from 2.434 billion pesos a year earlier. Financing expenses jumped to 1.2 billion pesos in the first quarter from 248 million pesos because of increased debt and higher interest rates, Coke Femsa said.The company acquired Brazilian bottlers Spaipa and Fluminense last year. Revenue rose 15 percent to 38.708 billion pesos, helped by a 12 percent jump in sales volume that was driven by bottled water and still beverage sales. Growth in those categories offset a slump in sales of fizzy drinks in Mexico, where the government last year approved junk-food and sugary drinks taxes that have dampened Coke Femsa's sales.($1 = 13.06 pesos at end March)   (Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-04-30,KO,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 8:49am EDT",UPDATE 1-Mexico's Coke Femsa says quarterly profit fell 5 percent,http://www.reuters.com//article/mexico-cokefemsa-idUSL2N0NM0NM20140430?type=companyNews
80,"  The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is likely to revise its controversial equity compensation plan for executives before it goes into effect in 2015, following pressure from Warren Buffett, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), made his reservations about the plan known privately in recent weeks to Coca-Cola's Chief Executive Muhtar Kent in three conversations, the Journal quoted sources as saying.As of February 24, Berkshire owned 400 million shares of the company, just over 9 percent of the shares outstanding, according to Thomson Reuters dataBuffett said last week that he thought Coca-Cola's controversial equity compensation plan was excessive, but Berkshire Hathaway abstained in the shareholders vote. Buffett, in an interview with CNBC, said he and partner Charlie Munger did not want to vote against the plan because he did not want to show disapproval of Coca-Cola's management.On Tuesday, Buffett said that he had spoken to Kent ""multiple times"" and to his son Howard Buffett ""very briefly"" in reference to the equity compensation plan, adding that his son served Coca-Cola shareholders and not Berkshire on the beverage maker's board. Buffett's pressure adds to that from critics, most notably activist investor David Winters, who said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders too much.Coca-Cola had said last week that 83 percent of shareholders approved the plan. Spokesman Petro Kacur said in an emailed statement to Reuters that ""no changes are being made to the plan at this time."" The expected changes include awarding fewer options per staffer each year, so the pool of options in the new plan lasts longer, the Journal said, quoting a source.Another choice could be a longer vesting period for options than the four years the plan calls for.

82,"  (Adds details from meeting throughout)By Luciana LopezOMAHA, Neb. May 3 Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his recent controversial vote on executive pay at Coca-Cola Co and disappointing performance at railroad BNSF, as investors grilled him on his Berkshire Hathaway Inc   conglomerate at its annual shareholder meeting.The investment guru was peppered with questions at the meeting, part of a mostly festive weekend that Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" following concerns that Berkshire last year missed Buffett's five-year growth target for the first time in his 49 years at the helm.Buffett, 83, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 90, took the stage at a downtown Omaha arena as they faced off with the audience and a hand-picked panel often excusing recent worries at the sprawling conglomerate.""Over any cycle we will over-perform, but there's no guarantee on that,"" he said. Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 30 percent.Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire's decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola's equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive.That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket.Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that ""going to war"" would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire's abstention sent an even more effective message.""We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,"" Buffett said. ""I don't think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.""Buffett said he had conversations with Coke's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive.""I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,"" he said.Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis.""I don't think there's anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,"" Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal.""I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,"" he said. ""It's way easier to prosecute corporations - it's somebody else's money, and the prosecution knows it's going to get a win. (Corporations') calculus is such that it just doesn't make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.""WORKING ON THE RAILROAD The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts.That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company's service challenges.""We're making significant investments,"" Rose reassured the audience. Buffett added that Berkshire could spend ""many, many billions"" to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country's largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business.In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions.Indeed, much of Berkshire's growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle.Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co last year for $23.3 billion.""We're very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large,"" Buffett said. ""I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses.""Later, he added: ""What we really want to do at our present size and scope (is) buy big businesses with good management and prices, and then build them over time."" Last year, Berkshire underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett's own preferred measure: gains in the company's book value, or worth, lagged the S&P 500.Shareholders at the meeting also rejected a proposal that Berkshire start paying a dividend, after having not made any cash payouts since 1967.GETTING THERE EARLY The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger talk about business, the economy, and even politics and life.It includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire's holdings, including Geico car insurance, Borsheim's jewelry and Dairy Queen ice cream.

Small quantities of BVO are used legally in some citrus-flavored drinks in the United States to keep the flavor evenly distributed.Coca-Cola said the ingredient was dropped from two flavors of its Powerade drink - fruit punch and strawberry lemonade - earlier this year.

Kavanagh's PepsiCo petition received more than 200,000 signatures and, after the company announced the change in late January, the teenager declared victory.

89,"   By Olga Sichkar and Maria Kiselyova | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is closing two of its four fruit juice plants in Russia in response to falling demand, putting at risk hundreds of jobs in a business which the U.S. company had bought for $276 million four years ago.The company will close the two plants run by its Nidan unit on June 1 and transfer some of their capacity to the other juice unit, Multon, before the year-end, spokesman Vladimir Kravtsov said on Thursday.The plants being closed are located in Novosibirsk in Siberia and in the Moscow region. Some of the unit's 1,000 staff will be offered jobs at Multon, Kravtsov added.""The juice market fell by 5 percent last year and the performance of Nidan was worse than the market,"" said Kravtsov, adding the company had been considering the move for some time and made the closure decision at the end of last year. Coca-Cola bought Nidan, then the fourth-biggest juice maker in Russia, in 2010. Multon, which it acquired in 2005, has two plants with a combined production capacity of more than 790 million liters a year.The Russian juice market fell by 6 percent year-on-year in volume terms in January-September 2013, according to market researchers Nielsen. In addition to falling market volumes, Coca-Cola and its rival PepsiCo (PEP.N) are faced with increased competition from local Russian brands.

""In some ways, (Coke's move) could be a preemptive measure to get there first ... and assert itself in the custom-beverage space,"" Cioletti said.Coke and PepsiCo have been struggling with declining soda sales in developed markets such as the United States as consumers become more health conscious.Under a 10-year agreement announced in February, Coke and Keurig are developing a machine that will serve both carbonated and non-carbonated drinks.

100,"  * FTSE 100 index finishes 0.2 percent higher* Supermarkets advance, bid rumours around Wm Morrison* Coca-Cola HBC falls as results disappoint* House builders under pressure, Barratt downBy Atul PrakashLONDON, May 16 Britain's top equity index edged higher to finish near a 14-year high on Friday, with supermarkets advancing on a defensives-led bounce and bid speculation boosting Wm Morrison.Sainsbury climbed 4.5 percent, outpacing a 3.8 percent gain by Morrisons and a 2.6 percent rise in Tesco shares . The companies were the top three gainers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index.""Supermarkets are the best performers, with vague chatter surrounding a possible bid for Morrisons,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Morrison's advance was helped by mounting speculation that a U.S.-led private equity consortium was weighing a bid for the company, traders said. The Daily Mail's market report noted talk of a possible 6.4 billion pound ($10.8 billion), or 275 pence a share, cash offer. Morrison declined to comment.The sector built on gains seen in the previous session when there was a strong bias towards defensive stocks. These often lag when markets rise, supporting a view that the good times will not roll for long.Frothy valuations are stopping investors from aggressively putting money to work in equities. The FTSE 100 is trading on a 12-month forward price/earnings ratio of 13.7 times, against its 10-year average of 11.7 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows. ""The recent defensive rotation in equity markets underscores our view that the wider risk-on rally now looks tired,"" said Graham Bishop, senior equity strategist at Exane BNP Paribas.The FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent to 6,855.81 points to finish near this week's 14-year high. It fell 0.6 percent in the previous session, taking its cue from Wall Street, which sold off after results from Wal-Mart disappointed and as small-cap shares extended their retreat.The UK small cap index was down 0.8 percent, while the mid-cap index fell 1.4 percent, underperforming the wider stock market.The FTSE 100's gains were capped by losses at bottler Coca-Cola HBC after disappointing results, and as UK homebuilders fell on concerns that authorities may intervene to prevent a housing market bubble.

Britain's housing market has made a swift recovery from the global financial crisis, with prices up about 10 percent in the past 12 months.The fall in house builders, along with a drop in mining shares on growth concerns in countries such as China, dragged the FTSE 100 index down from this week's 14-year high. The UK mining index was down 2.2 percent, with investors switching to defensive stocks.The FTSE 100 index was down 0.1 percent at 6,837.71 points by 1427 GMT, having dropped 0.6 percent in the previous session, taking its cue from Wall Street which sold off after results from Wal-Mart disappointed and as small-cap shares extended their retreat. The UK small cap index was down 0.8 percent, while the mid-cap index fell 1.7 percent, underperforming the wider market.But losses were capped by a strong performance from individual firms. Retailers, often seen as defensive plays, were up. Wm Morrison rose 2.7 percent, followed by Sainsbury , 2.6 percent firmer. Tesco was up 2.5 percent.Morrison's advance was helped by mounting speculation that a U.S.-led private equity consortium was weighing a bid for the company, traders said, with the Daily Mail's market report noting talk of a possible 6.4 billion pound ($10.8 billion), or 275 pence a share, cash offer. Morrison declined to comment.The sector built on gains seen in the previous session when there was a strong bias towards defensive stocks, which often lag when markets rise, supporting a view that the good times will not roll for long.Frothy valuations are stopping investors from putting more money to work in equities.

Russia, CC HBC's biggest market in terms of sales, grew by a high single digit percentage in the first quarter.

This was much higher than analysts' average forecast of a 17 million euro loss in a Reuters poll.The sharp devaluation in the Russian rouble and Ukrainian hryvnia against the euro due to political tensions in Ukraine damaged CC HBC's results.

106,"   By Anna Louie Sussman and Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn, who's from Cleveland, are friendly enough that Brown has been known to rib Cohn for abandoning the Cleveland Indians baseball team in favor of the New York Yankees. The two men first met years ago, and Cohn and his family, who are also Democrats, have contributed to Brown's campaigns.They may like each other, but the two men are antagonists in a battle over whether Goldman can maintain its lucrative role in physically trading stuff ranging from aluminum to coal to natural gas to zinc.Brown, 61, has been a critic of the role that banks, particularly Goldman, play in commodities markets, accusing Wall Street of driving up prices for businesses and consumers. Cohn, Goldman's No. 2 executive, met this month with lawmakers including Brown as well as U.S. Federal Reserve officials to explain why a Wall Street bank's presence in the commodities market is actually good for Main Street.The meetings with lawmakers and the Fed, which haven't been previously reported, show how hard Goldman is fighting to hang on to its commodities business.""For more than 30 years, we have been helping our clients manage commodity and other risks and we believe that experience has given us an important perspective on the policy debate under way today,"" Goldman said in a statement.Goldman reported $902 million in commodities revenues for 2013, up from $492 million the prior year. The bank says those figures, reported in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, do not accurately reflect the way it runs its commodities business.Cohn's meetings come after consumers, including beer-can and steel-railings manufacturers, prompted Brown to hold hearings on the subject of banks and physical commodities through a congressional subcommittee he oversees. Brown has also been considering whether to bring bankers in front of the committee to publicly question their role in the raw materials supply chain, sources said.This week, Goldman said it began a process to sell one part of its physical trading operations, a metals warehousing business called Metro International Trade Services, that has been the center of controversy over its influence on consumer prices.The Metro sale announcement follows exits from physical commodities trading businesses by top rivals including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank AG. Though Goldman is selling Metro, it still would like to hold on to other physical commodities assets. The bank is counting on Cohn and other Goldman executives, including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, to persuade regulators and lawmakers not to force its exit.The Metro sale is meant to rid Goldman of a controversial holding and appease regulators, said Kristofer Tremaine, a former commodities trader and founder of a London-based commodity trade finance fund. Goldman wrote in April to the Fed in response to a call for public comment about possible new rules on commodities trading. ""The letters we and many others sent to the Fed explain the importance to the economy of managing commodity risk and we feel it is important to continue talking with those in Washington who are open to engaging on the subject,"" Goldman said in its statement to Reuters.Being in the physical commodities market give banks insight into supply and demand, potentially making trading more profitable. Critics contend that Wall Street's involvement hurts consumers and businesses, because banks can restrict the flow of material through the supply chain to drive prices higher.During their meeting, Cohn, 53, told Brown that the fears are misdirected. In practice, he said, Goldman acts as an important facilitator between buyers and sellers of commodities. Cohn argued that the bank's role as an intermediary - with the ability to maintain inventories, lend money, be patient with debts and provide hedging products - actually helps the economy flourish, sources said.VICTORY FOR BEER It could not be determined whether Cohn discussed the future of the Metro business with Brown in their meeting. Following the announcement, Brown put out a statement celebrating the potential sale. ""This is good news for consumers, taxpayers, and manufacturers that depend on aluminum,"" he said. ""Banks should focus on core banking activities rather than owning physical assets like warehouses, pipelines, and tankers. Today's announcement is a victory for beer and soft drink makers and for the safety and soundness of our financial system.""Cohn did not respond to requests for comment, and Goldman Sachs declined to make him available for an interview.Metro became the center of controversy after big consumers such as MillerCoors LLC and The Coca-Cola Co accused warehouses and their owners of exploiting London Metal Exchange storage rules to boost rental income, distorting supplies, inflating physical prices of aluminum and costing consumers billions of extra dollars annually. The issue captured public and political attention last year and the Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are looking into the issue.Another congressional panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has subpoena power, is also probing banks' role in the commodities market. And the Fed is considering rules that could restrict such activities, or make them less profitable by requiring a capital surcharge on those it deems risky. Wall Street executives say although the Fed has not said what it wants banks to do yet, the regulator has raised the bar on banks explaining why they should be allowed to stay in such businesses.Cohn also met with Fed staff on his recent trip to explain Goldman's position. One source close to Goldman said its outreach efforts to senators such as Brown were important as long as the Fed is ""being hauled up in front of Congress."" A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.SOLIDIFY POSITION If Goldman fends off new regulations, it could solidify its position as the leading Wall Street bank in the commodities market.Banks that have announced plans to significantly scale back their commodities trading operations have cited regulatory pressure as well as higher capital requirements that are denting profits. Wall Street banks took in as much as $14 billion in commodities trading revenue in 2008, but that figure declined to just $4.5 billion in 2013, according to data from the consulting firm Coalition.Although Goldman is facing those same pressures, the business is known to have been very profitable for it over the long term. In a January earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz described the business as ""too important"" to its clients to give up.""The real victor in the mass exodus of the major banks from commodity trading will likely be Goldman Sachs,"" Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz said in a recent report.Some rivals expect Goldman to feel compelled to exit physical commodities trading. To be sure, Goldman's ability to stay in commodities trading was grandfathered into the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.One senior Wall Street executive whose firm has decided to exit those businesses said it would not be fair to banks that have gotten out in anticipation of new Fed regulations. If Goldman is successful in its push to remain in physical commodities, rivals will see it as proof that the bank - known for its history of senior executives moving to roles in policy and regulation - still enjoys a cozy relationship with the government, the executive said.""Sen. Brown is open to hearing the viewpoints of stakeholders affected by legislation before the Banking Committee,"" said spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak, in an email. ""He hopes that even people he disagrees with will find him knowledgeable, accessible, and open to argument. But anyone the least bit familiar with him knows that he has the same message to all audiences - banks should stick to banking.""(Editing by Paritosh Bansal and John Pickering)",2014-05-23,KO,"Fri May 23, 2014 | 7:39am EDT",Exclusive: Goldman's Cohn takes on Washington to defend commodities,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-goldman-sachs-commodities-idUSBREA4M03L20140523?type=companyNews

109,"   By Esteban Israel and Anthony Boadle | SAO PAULO/BRASILIA  SAO PAULO/BRASILIA May 30 The hacker group Anonymous is preparing a cyber-attack on corporate sponsors of the World Cup in Brazil to protest the lavish spending on the soccer games in a country struggling to provide basic services, said a hacker with knowledge of the plan on Friday.Earlier this week, Anonymous attacked the Brazil's Foreign Ministry computer networks and leaked dozens of confidential emails.""We have already conducted late-night tests to see which of the sites are more vulnerable,"" said the hacker who operates under the alias of Che Commodore. ""We have a plan of attack.""""This time we are targeting the sponsors of the World Cup,"" he said in a Skype conversation from an undisclosed location in Brazil. Asked to name the potential targets he mentioned Adidas , Emirates airline, the Coca-Cola Co  and Budweiser, which is owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev.Reuters had no means of confirming Che Commodore's identity or his affiliation with Anonymous. The sponsors did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the threat.A DDoS or Distributed Denial-of-service is a low-cost attack aiming at taking a website offline by simultaneously requesting access from thousands of computers in order to jam the host server.The threat of cyber-attacks is yet another headache for the organizers of the World Cup kicking off on June 12 in Brazil. The 32-nation soccer tournament has already been marred by embarrassing delays in the building of stadiums and widespread discontent in Brazil over the excessive cost of hosting the  event in a country with deficient public services. In what could be the biggest cyber-security breach since the U.S. National Security Agency allegedly spied on President Dilma Rousseff's personal communications, Anonymous this week posted   333 documents extracted from the Foreign Ministry's computing network.They include a briefing of talks between Brazilian officials and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden during a visit to Brazil in May last year and a list of sport ministers that plan to attend the World Cup.A hacker known as AnonManifest used a phishing attack to break into the Foreign Ministry's databases and eventually access its documentation system, Che Commodore told Reuters. ""Until yesterday afternoon the hacker still had access to the system,"" he said.The Foreign Ministry closed down its email system after the attack and instructed its 3,000 email account holders to change their passwords. Federal police is investigating the breach.A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters on Friday that only 55 email accounts were hacked and the only documents that were obtained where attached to emails and from the ministry's internal document archive.""The problem has been resolved. Nothing important was leaked,"" said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter.But Brazilian diplomats abroad were left without email communications with their headquarters for several days. One diplomat in a European capital told Reuters on Friday the email service was still down.

110,"  * Sponsors signal unease on Qatar 2022 bribe allegations* Allegations cloud build-up to Brazil tournament this week* Sponsors, broadcasters would benefit from move to another venue   (Adds Coca-Cola reaction)By Keith Weir and Ossian ShineLONDON/RIO DE JANEIRO June 8 Sponsors Adidas , Sony, Visa and Coca-Cola on Sunday called on soccer's rulers to deal thoroughly with allegations of bribery to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar, an issue overshadowing this week's kickoff in Brazil.With its four yearly showpiece event only four days away, soccer's governing body FIFA is on the defensive, conducting an internal investigation into the decisions to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 Cup in Qatar. Both countries have denied any wrongdoing.Qatar's bid has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the Cup is played and the tiny country's lack of domestic soccer tradition. If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European club soccer clubs.The signs of unease from some of FIFA's paymasters will raise pressure on the body, led by its 78-year-old Swiss president Sepp Blatter, to get to the bottom of the allegations and tackle underlying concerns about how it is run.""The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,"" said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970.Coca-Cola concurred.""Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us,"" a company statement read.""But we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee.""The FIFA World Cup is a platform that unites people all over the world, inspiring and celebrating the world's most popular sport while creating memorable experiences for athletes and fans. We believe that through our partnership and continued involvement with FIFA we can help foster optimism and unity, while making a positive difference in the communities we serve."" Britain's Sunday Times newspaper has over the last two weekends printed what it says are leaked documents showing bribes were paid to secure the event for Qatar, which Qatar denies.Former U.S. prosecutor Michael Garcia, leading FIFA's internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after this year's World Cup final.FIFA issued a statement from the body's marketing director Thierry Weil as it sought to take heat out of the situation.""We are in constant contact with our Commercial Affiliates including adidas, Sony and Visa and they have 100 percent confidence in the investigation currently being conducted by FIFA's independent Ethics Committee,"" Weil said.""Our sponsors have not requested anything that is not covered by the on-going investigation by the Ethics Committee.""Payment card company Visa, which has a contract as a FIFA sponsor until 2022, said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation.""We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,"" it said in a statement. Japanese consumer goods company Sony took a similar line, saying said it expected the allegations to be ""investigated appropriately"".GOING PUBLIC It is unusual for sponsors to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue and the comments reflect concern over the knock-on effects on their image.""This underlines that companies need to make sure that any high profile association enhances their reputation rather than damages it,"" said Andy Sutherden, Global Head of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies.FIFA, which Blatter has led since 1998, earned almost $1.4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from the sale of broadcasting rights and more than $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners. Sony, Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola are among six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year. Sony's sponsorship agreement, which also included the 2010 World Cup,  expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal.Airline Emirates, whose sponsorship deal is also up for renewal at the end of the year, declined to comment, as did South Korean carmaker Hyundai/Kia.The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari, had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals.Qatar denies Bin Hammam was connected to its bid for the Cup. Bin Hammam has not commented. FIFA has already banned Bin Hammam for life from soccer over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president. That ban was overturned but another was imposed for conflicts of interest.OTHER VENUES FIFA is now facing calls to strip Qatar of the World Cup should Garcia's investigation prove that it bought the votes needed to host the tournament.The United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea were the rivals who lost out to Qatar in the 2010 vote and are all safer choices as former hosts of major sporting events and developed markets for consumer brands.U.S. broadcaster Fox, which paid an estimated $425 million for rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, was already unhappy with plans to switch the dates of the Qatar tournament to later in the calendar year when it would clash with the NFL American football programme.Both fans and sponsors would be likely to cheer a switch to a different venue, although Qatar would be certain to mount a legal challenge to keep the Cup.""None of the sponsors would want it to be held in Qatar,"" said David Peters, managing director of marketing company Dentsu Aegis Network Sport & Entertainment.""FIFA haven't given a great deal of consideration to sponsors. The sport is so big, they are less beholden than other sports,"" he added.

If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European club soccer clubs.The signs of unease from some of FIFA's paymasters will raise pressure on the body, led by its 78-year-old Swiss president Sepp Blatter, to get to the bottom of the allegations and tackle underlying concerns about how it is run.""The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,"" said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970.Coca-Cola concurred.""Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us,"" a company statement read.""But we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee.""The FIFA World Cup is a platform that unites people all over the world, inspiring and celebrating the world's most popular sport while creating memorable experiences for athletes and fans. We believe that through our partnership and continued involvement with FIFA we can help foster optimism and unity, while making a positive difference in the communities we serve.""Britain's Sunday Times newspaper has over the last two weekends printed what it says are leaked documents showing bribes were paid to secure the event for Qatar, which Qatar denies. Former U.S. prosecutor Michael Garcia, leading FIFA's internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after this year's World Cup final.FIFA issued a statement from the body's marketing director Thierry Weil as it sought to take heat out of the situation.""We are in constant contact with our Commercial Affiliates including Adidas, Sony and Visa and they have 100 percent confidence in the investigation currently being conducted by FIFA's independent Ethics Committee,"" Weil said.""Our sponsors have not requested anything that is not covered by the on-going investigation by the Ethics Committee.""Payment card company Visa, which has a contract as a FIFA sponsor until 2022, said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation.""We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,"" it said in a statement. Japanese consumer goods company Sony took a similar line, saying said it expected the allegations to be ""investigated appropriately"".GOING PUBLIC It is unusual for sponsors to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue and the comments reflect concern over the knock-on effects on their image.""This underlines that companies need to make sure that any high profile association enhances their reputation rather than damages it,"" said Andy Sutherden, Global Head of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies.FIFA, which Blatter has led since 1998, earned almost $1.4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from the sale of broadcasting rights and more than $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners.Sony, Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola are among six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year. Sony's sponsorship agreement, which also included the 2010 World Cup,  expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal. Airline Emirates, whose sponsorship deal is also up for renewal at the end of the year, declined to comment.South Korean carmaker Kia Motors Corp, which shares sponsorship of the tournament with its affiliate Hyundai Motor Co, said in a statement: ""We are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations seriously and that the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee will conduct a thorough investigation.""The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari, had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals.Qatar denies Bin Hammam was connected to its bid for the Cup. Bin Hammam has not commented. FIFA has already banned Bin Hammam for life from soccer over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president. That ban was overturned but another was imposed for conflicts of interest.OTHER VENUES FIFA is now facing calls to strip Qatar of the World Cup should Garcia's investigation prove that it bought the votes needed to host the tournament.The United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea were the rivals who lost out to Qatar in the 2010 vote and are all safer choices as former hosts of major sporting events and developed markets for consumer brands.U.S. broadcaster Fox, which paid an estimated $425 million for rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, was already unhappy with plans to switch the dates of the Qatar tournament to later in the calendar year when it would clash with the NFL American football programme.Both fans and sponsors would be likely to cheer a switch to a different venue, although Qatar would be certain to mount a legal challenge to keep the Cup.""None of the sponsors would want it to be held in Qatar,"" said David Peters, managing director of marketing company Dentsu Aegis Network Sport & Entertainment.""FIFA haven't given a great deal of consideration to sponsors. The sport is so big, they are less beholden than other sports,"" he added.

112,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that drink producer POM Wonderful LLC can sue over allegations that Coca-Cola Co(KO.N) has misled consumers over its marketing of Minute Maid pomegranate blueberry juice.The court ruled in favor of POM on an 8-0 vote, with Justice Stephen Breyer recused. POM had filed a lawsuit against Coca-Cola saying it had misled customers by selling a pomegranate blueberry juice even though it had 0.5 percent of the two juices. POM, which makes a drink that is 100 percent pomegranate, said the label would hurt sales for its own product. Although the case pitted two businesses against each other, POM hailed the ruling as a victory for consumers.    ""We believe that when people better understand what they are consuming, they can make healthy and more informed decisions about what they buy,"" the company said in a statement. POM Wonderful also makes food products.Both a U.S. District Court in California and a federal appeals court said that POM could not bring its claims under the federal Lanham Act but the Supreme Court reversed that finding. ""We intend to defend against POM's claims that our labeling is misleading and the evidence at trial will show that our product was not the cause of POM's poor sales,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote on behalf of a unanimous court that challenges such as POM's are permitted even though food and beverage labels are regulated under another federal law, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The lower courts had said that it was the prerogative of the Food and Drug Administration, and not private parties, to object to juice labels which are potentially misleading. Various business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Beverage Association, had backed Coca-Cola in the case. The federal government filed a brief supporting neither side, saying some claims could move forward but not others.Kennedy wrote that, contrary to what Coca-Cola argued, the two laws complement each other. He noted, for example, that the FDA ""does not have the same perspective or expertise in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day competitors possess."" POM has itself run into legal problems over allegations of misleading consumers. In January 2013, the Federal Trade Commission said the company was deceptive in advertising that its pomegranate juice and other products had been clinically proven to reduce the risk of heart disease and other ailments. That case is currently on appeal.Justices do not usually reveal why they recuse themselves in cases so it was not disclosed why Breyer did not participate. The case is POM Wonderful LLC v.

115,"   By Shadia Nasralla | CAIRO  CAIRO Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) expects to start production in five new factories in Egypt and Pakistan over the next 18 months, seeing double-digit percentage growth in sales for both markets this year, its Middle East and North Africa president told Reuters.The U.S. soft drinks maker's investment is a particular boost for Egypt, which is desperate to attract foreign direct investment after three years of political and economic turmoil that has seen its foreign currency reserves shrink and budget deficit swell to around 14 percent of GDP last year.""Egypt is going to be one of our key anchor countries,"" Curt Ferguson said on Wednesday, citing the country's large and growing population as a big positive. ""For sure the other key anchor will be Pakistan.""As part of a $500 million investment plan announced for Egypt in March, Coca-Cola will start constructing a new juice plant in 6th of October city near Cairo next year in a joint $100 million dollar project with Saudi Arabia's Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company.The $500 million will be spent over the next three years, Ferguson said.The beverage group is in talks to buy a plot of land between Cairo and Alexandria to build a plant for sparkling drinks and water which should go online next year, Ferguson added.The rest of the $500 million will be used to increase production at existing plants such as its concentrate factory in Cairo, the only one of its kind in the Middle East, and to cover capital spending. In Egypt, the company wants to redevelop production lines and keep distributing tens of thousands of Coca-Cola branded fridges to small supermarkets every year. Just to keep its business ticking over, Coca-Cola needs to spend more than $75 million a year in the country on such costs.The Cairo concentrate plant exports more than 30 percent of its produce and Coca-Cola wants to double exports from this facility within about three years, Ferguson said, sipping a can of coke light in the regional headquarters in Cairo.When asked about recent tax increases in Egypt, Ferguson said Coca-Cola could live with the tax rates and understood Egypt's need to increase its revenues, but added lower taxes and clear, well-organized economic reforms would help investors.  ""Business needs certainty,"" he said, listing recent presidential elections as helping stability in the country. ""The clearer, the easier, the lower the tax rate, you're going to attract the most investment. It's that easy.""EXPANSION BEYOND EGYPT Surpassing Egypt for its sales growth, Pakistan will see three new plants open in the next 18 months in Karachi, Multan and Islamabad to serve the domestic market with sparkling drinks such as Coke, Fanta and Sprite. ""We watch the needle in Pakistan and almost every month we red-line on what our capacity is,"" Ferguson said, adding he expected sales growth of around 20 percent in Pakistan this year. ""We're just scratching the surface there.""Coca-Cola has also purchased land in the Palestinian Gaza Strip for a bottling factory for which it has already paid $20 million and which should go online in the first quarter of 2015, Ferguson said.The company hopes U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry might open the Gaza plant, Ferguson said, adding the group had received all necessary permits from Israel, which has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip. Kerry has not visited the Gaza Strip since becoming Secretary of State.Further expanding into the region, Coca-Cola has started building its first factory in Qatar for $40 million, to be finished before an expected surge in demand for the 2022 soccer World Cup in the desert country. ""It's us and nine stadiums,"" Ferguson joked of the construction.

120,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Coca-Cola Co may have annual profits of about $9.3 billion, but that princely sum could fall short of what the world's largest soda maker needs to tempt would-be franchisees into taking over more of its regional bottling operations.That is one of the biggest puzzles the Atlanta-based soft drink company is struggling to solve as it prepares to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.North American profit margins will likely show an improvement from the roughly 14.5 percent in the year-ago period, but may still fall short of what is needed to lure more independent bottlers to bid for Coke's North American bottling operations.Following a similar move by rival PepsiCo Inc, which reports earnings on Wednesday, Coke bought back its top bottler in the region in 2010 to streamline decision-making and cut costs.Now Coke has changed direction again and is seeking to sell the bottling operations to franchisees in a bid to shift away from the capital intensive and low-margin business of distribution to focus on what it is best at: branding and innovation.Some progress has already been made on that front. According to the trade publication Beverage Digest, Coke directly controlled 78.7 percent of U.S. distribution at the end of last year. Today that number is lower: In February, Coke announced deals to sell bottling operations in the greater Chicago and central Florida areas. Irial Finan, Coke's head of bottling investments, said at a conference in June that the company was being ""methodical"" in its approach, adding that the company would go faster if it could but wanted to get it right.But analysts say it could be difficult for Coke to hand over distribution to independent bottlers on a wider scale unless its North American profits grew enough to give bottling partners a large enough share to cover their cost of capital.""Right now the profit pool is too low for it to be split up in a sustainable way,"" said Stephen Powers, a beverage analyst at UBS. That is partly because U.S. consumers are buying less soda as they become more health conscious, a trend that has pressured carbonated soft-drink sales for years.The concern may help explain why Coke shares have edged up just 2.6 percent this year, underperforming the Standard & Poor's 500, which is up 6.8 percent over the same period. Powers said he expects North American profit margins to improve in the second quarter from a year ago after a first quarter decline, with the help of the Easter holiday, which fell in the second quarter this year. Margins are stronger outside North America where Coke does most of its business. But the region still accounts for about 45 percent of Coke's cost base, he said.  Investors will also be looking for commentary on pricing during Coke's conference call. The company said last quarter that the overall prices that it charges to customers increased 2 percent globally.    That bodes well for both Coke and PepsiCo, which usually move in tandem. When it comes to soft drinks, ""both have to be more concerned about growing the category than beating each other up,"" said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ""They should play nice.""As of Friday afternoon, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting Coke to earn 63 cents a share on $12.8 billion in revenue. Analysts expect Pepsi to earn $1.23 per share on revenue of $16.8 billion.

Hope persists that the company, which has not unveiled a product in a new category since 2010, will also have another trick up its sleeve, such as the oft-rumored iWatch.   Microsoft is expected to report a slightly lower fiscal fourth-quarter profit, partly due to the acquisition of Nokia's handset business in April, but investors are already looking past that - pushing the stock up to new 14-year highs - and want to hear more details from new CEO Satya Nadella about the recent 18,000 job cuts and get more color on how exactly he plans to reshape the company as a mobile and cloud-focused competitor to Google and Apple.   Verizon is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings. Some investors have been skeptical of the company's reluctance to follow its competitors' aggressive discounts in a near-saturated market. Investors will look closely at Verizon's revenue and churn, or wireless customer defections, to gauge how customers are responding to some of the most competitive pricing the industry has seen. Separately, Comcast, which made a $45.3 billion bid to acquire Time Warner Cable in February, is scheduled to report its second-quarter results.   Beverage giant Coca-Cola is expected report second-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company has posted three straight quarters of sales declines due to weak demand for sodas, but investors have started to see glimmers of hope that the worst might be behind it. Stagnating sales in North America, Coke's biggest market, and the continuing fall in demand for sodas have some investors on the edge. They will be watching out for unit volume growth in developed markets and sales trends in international regions. Coke is expected to marginally miss sales expectations this quarter.

Analysts expect the company to report in-line results driven by the robust sales of the Xbox One exclusive ""Titanfall."" Investors will keep an eye on Electronic Arts' full-year guidance, which analysts expect will remain unchanged, as the company steps up its efforts to rein in costs and bring about margin expansion from digital sales.

TD Ameritrade is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results that are expected to continue to be mixed, with a healthy growth in client assets, continuing low returns on client cash because of low rates and seasonally weak trading (June) trading revenue.     Intuitive Surgical looks to bounce back from a dismal first quarter that rocked shareholders accustomed to solid quarterly sales and earnings growth. Investors will be looking for signs that sales and use of the expensive da Vinci robotic surgical system have picked up after sales fell more than 20 percent in the first quarter, and for an updated forecast, including details of whether expansion of sales in Japan can help offset declines in the United States.   A sluggish housing recovery in the United States is likely to affect Ingersoll Rand's second-quarter results. The company is likely to report lower orders for its climate controls business. Investors will be looking out for order numbers on the company's commercial HVAC business. Johnson Controls HVAC business recorded a 4 percent decline due to lower orders from North America and Middle East in its third quarter    Juniper Networks' first-quarter profit is expected to beat analysts' expectations. The company has been benefiting from higher spending by U.S. telecom carriers on their network. Some analysts speculate that Juniper, which already undertook a round of job cuts this year, could slash more jobs.

Analysts expect CIT to deliver strong loan growth in the long term, but margins to remain compress.   Gannett, the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., is expected to report its second-quarter results tomorrow as the print industry continues its struggle with declining ad revenue and readership.

123,"   By Anjali Athavaley  Coca-Cola Co is still grappling with a problem even as sales of traditional Coke rise in North America: U.S. consumers are drinking less diet soda. The world's largest soda maker said on Tuesday that global sales volume rose 3 percent in its second quarter, boosted by growth in sparkling beverages. Sales were helped in part by the fact that Easter fell in the second quarter this year. But Coke reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales volume in North America, its biggest market, was flatpartly because of a decline in diet Coke sales. JP Morgan analysts had expected volume to be up 1 percent to 2 percent in North America, which accounted for 45 percent of total revenue in the second quarter.Coke's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said that while the drop in diet Coke sales had improved from the first quarter, ""we recognize we have more work to do here.""Coke, like rival PepsiCo Inc, has been struggling with declining soda sales in developed markets like the United States as consumers become more health conscious. In a conference call on Tuesday, the company attributed the slipping diet Coke sales to insufficient marketing, a shift toward natural sweeteners and consumer skepticism about the safety and quality of artificial sweeteners. One bright spot in the quarter: Sales volume of regular Coke rose 1 percent in North America. Kent cited demand for smaller packages of the product, which Coke has found to have generated more ""brand love.""The company said that its still beverage volume in North America - which includes flavored water - grew 1 percent, although juices and juice drinks drew lower volume as Coke raised prices to cover higher commodity costs.

127,"  (Adds detail on sales volumes, sugary drinks tax)MEXICO CITY, July 23 Mexican Coke bottler Coca-Cola Femsa said on Wednesday its second-quarter profit fell 4.6 percent in spite of higher sales as it faced restructuring charges and paid more interest on debt it took on to acquire businesses in Brazil.Femsa reported a second-quarter profit of 2.68 billion pesos ($206 million), compared to a profit of 2.81 billion pesos in the year-earlier period.The jump in revenue, an increase of 14.3 percent to 41.434 billion pesos, was helped by the company's acquisitions of two bottlers in Brazil, Spaipa and Fluminense, and another Mexican bottler, Yoli. Those acquisitions also helped quarterly operating profit rise 11.7 percent to 5.742 billion pesos from 5.142 billion pesos a year earlier.Excluding those three acquisitions, however, sales volumes fell 1.5 percent. The company attributed that drop to price increases because of a new tax on sugary beverages in Mexico. Sales of fizzy drinks in Mexico have slumped this year since the government introduced junk-food and sugary-drinks taxes.Coke Femsa has said it expects sales volumes in Mexico to drop between five and seven percent this year as a result of the 1 peso (8 cents) a liter (34 ounces) tax on sugary drinks. Excluding the integration of Yoli, Coke Femsa said its revenue fell 2.1 percent in Mexico. Latin America's No. 2 economy accounts for close to half of Coke Femsa's total revenue, even after a string of acquisitions outside of Mexico in the last few years.Not all of Coke Femsa's recent acquisitions had a positive effect on quarterly results. The company recorded a 100-million-peso loss related to its participation in Coca-Cola's Philippines bottling operation and a bottler in Panama.Coke Femsa also had financing expenses of 1.61 billion pesos in the second quarter, compared to 1.1 billion pesos a year earlier, and it took on a charge related to restructuring in Mexico.

129,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In the days after its infamously mishandled initial public offering in May 2012, it looked as if Facebook would struggle to become a must-own for fund managers. Now the company's $190 billion market value makes it bigger than such bellwethers as Coca-Cola and AT&T. It's not a member of the Dow industrials, but if it were, it would be larger than two-thirds of that index's 30 members. Shares of the world's No. 1 social network touched a record high of $76.74 on Thursday after earnings and revenues easily topped analysts' forecasts, boosting its market value to nearly $194 billion. That ranks it 15th in the Standard & Poor's 500 benchmark index, just below the $196 billion market cap of International Business Machines Corp. ""A 100-year-old company with real assets versus a company admittedly with virtual assets and they are trading at the same market cap – crazy,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The speed of Facebook's rise to mega-cap status is what's notable. It took Apple Inc nearly three decades to achieve such a market value; Google Inc needed five years.Facebook has only been public for a little more than two years, and only joined the S&P 500 seven months ago. Since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced the addition on Dec. 11, Facebook shares have risen 54 percent.The gains represent a reversal of fortune for the social media company. After a botched IPO that infuriated investors in May 2012, the stock slumped, underperforming for 15 months before finally eclipsing its offering price of $38 in August 2013. Since then, Facebook shares have been unstoppable, doubling in less than a year.""People understand the world is moving to mobile, and when you look at the time spent on mobile, Facebook has the lion's share,"" said Walter Price, senior portfolio manager and managing director of the AllianzGI Global Technology fund, which owned more than a million shares as of June 30.  The firm has leveraged its position by selling put options, or negative bets on the stock, and buying more call options, or bets on the shares rising further. ""This is a momentum stock you can put a P/E on,"" Price said.Facebook's rally has left e-commerce giant Amazon Inc in the dust. That company's value peaked around $187 billion in January, but closed Thursday at $165 billion. Amazon reported disappointing results afterwards, which dragged down its stock by 7 percent, valuing the company around $153 billion.Facebook's market cap is still dwarfed by the roughly $403 billion in combined market cap for the two classes of Google shares, arguably the most similar in terms of revenue generation. However, Facebook tops The Coca-Cola Co by about $15 billion and Disney by more than $40 billion.SHORT, QUICK TRIP   Apple, the S&P 500's most valuable company, needed nearly three decades before its market value finally rose to more than $190 billion, surpassing that level in late December 2009. Google's move was swifter. The company went public in August 2004, and posted a closing market value of more than $190 billion for the first time in October 2007, right around the S&P's peak before the financial crisis.That's not to say there aren't detractors. StarMine, a Thomson Reuters company, sees Facebook as more overvalued than 95 percent of the companies in its stock universe. Using expected growth rates over the next decade, StarMine puts an intrinsic value of $29 on the stock. It has a high price-to-earnings ratio of 42, more overvalued than 90 percent of the stocks StarMine tracks.However, the stock's relentless march has left few willing to stand in its way. Investors betting on the stock falling have dried up. In August 2012, more than 80 percent of shares available for short bets were being borrowed by investors expecting the stock to drop, according to Markit. Now, just 0.4 percent of shares available are being used for short bets.   Of the 43 analysts with recommendations on the stock, 37 are ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" ratings, with six ""hold"" ratings. ""If you were looking to short names that were ridiculously overvalued and people were not even thinking the growth was going to continue, I wouldn't put Facebook in that category,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. ""That being said, do I buy Facebook here? From my perspective, I am a value investor - I wouldn't get anywhere near it with a 10-foot pole.""         That acceptance of Facebook's legitimacy as a successful and viable company makes the comparison to the classic names that now surround it on the market cap list more palatable.""In some respects, Facebook speaks to a demographic shift in the way retailing, social media and virtually every other component of people’s lives is being bundled,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. ""Investors are starting to see the brilliance of this platform in ways that haven’t to date really captured the imagination of many.""

131,"  (Corrects figures in paragraph 3)By Adam Jourdan and Clare BaldwinSHANGHAI/HONG KONG, July 29 With green-tea flavoured toothpaste and pickled plum juice, an army of Chinese retailers is tapping local tastes to whittle away market share from global rivals that are banking their future growth on the world's second-largest consumer market.Senior executives at companies such as The Coca-Cola Co , Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co  are being forced to adapt as the challenge posed by local firms intensifies in a slowing economy.Last year, China's 1.15 trillion yuan ($185.31 billion) consumer goods market grew at 7.4 percent annually, half the rate of three years ago, according to a report this month from Bain & Company and Kantar World Panel.In this tougher market, both local and foreign brands are targeting the same customers, and increasingly, the domestic firms are winning: nearly two-thirds of foreign brands surveyed lost market share in China last year, according to the report.""The good domestic brands are closing the gap really quickly and are able to play off the idea that they know how to develop something that a Chinese person is going to want,"" said Ben Cavender, a principal at China Market Research Group.Understanding the needs of Chinese consumers has given local companies an edge. Privately owned Jiaduobao Group (JDB) makes canned herbal tea which it says can put out internal ""fires"", playing on a concept in traditional Chinese medicine. The firm also sponsors a popular TV talent show, ""The China Voice"".""Our campaign around 'fearing internal fire' has helped JDB herbal tea become the highest selling canned drink in China...,"" said Wang Yuegui, a senior executive at the firm.JDB accounted for 6.1 percent of the soft drinks market in 2013 by value, up from 4.2 in 2009, according to data from consumer consultancy Euromonitor. Coca-Cola had 13.1 percent, while Pepsi had 3.9 percent. GREEN TEA TOOTHPASTE With a population of 1.2 billion and a rapidly expanding middle class, China is the largest consumer goods market after the United States and even with a slowing economy, remains key to the future of global brands.China's economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in 24 years this year, but that's still 7.4 percent. The U.S. economy, by comparison, is expected to grow at just 1.7 percent.Many of the Chinese firms taking on the international conglomerates are little-known abroad, but their local know-how is helping them broaden their appeal at home.Hawley & Hazel, a joint venture owned by Colgate-Palmolive and its Hong Kong-based founders, makes Darlie toothpaste which leads the domestic market according to Kantar and Bain, playing to Chinese tastes with green tea and jasmine flavours. Another popular toothpaste brand is made by Yunnan Baiyao Group Co Ltd, which uses its history as one of the biggest and oldest traditional Chinese medicine makers in the country as a selling point.Taiwan-based drinks maker Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp , which bottles and distributes PepsiCo Inc  products in China, also says it makes a point of developing traditional Chinese flavours such as snow pear and pickled plum.""There are a lot of things that Chinese prefer localized,"" said Bruce Rockowitz, chief executive of Global Brands Group  and former CEO of global sourcing firm Li & Fung. ""Foreign brands haven't adapted well enough.""In a bid to fend off competition, market leader Coca-Cola launched small-sized products, which helped boost its China sales. It also offered shoppers discounts, like rival PepsiCo.Coca-Cola, however, saw its market share drop more than 3 percentage points to 13.1 percent last year, while PepsiCo Inc  fell 1.8 percentage points to 3.9 percent, according to Euromonitor data. Coca-Cola International president Ahmet Bozer said he was happy with the company's 9 percent sales volume growth in China during the second quarter.""From a competitive standpoint, we are quite pleased,"" he said on a conference call with reporters.Pepsi said in an email to Reuters that its China revenue grew by low double-digits in the second quarter. It also said its relationship with Tingyi and a research and development centre in Shanghai helped it develop products geared to the local market.UNDER SIEGE Even traditional strongholds for foreign brands are under attack in China, including the market for infant milk formula. That market is one of largest and fastest growing, expected to be worth $25 billion by 2017, according to Euromonitor data.Global companies including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co , Nestle SA, Danone SA and Abbott Laboratories have long dominated the premium formula segment but they have increased tie-ups with Chinese partners and boosted domestic supply chains to protect their position.Chinese milk powder firms including Biostime International Holdings and Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co Ltd  increased their market share last year, helped by a food scare that hit foreign brands as well as government drives to consolidate the sector.In diapers, another area traditionally dominated by foreign brands, local firms are becoming more credible rivals, said a spokesman for Japanese diaper maker Kao.""The potential challenge from Chinese domestic manufacturers has grown remarkably,"" he said.

133,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK About a year ago, Texas rancher George Krueger worried about his weight, and decided it was time to downsize - his Coke cans, that is.Like increasing numbers of U.S. consumers, Krueger bet that by switching from regular-sized soda cans to 7.5 ounce ""mini""-sized ones, he could make a dent in his daily calorie intake.“It’s kind of a happy medium,” said the 62-year-old, who generally drinks a can a day, but sometimes goes for an extra one for more caffeine. “I can have my sweet fix but not feel guilty for having so much.”U.S. soft drink companies are betting that soda drinkers like Krueger and their willingness to buy smaller cans, even for a higher unit price, will be a potential antidote to weak sales as consumers shift away from sugary soft drinks.The mini-can is the latest move by food and beverage companies to boost their product offerings of smaller portion sizes that supposedly help consumers limit their caloric intake - even if there are signs that some end up reaching for another package or can.Mini can sales grew 3 percent in 2013 while the rest of the carbonated soft drink category dropped, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Pepsi (PEP.N) said the cans were one of the few bright spots in U.S. soda sales in their second quarter earnings calls last month.“Consumers are paying more and more attention to calories now,” said Simon Lowden, chief marketing officer at Pepsi Beverages North America, in a phone interview last week. While such concerns might have once helped diet drinks, growing health worries about artificial sweeteners have hurt that category, experts say.     Coke, the world’s largest soda maker, said there was double-digit growth in mini cans even while sales volumes of sparkling beverages in North America were flat. Smaller sizes, which include mini cans, accounted for more than 60 percent of the volume growth in traditional Coke. Pepsi’s mini can business in the United States has grown 24 percent year-to-date in 2014 and was up 34 percent last year. The company said that this year, it has also seen a significant increase in the number of in-store displays of mini cans.There's still a lot of room for growth.

134,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 5 About a year ago, Texas rancher George Krueger worried about his weight, and decided it was time to downsize - his Coke cans, that is.Like increasing numbers of U.S. consumers, Krueger bet that by switching from regular-sized soda cans to 7.5 ounce ""mini""-sized ones, he could make a dent in his daily calorie intake.""It's kind of a happy medium,"" said the 62-year-old, who generally drinks a can a day, but sometimes goes for an extra one for more caffeine. ""I can have my sweet fix but not feel guilty for having so much.""U.S. soft drink companies are betting that soda drinkers like Krueger and their willingness to buy smaller cans, even for a higher unit price, will be a potential antidote to weak sales as consumers shift away from sugary soft drinks.The mini-can is the latest move by food and beverage companies to boost their product offerings of smaller portion sizes that supposedly help consumers limit their caloric intake - even if there are signs that some end up reaching for another package or can.Mini can sales grew 3 percent in 2013 while the rest of the carbonated soft drink category dropped, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.Coca-Cola and Pepsi said the cans were one of the few bright spots in U.S. soda sales in their second quarter earnings calls last month.""Consumers are paying more and more attention to calories now,"" said Simon Lowden, chief marketing officer at Pepsi Beverages North America, in a phone interview last week. While such concerns might have once helped diet drinks, growing health worries about artificial sweeteners have hurt that category, experts say. Coke, the world's largest soda maker, said there was double-digit growth in mini cans even while sales volumes of sparkling beverages in North America were flat. Smaller sizes, which include mini cans, accounted for more than 60 percent of the volume growth in traditional Coke.Pepsi's mini can business in the United States has grown 24 percent year-to-date in 2014 and was up 34 percent last year. The company said that this year, it has also seen a significant increase in the number of in-store displays of mini cans.There's still a lot of room for growth. In 2013, mini cans comprised just 3 percent of carbonated beverage cans sold in the U.S., according to Euromonitor International.Earlier this year, the mini can was featured for the first time in a television ad starring actor Cuba Gooding Jr. which ran during the Oscars, the second most visible time frame behind the Super Bowl, Lowden said.

135,"  * Russia ban is in retaliation for Western sanctions* Putin orders food import curbs* Central bank warns bans will hurt inflation fight   (Recasts lead, adds comment from U.S. exporters)By Polina Devitt and Dmitry ZhdannikovMOSCOW, Aug 6 Russia has escalated an economic battle set off by the crisis in Ukraine with a ban on all food imports from the United States and on fruit and vegetables from the European Union, dropping any pretence these might be for food safety reasons.The import ban, reported by state news agency Ria Novosti on Wednesday, comes after Russia President Vladimir Putin ordered retaliation for Western sanctions against Moscow.Russia is a major buyer of European fruit and vegetables but ranks 23rd among buyers of food from the United States, accounting for less than 1 percent of America's agricultural exports.Putin signed a decree on Wednesday halting or limiting imports of agricultural products from countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia, ordering his government to come up with a list of imports to be banned for a year.""(All food products) that are being produced in the U.S. and being supplied to Russia will be banned,"" Ria Novosti quoted Alexei Alekseenko, spokesman for the VPSS food standards agency, as saying. ""Fruit and vegetables from EU will be covered by the total ban,"" he added. No one was available for comment at the VPSS (Phytosanitary Surveillance Service), but earlier Alekseenko told Reuters that retaliatory action would be ""quite substantial,"" and include U.S. poultry. Russians have a strong appetite for U.S. chicken, buying 276,100 tonnes of it last year, or 8 percent of U.S. exports.A spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels said he had no immediate comment.Russians bought 21.5 percent of EU vegetable exports and 28 percent of the bloc's fruit exports in 2011.The U.S. National Chicken Council and Poultry & Egg Export Council said it did not expect a great impact on the industry from the ban, while farmers said ordinary Russians could suffer.""This is clearly a political move. It is unfortunate that the biggest losers in this will be Russian consumers, who will pay more for their food now as well as in the long run,"" said Bob Stallman, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. In the past, Russia has banned a variety of U.S. foods citing health and safety concerns, but Wednesday's action makes  its language on terms similar to that of the United States and European Union, which have imposed sanctions on Moscow.Explicitly banning a country's products for political reasons would violate the rules of the World Trade Organization, which Russia joined in 2012.After Putin issued his decree, the VPSS said it would discuss an option to increase food imports from Ecuador, Brazil, Chile and Argentina with the countries' ambassadors on Thursday.Brazilian producers could send an additional 150,000 tonnes of chicken per year to Russia to make up the shortfall, Francisco Turra, president of the country's animal protein association, ABPA, said in Sao Paulo. Washington and the EU first imposed sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March and tightened them after a Malaysian airliner was shot down last month over territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Moscow rebels. Moscow rejects Western allegations that the rebels used a missile it supplied to bring down the airliner, killing all 298 people on board.East-West relations soured yet further on Wednesday as NATO said Russia might use the pretext of a humanitarian mission to invade eastern Ukraine.SET UP WELL Until now, smaller or poorer countries have featured prominently among those targeted by the Russian response. Moscow has already suspended beef and cattle imports from Romania, citing an outbreak of mad cow disease, and banned Ukrainian juice and dairy produce, Polish vegetables and Australian beef.Russia's central bank warned that such bans on importing cheap products could make it harder to control inflation, which fell to an annual 7.5 percent in July, but remains well above the 6.5 percent rate in 2013.(US$1 = 0.7487 euro)   (Writing by David Stamp; Additional reporting by Michael Shields, Fabiola Gomes; Angelika Gruber, Polina Devitt, Maria Kiselyova, Silvia Aloisi and Gianluca Semeraro; Karl Plume and Tom Polansek in Chicago; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Steve Orlofsky)",2014-08-06,KO,"Wed Aug 6, 2014 | 7:40pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Russia escalates economic battle with U.S., EU with food import ban",http://www.reuters.com//article/ukraine-crisis-russia-sanctions-idUSL6N0QC5X320140806?type=companyNews
136,"  * Putin orders food import curbs in muted retaliation* Central bank warns bans will hurt inflation fight* Finland says EU must share burden of retaliation* Western bank still expects robust Russia profits* Coca-Cola cuts TV commercials in RussiaBy Sakari Suoninen and Dmitry ZhdannikovESPOO, Finland/MOSCOW, Aug 6 Finland warned on Wednesday that Russian retaliation against EU sanctions could push its economy into crisis, while President Vladimir Putin ordered curbs on food imports from countries that join the Western action over Ukraine.Despite the deepening crisis, Putin held back from imposing any broad ban or restrictions that might cause food shortages or risk stoking inflation.East-West relations, already at their worst since the Cold War, soured yet further on Wednesday as NATO said Russia might use the pretext of a humanitarian mission to invade eastern Ukraine.Although rhetoric levels are rising, Putin's response to EU sanctions targeting Russia's banking, energy and defence industry remains relatively muted. On Wednesday, he signed a decree banning or limiting imports of agricultural products from countries that have imposed the sanctions.Putin ordered his government to come up with a list of goods to be banned for one year, the Kremlin said. However, with the central bank warning that import restrictions could push up food prices and general inflation, Putin said the list should not hurt Russian consumers - who are fond of U.S. chicken pieces known as ""George Bush's leg"". Nevertheless, the prospect of tit-for-tat economic restrictions has raised concern among smaller European Union nations that have close trading ties to Russia. Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, said it feared a repeat of the turmoil suffered by most Western economies in 2008-09.""This has the potential - and I stress potential - to become Economic Crisis 2.0,"" Prime Minister Alexander Stubb told reporters in the Finnish city of Espoo.Neutral Finland traded heavily with its huge neighbour even during the Cold War, and suffered badly when the Soviet Union collapsed almost a quarter of a century ago. Today, Russia is Finland's third largest export market, while Russian tourists spend roughly 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) a year in Finland.Stubb said he expected Moscow to retaliate but defended the sanctions, imposed after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March and tightened after a Malaysian airliner was shot down over territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Moscow rebels.However, he made clear the burden of retaliation had to be shared among EU members: ""If sanctions hit Finland disproportionately, we will seek aid from our EU partners."" SET UP WELL So far, smaller or poorer countries have featured prominently among those targeted by the Russian response.Veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor said it was suspending beef and cattle imports from Romania, citing an outbreak of mad cow disease. Moscow has already imposed bans on Ukrainian juice and dairy produce, Polish vegetables and Australian beef, saying it might target Greek fruit and U.S. poultry.The central bank warned that bans on importing such cheap products could make it harder to control inflation, which fell to an annual 7.5 percent in July, but remains well above the 6.5 percent increase seen in 2013.Rosselkhoznadzor said Russia would look to other suppliers to compensate for the bans. ""We are talking about a significant increase of meat and dairy imports from Brazil,"" said Alexei Alekseenko, spokesman for the watchdog. The sanctions have effectively frozen Russian banks out of EU financial markets, and yet one Western bank active in Russia said it expected to keep making solid profits there despite losing some business.Bank Austria, the central and eastern European arm of Italian bank UniCredit, said its pretax profit in Russia rose 3 percent to 247 million euros in the first half of this year.That was more than a quarter of its total pretax profit, making Russia its most profitable market.Bank Austria said it would be able to keep raising money locally. ""Given what we know now about sanctions, we assume that in Russia we will continue to have a very significant profit contributor. We feel we are set up well,"" Chief Executive Willibald Cernko said.Federico Ghizzoni, UniCredit's chief executive, also expressed confidence. ""The bank seems strong enough to go through this storm,"" he said in Milan. ""This is not to say that we are not looking at the situation with concern, but there is no systemic problem,"" he said, adding the bank estimated a hit of up to 10-15 million euros in lost revenues.In a research note, Berenberg analysts said UniCredit was among the European banks most exposed to Russia - whose economy is already teetering on the verge of recession.While the direct effect of sanctions would be limited, it said the indirect fallout could include weaker demand for Russian debt, and funding restrictions and deteriorating asset quality - meaning more Russian borrowers are likely to default on their loans.In a sign of the economic slowdown, soft drinks giant Coca-Cola Co said it had taken advertisements off four television channels there as a fall in second-quarter sales prompted a rethink of its marketing plans.Two of the channels named by the Russian business daily Kommersant are owned by St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, which is owned in turn by Yuri Kovalchuk, a close ally of Putin.Kovalchuk was hit by U.S. sanctions in March and blacklisted by the EU last month. However, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said by email that ""there is no political motive in this decision"".

(KO.N) said Thursday it is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) as the company seeks to expand into faster-growing categories like energy drinks. Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on Monster's board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business including NOS, Full Throttle and Burn, to Monster. Monster will issue Coke shares of common stock, and transfer its non-energy business, which includes Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, while Monster will become Coke's exclusive energy drinks partner. For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to increase its footprint in a faster growing category than soda. Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North America its biggest market was flat, partly driven by a decline in diet coke sales. In turn, Monster will gain access to Coke's extensive global distribution system. The companies will amend their current distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada by expanding into additional territories.  Coca-Cola shares rose 1.2 percent in after-hours trading, while Monster surged 22 percent. On a conference call with reporters, Coke's Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent.

148,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 14 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter.Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30.Charter is ""the play of choice on cable consolidation,"" said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.""You've got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,"" he said.DirecTV is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T for $48.5 billion.Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire's larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz.The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire's cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion.That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday's filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc, an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc , whose stock Berkshire also owns.Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp, IBM Corp, Suncor Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips, former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co, National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp.U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks.Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

152,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) $2.15 billion wager on a stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) highlights the growth-starved soft drink company's embrace of deals that fall short of a full-blown merger and acquisition but allow it to test-drive potentially risky targets.The world's largest soda maker said Thursday that it was  buying a 16.7 percent stake in Monster. Coke will get two directors on Monster's board as well as Monster's non-energy brands, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea. Monster will get Coke's energy brands, which include NOS and Full Throttle, as well as access to Coke's extensive distribution system. Taking a minority stake instead of acquiring Monster outright gives Coke the opportunity to get the perks of being in  a $27 billion global energy drinks market without taking on the financial and public relations risks that come with the controversial category, analysts said. If the deal closes as expected, Coke will distribute energy drinks but will not actually own them anymore. One advantage for Coke is that deal involves less cash upfront than a full-on acquisition, which would have been at least $12 billion at Thursday's closing stock price. That is roughly equivalent to the amount of cash Coke had in hand at the end of July. ""A couple of billion is something that Coke could handle without much difficulty,"" said Linda Montag, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service. Also, the gradualist approach allows Coke to sample at a distance a market in which it has a small presence and thus limited experience, with both the risks and rewards. The category enjoyed double-digit global growth in the mid-2000s, but as of late that has slowed. According to Euromonitor International, energy drink sales increased 7 percent in 2013 from the previous year.  There are other hazards with which Coke may want to get more familiar before doing a full deal. Energy drinks have been wrought with controversy in both the United States and international markets. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in 2012 that it was probing five deaths possibly linked to Monster Energy. The agency says it is still studying energy drinks but has not taken any action so far. Earlier this year, Lithuania banned the sale of high-caffeine drinks to minors, raising the question of whether other countries could follow its lead. A Coke spokesman said Friday that the company has done its due diligence in evaluating Monster's legal proceedings. The deal notably keeps Coke at an arm's length from any future public relations battles facing the energy drinks industry.  ""This is a category that faces ongoing scrutiny, fair or not,"" said Stephen Powers, an analyst at UBS. ""Coke has always been wary of that because they face a lot of scrutiny themselves."" A deal between Coke and Monster has been speculated about for years. Coke shares were up 2 percent at $40.93 in Friday's trading while Monster's surged 30 percent to $93.07. Indeed, a cautious approach does not necessarily mean the company is shutting the door on owning Monster some day. The company made investments in both Honest Tea and Zico Beverages, the maker of coconut water, before eventually buying them.  It could be pursuing a similar strategy with Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O: Coke bought a 10 percent stake in the single-service coffee brewing company earlier this year and raised it to 16 percent in May, making it Keurig's largest shareholder. ""This seems to be an evolving and accepted method for Coke to diversify and do it in baby steps before they go all in,"" Powers said.

The inspection comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a softer tone in comments regarding Ukraine.* In Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for a new coalition that world and regional powers hope will be able to quash a Sunni Islamist insurgency that threatens Baghdad. * Investors awaited August data on both manufacturing and consumer sentiment.

158,"  (Updates with CEO quotes)By Anjali AthavaleyNEW YORK Aug 14 Coca-Cola Co said Thursday it is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp as the world's largest soda maker seeks to expand into faster-growing categories such as energy drinks.Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on Monster's board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business including brands like Full Throttle and Burn, to Monster. Monster will transfer its non-energy business, which includes Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, while Monster brands will be the only energy drinks distributed by Coke.For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to increase its footprint in energy drinks, a $27 billion market globally, according to Euromonitor International. It comes at a time when people are drinking less soda in developed markets. Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North America, its biggest market, was flat, partly driven by a decline in diet Coke sales.In turn, Monster will gain access to Coke's extensive global distribution system. The companies have a distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada and will amend it to expand into additional territories. On a conference call with media, Rodney Sacks, chief executive officer of Monster, said that the company would also convert distribution agreements it has with Anheuser-Busch InBev in the U.S. to Coke.

159,"  * H1 net profit falls 15.6 percent to $169.50 mln* Strategic review report due end of October* New products include 250ml, A$2 Coke can   (Recasts, updates throughout with more detail, CEO and analyst comment, share price)SYDNEY, Aug 20 Struggling Australian food and beverage company Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA) warned on Wednesday it expects to post a second consecutive drop in full-year earnings amid weak consumer confidence and thanks to a few management ""own goals.""CCA is scrambling under new Chief Executive Alison Watkins to address the changing tastes of its core market, launching a smaller, cheaper Coke can and promising more sugar-free products.Still, those introductions will be too late for the current year, when it expects full-year profit to be ""materially lower"" than last year.In its first set of results under Watkins, the company revealed on Monday that first-half net profit slid 15.6 percent to A$182.3 million ($169.50 million), from A$215.9 million a year ago.That was largely in line with analyst expectations of A$184.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but shares fell 2.9 percent as analysts focused on the weak earnings outlook.Watkins, who took the post in March, conceded the poor operational result was not entirely due to external factors like domestic price competition from Asahi Group Holding Ltd's  Pepsi. ""Some of that is due to market forces, some is due to what we can only describe as own goal factors,"" Watkins said on a conference call.Decisions by the company last year to cut its sales staff and stand back from promotional activity in Australia were poorly made in hindsight, she said.CCA in February booked an 83 percent decline in annual net profit, its worst profit in 20 years.Watkins is overseeing a strategic review that seeks to restore brand value and save the company A$100 million in costs over the next three years partly by streamlining its supply business. The company is drawing up plans for more low and no-calorie drinks and on Wednesday unveiled a new 250ml, A$2 coke can - an attempt to gain leverage in Australia's price wars. Further initiatives would be coming in the summer, Watkins said.""As a business, we have been slow to adapt to these changes in market conditions and shifting consumer trends,"" Watkins said.Analysts said the first-half results were extremely disappointing and wanted to see more detail on the review, which is not expected until a scheduled analyst day in October.""Management is still in rebase mode and we recommend caution until it is clear this has come to an end,"" Citi analyst Gino Rossi said in a note to investors. INDONESIA AND BEER First-half earnings before interest and tax in Australia, which generates more than 80 per cent of profits, fell 14.1 per cent to A$226.5 million, while earnings in Indonesia plummeted 83.4 per cent to A$5.2 million.There has long been speculation that CCA's 30 percent shareholder, The Coca-Cola Co, was keen to buy the business back from CCA or team up with a partner like Mexican bottler Coca-Cola FEMSA.But Watkins said on Wednesday CCA was committed to both Indonesia and its alcoholic beverages unit, which is unlikely to reach the 1 percent contribution to profit growth that had been flagged for this year.CCA returned to the beer market in December after a two-year break, but it said sales had been slower than expected due to increased competition.CCA shares were 2.9 percent lower at A$9.45 in mid-afternoon trade on the Australian stock exchange, off an intraday low of A$9.23. Shares have fallen around 22 percent since the start of the year, compared with an 4.8 percent rise in the S&P/ASX 200 .(1 US dollar = 1.0755 Australian dollar)   (Reporting By Jane Wardell; Editing by Matt Driskill)",2014-08-20,KO,"Wed Aug 20, 2014 | 12:00am EDT","UPDATE 1-Australia's Coca-Cola Amatil warns on profit, launches new products",http://www.reuters.com//article/coca-cola-amatil-results-idUSL4N0QQ14920140820?type=companyNews

162,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Billy Horschel, seeking a second consecutive PGA Tour victory, birdied three of the last eight holes to move two strokes clear of the chasing pack in the Tour Championship second round on Friday.The American, ranked second in the FedExCup standings coming into this week, fired a second successive four-under-par 66 at East Lake Golf Club to seize control of the fourth and final playoff event with an eight-under total of 132.However, Northern Irish world number one Rory McIlroy was in hot pursuit after carding a best-of-the-day 65 in hot and humid conditions to soar into a three-way tie for second at six under.McIlroy has already enjoyed a brilliant 2014 campaign, clinching two major titles among four wins worldwide, and has now set his sights on claiming playoff honors on the U.S. circuit for the first time after a season-long race.""I just want to finish my season off the way I feel like I should and the way I feel like it deserves to be finished off,"" McIlroy told reporters after piling up six birdies and a sole bogey with a sizzling display in the second round.""I'm not putting too much pressure on myself because it's already been a great year, but I still want to win this thing.""Level with McIlroy at six under were Australian Jason Day (67) and American Chris Kirk (68), the FedExCup points leader who had been joint pacesetter with Horschel after the opening round.Horschel, who tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship two weeks ago and then won the BMW Championship on Sunday, did well to par the short 18th after hitting his tee shot into a greenside bunker and splashing out to seven feet. He coolly sank the par putt to end his day with an overall tally of six birdies and two bogeys, in pole position heading into the weekend with his sights set on victory and the staggering FedExCup playoff bonus of $10 million.""Drove the ball really well today,"" said the 27-year-old Horschel, arguably the hottest player in the game. ""Just didn't hit very good chips, but played pretty solid coming in. Probably could have hit some better iron shots.""But I'm happy with the way I played today. I'll take two more 66s, see where that puts me on Sunday."" JOSTLING FOR POSITION Horschel, McIlroy, Kirk, Day and American Patrick Reed all held at least a share of the lead in the second round as the players jostled for position in the PGA Tour's season-ending event.Kirk, who won the second playoff event earlier this month, slipped back with two bogeys in the first six holes but rebounded in style as he drained successive birdie putts from 26 feet at the seventh and eighth.He picked up another shot at the par-five ninth, where he sank an eight-footer, to join Day in a tie for the lead at six under, then knocked in a six-foot birdie putt at the 10th to edge a stroke in front. However Kirk stumbled with a three-putt bogey at the short 11th to drop back into a three-way tie at the top with Day and Horschel, who moments earlier had rolled in a 13-foot birdie putt on the 11th green.Day and Horschel both birdied the 14th to get to seven under, Horschel by draining a 25-footer, but the Australian faltered with a bogey at the last after missing the green to the right off the tee.McIlroy had ended his round with a birdie-birdie flourish for a brief share of the lead but Horschel moved two strokes clear at the top after hitting a superb approach to four feet at the 17th and knocking in the birdie putt.Any of the top five in the points standings would clinch the FedExCup by winning the Tour Championship - and that quintet comprises top-ranked Kirk, Horschel (second), Bubba Watson (third), McIlroy (fourth) and Hunter Mahan (fifth).Tee times for the second round were brought forward by three hours due to the threat of thunderstorms forecast for Friday afternoon.

163,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | ATLANTA  ATLANTA A bizarre bounce of his ball into a spectator's pocket and an unexpected birdie-birdie finish helped Rory McIlroy surge into contention for the Tour Championship with a sizzling display in Friday's second round.The world number one, hunting his fifth victory of the year worldwide, fired a five-under-par 65 on a steamy day at East Lake Golf Club to finish at six under, two strokes off the lead in the PGA Tour's fourth and final playoff event.After sinking a nine-foot birdie putt at the 12th, McIlroy did well to par the 14th after his tee shot sailed into trees before the ricocheting ball ended up in the right-hand pocket of a spectator's shorts.McIlroy shook hands with the bemused golf fan and shared a brief laugh with him before getting a free drop in the right rough, from where he hit his second shot to 20 feet and comfortably two-putted for par.The Northern Irishman then stunningly moved into a brief share of the lead with a birdie-birdie finish, sinking a 20-footer at the 17th before coaxing in a curling 27-footer at the uphill par-three last.""It was a really good way to finish,"" four-times major champion McIlroy told reporters after mixing six birdies with a lone bogey to shoot the best score of the day. ""I think it really started out when I made a good par putt on 16.""That kept the momentum of the round going,"" he said of a 13-foot putt for par at the 16th. ""Did exact same thing yesterday, was able to birdie 17.""And 18 was a bit of a bonus. I had a decent shot in there, but it was a pretty tricky putt up that hill with a lot of right-to-left breaks. I was trying to get it somewhere close to the hole. Once I hit it, I knew I had a chance. It dropped in."" McIlroy has already enjoyed a brilliant 2014 campaign, clinching two major crowns among his four wins, and has now set his sights on claiming FedExCup playoff honors, a title he has never won and has specifically targeted this week.Three strokes off the pace going into Friday's second round at East Lake, he recorded three birdies and a bogey at the fourth, where he found a fairway bunker off the tee, to reach the turn in two-under 33.BIRDIE HIGHLIGHTS  His bogey-free back nine, highlighted by his birdies at the 12th, 17th and the last, kept him in contention for the Tour Championship and the mind-boggling playoff bonus of $10 million.Giving McIlroy extra motivation this week is the fact that he narrowly missed out on FedExCup honors two years ago after he had arrived at East Lake heading the point standings following consecutive wins in the four-event playoffs.He ended up tying for 10th in that year's Tour Championship, his only previous start in the elite limited-field event, and was edged out by tournament winner Brandt Snedeker in the race for the FedExCup.""It would be the icing on the cake,"" McIlroy said of what a victory would mean to him after his impressive major victories at the British Open and PGA Championship. ""Before coming into these FedExCup playoffs, having won four times in a season, two majors, a World Golf Championship, the flagship event on the European tour, it was going to be a great season anyway.""I wanted to cap it off in style and I've given myself a chance to do that over the next two days,"" said the Northern Irishman, who trails pacesetting American Billy Horschel by two shots heading into Saturday's third round.As for the fortunate bounce of his ball at the par-four 14th, McIlroy said it was the second time this year he has contended with a similar situation.""I hit it off someone's leg at the Scottish Open in Aberdeen,"" he grinned. ""I need to stop hitting it off line.""I was happy,"" McIlroy said of his adventure at the 14th on Friday. ""That ball could have hit the tree and went anywhere. It hit up on the tree and ricocheted straight into his pocket. I just felt fortunate I was able to drop it there and make a par.""

""On the golf course I'm not thinking about it.""We have decided that if she (Brittany) goes into labor while I'm playing, I will just keep playing, because $10 million is a lot of money and I'm not going to pass that by.""And I'll just fly home after the round and fly back (to the tournament) a couple hours later, spend some time with them.""Horschel, who rose to second in the FedExCup points list after finishing runner-up at the Deutsche Bank Championship two weeks ago and then winning the BMW Championship on Sunday, said he did not want to be notified while out on the course.""We've talked about that,"" the 27-year-old explained after recording four birdies in a flawless display to end the opening round of the PGA Tour's season finale level with fellow American Chris Kirk. ""I'm going to stay put on the golf course. I'll find out after the round. I won't find out on the course, because my focus may be taken away from the task at hand.""But after the round's over with, I will be flying home, spend a few hours and then fly back later that day or the next morning before the round of golf.""ANXIOUS WAIT  Asked whether he was more nervous about the baby's impending arrival or the chance to win the Tour Championship and the FedExCup bonus of $10 million, Horschel replied: ""I'm not too nervous about having a kid. My wife and I are very excited.""I'm just anxious for it to happen. I'm anxious for the baby to get here, our child to get here. And I'm anxious to have a chance to win $10 million.""Having a chance to win $10 million and our first child on the way, it's pretty amazing, especially the time of year that it's happening."" Horschel, one of only five players in the 29-man field at East Lake who is automatically guaranteed the overall FedExCup prize by winning the Tour Championship, is playing his sixth week in a row on the PGA Tour.Some players on a similarly busy run have cited fatigue as the season draws to a close but Horschel said he had ""no issues with that"" as he continued his bid for a third career title on the U.S. circuit.""Maybe it's just the way that I take care of myself. I try to work out and do the right things, make sure I get enough sleep and everything else,"" he said.""But, listen, this is the FedExCup Playoffs.

165,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Rory McIlroy spectacularly eagled the par-five 15th to join Billy Horschel in a tie for the lead in the Tour Championship  on Saturday and set up a thrilling conclusion to the 2013-14 PGA Tour season.With the FedExCup playoff title and a bonus jackpot of $10 million on the line at East Lake Golf Club, world number one McIlroy sank a 26-foot putt to draw level at the top, then parred the last three holes to card a three-under-par 67.That left the Northern Irishman at nine-under 201 in the fourth and final playoff event, level with his American playing partner Horschel, who had been three ahead at the turn before losing momentum over the closing stretch on the way to a 69.McIlroy has already enjoyed a superb 2014 campaign, clinching two major titles among four wins worldwide, and has set his sights on claiming the FedExCup crown for the first time after a season-long race.""I haven't played my best golf by any stretch this week, but I'm just sort of grinding out scores and trying to keep myself at the top of the leaderboard,"" McIlroy told reporters after carding three birdies, his timely eagle and two bogeys.""Being tied for the lead going into the last day tomorrow with the way I've played this week, I can't really ask for any more,"" said the 25-year-old, who twice three-putted for bogey during the third round.""I feel like I've had the best year out of anyone on Tour and I've came here with the ultimate goal of trying to cap it off, trying to put an exclamation point on it.""Horschel is also seeking to end his season with a flourish, having tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier this month before winning the BMW Championship six days ago. ""It was like two different nines today,"" said Horschel, who mixed three birdies with two bogeys. ""I played really good on the front side ... but after that I was holding on to the reins pretty tight.""But I was able to keep it together, battle and turn in a number that I can be somewhat happy with and put me in a great position going into Sunday.""Veteran American Jim Furyk, who has not triumphed on the PGA Tour since his 2010 victory at the Tour Championship, was alone in third place at seven under after firing a four-birdie 67.QUALITY LEADERBOARD  English world number five Justin Rose (66), American young gun Rickie Fowler (67) and Australian Jason Day (70) were a further stroke back on a high-quality leaderboard after charging into contention on what is traditionally known as 'Moving Day'.Horschel, two ahead of his closest pursuers overnight, had his lead briefly cut to one when first Day and then McIlroy birdied the opening hole on a steamy afternoon in Atlanta.However, both Day and McIlroy bogeyed the par-three second where Horschel drained a bomb, a 50-foot birdie putt giving him a three-stroke cushion.McIlroy rebounded by sinking a 22-foot birdie putt at the third but Horschel regained a three-shot lead when he struck a superb approach to six feet at the par-four eighth and knocked in the putt. Both players birdied the par-five ninth after reaching the green in two and two-putting for Horschel to reach the turn in three-under 32, three ahead of the chasing pack at 11 under.Horschel dropped his first shot of the day at the 10th, where he missed the fairway off the tee and failed to reach the green in two, but McIlroy also bogeyed the hole, three-putting from long range, to remain three shots adrift.After lipping out with a birdie attempt from 16 feet at the 11th, Horschel found a bunker off the tee and also with his approach to bogey the 13th and slip to nine under.McIlroy then upped things a gear, almost reaching the green in two at the 15th before draining the eagle putt from just off the fringe to join Horschel in a two-way tie at the top.Watched by the largest galleries of the day, they parred the last three holes to remain at nine under, each of them staying on track for the biggest payday of their respective careers.

166,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Rory McIlroy spectacularly eagled the par-five 15th to join Billy Horschel in a tie for the lead in the Tour Championship  on Saturday and set up a thrilling conclusion to the 2013-14 PGA Tour season.With the FedExCup playoff title and a bonus jackpot of $10 million on the line at East Lake Golf Club, world number one McIlroy sank a 26-foot putt to draw level at the top, then parred the last three holes to card a three-under-par 67.That left the Northern Irishman at nine-under 201 in the fourth and final playoff event, level with his American playing partner Horschel, who had been three ahead at the turn before losing momentum over the closing stretch on the way to a 69.McIlroy has already enjoyed a superb 2014 campaign, clinching two major titles among four wins worldwide, and has set his sights on claiming the FedExCup crown for the first time after a season-long race.""I haven't played my best golf by any stretch this week, but I'm just sort of grinding out scores and trying to keep myself at the top of the leaderboard,"" McIlroy told reporters after carding three birdies, his timely eagle and two bogeys.""Being tied for the lead going into the last day tomorrow with the way I've played this week, I can't really ask for any more,"" said the 25-year-old, who twice three-putted for bogey during the third round.""I feel like I've had the best year out of anyone on Tour and I've came here with the ultimate goal of trying to cap it off, trying to put an exclamation point on it.""Horschel is also seeking to end his season with a flourish, having tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier this month before winning the BMW Championship six days ago. ""It was like two different nines today,"" said Horschel, who mixed three birdies with two bogeys. ""I played really good on the front side ... but after that I was holding on to the reins pretty tight.""But I was able to keep it together, battle and turn in a number that I can be somewhat happy with and put me in a great position going into Sunday.""Veteran American Jim Furyk, who has not triumphed on the PGA Tour since his 2010 victory at the Tour Championship, was alone in third place at seven under after firing a four-birdie 67.QUALITY LEADERBOARD  English world number five Justin Rose (66), American young gun Rickie Fowler (67) and Australian Jason Day (70) were a further stroke back on a high-quality leaderboard after charging into contention on what is traditionally known as 'Moving Day'.Horschel, two ahead of his closest pursuers overnight, had his lead briefly cut to one when first Day and then McIlroy birdied the opening hole on a steamy afternoon in Atlanta.However, both Day and McIlroy bogeyed the par-three second where Horschel drained a bomb, a 50-foot birdie putt giving him a three-stroke cushion.McIlroy rebounded by sinking a 22-foot birdie putt at the third but Horschel regained a three-shot lead when he struck a superb approach to six feet at the par-four eighth and knocked in the putt. Both players birdied the par-five ninth after reaching the green in two and two-putting for Horschel to reach the turn in three-under 32, three ahead of the chasing pack at 11 under.Horschel dropped his first shot of the day at the 10th, where he missed the fairway off the tee and failed to reach the green in two, but McIlroy also bogeyed the hole, three-putting from long range, to remain three shots adrift.After lipping out with a birdie attempt from 16 feet at the 11th, Horschel found a bunker off the tee and also with his approach to bogey the 13th and slip to nine under.McIlroy then upped things a gear, almost reaching the green in two at the 15th before draining the eagle putt from just off the fringe to join Horschel in a two-way tie at the top.Watched by the largest galleries of the day, they parred the last three holes to remain at nine under, each of them staying on track for the biggest payday of their respective careers. Any of the top five in the points standings would clinch the FedExCup by winning the Tour Championship, a group that comprises top-ranked Chris Kirk, Horschel (second), Bubba Watson (third), McIlroy (fourth) and Hunter Mahan (fifth).

167,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) issuance of EUR2 billion senior notes including  EUR800 million of 1.125% notes due 2022 and EUR1.2 billion of 1.875% notes due  2026. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $40.2 billion  of debt as of June 27, 2014. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of  this release.  The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds from the  offering for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital,  capital expenditures, acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets,  redemption and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings and purchases of  our common stock. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Global Brands Coca-Cola's ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global  beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has 17 $1  billion brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid,  and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's  beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in  the U.S., growing scrutiny over artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand  in North America, and modest CSD growth in other developed countries. However,  this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing, higher  growth geographies with low per capita consumption characteristics that should  provide an important longer-term offset. Debt Structure, Elevated Leverage Fitch remains concerned with Coca-Cola's high gross leverage that has been  elevated by substantial commercial paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's gross  leverage is weak for the rating category at 3.0x on a total debt-to-operating  EBITDA basis for the second quarter ending June 27, 2014, up from 2.4x at the  end of 2012. FFO adjusted leverage was 3.9x and FFO fixed charge coverage was  14.8x.  Coca-Cola's commercial paper (CP) balance remains substantial at $19.9 billion  as of June 27, 2014. The CP mix is approximately half of the firm's overall  capital structure which Fitch believes increases Coca-Cola's financial risk.  Coca-Cola has indicated that $20 billion is the upper limit for its CP program.  The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its U.S.  cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which the company  has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola maintains a comparable  cash balance along with its committed bank lines to provide backup to its CP  borrowings. Fitch believes Coca-Cola should advance a longer-term plan to  address the structural mismatch and the large CP balance including any reduction  in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels, thus lowering gross  debt.  Strong Cash Generation, Liquidity Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently generate  considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF). For the  LTM period ending June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola generated $11.1 billion and $3.5  billion (after adjusting for dividends) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, after  generating $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012. Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be in excess of $3.5 billion driven in  part by reduced pension contributions and improved working capital. Coca-Cola  has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net share repurchases in 2014,  after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. Net share repurchases was $1.3  billion for the first half of 2014. LTM dividends were $5.1 billion representing  a cash flow payout ratio of 59%. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturing in the next  12 months was $1.5 billion. As of June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola's $27.9 billion liquidity position consisted of  $18.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, $3.5 billion of marketable  securities, and $6.3 billion of availability under its committed credit lines  and revolving credit facility that mature August 2019. As part of Fitch's  corporate policy, off shore cash is viewed as not readily accessible due to a  general reluctance of firm's to repatriate because of incremental tax cost  although Fitch recognizes the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's CP  program is a key mitigating ratings factor.  Consistent Operating Performance Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the past with  top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix and  improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global macroeconomic pressure,  higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial sweeteners and weather-related  issues has made past volume growth more challenging. During the six-month period  ended June 27, 2014, consolidated net operating revenue excluding the negative  effects of currency and structural changes grew 3%. Concentrate volumes rose 1%  while price/mix contributed 2%. Operating income increased 6% excluding the  impacts of currency and structural changes. Coca-Cola's first half 2014  performance was in line with Fitch's expectations.  Coca-Cola's expectations for an incremental $1 billion in productivity savings  by 2016 that will be primarily redirected for increased media investments should  further support brand development. M&A Investments The ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions given the  company's transaction history. Fitch views KO's investments in minority  positions of Monster Beverage and Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. as relatively low  risk and having key strategic benefits of improving product diversification and  distribution. The shifting secular trends within the soft drink industry make  these investments essential to create an additional avenue for growth.  Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) Ratings Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and CCR  issued obligations, since default risk is very low at this level on the rating  scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the notes issued by Coca-Cola. Fitch currently rates The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its subsidiaries as  follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --CP 'F1'.

169,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | ATLANTA  ATLANTA Billy Horschel took the limelight from world number one Rory McIlroy to win the biggest title of his career at the Tour Championship on Sunday, along with FedExCup honors and an eye-popping $10 million bonus.Tied for the lead overnight with Northern Irishman McIlroy in the PGA Tour's season-ending playoff event, American Horschel held his nerve to triumph by three shots, clinching his third career victory on the U.S. circuit and second in two weeks.Helped by a clutch par-saving putt from 30 feet on the 16th hole, the in-form Horschel signed off with a two-under-par 68 on a damp day at East Lake Golf Club for an 11-under total of 269.""I'm on cloud nine, it's unbelievable,"" Horschel said after being presented with the Tour Championship and FedExCup trophies by PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem.""It's just unbelievable, everything that's happened the last two weeks, and especially having a kid on the way. I'm not sure life can be better than this.""Horschel's wife, Brittany, is scheduled to give birth to their first child in two weeks' time.McIlroy, seeking his fourth PGA Tour win of the year, fell out of contention with a double at the sixth and three consecutive bogeys from the ninth before closing with a 71, tying for second with American Jim Furyk (69).""It was a week too far,"" McIlroy told NBC Sports after competing in his eighth tournament in a hectic 10-week run. ""I was making mistakes that I don't normally make. But Billy deserved it. He played the best golf.""Horschel, one of five players who came into the tournament knowing that victory would automatically secure him the prized playoff crown, mixed three birdies with a lone bogey on Sunday to keep his closest challengers at bay. The 27-year-old American ended his season with a spectacular flourish, having tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier this month before winning last week's BMW Championship outside Denver.Furyk made a sizzling start to the final round on a cool and overcast afternoon at East Lake, birdies on the second and third holes lifting him briefly into a three-way tie at the top with McIlroy and Horschel.However McIlroy and Horschel made matching birdies at the par-four fourth to move one stroke clear, McIlroy sinking an 18-foot putt after missing the fairway off the tee and Horschel holing out from 11 feet.MCILROY DOUBLE-BOGEY  Horschel edged one ahead by draining an 18-footer to birdie the par-four fifth, and was then handed a two-stroke lead when McIlroy double-bogeyed the tricky par-three sixth after dumping his tee shot into water.Furyk trimmed Horschel's advantage by one with a birdie at the par-five ninth before faltering with a bogey at the 10th and McIlroy again stumbled with a bogey at the ninth after hitting a wild tee shot that sailed way right.Horschel, who had reached the turn with a two-stroke cushion at 11 under, made his first mistake of the day with a bogey at the 10th where he ended up in the right rough both off the tee and with his second shot.McIlroy also bogeyed the hole after three-putting, missing a three-footer for par, to slide four strokes off the pace. Furyk joined Horschel in a tie for the lead at 10 under after very nearly holing out with a delicate chip from greenside rough for eagle at the par-five 15th, settling instead for a tap-in birdie.But Horschel responded with a birdie of his own at the 15th, getting up and down from a greenside bunker to edge one stroke clear.Just when it seemed that Horschel would bogey the par-four 16th, where his tee shot sailed right into trees from where he could only punch his second out on to the fairway, he sank an uphill 30-footer to save par before pumping his fist in relief.Furyk gave Horschel welcome breathing space and a two-shot advantage when he bogeyed the par-four 17th after ending up short of the green in two.""This one, Billy was out ahead,"" said Furyk, who also bogeyed the final hole and has not won on the PGA Tour since his victory at the 2010 Tour Championship. ""I was trying to chase him down all day. I just couldn't make enough birdies.""Horschel, playing in the final pairing right behind Furyk, narrowly missed a birdie attempt from 15 feet at the 17th before comfortably parring the last to seal a three-stroke triumph.

170,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Leaders of some of the biggest U.S. corporations, from Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), unveiled a campaign on Tuesday to reduce the nation's healthcare costs, urging their peers to embrace wellness programs to improve employee health.The newly-formed group, called The CEO Council on Health and Innovation, said it came together ""to lead the U.S. business community"" in improving employee and community health and reducing costs.The council's members also include Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Walgreen Co WAG.N, McKinsey & Co, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and the Institute for Advanced Health. Combined, the group said its healthcare benefits cover 150 million people.In a report released at a press conference in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the council called on employers to accelerate the adoption of wellness programs to improve nutrition and weight management, promote physical activity, help employees quit smoking and manage chronic diseases.    Several council members described successful wellness initiatives at their own firms and urged others to follow suit. ""Today is about a call to action,"" said Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. The company's sugary soft drinks have been the target of public health advocates who argue they contribute to obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are popular because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses. Some employers, including Bank of America, offer financial incentives for employees to get screened, while others have begun to penalize workers who don't participate in wellness requirements. Despite the rising popularity of such programs, some independent research has shown that wellness campaigns do not always cut costs as hoped. A long-running workplace wellness program at PepsiCo (PEP.N), for example, helped reduce costs for workers with chronic diseases by cutting down hospital admissions. But the savings for employees who were urged to make preventive changes to their lifestyle were negligible, according to a report published in the journal Health Affairs in January. Still, Dr. Fikry Isaac, vice president of global health services at J&J, said the company's own research showed that every dollar it spent on wellness programs yielded a potential $2 to $4 return on investment.""We believe it does work and we have the ability to show quite a bit of evidence,"" he said.One J&J study that lasted more than six years showed a $565 dollar saving per employee per year, Isaac said, adding that healthcare costs for J&J over the period rose just 1 percent, compared to a gain of 4.7 percent for its peers.

173,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON, Sept 16  WASHINGTON, Sept 16 The White House on Tuesday announced steps to tackle a potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration and air conditioning, of which the United States is the world's largest producer, a week ahead of a major UN summit focused on addressing climate change.The Obama administration unveiled a batch of voluntary private sector commitments and executive actions to phase out the use of  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which would result in the equivalent reduction of 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through 2025.Industry leaders from companies such as Coca Cola, Dupont, True Manufacturing and Honeywell attended an event at the White House on Tuesday where they pledged to invest in the next generation of HFC alternatives and to adopt more climate-friendly technologies.HFCs are factory gases that were used to replace ozone-depleting substances in air conditioning, insulation and refrigeration. Support is now growing to phase them out under the UN's Montreal Protocol.They are 10,000 times more potent than the most prevalent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and are growing at a rate of up to 15 percent per year.""Today's commitments and actions demonstrate significant U.S. leadership in advance of the United Nations Climate Summit next week and build on progress made earlier in the Administration,"" the White House Council on Environmental Quality said in a statement. They will also help build momentum for an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the use of HFCs.Additional announcements on HFCs are expected to be announced at the UN Secretary General's Climate Summit in New York City on Sept. 23, according to the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development.""This is another important step by the White House in their effort to capture the biggest climate prize in near term by the phasing down of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, a strategy now supported by over 100 countries,"" said Stephen Andersen, Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will carry out some of the executive actions announced by the White House.It will require companies to list additional fluorinated and non-fluorinated chemicals as acceptable alternatives, identify refrigerant management options to reduce HFCs from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment and set up sector-specific workshops on phasing out HFCs.Industry also announced new investments and measures on phasing out HFCs. Stephen Yurek, president of industry group the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute announced the industry will invest $5 billion in research and development over the next decade to develop the next generation of refrigerants.Individual companies also made voluntary pledges Tuesday.Coca Cola  set a goal for all of its newly purchased cold drink refrigerators to be HFC-free.

174,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The ploy by the United States to draw extra motivation from a stinging loss to Europe at Medinah two years ago could prove to be ""a double-edged sword"" for them at next week's Ryder Cup in Scotland, Justin Rose told Reuters.U.S. captain Tom Watson has already pinpointed that 2012 defeat outside Chicago as a focal point for his team, saying the Americans will be driven to make amends for one of their most harrowing experiences in the biennial competition.""It could be very powerful, and it could be exactly the right thing to do -- or it could lead to a lot of frustration if they get off to a bad start,"" Englishman Rose said of the U.S. tactic.""Either way, it's a ploy, it's a tactic that is probably the right one but if the Europeans can get an upper hand, it's going to feel very similar to what they have faced probably the last 10, 15 years,"" the world number five added.The Americans have had very little to celebrate at the Ryder Cup over the past 20 years, losing seven times in the last nine editions with their most recent victory coming on home soil at Valhalla in 2008.At Medinah, they were seemingly poised to clinch a rare win when leading by four points going into the last-day singles, but the Europeans pulled off one of the greatest team comebacks on a golf course to triumph by 14-1/2 points to 13-1/2.""I can tell you that all the players I have talked to, every one of them without a doubt, had one thing to say about the Ryder Cup,"" Watson said earlier this month about what came to be known as the 'Meltdown at Medinah'. ""They want to go back and make amends for what happened at Medinah. Our team has that one focus. The Europeans played great in the last round in 2012 and that was a hard loss for the American players and it still sticks with a lot of them.""HEAVY FAVOURITES  The hosting Europeans, who have four of the top six ranked players in the world in their 12-man lineup, are being billed heavy favourites for the Sept. 26-28 matches at Gleneagles.Former U.S. Open champion Rose, however, does not buy into the notion of Ryder Cup favourites and underdogs.""We've got a good team and we believe in our team but I think the U.S. has a good team with some naturally strong pairings and partnerships,"" said the 34-year-old, who will represent Europe for a third time in the competition.""The last two Ryder Cups have come down to one point, each time, so I don't really buy into favourites, I don't really buy into all of that stuff. ""It's going to be the team who wants it the most on the week and is prepared to dig deep for it that I think is going to be the team that wins. There will be no false sense of security from the Europeans' point of view.""Rose is especially thrilled by the prospect of competing in his first Ryder Cup on European soil, having made his debut on a losing team at Valhalla in 2008 before savouring success at Medinah two years ago.""I am really excited,"" said the Englishman, who has achieved an impressive win-loss-half record of 6-3-0 at the Ryder Cup where he is unbeaten in the singles, having twice beaten Phil Mickelson.""It's going to be my first Ryder Cup playing in front of a home crowd and hopefully the energy of that will really spur me on at Gleneagles.""

When we did draw him we would say 'Game on, I've got a chance here.""If he beats me he's supposed to beat me, if he doesn't, well, what a day for me and what a day for the team."" Montgomerie, who also featured in eight Ryder Cups as a player, said European captain Paul McGinley may be tempted to ""hide"" McIlroy in the opening foursomes or fourballs on Friday and Saturday.""I think a lot of pressure is on Rory's shoulders,"" explained the eight-times order of merit winner. ""If the rest of the team see Rory winning it gives them confidence. ""If the team see Rory losing in one of the first groups then it's difficult to think 'we've got to pick up the pieces' so it's a huge temptation to hide him away.""You don't want to put your main star out at number one because the rookies in the American team can play and any one of them can score a 66 and win,"" said Montgomerie who is Europe's third highest Ryder Cup points scorer of all time with 23 1/2. ""I would definitely be for hiding Rory the way Tiger was many times.

176,"   By Tony Jimenez | GLENEAGLES Scotland  GLENEAGLES Scotland The U.S. team have made no secret of the fact they are gunning for Rory McIlroy at this week's Ryder Cup but the world number one will lap up the challenge, according to his mind coach Dr Bob Rotella.Visiting captain Tom Watson told reporters on Monday that it always boosts the confidence of a side ""whenever you beat the stud on the opposing team"".Rotella, however, said McIlroy would use the comment as an extra incentive to perform well for holders Europe when the biennial event gets underway with Friday morning's fourballs.""Rory has a great attitude about it,"" Rotella told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""He will embrace it.""I think he is very comfortable with being the top dog and he's going to enjoy the experience. The more people talk about how badly they want to beat him, the more he'll relish it and use that to take pressure off himself.""The way Rory has played recently he's very comfortable with high expectations and people putting pressure on him. That's why he's the number one player in the world.""The 65-year-old American said four-times major winner McIlroy would also be able to share the burden of being the figurehead of the European team behind the scenes.""My guess is that one advantage Rory is going to have is that he won't have to be the leader in the locker room,"" added Rotella who is an ambassador for sports bookmaker Betway (betway.com). ""Europe have players like Sergio Garcia, Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter who have all been around a long time and had a lot of success.""They will be the team leaders,"" said Rotella. ""Rory will be talked about and he'll be the star player but I think it will help him in that he won't have to be the team leader between matches.""That's very different to what we've had with Tiger Woods over here.""GREAT GOLF  Rotella, who also operates as a performance coach and has worked with nine of the 24 players who will be doing battle at Gleneagles, said British Open and U.S. PGA champion McIlroy's easy-going personality would be his biggest ally.""All Rory has to do is go out there and play great golf,"" he added. ""The fact is that he enjoys his team mates, he gets along with everybody and he's great with the media.""If you look at him in interviews he's a lot more open and comfortable than some of our top players have been. I think he'll handle everything just fine,"" said Rotella.""If he gets beaten it will be because the other man has played better, not that he has beaten himself or didn't handle the pressure."" Former world number one Woods is missing this week after declaring himself unfit following back surgery but the 14-times major champion has a mediocre Ryder Cup record and has only once been on the winning side.Rotella, who has coached the winners of 74 major championships in men's, women's and senior golf since 1984, said the U.S. may benefit from the absence of Woods.""The Americans are going to have to embrace the fact they are underdogs for the first time,"" he added. ""Some of them will feel less pressure because Tiger is not on the team.""All of them will remember the last time Tiger was not on the team that we won,"" said Rotella in reference to the victory at Valhalla, Kentucky in 2008.""That's an omen and I think it will take some pressure off. If we win without Tiger it will be an incredible accomplishment.""Some of them may think they've taken it too seriously and got too worked up about it all and they will say, 'I'm just going to go and have some fun',"" said Rotella.

180,"  (Corrects day of U.N. speech to Saturday from Friday)By James B. KelleherSept 29 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told nearly a dozen U.S. company chiefs on Monday that he is committed to liberalizing his country's economy, which has underperformed other emerging markets recently after years of breakneck growth.Modi spoke at a breakfast with 11 chief executive officers during his first U.S. visit since coming came to power in May, vowing to get India's economy back on track.The prime minister was headed to Washington for a private working dinner with President Barack Obama on the fourth day of the visit. Modi, however, is fasting.Among those attending the breakfast at the New York Palace Hotel were the CEOs of Caterpillar Inc and Boeing Co .""He wasn't at all like the politicians we're used to here,"" said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman, who shared his impressions of the breakfast meeting with Reuters.""He acknowledged that the last five years have been very difficult for the Indian population, the Indian economy and the world in general, and he vowed and promised to change that. I believed him. He was very serious. ... I was genuinely quite impressed.""However, some U.S. business groups have questioned Modi's reformist credentials.Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 15 other business associations representing various sectors gave a more cautious assessment of the prime minister's record so far. Modi also alarmed some foes of government tinkering with business last week when he said in India that multinational soft-drink giants PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola Co  should help increase sales by Indian farmers by adding fresh fruit juices to their fizzy drinks.In a letter to Obama, the U.S. business groups urged the president to press Modi to remove barriers to trade when the two leaders meet on Monday and TuesdayThe letter highlighted India's blockage of a key World Trade Organization agreement reached last year, which overshadowed a July 30-Aug. 1 visit to India by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The business alliance also complained about India's raised tariffs and ""burdensome"" new testing requirements on imported information and communication technology products.Last week, U.S. congressional leaders on trade and finance wrote to the U.S. International Trade Commission calling for a second investigation into India's ""unfair"" trade practices, detailing any changes under Modi.In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank on Monday before heading to Washington, Modi reiterated India's WTO stance, saying that while India supported the trade pact, its demands for food stockpiles were not incompatible with it. He stressed his campaign to encourage manufacturing in India and the country's desire for U.S. research and technology, something U.S. firms have been reluctant to share without stronger Indian intellectual property protectionsIndia, which once seemed to vie with China for the title of fastest-growing developing economy, has stumbled in recent years as a spate of scandals undermined business confidence in the government's commitment to economic reform.Still, Modi had won the confidence of at least one other high-profile U.S. CEO even before the U.S. visit.Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers last week praised him as a leader who had ""captured the imagination"" of Indian business, adding that he would make the needed ""tough decisions"" to revive the company's economy. One of Modi's priorities on this trip is to gather more such endorsements and - judging from Oberhelman's reaction - he won some more converts at Monday's CEO breakfast.""I deeply believe that he's committed to changing India,"" Oberhelman said.""There's no question that part of his mission is to enhance and increase the investment climate in India, both for domestic companies and for direct investment.""Caterpillar is the world's largest maker of earthmoving construction and mining equipment. The Peoria, Illinois-based company operates several plants and research and development centers in India and - together with its two independent dealers - employs more than 10,000 people there.Monday's events follow three momentous days for India's new leader.On Saturday, Modi addressed the United Nations General Assembly, taking a jab at Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir. That evening, he appeared before some 60,000 people at a musical event in New York's Central Park aimed at ending global poverty and bringing essentials such as sanitation to all.And on Sunday, the prime minister received a rapturous welcome from Indian-Americans in an appearance in New York's Madison Square Garden arena.It was all a far cry from 2005, when the former chief minister of Gujarat was denied a U.S. visa over rioting in his home state that killed more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, three years before. Modi, who denies wrongdoing, has been exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court probe.However, the issue has not been forgotten and Modi's U.S. trip had an awkward start on Friday after a little-known human rights group sued him in New York, alleging he failed to stop the riots.

He told CNBC earlier this year he had abstained from a shareholder vote on its controversial equity compensation plan when it came up for renewal in April, even though he considered it excessive. Buffett also said Burger King Worldwide Inc's $11.5 billion purchase of Tim Hortons Inc  was not a tax-motivated deal. ""Overwhelmingly, most inversion deals have had a huge tax motivation in doing them, I can tell you this one didn't,"" he said.Berkshire committed $3 billion in preferred equity for 3G Capital, which controls Burger King, to buy Tim Hortons. Investors and tax experts have said the main reason for Burger King to move its domicile to Canada was to avoid double taxation on profits earned abroad. Buffett said Berkshire's investment in Tesco Plc, Britain's biggest retailer, was a ""huge mistake."" Berkshire had a roughly 3.96 percent stake in Tesco's shares, according to an early May regulatory filing. Tesco shares have fallen about 46 percent this year.Buffett also said his company's purchase of auto dealership group Van Tuyl Group, announced Thursday, was an all-cash deal. He said Berkshire would likely buy ""a lot more"" dealerships over time. Buffett said if he was invested in asset manager Pimco, he would not have changed his investment after the departure of Bill Gross, the co-founder and chief investment officer.""I would assume that Pimco has got all kinds of professionals there managing money,"" Buffett said. ""I would not change, myself, just because Bill Gross left, I mean if I was happy with the personnel at Pimco.""Gross, one of the bond market's most closely followed investors, quit Pimco, or the Pacific Investment Management Co, for distant rival Janus Capital Group Inc last Friday. He was expected to be fired the next day from the huge investment firm he co-founded more than 40 years ago, a source said.

Earlier this week, the Dow component hit a new all-time high, taking out a level that had persisted since 1998.

193,"   By Anjali Athavaley  Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on Tuesday announced new cost-cutting measures and a timeline for selling its bottling operations after its quarterly profit slumped 14 percent and the world's largest beverage maker struggles to find growth amid a soft market for soda.The Atlanta-based company said it would hand back, or refranchise, about two-thirds of its North American bottling territories by the end of 2017, and a substantial portion of the remaining territories no later than 2020. It is the clearest timeline that Coke has given to date as it seeks to sell the bottling operations to franchisees in a bid to shift away from the capital intensive and low-margin business of distribution.Coke also said that it was targeting $3 billion in cost savings by 2019, up from its announcement in February of $1 billion. But the moves failed to impress investors. Coke shares were down 6 percent to $40.54 on Tuesday morning and down 1.8 percent this year while the S&P 500 was up 4.3 percent.Coke is grappling with deteriorating economic conditions in major emerging markets as well as softness in consumer spending in the United States and Europe.  ""This is placing strong pressure on the short-term performance of our business,"" said Chief Executive Muhtar Kent on the company's earnings conference call.  U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks have been declining for nearly a decade, and more recently, consumers have shifted away from diet soda because of health concerns over artificial sweeteners. Coke has tried to diversify its business by taking a smaller stake in companies in faster-growing markets and in some cases, eventually acquiring them. In August, Coca-Cola said it was buying a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O). Earlier this year, it bought a 10 percent stake in Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O which it raised to 16 percent in May to become Keurig's largest shareholder.  Still, analysts said investors have been agitating for further cost-cutting. On the earnings conference call, Kent declined to give specifics on how much of the $3 billion would be reinvested in operations as opposed to flowing through to the bottom line but said the company would achieve a balance. Industry watchers also have been waiting for more specifics on Coke's North American bottling operations. Following a similar move by rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), Coke bought back its top bottler in the region in 2010 to streamline decision-making and cut costs. The company also said it expected to miss its long-term earnings growth target in 2014, due in part to currency fluctuations.  Net income for the third quarter declined to $2.1 billion, or 48 cents a share, from $2.4 billion, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges for refranchising some North American bottling operations and other special items, earnings per share were 53 cents, in line with analysts' expectations. Overall revenue was flat at $11.97 billion versus expectations of $12.12 billion.

200,"  * European shares surge on report ECB to buy corporate bonds     * Wall Street to start up, earnings from Coca Cola, McDonalds due     * Nikkei slips 2 pct, giving back half of Monday's rally     * US Treasury yields back above 2.20 pct as dollar rebounds      By Marc Jones     LONDON, Oct 21 European shares got a major lift while the euro and the region's bond yields fell on Tuesday after European Central Bank insiders told Reuters the bank was readying a plan to buy corporate bonds.     The move could start at the beginning of next year and though not the kind of full-scale government bond buying that markets have been angling for, it would be a major step up by the ECB as it battles a slowing euro zone economy.       European shares jumped immediately after the report, with Italian, French and Spanish  stocks -- potentially the main beneficiaries of the ECB's actions --  leading the way among the main bourses as they surged 1.8 to 2.2 percent.     The euro tumbled to a session low of $1.2760 against the dollar, while there was a complete turnaround in bond markets with a rush down southern euro zone yields and a rush up German ones.      ""There has definitely been an impact on the markets,"" said Luca Jellinek head of European interest rates strategy, at Credit Agricole.       ""I don't know that buying corporate bonds really changes the underlying issues of low growth and low inflation, but any sign from the ECB that it will do more is a positive.""     Traders had already been giving a tentative thumbs up to growth data from China earlier as world markets  continued to recover from last week's heavy falls, although the data did not change the perception that the world's second-biggest economy will continue to slow.     China's economy grew 7.3 percent in July-September official Beijing data showed, slightly above the 7.2 percent forecast by analysts. However, it was the weakest for any quarter since the 2008/09 global financial crisis.      With the euro tumbling on the ECB bond-buying news, the dollar gained some traction and left the dollar basket up 0.2 percent after its 2 percent slide over the last couple of weeks.     The Australian dollar, often seen as a liquid proxy of Chinese growth prospects given Australia's large trade exposure, got a lift from Beijing's data, but had handed back some of those gains in Europe.     ""The euro is the major move,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of FX strategy at UniCredit in London. ""We started the day with a fairly bearish mood on the dollar but that changed after we saw the headlines on the ECB (buying corporate bonds).""                EARNINGS      Europe's positive sentiment was expected to follow into U.S. trading, with U.S. futures pointing to early gains of 0.8 percent for the S&P 500 and almost 1 percent for the Dow Jones industrial.      Gadget giant Apple reported a better-than-expected 12 percent jump in revenue on Monday and U.S. retail sales data is due later alongside another flurry of earnings, including from Coca Cola, McDonalds and Lockheed Martin. .      A breakdown of the earlier China data showed industrial output rose a better-than-expected 8.0 percent in September from a year earlier, up from August's six-year low of 6.9 percent growth.      However, fixed-asset investment and retail sales figures were weaker than expected. The Shanghai Composite index  slipped 0.4 percent, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended broadly flat.      Japan's Nikkei also took a heavy 2 percent hit, as the yen took advantage of a weakened dollar in Asian trading and as investors locked in profits after the previous session's 4 percent rally.           OIL, TREASURY YIELDS REBOUND         The wilting of the dollar this month has come amid signs that with global growth and inflation falling, the U.S. Federal Reserve may hold off from a first post-financial crisis interest rate hike until deep into next year.     Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year government bonds  climbed back above 2.20 percent in European trade though. German Bund yields led the way as the ECB bond-buying news encouraged investors out of safer but lower-yielding assets.     Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher also said on Monday that last week's market turbulence should not stop the Fed from ending its stimulus programme, and that the economy could be fully recovered from the effects of the financial crisis and recession by as early as next year.      Shares in French oil giant Total were also in focus in Europe after its chief executive Christophe de Margerie was killed when his plane collided with a snow plough during takeoff at a Moscow airport.      Like much of the region's stock markets, though, Total shares fought back from a early 1.2 percent drop to climb higher.     In commodities trading, spot gold added about 0.3 percent to $1,249 an ounce, bolstered in part by renewed physical demand ahead of the Diwali festival in India this week.     Oil also clawed back some more of its recent sharp losses as Brent crept up to $85.75 a barrel and U.S. crude  hovered at $82.87.

""Just to maintain the level of play I have had over the last year would be a pretty good accomplishment in itself too. ""I really had a great year last year and it takes a lot of hard work and a lot of good breaks to do that.""So I'm hoping to just play as much good golf as I can and if I can just improve a little bit here and there, my game will translate well and my comfort level in majors will increase.""

215,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel  Nov 14 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  disclosed a new stake in healthcare management company Express Scripts Holding Co and shed its stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co, among several changes in its stock investments during the third quarter.In a regulatory filing, Berkshire also revealed it has disclosed confidential information about its investments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC often allows Buffett to do this to let him amass a large investment without worrying about copycat investors.  Berkshire disclosed last week that it had bought more than $2.3 billion of equity securities in the third quarter.Berkshire bought 449,489 shares of Express Scripts in the quarter, making it among the smallest holdings in its portfolio.Shares of Express Scripts rose 0.4 percent in after-hours trading to $78.20. Companies' shares often rise when Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett. In contrast, Berkshire eliminated its stake in Deere, which it had originally bought two years ago.Berkshire did not disclose what investments were made by Buffett's portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire's larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest, make other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with. Other changes to Berkshire's stock portfolio simply adjusted already-existing positions.Berkshire raised its share stakes in several companies including DirecTV, General Motors, MasterCard and Suncor Energy. It also cut its share stakes in Bank of New York Mellon, ConocoPhillips, National Oilwell Varco and Phillips 66.U.S. regulators require large investors each quarter to disclose their stock holdings, offering a window to their investment strategies.The view is limited because investors are not required to list short positions, foreign holdings and bonds, and because it reflects the just-completed quarter.Berkshire ended September with about $118.9 billion of equities, the vast majority of which are on U.S. exchanges.It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

217,"  * Non-cash deal to help speed up African expansion* Coke to buy SABMiller some non-alcoholic brands* SABMiller says merger to save soft drink expansion spending   (Adds details, SABMiller Africa comment )By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Helen Nyambura-MwauraJOHANNESBURG, Nov 27 SABMiller   and Coca-Cola will combine the operations which mix, bottle and distribute their soft drinks in Africa, creating a group with sales of $2.9 billion and ambitions to corner a fast-growing market.Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will be the continent's largest soft drinks bottler, accounting for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa. It will serve 12 southern and eastern African countries, including South Africa.The broader deal -- which will also hand Coca-Cola an extra 20 brands, including Appletiser -- will extend both firms' distribution networks and presence. It comes as brewers like SABMiller bulk up on low-margin fizzy drinks in emerging markets, where soft drinks are outpacing more lucrative sales of beer. For SABMiller, bottling soft drinks may be less profitable than packaging beer, but it is also a cheaper way to grow.""The idea behind the merger is to expand quicker, and over time we will look for more bottlers to acquire to grow the business further,"" Mark Bowman, Africa head of SABMiller.""The capital we would have spent today to expand our soft drinks business in Africa is probably half what we expect to spend in the future.""Coke and SABMiller did not say how much they expected to save with the deal. Households in Africa's growing economies are finding themselves with more disposable income, which they are spending on what previously would have been considered luxuries.Africa's consumer spending on shopping, banking, telecoms and tourism could grow to $978 billion by 2020, from $570 billion in 2010, according to McKinsey.While many U.S. and European companies are taking a serious look at Africa, both Coke and SABMiller are veterans. SABMiller was founded as South African Breweries, while Coke has built a distribution network that allows its drinks to reach tiny tuckshops in far-flung townships. The all-equity deal pulls together SABMiller, Coke and Coke's South African bottling partner, the Gutsche family. SABMiller will own 57 percent of the group, Coke will hold 11.3 percent and the rest will be in the hands of the Gutsches.As part of the deal, Coke will acquire SABMiller's sparkling soft drink Appletiser brands globally, and buy or be licensed for a further 19 non-alcoholic names in Africa and Latin America for about $260 million.SABMiller will retain its non-alcoholic malt beverages in Africa and Latin America and also keep Coke's franchises in El Salvador and Honduras.Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have more than 30 bottling plants when the deal is completed.Nomura and NLA advised Coca-Cola Sabco and Rothschild advised SAB Miller on the deal.(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle in LONDON; Editing by Vincent Baby and Clara Ferreira Marques)",2014-11-27,KO,"Thu Nov 27, 2014 | 10:20am EST","UPDATE 2-SABMiller, Coke team up to bottle Africa's fizzy drinks",http://www.reuters.com//article/sabmiller-beverages-safrica-idUSL6N0TH14U20141127?type=companyNews

220,"  * ""Millennial"" generation keen on self-expression* Mars, Coca-Cola, Nike, Adidas offer personalised products* Co-creation trend spreads as technology advances* Personalisation helps retailers draw shoppers to storesBy Emma ThomassonBERLIN, Dec 11 Looking for a unique Christmas gift to wow friends or family? Try some specially tailored perfume, chocolates stamped with a personal message or sneakers embossed with a selfie.Products with that individual twist are not really new. It has long been possible to get a basic T-shirt, baseball cap or umbrella printed with a name or photo.But big consumer brands, including major names like Coca-Cola, and Nike have latched on to personalised products because they seem to have a particular appeal to consumers known as ""Millennials"" in marketing speak.Used to posting selfie mobile phone shots on social media, this generation, who came of age from around 2000, wants something more than just the latest hot brand name.Millennials still like brands but expect them to listen and react to their ideas and criticism in real time and allow them a role in shaping future products. They have become a big focus of marketing experts as their spending power grows.""They're drawn to brands who are rethinking the way things are done. They want to be heard,"" Maryleigh Bliss, trends editor at youth marketing firm Ypulse, told the World Retail Congress earlier this year.Early to respond was Mars Inc, which prints tiny personal messages and photos on M&Ms chocolates, and Coca-Cola which scored a hit by putting people's names on its bottles, selling more than 150 million.""It was a crazy idea but ... it really connected because it has all the characteristics that appeal to Millennials,"" Coca-Cola chief marketing officer Joe Tripodi said.""It was customisable, it was social."" Coca-Cola has gone a step further to produce its first fully user-generated commercial, including shaky videos showing its fans enjoying a Coke. It has also come up with the Freestyle machine which allows people to mix their own soft drink.The ""co-creation"" fad is spreading to more complex products and processes as technology brings down costs.U.S. sportswear firm Nike allows people to customise colours of shoes and accessories. German rival Adidas has tapped into the selfie obsession by offering shoppers the option to put personal images on the uppers of ZX Flux sneakers. THE FUTURE OF RETAIL? While Adidas customers currently have to wait three to four weeks for the delivery of ""selfie shoes,"" the proliferation of technology like 3-D printing means it might not be long before personalised products can be made on the spot in a store.Ben Perkins, a consumer expert at consultants Deloitte, said brands and retailers have to act fast to keep up with rising expectations for more personalisation.""As speeds improve, this kind of real-time product design, development and manufacture is going to be increasingly scaled,"" he said. ""Don't look at your customer base today but look at them tomorrow and think about how you need to embed these approaches and technologies ... in your organisation now.""Retailers trying to cope with the growth of online shopping are also looking at co-creation as a way to attract consumers back into their stores.British department store Selfridges and Swiss fragrance maker Givaudan created a ""lab"" installation where shoppers can develop a perfume, bottle shape and label tailored to their personality.Australian online start-up Shoes of Prey allows customers to choose from 170 different fabrics to design their own shoes. It launched studios in six branches of upscale U.S. department store chain Nordstrom last month.Shoes of Prey delivers within four weeks but is working towards a two-week turnaround. Chief Executive Michael Fox said that the business model was more profitable and involved less waste as there was no need to discount excess stock.""Customers are looking to participate in the design process to get exactly what they want. Together we see customisation and manufacturing on demand as the future of retail,"" Fox said.       (Reporting by Emma Thomasson.

""Muhtar Kent and the company's leadership team have outlined meaningful strategic plans to accelerate sustainable and profitable growth and deliver long-term value to our shareowners."" Coca-Cola bought Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, for $4.1 billion in 2007 and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc's CCE.N North American business for $12.2 billion in 2010. Wintergreen said the two acquisitions have destroyed shareholder value.This year alone, Coca-Cola spent $3.5 billion in buying minority stakes in beverage companies Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) and Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O.Following criticism from Warren Buffett and other investors for its outsized employee share rewards, Coca-Cola said in October it had adopted new guidelines that would limit its executive compensation plan starting next year.  The company had said the guidelines would facilitate a shift toward performance shares and cash awards and be less weighted toward stock options.Wintergreen said on Monday Coke's problems could be resolved by fixing its compensation plan, cutting expenses and replacing the board and management.

Israel confirmed it had allowed nine truckloads from Jordan to reach Gaza for an enterprise it hoped would provide jobs for hundreds of people in the coastal territory.Hindi said he expected more equipment to be shipped from Germany and Turkey and hoped the machines would be installed at a location in central Gaza by March ""so that we can launch operations before the end of 2015."" ""The factory building is ready, lines of produce are ready,"" Hindi said, adding ""we hope to be able to conclude all the stages without any obstacles."" Hindi estimated total investment would come to $20 million and hoped the factory would employ 360 Palestinians by 2016 and more at a later stage, a small but critical economic opportunity in a territory plagued by poverty and where war has destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of buildings.The plant would be the first to produce Coca Cola in Gaza, which already has a Pepsi plant (PEP.N).Israel's approval of the plant, a plan for which was developed over the past two years, preceded a July-August war involving Israel and Hamas Islamists who dominate in Gaza, in which more than 2,100 Palestinians and 70 Israelis were killed. Post-war reconstruction in Gaza has been slow, with donations from abroad trickling in slowly and Israel tightly monitoring Gaza's imports of construction equipment to prevent Hamas militants from rebuilding tunnels to launch attacks.In a related development, President Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority took a step towards implementing a key truce term that ended the Gaza war by naming a panel on Monday to take control of Gaza's crossings with Israel from Hamas. A statement by Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah said the committee would meet with Gaza officials to ""enhance the work of the crossings and speed up reconstruction.""Their mission would also involve talks with Hamas officials to agree to a handover of the Islamists' role at the crossings.  Palestinians seek independent statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, territories Israel captured in a 1967 war.

230,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Dec 24 Facing a slump in the mail it had been delivering since the days of America's Revolutionary War, in 2012 the U.S. Postal Service began aggressively targeting e-commerce and lapsed customers as the way to salvage its declining business.""Really it started almost at the level of cold-calling, talking to people who really hadn't spoken to us in a long time,"" said Nagisa Manabe, who joined the USPS in May 2012 as chief marketing and sales officer from Coca-Cola Co after a career in the private sector. ""And really trying to persuade them to consider us as a very viable alternative in the shipping market.""With further drops in its traditional bread-and-butter products ahead, the USPS wants to capitalize on e-commerce, which consulting firm Detroit LLP has predicted should grow 14 percent this holiday season alone. But industry experts question whether the USPS has enough space in its delivery vans and whether its unionized work force can handle a greater proportion of the e-commerce market.Over the past two years the USPS has rolled out real-time scanning for packages, a vital tool for online retailers and consumers alike to track their packages. It is also upgrading all of its delivery workers' handheld scanners.The rise of the Internet has taken a heavy toll on first-class mail, the USPS's most profitable product. That falling business played a significant role in the USPS's fiscal 2014 loss of $5.5 billion, its eighth consecutive year in the red.From 2009 to 2013, the volume of first-class mail deliveries dropped more than 20 percent. In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, USPS deliveries declined to 155.4 billion pieces from 158.2 billion. First-class deliveries accounted for 2.2 billion pieces of that decline.But package deliveries rose to more than 4 billion pieces from 3.7 billion, accounting for $1.1 billion of the USPS's revenue growth of $1.9 billion. In the run-up to Christmas, the USPS has been doing Sunday deliveries for Amazon.com Inc  in a number of cities. Manabe adds that the agency will handle the online retailer's push into same-day and next-day deliveries ""in many markets.""EBay Inc is another major customer and Manabe says ""pretty much anyone who's in the e-commerce space at least does some volume with us."" FLEET OVERHAUL Many in the delivery industry are waiting to see how the USPS has handled surging e-commerce volumes in the days before Christmas.The USPS's competitive advantage lies in the fact that it already delivers to every house in America and analysts estimate it can do so for around a quarter of the cost charged by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, which are both competitors and customers of the USPS. ""The U.S. Postal Service has the ultimate last-mile delivery network, so it has a real opportunity here,"" said Vinnie DeAngelis, vice president of postal relations at Neopost USA, which provides tracking and other software for e-commerce retailers and delivery companies.According to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc, in 2013 the USPS accounted for 59.2 percent of e-commerce deliveries, while UPS accounted for 31.9 percent and FedEx 8.9 percent. The USPS has predicted holiday package volume growth of around 12 percent this year from Nov. 17 to Christmas.In the years ahead, the USPS expects 80 percent of U.S. ZIP codes will see ""significantly more business,"" Manabe said. But many of the USPS's current delivery vehicles are more than 25 years old and built for mail instead of larger packages.""They (the USPS) tend to operate smaller vehicles that really cube out (fill up) pretty quickly as opposed to the network we have in place,"" FedEx Executive Vice President Michael Glenn said during a Dec. 17 earnings conference call with analysts. Delivery companies measure their vehicles' three-dimensional space in cubes. The USPS plans to spend more than $10 billion over the next four years on a new fleet of vehicles. Manabe said that could mean three or four different sizes of vehicles to handle different package volumes in urban and rural areas.Some industry experts are concerned that the USPS, whose operations are dictated by Congress, may have trouble handling e-commerce growth due to its quasi-government unionized workers.""When I think about the USPS business model, I don't believe they are ever going to get the productivity of FedEx or UPS,"" said Brian Hancock, a board member of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals.But Manabe insists the unionized work force is on board and recognizes the importance of e-commerce.The last few delivery days before Christmas have been a test for the USPS. After struggling with a late surge in online orders last year that left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve, UPS and FedEx both made it clear this year that they would reject a last-minute flood of packages if it threatened their systems.Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight, says that for many retailers this holiday season, the USPS may have become the carrier of last resort.""The question is whether their smaller vehicles, which are designed for mail rather than packages, could handle the extra volume,"" he said.

231,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | KAPALUA, Hawaii  KAPALUA, Hawaii Chris Kirk ended a roller-coaster week at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in record-equalling style, profiting from a new putting grip as he fired a sizzling 11-under-par 62 in Monday's final round.Dead-last overnight in the elite winners-only field of 33, Kirk rocketed up the leaderboard with a barrage of birdies on the hilly Plantation Course at the Kapalua Resort to post a 13-under total of 279.The 29-year-old, a three-times winner on the PGA Tour, employed a 'claw' grip on his putter as he picked up four shots before the turn, then covered the back nine in a scintillating seven-under 30 to match the tournament course record.""I haven't got to practise a whole lot but something kind of clicked for me on the back nine,"" Kirk, who booked his place in the elite field by winning the Deutsche Bank Championship in September, told reporters. ""I hit a lot of wedges close, and I drove it way better today. I drove it right where I was looking all day, which was nice.""South Korean K.J. Choi was the first player to shoot a 62 at the Kapalua event, doing so in the third round in 2003. Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell then followed suit in the final round in 2011.Kirk, who opened with a 68 at Kapalua before plummeting down the leaderboard with a 76 and 73, introduced the claw putting grip for the first time during Sunday's third round. With a claw grip, the bottom hand comes off the putter grip and rests gently against the shaft.""It's something that I've been practicing with for probably six months, and I hadn't put it in play yet until yesterday,"" said the American, who raced around the Plantation Course in under three hours as he did not have a playing partner. ""I putted really well last year ... but there were some times I didn't feel like I was getting the ball started on line as well as I could. I generally am a very good putter out here because I have good speed and I read the greens really well.""So if I can find a way to consistently start the ball on line a little bit better, I should be able to have more days like today.""

The company says they both now produce annual revenues of at least $1 billion. ""Increasingly, we’ve seen this category being very fertile and growing in quite a few regions across the world,"" said Samir Bhutada, the company's global director of tea and ready-to-drink coffee, in an interview. The company launched Gold Peak in 2006 and Fuze in 2012. Global sales in the ready-to-drink tea category have more than doubled in the last decade, and sales are expected to reach $53.9 billion this year, according to Euromonitor International. For companies that sell soft drinks like Coke and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), the category represents an opportunity to diversify the portfolio as both have faced pressure from investors amid a decade long decline in U.S. soft drink sales. Pepsi's chief executive Indra Nooyi last year said the company's Lipton Pure Leaf tea, which it markets through a joint venture with Unilever PLC	(ULVR.L), was among its products that achieved more than $100 million in retail sales in its launch year and generated double digit retail sales growth in the second year.  Coke had roughly 9 percent of global market share for tea last year, according to Euromonitor. Gold Peak is positioned as a homebrewed tea for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, Fuze, which combines tea and fruit juice, has performed well in overseas markets like Turkey and Mexico.""The concept is to sort of take this as an alternative to sodas, especially as we're seeing more and more consumer backlash to carbonated soft drinks in Latin America as well as Europe,"" said Jonas Feliciano, senior beverages analyst at Euromonitor.

The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 rallied more than 1 percent, even as declining oil prices pushed the S&P energy index down a modest 0.19 percent.     European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stepped up contacts with Greece's new leftist leader to try to bridge differences on the country's debt crisis but EU officials cautioned against expecting a breakthrough this week.  Earlier, reports of a possible agreement helped shares rebound ahead of a meeting of the bloc's finance ministers Wednesday.      German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, however, denied Greece had come to an agreement with the Commission and said the ministers would not negotiate a new program.

Coca-Cola Co shares boosted the Dow and the S&P 500 after the company reported a bigger-than-expected profit and its first increase in North American sales, its biggest market, in four quarters. Shares closed up 2.8 percent at $42.40.      U.S. Treasury yields rose, with those on benchmark 10-year notes surpassing 2 percent to their highest in a month on heightened expectations that the Fed, the U.S. central bank, would hike rates from rock-bottom lows this year after strong U.S. jobs data last Friday.      ""As far as the first rate, June is definitely more in play,""  said Edward Acton, Treasury strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.

In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top regional shares ended 0.57 percent higher, at 1,488.39. MSCI's all-country world stock index was last up 0.54 percent at 421.13.     The rise in Treasury yields helped the U.S. dollar hit a one-month peak against the safe-haven Japanese yen of 119.61 yen . The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, was last up 0.34 percent, at 94.764.      Brent crude settled down $1.91 at $56.43 a barrel.

Coke's prices in North America rose 4 percent overall in the quarter. Low gasoline prices and a brighter job market have encouraged many consumers to dig a little deeper into their pockets. U.S. consumer confidence is at its highest in more than seven years, according to a report released in January. In a research note, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg called the fourth quarter a ""silver lining quarter,"" saying efforts to improve growth should eventually bear fruit.Coke said in October that it was targeting $3 billion in cost savings by 2019. It also announced a timeline for selling its lower-margin bottling operations. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller said the cost-cutting plan, as well as the timeline for refranchising bottlers, was on track.  At the end of last year, the company said it would eliminate 1,600 to 1,800 positions. Those workers are being notified, Waller said. Coke has said it would reinvest $1 billion of the cost savings into its brands. Waller said it would do the same with the remaining $2 billion, as well as invest in research and  development, ""if we see a great opportunity.""The company said net income attributable to shareholders fell to $770 million, or 17 cents per share, in the quarter from $1.71 billion, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items such as the effects of cost-cutting measures and the refranchising of bottlers, the company earned 44 cents per share.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 42 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net operating revenue fell 2 percent to $10.87 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates of $10.76 billion.

266,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON A decision by Coca-Cola Co's chief executive to decline his 2014 bonus did not go far enough, a well-known pay critic said Friday, indicating the company could face more scrutiny of its compensation ahead of its shareholder meeting this spring. While Coke Chairman and Chief Executive Muhtar Kent declined a $2.5 million bonus, that amount was offset by increases in the value of his stock-based awards, said David Winters, whose Wintergreen Advisers owns about 2.5 million Coke shares.""The problem is, he's created an impression he took a hit, and he didn't take the hit,"" said Winters, who runs the $1.3 billion Wintergreen Fund, in an interview.Excluding a change in the value of Kent's pension, his total compensation last year was $18.1 million, or about the same as in 2013, according to Coke's pay disclosures.However, Coke spokesman Petro Kacur noted how the value of stock and option awards to Kent will be cut in half this year, to an estimated $7.7 million from the $15.8 million he received in 2014. The decline reflects performance challenges as Coke's total return for shareholders last year was 5.25 percent, lagging the 13.69 percent total return on the benchmark S&P 500 Index.Kent declined his 2014 bonus ""in light of the difficult but necessary decisions required as the company implements strategic actions to accelerate growth,"" according to Coke's proxy statement released on Thursday.    Coke of Atlanta has struggled to boost revenue amid sluggish demand for soft drinks. Winters' criticism last year made the company's pay plan a battleground, though it was ultimately approved by shareholders.Coke spokesman Kacur said Kent's pay details were clearly and fully disclosed.""Mr. Winters continues to make statements that are without merit in an attempt to try to grab headlines,"" Kacur said via e-mail. After last year's criticism Coke made changes that drew some praise from Winters and Liz Cohernour, Wintergreen's chief operating officer, such as giving more details around pay calculations.Winters said his firm plans to cast its ballots against Coke's pay in an advisory vote scheduled for the company's annual meeting on April 29.

Cost of product revenue jumped 71 percent to $10.4 million. The company reiterated its 2015 sales forecast of at least $100 million. Analysts on average were expecting $107.1 million.Net loss attributable to common shareholders narrowed to $7.2 million, or 4 cents per share, from $28.9 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier when it recorded a $21 million charge related to stock warrants.The company recorded a $6.1 million gain related to stock warrants in the latest reported quarter.

268,"   By Stella Dawson  WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Coca-Cola Co has made a good start in axing land grabs from its supply chain, but it must work harder in proving that its bottlers and sugar suppliers do not violate land rights, development experts told the company.Coke declared two years ago that land grabbing is unacceptable, and as a major buyer of sugar pledged to help protect land rights of local communities, including evaluating its top 16 cane sugar-sourcing countries by 2020.In the first of those reports released earlier this month, Coke said it found no evidence of land rights abuses by five sugar mills it buys from in Guatemala.However, those findings raised questions at a World Bank conference on Land and Poverty, given Guatemala's long and often violent history of land conflict and human rights abuses.Karol Boudreaux, land expert at the Cloudburst Group consulting firm, said the report was too superficial, relying on the word of sugar mill operators without digging deeply into their land acquisition methods.""How did the owners acquire title documents?

276,"   By Noel Randewich  U.S. stocks ended stronger on Wednesday as Visa's potential expansion into China and talk of a turnaround at McDonald's helped investors look beyond a mixed bag of quarterly earnings.All of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with the tech index gaining 1.09 percent, propelled by Visa and MasterCard. Visa ended 4.07 percent higher at $68.01 after hitting a record high of $69.98, while MasterCard closed up 3.91 percent after China said it would open up its market to foreign firms for clearing domestic bank card transactions.McDonald's surged 3.13 percent after it said it was working on a plan to reverse its shrinking sales. A week ago, more than 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies to have posted their March-quarter earnings had beaten estimates. But with 121 reports now in, that number has slipped to 71.9 percent - just above the 70 percent earnings beat rate seen over the past four quarters. Many have blamed misses on revenue on a strong dollar for making their products more expensive overseas.    ""We’re sorting through earnings. It’s mixed, but there’s no drastic change to the general economic recovery.” said Michael Sansoterra, portfolio manager of the RidgeWorth Large Cap Growth Fund in Atlanta. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.68 points, or 0.49 percent, to end at 18,038.27. The S&P 500 gained 10.67 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,107.96 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.07 points, or 0.42 percent, to 5,035.17.The Nasdaq Composite is now just 13 points shy of its record high close, set in March 2000, that signaled the limit of the dot-com bubble. By October 2001, 70 percent of its value had evaporated.""I do think there are valuation concerns, and some tech companies are trading at extremely high multiples,"" said Derek Hoyt, chief investment officer at Minneapolis-based KDV Wealth Management. ""People need to be cautious about what they buy, but I don’t think the situation calls for a 70 percent decline."" Major tech earnings on tap for Thursday include Amazon.com , which trades at over 400 times earnings, as well as Microsoft  and Google .Yum Brands ended 3.95 percent higher after the restaurant operator said late on Tuesday it was recovering from a meat scare in China and expected a strong year-end finish.After the bell, eBay was up 5 percent after it posted March-quarter earnings above estimates and said its growth was hurt by the strong dollar. Facebook Inc  posted its slowest growth in quarterly revenue in two years and its stock fell 2.1 percent in extended trade.    On Wednesday, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,737 to 1,230, for a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,483 issues rose and 1,267 fell for a 1.17-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 94 new highs and 33 new lows.

277,"   By Anjali Athavaley and and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on Wednesday reported better than expected profit and revenue, helped by price increases in North America, as the beverage maker struggles to grow amid sluggish demand for soda.The world's largest beverage maker showed the first revenue rise in nine quarters and shares gained 1.3 percent to $41.30 in midday trading. U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks have been declining for nearly a decade, with consumers shifting away from diet soda because of health concerns. Global Diet Coke sales volumes were down in the quarter, while Coke Zero, Sprite and other brands showed growth. Coke has called 2015 a transition year as it attempts to figure out how to increase soda sales. It kept its 2015 forecast unchanged Wednesday and said it will spend up to $3 billion this year buying back stock. ""Investors will need patience here, but get paid a healthy dividend while they wait for better times,"" Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in an email. The company has said it is targeting $3 billion in annual cost savings by 2019 and plans to reinvest part of that in marketing.  The company has said it will hand back, or refranchise, about two-thirds of its North American bottling territories by the end of 2017. With new agreements to give seven U.S. bottlers greater control of operations, Coke said it was on track to meet those goals. ""We still have much to do, and the full benefits from the announced initiatives are going to take time to materialize,"" Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said on a conference call. Coca-Cola's net income attributable to shareholders fell to $1.56 billion, or 35 cents per share, in the quarter, from $1.63 billion, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 48 cents per share in its fiscal first quarter ended April 3.Net operating revenue rose 1.3 percent to $10.71 billion. A strong dollar partly offset higher volumes and prices. Consumers bought more teas, dairy and water, but fewer juice drinks. Coke said the dollar will remain a headwind for the balance of 2015.Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 42 cents per share on revenue of $10.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company benefited from six additional selling days and the timing of Easter. Net operating revenue in North America, its biggest market, rose 6 percent to $5.10 billion. Revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency impact, increased 10 percent, helped by higher concentrate sales and prices, which rose 2 percent.

Net operating revenue rose 1.3 percent to $10.71 billion. A strong dollar partly offset higher volumes and prices. Consumers bought more teas, dairy and water, but fewer juice drinks. Coke said the dollar will remain a headwind for the balance of 2015.Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 42 cents per share on revenue of $10.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company benefited from six additional selling days and the timing of Easter.Net operating revenue in North America, its biggest market, rose 6 percent to $5.10 billion.

Starbucks bought privately held Ethos Brands LLC for $8 million in April 2005. It does not break out sales for Ethos.Starbucks donates 5 cents for every bottle of water sold to the Ethos Water Fund, which is part of the Starbucks foundation.

But Coca-Cola is not moving bottled water operations out of the state.""We are committed to keeping jobs in California, while reducing our water use and replenishing water back to nature,"" Limon said, adding that Coca-Cola is involved in several water stewardship projects around the state.Representatives from PepsiCo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The total volume of bottled water consumed in the United States hit 11 billion gallons last year, up more than 7 percent from 2013. That translated into an average of 34 gallons per person, according to the International Bottled Water Association, citing data from the Beverage Marketing Corp.Starbucks shares gained 0.9 percent to close at $49.78 on Friday.

294,"  (Adds details of holdings, comment, byline)By Jonathan StempelMay 15 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire's favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co  and International Business Machines Corp.The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31.Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp , another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies.No new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall. Buffett has long praised his ""Big Four"" stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire's equity investments.Buffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM's stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola's sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law. ""Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well"" in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett's investment strategies. ""Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.""Friday's regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs.In the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares. The U.S. Bancorp stake grew about 5 percent to 83.8 million shares. Other holdings that grew include Deere & Co, Liberty Global Plc, Phillips 66, Precision Castparts Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.Holdings declined in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Charter Communications Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc , Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc.Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses, including the Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance.Buffett, 84, this month celebrated his 50th anniversary running his Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose market value is fifth-highest among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

The announcement came two days after the pressure group New FIFA Now and international workers' unions renewed their call on FIFA sponsors to put pressure on world soccer's governing body over the issue.Qatar has been widely criticised for the treatment of migrant workers, mainly from Nepal and India, employed in the construction industry. The country announced labour reforms in May last year, although organisations such as the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and Amnesty International said at the time that they did not go far enough.Soccer's world governing body has also been criticised for not doing enough to ensure that workers involved in construction projects related to the World Cup are protected. Coca-Cola, another sponsor, said it expected FIFA to take the matter seriously.""The Coca-Cola Company does not condone human rights abuses anywhere in the world,"" it said in a statement.""We know FIFA is working with Qatari authorities to address questions regarding specific labor and human rights issues.

298,"  (Adds ex-FIFA vice president Warner court appearance, statements by FIFA sponsors, Nike and Coca-Cola)* Nine FIFA officials, five corporate executives indicted* Seven top soccer figures arrested in Switzerland* Authorities seek arrests of others - U.S. prosecutors* High-ranking officials in Switzerland for FIFA Congress* Swiss criminal probe related to Russia, Qatar World CupsBy Mike Collett, Brian Homewood and Nate RaymondZURICH/NEW YORK, May 27 The world's most popular sport was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday as seven senior soccer officials were arrested on U.S. corruption charges and faced extradition from Switzerland, whose authorities also announced a criminal investigation into the awarding of the next two World Cups.The arrests in a dawn raid at a five-star Zurich hotel mark an unprecedented blow against soccer's governing body FIFA, which for years has been dogged by allegations of corruption but always escaped major criminal cases.U.S. prosecutors said they aimed to make more arrests but would not be drawn on whether FIFA President Sepp Blatter, for long the most powerful man in the sport, was a target of the probe. Blatter, 79, is standing for re-election to a fifth term at the FIFA Congress in Zurich on Friday, and FIFA said the vote would go ahead as planned.The European soccer body UEFA called for the election to be postponed, saying ""the European associations will have to consider carefully if they should even attend this Congress.""In a scathing indictment of corruption in soccer, U.S. authorities said nine officials and five sports media and promotions executives were charged in cases involving more than $150 million in bribes over a period of 24 years. They said their investigation exposed complex money laundering schemes, millions of dollars in untaxed incomes and tens of millions in offshore accounts held by FIFA officials.Swiss police arrested the seven, all from the Latin American and Caribbean region, and detained them pending extradition proceedings to the United States, which could take years if they contest the process. The Federal Office of Justice in Switzerland said that six would contest extradition, but that one person agreed to be extradited.""As charged in the indictment, the defendants fostered a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for the biggest sport in the world,"" said Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. ""Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA.""Blatter, who has denied and survived allegations of his involvement in corruption, said in a statement: ""Let me be clear: such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game.""The statement also said that FIFA welcomed the actions and the investigations ""and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football.""Separate from the U.S. investigation, Swiss prosecutors said they had opened their own criminal proceedings against unidentified people on suspicion of mismanagement and money laundering related to the awarding of rights to host the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 event in Qatar. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters at a news conference in New York her office did not want to impede the 2018 and 2022 World Cups but looked forward to working with Swiss authorities investigating the award of the tournaments.""FIFA has a lot of soul searching to do,"" she said.The indictment accused the officials of using a variety of schemes to take kickbacks and bribes from sports marketing firms connected to major tournaments, and also alleged corruption in the selection of the 2010 World Cup host and the 2011 FIFA presidential election.One of those indicted, former FIFA Vice President Jack Warner of Trinidad, solicited $10 million in bribes from the South African government to host the 2010 World Cup, the Justice Department said.Warner directed a number of co-conspirators to arrange the payment, which was eventually sent from a FIFA account in Switzerland to a Bank of America account in New York that Warner controlled, the indictment said. The South African Football Association called the bribe allegations ""baseless and untested.""""THE BEGINNING...NOT THE END"" Warner, former FIFA vice president and executive committee member of CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America, Caribbean Association Football), said in a statement that he was innocent of any charges. Warner surrendered to the police mid-afternoon in Port of Spain, made an initial court appearance on 12 charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering and was granted TT$2.5 million ($400,000) bail.The United States took jurisdiction of the case in part because the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI secured the cooperation of U.S. citizen Chuck Blazer, a former top FIFA official, who U.S. officials said had not paid taxes for years. Blazer's lawyer, Eric Corngold, declined to comment.Kelly Currie, the acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said Wednesday's charges brought in the New York City borough represent ""the beginning of our effort, not the end.""Early Wednesday, FBI agents carrying bags and boxes to execute a search warrant went into the group's office in Miami Beach. Agents also used a search warrant at the offices of Traffic Sports in Miami.CONCACAF said in a statement it was ""deeply concerned by today's developments"" and that ""the Confederation will continue to cooperate with the authorities to its fullest capacity.""In addition to Blazer, 70, others who pleaded guilty were José Hawilla, 71, owner of the Traffic Group, a sports marketing firm founded in Brazil, and two of his companies; Daryan Warner, 46, and Daryll Warner, 40, sons of Jack Warner.Their lawyers declined comment or were not available to comment.""It is clear that the case is based in large part on some cooperating insiders who have already plead guilty,"" said Miami lawyer David Weinstein, former prosecutor.The FIFA officials appeared to have walked into a trap set by U.S. and Swiss authorities. The arrests were made at dawn at a plush Zurich hotel, the Baur au Lac, where officials are staying before the vote. Suites at the hotel cost up to $4,000 a night. SPONSORSHIP CONSEQUENCES The arrests could have implications for sponsorship.The indictment said that in 1996, an unidentified global sports company agreed to pay $160 million over 10 years to become Brazil's exclusive footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment supplier. That was an apparent reference to Nike Inc , which sponsored the Brazil national team.Nike said that it was cooperating with authorities. ""Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport...,"" a company statement said.The indictment said that the company agreed to additional financial terms not in the initial contract. This included paying an additional $40 million to ""a Traffic affiliate with a Swiss bank account"" and referred to as ""marketing fees.""German sportswear company Adidas, long associated with FIFA, said the soccer body should do more to establish transparent compliance standards. Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose Budweiser brand is a sponsor of the 2018 World Cup, said it was closely monitoring developments at FIFA.Coca-Cola Co, another FIFA sponsor, said the charges had ""tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations.""Officials said that following the arrests, accounts at several banks in Switzerland had been blocked.The officials arrested in Zurich are: Jeffrey Webb, vice-president of world body FIFA, president of North and Central American body CONCACAF and head of soccer in the Cayman Islands; Eduardo Li, who runs Costa Rica's soccer federation; Julio Rocha, who headed Nicaragua's federation; Eugenio Figueredo, another FIFA vice-president who used to run Uruguayan soccer; Rafael Esquivel who is the sport's boss in Venezuela; Jose Maria Marin, who used to be the head of Brazil's federation; and Costas Takkas, another CONCACAF official.Those detained or their representatives were not available to comment.Lynch said in a statement that the charges span ""at least two generations of soccer officials who, as alleged, have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.""The international governing body of football collects billions of dollars in revenue, mostly from sponsorship and television rights for World Cups. It has been dogged by reports of corruption which it says it investigates itself.""The chickens are finally coming home to roost and this sounds like a hugely significant development for FIFA,"" said Damian Collins, a British member of parliament who founded the reform group New FIFA Now.FIFA's decision to award the World Cup to Qatar, a tiny desert country with no domestic tradition of soccer, was heavily criticised by soccer officials in Western countries. FIFA was forced to acknowledge that it is too hot to play soccer there in the summer when the tournament is traditionally held, forcing schedules around the globe to be rewritten to move the event.Qatar's stock market fell sharply as news of the Swiss investigation emerged.

As a sponsor, we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization,"" Visa said.""This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices,"" it said. ""Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.""U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer's world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years.Airline Emirates and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA, although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung  are reportedly in talks to replace them.Emirates and Sony were among FIFA's six main partners who together paid a total of $177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark.A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony's withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal.Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehaviour of top players on and off the pitch. Sponsors including Nike Inc dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping, but Germany's Adidas decided last year to stick with Uruguay's Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender.""Brands have to take a longer-term view. Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field,"" said Paul Smith, founder of sports marketing research group Repucom.""What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game... Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game, not of the organisation.""CLOSE TIES FIFA's longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co .Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022.That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022. ""This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,"" Coca Cola said.Adidas, which is the world's biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA ""to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards"". Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday.Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas' dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world's top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team.U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said ""the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.""She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike.Nike later said in a statement it was ""concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: ""Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery."" OTHER SPONSORS BRISTLE FIFA's main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations.Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites.That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones.The pressure only mounted after Wednesday's news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA.""Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,"" wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter.The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors.""They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company's cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,"" said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald's Corp said they were in contact with FIFA.Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first ""official"" FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA.""The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren't exposed in the same way as the sponsors,"" said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller.But brand experts were sceptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors.""Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,"" said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton.Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency agreed:""These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,"" he said.

307,"  * Ban on int'l bank transfers crimps local operations* Finance Ministry: Firms can fax requests to wire money* Firms are finding solutions but remain cautiousBy Martinne Geller and Lefteris KaragiannopoulosLONDON/ATHENS, July 3 A halt to international payments from Greek bank accounts is hurting Greek businesses and their foreign partners and threatening supplies of vital goods like food and clothing into the debt-crippled country.With banks closed, people limited to withdrawing 60 euros  ($66.62) per day and Greece's future in the euro possibly hinging on a referendum on Sunday, Greek shoppers have been stocking up on essentials like sugar, flour, pasta, rice, beans, canned and paper goods.Shelves remain full for now as retailers have inventories in storage. But capital controls put in place after Greece defaulted on a loan to international creditors have essentially frozen companies' cash flows and credit.This has severely hampered production and shipping, meaning that goods are in finite supply. With this week's rush to supermarkets, shortages could be around the corner although budget limits are providing some cushion.""At this stage there is no problem of shortages. There is sufficient stock in our warehouses and we renew it frequently,"" said Melina Varoutsikou, spokeswoman for Sklavenitis, one of Greece's largest supermarket chains.""However, nobody knows how much these can last. It all depends on which product we are talking about.""With no international bank transfers, imports and exports have been clobbered, according to SEV-Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, meaning there are fewer raw materials, even for local production, and less petrol available for deliveries. The Greek finance ministry said on Friday that companies wishing to process bank transfers abroad to pay suppliers must submit a request to the Committee of Approval of Bank Transfers through their commercial bank.The ministry said companies can get further information by going to their home branch or calling their bank's central number. But for quicker processing, the ministry recommended faxing the requests. It made no mention of e-mail, the medium often used for international business.Meanwhile, sellers of perishable items like fresh fruit and vegetables stand to realize losses as shipments are stalled.""The food and beverage industry suffers heavily,"" said George Xirogiannis, director of industrial and sectoral policies for SEV, a trade group involved in lobbying the government to reconsider its position on cross-border transactions.""Cash flow problems are spread throughout the economy, regardless of the size of the enterprise."" Large multinationals such as Nestle, Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal and Coca-Cola operate in Greece and could see a sales hit, since wholesalers that lack online banking facilities or international accounts have been unable to execute any payments abroad.""Payment transactions have been severely affected,"" said an official from an international consumer goods company who spoke on condition of anonymity.DISCRETIONARY GOODS DECLINE Over the past five years the retail market in Greece has shrunk by nearly a quarter to about $29.7 billion this year, according to estimates from market research firm Euromonitor International, as its austerity-hit population of 11 million has cut back on everything from groceries to clothes to appliances. The less essential the product, the deeper the drop. ""Unnecessary items saw a dramatic decline already. With what's happening now we expect the decline to be even deeper,"" said Euromonitor analyst Dimitrios Dimakakos, based in London.He noted however that retailers in Greece were reporting sharp increases in sales, versus a year ago, of staple items in the days since Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced a referendum on the country's bailout.With Tsipras's leftist Syriza party having come to power in January, multinational companies have had months to plan for various scenarios and to consider options such as sending Greek profits to neighbouring countries to ease payments to suppliers, or by raising money from physical assets in Greece.""They have done all the scenarios. They are ready to face the crisis,"" said Spyros Christodoulatos, managing partner of consulting firm CS Compass, adding that the Greek business community remained on edge ahead of Sunday's referendum.Yet Yannis Perrotis, managing director of Atria Property Services, a Greek affiliate of CBRE Group that offers real estate consulting services to investors and developers, said some Greek subsidiaries of international companies had stopped getting supplies from parent companies.""It's a really peculiar situation, like a patient whose oxygen level is going down by the day and the heart will stop at some point as the systems stop functioning,"" Perrotis said.The head of one of Greece's largest wholesale clothing importers said that since the capital controls were announced, the market has been frozen, with suppliers demanding different forms of security on orders, probably cash.Credit insurers are reconsidering offering coverage to companies carrying out trade with Greece, according to the executive, who declined to be identified by name.""Last season, when things started looking up for the first time since 2009, they were willing to provide Greek companies in our sector with a certain credit limit. They are now having second thoughts,"" he said.""The good scenario is that there is going to be a drop in consumption in our markets, so we try to be proactive and bring less goods inside the country.""

312,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Yashaswini Swamynathan  Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue as it raised prices and boosted sales volumes in North America, where it has struggled to grow as consumers ditch soda for healthier options. Coke has called 2015 a transition year as it tries to cut costs and boost sales of its mainstay carbonated soft drinks. Global sales volumes of its sodas rose 1 percent in the second quarter, helped by growing demand for Coke Zero, Sprite and Fanta. Sales volumes of still beverages were up 5 percent, with increases in ready-to-drink tea and packaged water offsetting declines in juice and juice drinks. For the second straight quarter, sales rose in North America, which accounts for nearly half of the total. Prices there increased 4 percent in the quarter, while volume was up 2 percent.  Coke effectively raised prices by switching to smaller-sized packaging, and it boosted ad spending for its brands. Expanded distribution of energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp's products (MNST.O) in North America contributed to the increase. The company bought a stake in Monster last year as a way to diversify into faster-growing beverage categories. Coke's net revenue fell 3 percent to $12.16 billion, but it would have increased 4 percent without the impact of the strong dollar, acquisitions and divestitures. Analysts on average were expecting $12.06 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to shareholders rose nearly 20 percent to $3.11 billion, or 71 cents per share. The company said it would buy back shares worth up to $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion this year. Earlier, it had earmarked $2 billion to $3 billion. ""We looked at where we were for the first half of the year, and we looked at cash, particularly because of the currency getting worse in the back half and just tightened the range,"" Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller said on a conference call.Cowen and Co analyst Vivien Azer said in a note that the tighter range seemed ""consistent with the share repurchase revision that we saw last October, where the company narrowed their outlook for buybacks.""Coke's shares were down 0.3 percent at $41.05 in midday trading.

318,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Some of the biggest U.S. corporate names on Monday offered their support - and billions of dollars in green financing pledges - to buttress the Obama administration's quest for a global agreement on combating climate change.Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and 10 other well-known companies joined the White House in launching the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a campaign that the White House said would inject $140 billion in low-carbon investments into the global economy.Massive private sector commitments are seen by participants as essential to getting a global agreement on climate change in Paris in December. Emerging nations have demanded that any agreement include tens of billions of dollars in financing from developed nations to help their economies adapt to a low-carbon future.Although not all the corporate pledges represented new commitments, Monday's announcement showed the administration's ability to get private sector buy-in for international climate change financing. Mindy Lubber, president of environmental investor group Ceres, applauded the announcements but said the White House cannot rely solely on these pledges.""Voluntary commitments alone will not get us the meaningful reductions we need,"" she said. ""Strong carbon-reducing policies are hugely important."" None of the companies involved in Monday's announcement were from the fossil fuel sector of the economy, though the White House said there could be a second round of pledges in the fall ahead of the Paris conference.Other companies included General Motors, Bank of America, Microsoft and Coca Cola, many of which also announced measures to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions and deploy more clean energy.The White House said the companies' promises would lead to at least 1,600 megawatts of new renewable energy being brought on line. Water-use intensity would be reduced by 15 percent and the companies would target zero net deforestation in their supply chains.  Google, which claims to be the biggest corporate purchaser of renewable power globally, pledged to triple those purchases over the next decade. In a blog post on Google's website, CEO Eric Schmidt said while the private sector can play a leadership role on climate change, it needs political certainty to encourage companies to scale up their investments.""We need the world’s political leaders to confirm that investments in clean energy are sound, and that the laws and policies meant to enable such investment will be designed for the long term,"" Schmidt wrote. Among other elements of the plan, Apple, one of the 13 companies, pledged to bring nearly 300 MW of renewable energy online in five states and the Sichuan province in China. Berkshire Hathaway said it will retire 75 percent of its coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019. Soft-drink manufacturers Coca Cola and Pepsi Co. vowed to reduce the carbon footprint of their businesses: Pepsi pledging to expand its sustainable farming initiative for its supply chain, and Coca Cola saying it would reduce the carbon footprint of the ""drink in your hand"" by 25 percent by 2020.Obama needs voluntary private sector participation because the Republican-controlled Congress, which has power over public financing, appears reluctant to authorize extensive spending on renewable energy investments.Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to host an event at the State Department on October 20-21 to ""highlight American leadership in climate investment and innovative solutions to our toughest climate finance challenges.""

While early trading on Tuesday saw something of a rebound for miners, with investors focusing on their ability to cut spending in the face of the commodity price drop, sluggish trade kept energy stocks such as BG Group and BP in negative territory.Technology stocks including ARM Holdings were also weak after rocky Asia trading that saw Apple suppliers fall. ""The continuation of this commodity drag has meant the UK index underwent another lifeless open,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex.Home-improvement company Travis Perkins was among the FTSE 100's worst performers after it published a trading update that it said was in line with forecasts, though some analysts said the figures were disappointing.Insurer Standard Life saw first-half profits dented by a drop in sales of fixed-rate annuities. The shares fell nearly 3 percent. International Airlines Group also fell after reiterating annual growth but slightly reduced capacity growth. Bottling company Coca-Cola HBC fell after a broker downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which cited pressures on revenue growth and profitability and a lack of takeover potential.Deal hopes were much stronger with Smiths Group, whose shares jumped more than 6 percent on reports of stake-building in Smiths Group.Royal Bank of Scotland enjoyed small gains after news that Britain had sold a 2.1 billion pound ($3.3 billion) stake to kick off the disposal of its holding seven years after bailing out the bank.(Reporting by Lionel Laurent; Editing by Alison Williams)",2015-08-04,KO,"Tue Aug 4, 2015 | 4:50am EDT",Earnings-day blues drags UK shares down,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-ftse-idUSL5N10F1N920150804?type=companyNews
321,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON Three European bottlers of Coca-Cola (KO.N) drinks have agreed to merge in what will be one of the continent's largest consumer products deals ever, as they hope greater scale and cost cutting will revitalize sluggish soft drink sales. Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N said on Thursday it would combine with Coca-Cola Iberian Partners (CCIP) and the German bottling business of Coca-Cola to create a new company that will be the world's largest independent bottler of Coke drinks by net revenue, with business in 13 countries including Spain, France and Britain.The transaction will give the new company, Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP), a value of 28 billion euros ($31 billion) including debt, a source involved in the deal said, adding that was based on the core earnings of the companies, planned synergies and CCE's current valuation. CCEP will have annual revenue of $12.6 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.1 billion.""It's a major milestone and major transaction that will benefit all parties involved,"" said Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent on a conference call. ""There's no question we all believe that increased investment potential will lead to a better trajectory in terms of increased revenue growth going forward.""  CCE, whose drinks include Coke, Fanta and Capri-Sun, is struggling with weak sales in Western Europe, where austerity-hit consumers are drinking less soda, forcing producers to discount them, which hurts revenue and profit. Combining the bottlers, which buy drink concentrate from Coca-Cola and package and distribute the drinks, will remove duplicate functions and free up cash to be reinvested in marketing and sales.  CONTINUATION OF STRATEGY The formation of CCEP is the latest example of bottlers consolidating to face industry challenges. Coke and SABMiller  agreed in November to combine their soft drink businesses in Africa, while four Coke bottlers in Japan merged in 2013. The German and Spanish bottlers themselves are also the product of several bottlers merging.  ""This is not something that just came out of a hat,"" said CEO Kent. ""It's an evolution of what you've seen in other parts of the world."" CCE shareholders will receive one share in the new company and a one-time payment of $14.50 a share. The cash portion, about $3.3 billion, will be funded via new debt issued by CCEP, the companies said.The deal is structured as a so-called tax inversion, with CCE moving corporate headquarters to London and cutting exposure to higher U.S. taxes. CCE, now based in Atlanta, used to be the biggest Coke bottler in North America, but sold its U.S. operations to Coke in 2010, leaving it operating solely in Europe.  CCE itself was spun off from Coca-Cola in 1986 as a way to boost Coke's profit margins and balance sheet by separating the capital-intensive, low-margin bottling business into a different company.    CCE shareholders will own 48 percent of the new entity, with CCIP's shareholders owning 34 percent. Coke will own 18 percent. Between the three parties there will be 17 board members, a factor causing concern about accountability for some investors, said Bernstein Research analysts. They also noted concerns about the ""somewhat vague"" cost-savings targets and the tax rate not being lower.The merger is expected to result in savings of $350 million to $375 million within three years of closing.""Net-net, we see synergies, look for clarity on cross-market accountability/cooperation and believe regulatory hurdles are limited,"" Bernstein said.  CCEP will be incorporated in London and its shares will trade on Euronext Amsterdam, the New York Stock Exchange and the Madrid Stock Exchange.   While Coke's CEO said the focus now was on executing the current deal, industry observers said there could be scope down the road for more consolidation. Europe's other sizeable bottlers include Coca-Cola HBC (CCH.L) Coca-Cola Icecek (CCOLA.IS).  John Brock, current chief executive of CCE, will be CEO of the new group, while Sol Daurella, executive chairwoman of CCIP, will be chairwoman.Shares of CCE were up 2.8 percent in New York, where Coca-Cola shares were down 0.5 percent. News of the deal was reported last week by the Wall Street Journal, which sent CCE shares higher. Rothschild acted as financial adviser to CCIP, while Deutsche Bank advised Coca-Cola. Lazard advised CCE, while Credit Suisse advised the franchise relationship committee of CCE's board of directors.

Previously, McDonald’s had been critical of FIFA and urged change without specifically calling for an independent reform process.     “An independent commission would bring an appropriate level of credibility, transparency, and neutrality to the role, and ultimately provide sponsors and fans across the globe with the confidence that the reform effort is both meaningful and a step in the right direction,” wrote Sa Shekhem.    World soccer's governing body has been in crisis since May, when nine officials and five marketing executives were charged by the U.S. Justice Department with exploiting the sport for their own gain through bribes of more than $150 million over 24 years.    In the wake of the scandal, FIFA President Sepp Blatter has said he will stand down next February.     Last month FIFA announced they were creating a Reform Task Force made up of ten representatives of its regional confederations and to be chaired by someone from outside of soccer.    That body, which has yet to have its membership announced, is scheduled to make its proposals to FIFA’s executive committee in late September.    Campaigners were critical of the move, saying only an entirely independent body could bring about effective change.      “We applaud McDonald’s for joining with Coca-Cola and Visa. They understand just how vital it is that reform of FIFA is independent of the deep vested interests surrounding the organization and its personnel,” said New FIFA Now co-founder Jaimie Fuller.

Bozer, executive vice president and president of Coca-Cola International, will stay on as an adviser until March of 2016, the company said.""We believe this structure will allow Kent to focus more on longer-term strategy across the entire Coke system versus day-to-day operations,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog in a note. ""Given Quincey's favorable regard in the organization and relatively young age, we believe this new role potentially positions him to become (Coke's) next CEO."" Quincey, 50, is a 19-year veteran of the company and most recently served as president of Coke's Europe group, the company's most profitable business.  The announcement means that Quincey could succeed Kent, 62, who was elected CEO in 2008. Under the new management structure, the heads of Coke's international businesses, as well as Irial Finan, president of bottling investments, and Sandy Douglas, who oversees North America, will report to Quincey. In a conference call with reporters, Kent declined to speculate on succession plans but said the board unanimously supported Quincey's appointment. Quincey was instrumental in leading the negotiations for the recently proposed merger of Coke's bottlers Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and the German bottling business to form Coca-Cola European Partners Plc.  The proposed deal, valued at 28 billion euros ($31 billion), will make Coca-Cola European Partners the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on net revenues.His team in Europe also helped Coke acquire juice maker Innocent in 2009.  ""Given Quincey's global background and significant deal experience, we can't help but wonder if (Coke) will accelerate growth through stepped-up acquisitions,"" Herzog said in the note.Before he joined Coke in 1996, Quincey was a partner in strategy consulting at the Kalchas Group, a spin-off from Bain & Company and McKinsey.

FIFA was thrown into turmoil in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences.The charges included fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. Visa, McDonald's and Coca-Cola did not initially respond to requests for comment on the meeting.FIFA has set up a new Reform Committee, headed by former International Olympic Committee (IOC) director general Francois Carrard. However, critics say it lacks independence as it is made up mostly of members of the continental confederations who also elect the members of the executive committee.The executive committee is itself one of the main targets for reforms.(Reporting by Brian Homewood; editing by Clare Fallon)",2015-08-18,KO,"Tue Aug 18, 2015 | 2:01pm EDT",Soccer-FIFA to meet sponsors on Thursday - source,http://www.reuters.com//article/soccer-fifa-sponsors-idUSL3N10F38T20150818?type=companyNews

Additionally, Coke said all four entities, along with Coke's operating group in North America, will form a new supply group to work together on decisions in areas such new packaging launches and ingredient purchases, Coke said.

The deal under negotiation could change and there is no certainty that either Pepsi or Coca-Cola will reach an agreement, the people said. Other companies are also in talks with Chobani about a potential investment, the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.

Based in New Berlin, New York, Chobani was founded in 2005 by Turkish immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya, its majority owner and chief executive. While its yogurt has become one of the top-selling Greek brands in the United States, Chobani has also experienced some growing pains. Private equity firm TPG Capital LP gave a $750 million loan to the company last year to help it fund a turnaround.Pepsi and Coca-Cola are no strangers to the dairy sector. In 2012, Pepsi started selling yogurt through a joint venture with German dairy company Theo Müller.

357,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales due to a strong dollar, and the company said it expected the currency to hurt its full-year revenue more than previously anticipated. The soda maker, which gets more than half of its total revenue from markets outside North America, said a strong dollar would lower its full-year revenue by 7 percentage points compared with 6 percentage points estimated earlier. The dollar has risen 12 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past year. Coke has called 2015 a transition year as it tries to cut costs and boost sales by raising prices and diversifying into beverages beyond soft drinks such as cold-pressed juices and energy drinks. The company has said that it is targeting $3 billion in annual cost savings by 2019.It is also selling back its North American bottling operations to franchisees in a move to reduce low-margin assets on its balance sheet. The company said on Wednesday it signed letters of intent with three U.S. bottlers to expand distribution areas in seven states.    Overall, Coca-Cola's global sales volume rose 3 percent, driven by non-carbonated beverages such as ready-to-drink teas and juices. In an interview, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi called the growth healthy. He also noted that selling, general and administrative expenses, which declined 7 percent to $4.2 billion, were less than he expected, indicating that the company's cost cutting was having an impact earlier than anticipated.  Revenue from North America, its biggest market, rose 1 percent, helped by higher pricing and expanded distribution of Monster Beverage Corp's (MNST.O) energy drinks. Asia Pacific was the only business where sales excluding impacts from acquisitions declined, indicating that consumers there are shifting from soft drinks to non-carbonated beverages like tea. ""Coke is not as well positioned in those categories,"" he said.Shares fell 8 cents to $42.38 in early trading.      Coca-Cola's net operating revenue fell nearly 5 percent to $11.43 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 2. Its organic revenue, which excludes the impact of currency movements and mergers and acquisitions, rose 3 percent.

Coke has called 2015 a transition year as it tries to cut costs and boost sales by raising prices and diversifying into beverages beyond soft drinks such as cold-pressed juices and energy drinks. The company has said that it is targeting $3 billion in annual cost savings by 2019.It is also selling back its North American bottling operations to franchisees in a move to reduce low-margin assets on its balance sheet. The company said on Wednesday it signed letters of intent with three U.S. bottlers to expand distribution areas in seven states.Overall, Coca-Cola's global sales volume rose 3 percent, driven by non-carbonated beverages such as ready-to-drink teas and juices. In an interview, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi called the growth healthy. He also noted that selling, general and administrative expenses, which declined 7 percent to $4.2 billion, were less than he expected, indicating that the company's cost cutting was having an impact earlier than anticipated.Revenue from North America, its biggest market, rose 1 percent, helped by higher pricing and expanded distribution of Monster Beverage Corp's energy drinks.Asia Pacific was the only business where sales excluding impacts from acquisitions declined, indicating that consumers there are shifting from soft drinks to non-carbonated beverages like tea.

362,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) multi-tranche issuance of senior notes  including: --$750 million senior fixed rate notes due 2017; --$1.5 billion senior fixed rate notes due 2020; --$1.75 billion senior fixed rate notes due 2025.  The Rating Outlook is Negative.  Coca-Cola had approximately $46.2 billion of debt as of Oct. 2, 2015. A complete  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds for general  corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures,  acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets, redemption and repayment  of short-term or long-term borrowings and common stock purchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Debt Structure, Elevated Leverage The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated gross leverage of 3.4x on a  total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis for the first half of 2015, up from 2.8x at  the end of 2013. Since 2010, total debt has increased by approximately $21  billion to $46 billion at the end of the third quarter 2015. At July 2, 2015,  commercial paper balances totalled approximately $16 billion or 36% of the  firm's total debt. Coca-Cola does not generate sufficient domestic cash combined with dividend and  royalties from international sources to fund domestic cash requirements for the  dividend, U.S. capital investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A  activities. The company has also been reluctant to repatriate foreign earnings  given the tax consequences. As a result, the past growth in total debt including  Coca-Cola's large commercial paper balances, is due to domestic borrowing as a  large portion of the firm's cash flows are generated offshore. Sizeable Offshore Cash Position Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $20.9 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, $18.2 billion was held by  foreign subsidiaries excluding accounts held in Venezuela and Argentina as of  the second quarter 2015. For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. For certain issuers with significant levels of foreign cash positions like  Coca-Cola, supplemental adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the  level of tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. The foreign cash  balances are reduced by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further  adjustment capturing expectations for additional foreign cash balances that  could be used for shareholder-friendly actions. The supplemental adjusted EBITDA  net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of the first half 2015 was 2.5x compared  to 2.0x at the end of 2013. Deleveraging Key to Outlook Stablization  Fitch had expected Coca-Cola's supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage to  increase to the mid 2x range driven by an estimated $4 billion of borrowing to  fund domestic requirements. Fitch views the increase in net leverage as  concerning since it has been due to Coca-Cola's aggressive financial policies. Continued progress by Coca-Cola toward developing and implementing an  appropriate longer-term plan during the next 12 months to reduce aggregate debt  balances including sustaining lower commercial paper (CP) balances that would  lead to an improved financial structure is key. Past CP levels were roughly half  of the total debt compared to 36% for the second quarter of 2015. If Fitch  believes the company cannot realize improvement within its credit profile that  is comparable to Fitch's 2016 expectations, a downgrade is likely. Strong Global Brands Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global  beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has 20 $1  billion plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute  Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, market position and  diversification lend considerable support to Coca-Cola's business profile. Given  the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in the  U.S., continued concern over artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in  North America, and modest CSD growth in other developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing  geographies with greater long-term growth characteristics driven by low per  capita CSD consumption characteristics and expanding middle class that should  provide an important longer-term offset. CCEP Bottling Combination a Positive Fitch views the new bottling combination of Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP)  that will have pro forma 2015 revenue and EBITDA of $12.6 billion and $2.1  billion respectively, as a positive step toward improving the sustainability of  cash generation for the Coca-Cola System's underlying business operations in  Western Europe. As such, Coca-Cola's segment results should benefit longer-term  as its largest independent bottler improves its strategic operating profile. Coca-Cola's European bottling business has faced persistent headwinds caused by  a macro environment characterized by reduced consumer spending, higher  unemployment and the negative effects of austerity programs in Western Europe.  In addition, structural challenges due to health and wellness trends are  affecting the demand for carbonated soft drinks in developed markets. The  challenging environment thus places more importance on the need for Western  European consolidation. The merger increases operational scale, creates synergy opportunities, better  leverages best practices and improves operational strategy across 13 contiguous  countries. This should improve efficiencies, thus increasing CCEP's ability to  invest behind the brands. Fitch believes The Coca-Cola Company's 18% ownership  position, which includes two board seats, should also enhance the strategic  alignment within the Coca-Cola system between the two companies. The transaction  is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. Innovation Pivotal Innovation and M&A will continue to play pivotal roles for nonalcoholic beverage  companies including Coca-Cola to evolve their product portfolios beyond CSDs and  adapt to changing consumer taste or preferences. CSDs constitute approximately  74% of Coca-Cola's global portfolio. Diet CSD declines in the U.S. are in the  mid- to high single-digit range as perceptions toward artificial sweeteners,  fueled by social media attacks, remain highly negative. U.S. diet volume trends  are also inherently more volatile given the relatively narrow drinker base. As the shift in consumer attitude has become more centered on health and  wellness, companies are targeting new beverages that are fresh, natural,  minimally processed, and have a shorter ingredient list with flavorful taste  profile. Fitch believes innovation to bring back lapsed consumers to the CSD  category given the numerous alternative choices could prove challenging and  places a greater importance on having a well-rounded beverage portfolio. Regular  CSD retail trends should remain stable in North America in 2015, buoyed by  positive price/pack mix, innovation, marketing investments and an improving U.S.  economy. Operating Results For the quarter ended Oct. 2, 2015, revenue declined 5% to $11.4 billion and  operating income declined 12% to $2.4 billion on a reported basis. Organic  revenue growth, which excludes a 7% negative impact from currency, increased 3%  driven by 3% price/mix and modest growth in concentrate shipments. Organic  revenue growth was positive in all divisions except Asia Pacific which declined  1%. Currency neutral operating income increased 8% after adjusting for a 12%  foreign exchange headwind and other structural items. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Additional key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --Underlying organic sales growth of approximately 3.5% with volume growth of  1.5% and price/mix growth of almost 2% and an estimated foreign currency  headwind of approximately 7%; --Coca-Cola generates at least $10 billion of cash flow from operations (CFFO)  with approximately 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use; --Coca-Cola continues to borrow debt to fund domestic cash requirements in 2015  such that total debt increases to $46 billion; --Net share repurchases of $2 billion for 2015; --Capital spending of $2.75 billion for 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include:  Fitch currently does not anticipate a positive rating action given Coca-Cola's  high financial leverage. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  A lack of meaningful progress toward developing and implementing an appropriate  longer-term plan during the next 12 months to reduce aggregate debt balances  including CP that would lead to an improved financial structure. Parameters of a  deleveraging plan could include the following:  --Meaningful debt reduction from 2015 debt levels of at least 10%. Longer-term  rating expectations are for Coca-Cola to maintain supplemental adjusted EBITDA  net leverage of approximately 2x or less; --Long-term gross leverage of approximately 3x or less; --An improved long-term alignment of domestic cash availability versus domestic  cash requirements such that Coca-Cola does not need to meaningfully increase  total debt on an annual basis to fund domestic cash needs;  --A less aggressive financial strategy related to dividend and share  repurchases; --Sustained reduction in commercial paper reliance.  If Coca-Cola successfully executes a deleveraging plan, Fitch could affirm the  ratings with a Stable Outlook.  Other factors that could individually or collectively, lead to negative rating  action include: --Large debt-financed acquisition; --Coca-Cola materially underperforms Fitch's expectations for organic growth  including volume and price/mix; --Further slowing growth in emerging and developing market regions; --Margin erosion from channel mix shifts, competition, increased spending that  result in reduced profitability; --Lack of progress with executing on productivity based initiatives. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Liquidity Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and free cash flow (FCF). For the second quarter ending 2015, Coca-Cola  generated $11.3 billion and $3.2 billion (adjusting for dividend payment) of  CFFO and FCF, respectively, after generating $10.6 billion and $2.9 billion for  the year ended Dec. 31, 2014. For 2015, Fitch expects CFFO of at least $10.5  billion. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months totalled $2.7  billion. As of July 3, 2015, Coca-Cola's $29 billion liquidity position consisted of more  than $17 billion of cash and short-term investments, approximately $3.4 billion  of marketable securities, and $8.1 billion of availability under its committed  credit lines and revolving credit facility with rolling maturities through 2019. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola and its subsidiary as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

365,"  (Adds investment deals, paragraphs 6-7)WASHINGTON Oct 26 Indonesian President Joko Widodo, speaking after a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday, said his Southeast Asian country intends to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the United States has forged with 11 other nations.""We are the largest economy in Southeast Asia,"" Widodo said through a translator. ""And Indonesia intends to join the TPP.""U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said the United States would keep sharing information about the TPP, which will set common standards on issues ranging from workers' rights to intellectual property protection. ""As we have said from the beginning, TPP is intended to be an open platform to which other countries who are able and willing to meet the standards can potentially accede,"" he said at a business summit hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.More broadly, Indonesia had work to do on cutting red tape, addressing barriers such as local content and local packaging requirements, eliminating import and export restrictions and protecting intellectual property rights, Froman said. President Widodo finalized more than $20 billion worth of U.S. deals during his trip, including a $500 million infrastructure investment from Coca-Cola and up to $1 billion from General Electric for Indonesia's energy and healthcare sectors, according to the Indonesian embassy in Washington.

366,"  (Adds comments from conference call)MEXICO CITY Oct 28 Latin America's largest Coke bottler, Coca-Cola Femsa, reported lower third-quarter profit on Wednesday, hurt by currency volatility and weak sales.Coke Femsa, which has been on a buying spree in recent years in an attempt to offset slowing Coke sales, is focusing on improving its operations and managing costs in its existing businesses, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said on a call with analysts.While Coke Femsa may still consider possible acquisitions in Latin America and elsewhere, the company is focused on increasing sales of existing products, particularly still beverages and juices ""where we see lots of opportunities for growth,"" he said. The bottling company said profit fell to 2 billion pesos ($118 million), from 3.5 billion pesos in the year-earlier quarter, and total revenue dropped 10 percent to 37.7 billion pesos.Still, the company's success in hedging raw materials' costs helped it increase its profit margin and investors appeared to react positively to that news, sending the share price up 1.9 percent to 126.63 pesos after the results statement. Coke Femsa has also been trying to raise prices where it can, at least in line with inflation, said Trevino. ""We are trying to protect those margins,"" he said.Sales of million-unit cases increased by only 1.1 percent, hurt by a dip in sales volume in Brazil, which is heading toward a prolonged recession. Coke Femsa has been trying to increase sales of bottled water and other non-carbonated beverages, to offset a dip in Coke sales in its main market since Mexico's government introduced a fizzy-drinks tax.Coke Femsa's parent company, Femsa, is due to report full results after the market close.Femsa operates the Oxxo convenience store chain and holds a 20 percent stake in Dutch brewer Heineken.

371,"  * Second-quarter revenue up 6 pct, volume up 2 pct* Currency depreciation curbed sales, profits* Says committed to performance, employees during takeover period   (Adds comments by CEO, analyst)By Martinne GellerLONDON, Nov 12 Demand for higher-priced beers helped SABMiller to report a pick-up in quarterly underlying sales despite currency headwinds, a day after it formally received a $100-billion-plus takeover bid from industry leader Anheuser-Busch InBev.The maker of beers such as Peroni and Grolsch said on Thursday its performance accelerated in the second quarter, with underlying revenue rising 6 percent and beverage volume up 2 percent from the prior year.Fueled by strong gains in Africa and Latin America, and success in selling more higher-priced drinks including Castle Lite in South Africa and Cusquena in Peru, the results are an improvement from a 3 percent rise in revenue and flat volumes in the first quarter. Yet SABMiller is being hammered by the weakness of various operating currencies including the Colombian peso, Australian dollar and South African rand, which make raw materials like barley and aluminum more expensive for local units, and then reduces the value of those units' revenues.""It's a good business, but it's under an awful lot of pressure,"" Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling said, adding that currencies were a major reason for a decline in the share price earlier this year.Its shares had fallen 18 percent in the four months to mid-September, when SABMiller revealed AB InBev's approach. Many analysts say that decline had prompted AB InBev to finally launch a takeover offer that had been speculated about for years. On a reported basis, including the currency impact, revenue fell 12 percent to $10.0 billion and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) fell 11 percent to $2.9 billion in the six months to Sept. 30.SABMiller said growth would continue to be driven by developing markets and its focus on more premium drinks, though foreign exchange and higher raw material costs would still weigh on results.It said it planned to deliver more than $430 million in annual savings by the end of its fiscal year, on 31 March 2016. That is ahead of its original target, for savings of $500 million by 2018. ""The SABMiller board does believe that our strategy would have delivered further value to our shareholders over the long term. However, AB InBev's offer secures that value today, which is why the board unanimously recommended it,"" SABMiller Chief Executive Alan Clark said on a conference call.The takeover of the company, one of the largest in corporate history, is not expected to close until the second half of 2016, due to various antitrust approvals needed.In the meantime, SABMiller said it was committed to keeping employees motivated, despite what Clark described as a general tone of uncertainty among staff around future job security.He said the combination of its African soft drink bottling assets with those of Coca-Cola, a deal announced nearly a year ago, was on track to complete in coming months. He declined to say what would happen to the business after the takeover by AB InBev, which serves as a bottler for PepsiCo.He also told reporters it was too early to talk about SABMiller's stakes in France's Castel Group and Turkey's Anadolu Efes or his own career intentions following the takeover.

372,"   By Nita Bhalla  NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Eighteen village councils in Uttar Pradesh are demanding a local Coca-Cola bottling plant be prohibited from extracting water from the ground, claiming its over usage has led to water scarcity in the area, said an environmental campaign group.The villages, which are located in Mehdiganj area of Varanasi district -- the constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi --  claim they have been facing water shortages since 1999 when the plant began operations.""Elected village council heads represent the voice of the people, and they are clear that Coca-Cola is not welcome in Mehdiganj. It is time for Coca-Cola to pack up and leave,"" said Amit Srivastava of the California-based India Resource Center, which is supporting the village councils.""Coca-Cola paints a pretty picture of itself internationally as a responsible user of water, but the reality in India is that it exploits groundwater at the expense of the poor, the women, children, farmers and livestock who have to live with less water because Coca-Cola mines groundwater in a water scarce area for profit.""  Mehdiganj is largely agrarian and communities here rely on groundwater to meet most of their needs, including for personal drinking and washing, irrigation and for livestock.   Coca-Cola uses the same groundwater source to meet its production needs -- placing it in direct competition with the local community, environmentalists say.Srivastava said the 18 village councils had written to State Pollution Control Board, which granted a license to Coca-Cola, urging authorities to prohibit the company from extracting any more groundwater in the area. He also pointed to recent data released by the Central Ground Water Authority which declared Arajiline block, where the bottling plant in located, as ""over exploited"" in 2011.Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt ltd said a 2012 study by another authority called the Central Ground Water Board into a complaint by villagers of ponds, wells and hand pumps drying up found no evidence that the company was responsible.""The Central Ground Water Board observed that this depletion was not due to withdrawal of ground water by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd (HCCBPL) plant,"" said a company statement emailed to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""The report further mentioned there was a clear trend of water depletion in seven blocks of Varanasi district and particularly in Arajiline block, the rate was higher.""Despite the decline, the report also said there was enough water in ponds, dug-wells and good crops of wheat and mustard were observed in the fields, the statement added.

The announcement prompted comparisons on Wall Street between JAB's strategy and that of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev , though some industry watchers were sobered by the high price paid for Keurig, which is struggling with competition in single-serve pods and a failed product launch.While some of the more immediate benefits of a deal would come from JAB's heightened leverage in sourcing coffee beans, the bigger opportunity lies in the greater profit of distributing JAB's expanding portfolio of brands, including higher-end ""craft"" names like Peet's Coffee & Tea, Caribou and Stumptown Coffee Roasters, analysts and bankers said.Some of those brands already produce K-Cups for Keurig machines under licensing agreements, but as company-owned brands those arrangements would provide higher margins.Overall, Keurig's dominance of the U.S. single-serve market is a clear competitive advantage, said Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Athlos Research. ""They (JAB) can handle the brand strategy, the partner strategy, any way they want.""JAB could also raise prices on pods, especially since Keurig will be privately held and face far fewer requirements to disclose how it runs its business, Feeney said. As a result, partners who have licensing agreements with Keurig to make the pods, such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin' Brands Group , would not know how much Keurig is making from those deals and could find it harder to demand a greater cut. FILTER OR ESPRESSO? Whether Keurig will help JAB make greater inroads in Europe at the expense of Nestle remains a question, industry experts said, particularly in the single-serve market where Nestle serves espresso-style drinks rather than the American-style K-Cup which more closely resembles filter coffee. ""I suspect they would need a modified machine,"" said Robert Waldschmidt, a research analyst at investment bank Liberum.Others see room for more filter-style coffee in Europe.""Every meeting you go to, there is still a pot of coffee on the table that's not espresso,"" said one industry banker who was not involved in the deal. ""There's a lot of people drinking Americanos in Europe. There should be a market for this machine."" While significant risk exists that brands like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts could cut ties with Keurig once it is owned by JAB and opt for other partners to manufacture branded pods, analysts and bankers said it was unlikely.""These are significant streams of cash flow to these companies,"" Feeney said. ""It's not trivial for them to say 'OK we'll just do this ourselves.'""Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment. Dunkin' said in a statement that ""we anticipate no change in how we work with Keurig.""JAB's plan does not come cheap, as it will pay a 78 percent premium to Keurig's closing share price as of Friday.""I do suspect they wanted to act quickly and in this instance certain key minority partners like (Coca-Cola Co ) are made whole,"" Waldschmidt said.

380,"  (Adds Pepsi quote)By Tommy WilkesNEW DELHI Dec 11 The Indian subsidiary of Coca-Cola Co said on Friday it may have to close some bottling plants if the government pushes through a proposal that would subject fizzy drinks to a 40 percent ""sin"" tax, as part of a broader fiscal overhaul.The beverage maker, which operates 57 factories and bottling plants across India, said a proposal to group sugary sodas with higher-taxed luxury cars and tobacco would hurt demand for its drinks. ""It will lead to a sharp decline in consumer purchase,"" Coca-Cola India said in a statement. ""In these circumstances, we will have no option but to consider shutting down certain factories.""India's ruling party is trying to push a national goods and services tax (GST) through parliament that would replace a myriad of state sales taxes and shake-up government revenue. A government-appointed panel examining GST has suggested a standard rate of 17 percent to 18 percent, and a higher tax of 40 percent on some goods including the carbonated drinks Coca-Cola sells.Several countries are debating so-called ""sugar taxes"" to tackle obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles. While more than a fifth of India's population lives below the official poverty line, the country is home to the third-highest population of obese people after the United States and China, according to medical journal The Lancet. The chairman of Coca-Cola rival PepsiCo Inc in India, Shiv Shivakumar, said the company supported a unified tax in principle, and said he was confident the government would ""take a balanced view of taxation with respect to our industry"".Coca-Cola India, which employs 25,000 staff, said it is on course to invest $5 billion by 2020 as it looks to raise production to target a growing middle class.The company re-entered India after economic liberalisation in the early 1990s.

381,"  JOHANNESBURG Dec 17 SABMiller and Coca-Cola's proposed deal to combine their operations that mix, bottle and distribute soft drinks in Africa, cleared a major hurdle on Thursday after South Africa's competition watchdog gave its preliminary approval.SABMiller and Coca-Cola agreed in November 2014 to team up to create the continent's largest soft drinks bottler, a group with annual sales of $2.9 billion and ambitions to corner a fast-growing market.The group, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, will account for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa, serving 12 southern and eastern African countries. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will be headquartered in South Africa, its largest market.South Africa's Competition Commission said the deal can go ahead on several conditions that include the enlarged group limiting job cuts to 250 and making sure it purchases cans, glass, sugar and crates from local suppliers. The Commission investigates deals for any antitrust issues and recommends remedies to the Competition Tribunal, which makes a final ruling. There is no set timescale. The all-equity deal would also hand Coca-Cola an extra 20 brands, including sparkling soft drink Appletiser, whose fruit juice concentrate is sourced from South African producers.The Commission said the merged entity has agreed to continue sourcing fruit concentrate in South Africa to ensure that producers did not shut down or cut jobs.

387,"   By Sebastien Malo  NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than a third of the world's food goes uneaten, and many crops harvested in Africa are discarded rather than sold, according to an initiative announced on Thursday by the Rockefeller Foundation to cut food waste and loss by half.The seven-year, $130 million project aims to tackle food waste from crops in the fields to dinner tables in industrialized nations, the Foundation said in its announcement at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.Sub-Saharan Africa will receive much of the initiative's resources, the Foundation said. In Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, up to half of some crops are lost due to inefficient harvesting, storage, processing and time to market, it said.""The amount of food lost or wasted before it ever reaches a table is simply unacceptable, with devastating impacts on people, profit and planet,"" said Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, in a statement.Enough food is grown to feed the 1.2 billion hungry or undernourished people worldwide, but a third is never eaten, according to United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization figures cited by the Foundation. That lost food is worth about $1 trillion, according to the FAO.The initiative, called YieldWise, aims at cutting food waste and loss in half by 2030, the Foundation said. Last year, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama also announced a goal of reducing food waste by 50 percent by 2030.In France, legislators have banned big supermarkets from destroying unsold but edible food. The Foundation said it is counting on partnerships with food giants Coca-Cola Co and Dangote Group to help small farmers bring produce to market. Training at mango farms in Kenya, maize farms in Tanzania and tomato farms in Nigeria is already in the works, the New York-based philanthropic organization said, teaching farmers such skills as the use of crop-preserving technologies and strategies against crop loss.

402,"   By John Weavers  SYDNEY, Feb 16 (IFR) - The Coca-Cola Company  (Aa3/AA/A+) looks set to provide the first real test of the year for the corporate Kangaroo market, having mandated Deutsche Bank to arrange investor meetings from March 7 for a potential debut trade.The stellar A$2.25 billion ($1.59 billion) triple-tranche issue last August from Apple, rated Aa1/AA+ (Moody's/S&P), raised hopes that Australia would become a key second-tier destination for overseas credits, alongside the sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar markets.Intel, rated A1/A+ (Moody's/S&P), followed three months later with a slightly underwhelming inaugural A$800 million dual-tranche sale, which, despite being the second-largest corporate Kangaroo, failed to match hopes for a A$1 billion-plus issue.Intel's average order sizes were back at the typical A$20 million-A$50 million levels rather than the bumper Apple tickets of up to A$150 million, as the world's biggest chip-maker struggled amid a more difficult market backdrop than the one Apple had faced. Limited credit analyst coverage among Australian fund managers also weighed on the Intel trade, while several Asian investors felt the pick-up offered over Intel's US dollar curve was insufficient to compensate for the lower liquidity in the Australian market. The latter is a particularly important consideration during times of global market stress.Local funds are more familiar with Coca Cola, especially with regional bottler Coca-Cola Amatil, rated A3/A- (Moody's/S&P), having previously issued Australian dollar bonds, including a A$150 million seven-year MTN in November 2012.With the Aussie dollar, a proxy for China risk, now trading at around 70 US cents after being near parity between October 2010 and October 2014, a Kangaroo issue must now exceed A$700 million to reach the equivalent US dollar benchmark size of $500 million. It will be a very impressive result if Coca-Cola matches the size of its first Matterhorn transaction in September 2015, a SFr1.325 billion ($1.345 billion) three-trancher.Coca-Cola debuted in the euro market 12 months earlier with a 2 billion euro ($2.23 billion) dual-trancher and followed up with a whopping 8.5 billion euro five-note issue last February. The company, historically a large issuer, printed its last US dollar transaction in October 2015 with a $4 billion SEC-registered three-part senior unsecured offering.Deutsche Bank's role as arranger for the Coca-Cola roadshow underlines its position as the go-to international bank for US corporate blue chips looking to visit Down Under.Deutsche was joint lead manager for the Apple Kangaroo with CBA and Goldman Sachs and also led the Intel debut alongside Westpac.Although the Korea National Oil Corporation A$325 million three-year floating-rate-note sale on February 2 was technically 2016's first corporate Kangaroo, the state-owned company is seen as sovereign rather than corporate risk, while only 2 percent of the bonds were allocated to Australasian investors.

405,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives.Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier.Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share.Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion.Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire's intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501.For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.Buffett's largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash.Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G shares that Berkshire now owns.Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market.Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell. Buffett said BNSF's profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire's insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments.The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments.Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31.In Friday trading, Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92.

411,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON The British government's planned levy on sugary soft drinks means more business for suppliers of specialty ingredients that boost sweetness without adding calories and can mask aftertastes or add texture. The surprise levy announced on Wednesday would go into effect in two years. That gives manufacturers including Coca-Cola (KO.N) or PepsiCo (PEP.N) and their UK partners such as Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N or Britvic (BVIC.L) time to roll out more low-calorie drinks. Beneficiaries could include PureCircle (PURE.L), which sells the natural low-calorie sweetener stevia, Tate & Lyle (TATE.L), which sells sweeteners such as sucralose, and Kerry Group (KYGa.I), which sells natural flavours and coloring agents.Such companies are profiting from growing demand for lower-calorie foods and are free of competition from independent start-ups or own-brand players, since they often supply all major manufacturers. They are also high-margin, high-growth and have high barriers to entry, said Neil Brown, investment manager of pan European equities on Alliance Trust's Sustainable Investment team. His fund has owned shares of Kerry and peers Chr. Hansen (CHRH.CO), Naturex (NATU.PA) and DSM (DSMN.AS) for years.""Obesity is a serious issue, and most of us are trying to eat more healthily,"" Brown said.""We'd rather be in the company that gets the phone call to try and fix it, rather than the company that faces clear headwinds."" U.S. firm Ingredion (INGR.N), which sells corn syrup and other ingredients, has seen ""double-digit"" growth in its specialty ingredients business in Mexico since that country implemented a tax on sugary drinks and foods in 2014.""It created an environment for a company like ours to come up with affordable, healthy solutions,"" CEO Ilene Gordon told Reuters recently.  ""We quickly took formulations that we had in the rest of the world, solutions from Europe, and we adjusted them for the Mexican market, in flavor, taste and affordability,"" she said, citing as an example a Mexican yogurt that Ingredion reformulated using a less expensive starch. WORK IN PROGRESS  For Investec analyst Nicola Mallard, the two-year window before implementation of the UK levy is a sign the government  wants manufacturers to reformulate drinks, rather than merely raise prices, which can have limited effect if people get used to the new price and eventually return to old habits.""The easiest way to get people to consume less sugar is to not put it in the product in the first place,"" Mallard said. Yet Coke, Pepsi and others have been changing their product line-ups for the past decade, adding more lower-calorie juices, teas and water drinks as well as low-calorie versions of their flagship colas, to match consumer demand.""If you go back 20 years, the proportion of low- or no-calorie products on the market was 30 percent,"" said Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association. ""Now it's about 60 percent,"" including bottled water.In January, for example, Coke announced a ""one brand"" approach to marketing its flagship cola that allows for the classic full-calorie version in red packages, but also Diet Coke in silver, Coke Zero in black and most recently, Coke Life in green. The variety means Coke never has to change the recipe of the classic cola, said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt, though it has changed the recipe for Coke Life in the UK.  Instead of one-third less sugar as it had for its 2014 launch, the new mid-calorie Coke Life has 45 percent less, due to the addition of more stevia, which comes from a South American shrub. ""Reformulation is biggest on new products because there's no preset notion of what it should taste like,"" Waldschmidt said. Brands are reluctant to change recipes too fast, he said, citing last year's rocky performance for Diet Pepsi in the United States after it replaced aspartame with sucralose. Consumers complained of an unpleasant aftertaste in the new version, which highlights the opportunity for a class of specialty ingredients that do not provide sweetness or flavor, but have functional benefits like masking an aftertaste, boosting a sweetness, or providing bulk or texture.There will also be growing demand for ingredients such as Tate & Lyle's Dolcia Prima, made from allulose, which has 70 percent of the sweetening power of sugar but only 10 percent of the calories. Allulose, which occurs naturally in figs, raisins and jackfruit, can be used in the United States, but has not yet been approved in Britain.

412,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) and the debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its  subsidiaries at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative. A full list of rating  actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross  leverage and supplemental net leverage basis) as currently high for the ratings.  Moreover, Fitch needs to see progress related to refranchising and evidence that  Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital allocation stragegy related to  share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction. The Outlook could be stabilized  with a public commitment over the next 12 months toward a deleveraging policy.  Fitch would need to see clear visibility and traction on gross leverage  declining below 3x and supplemental net leverage below 2x as the company  transitions to a franchising model, produces at least 3% organic top-line growth  and sees EBITDA improvement through targeted productivity initiatives.  Long-term Business Model Strengthened Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result  of accelerated refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some  near-term EBITDA dilution, Coca-Cola will receive upfront cash proceeds that  will be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to bottling assets  to offset this decline. Moreover, over time, the refranchising will  substantially reduce SG&A costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range,  result in operating margins that improve to the mid-30% range from approximately  24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity. Consequently, upon completion of  refranchising in 2017, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows are expected to be more  stable providing greater support to its longer-term credit profile.  Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also  provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. While  Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand strength by  increasing media and R&D spending, cost reductions should help drive future  growth in operating profit. Consequently, Fitch views Coca-Cola's long-term  mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial  targets as achievable. More Balanced Capital Allocation Expected Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the  world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt including larger commercial paper (CP)  balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital  investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A activities.  Coca-Cola is in the process of implementing a more appropriate longer-term  capital allocation policy to improve the alignment of domestic cash generation  versus domestic cash requirements that should benefit its longer-term financial  structure. These steps include: a reduced reliance on CP usage to below $15  billion, a more balanced long-term share repurchase policy including reductions  for material M&A activity, a more conservative pace of dividend growth, and  using a portion of refranchising proceeds for debt reduction.  CP balances have declined to $13 billion at the end of 2015 from approximately  $19 billion a year ago as Coca-Cola committed to reduce its reliance on this  funding source, although overall debt increased by $2.2 billion in 2015. CP as a  percent of total debt was approximately 30% for 2015 which compares to peak  usage of approximately 50% of total debt. Fitch expects Coca-Cola will maintain  CP balances below $15 billion over the long term which compares to a past soft  cap of $20 billion. Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to Decline For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers  with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental  adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of  tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced  by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing  expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for  shareholder-friendly actions. In our calculations, Fitch haircuts after-tax  foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate for share buybacks.  Fitch expects long-term gross debt, inclusive of CP, to decline during the next  several years with a more balanced capital allocation policy. Supplemental  adjusted EBITDA net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of 2015 was approximately  2.6x compared to 2.3x at the end of 2014. After a modest increase in 2016, Fitch  expects supplemental net leverage will decrease to around 2x in 2018/2019 due to  debt reduction and EBITDA growth.  Strong Global Brands  As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola ratings are supported  by it strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong distribution  platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1 billion-plus  brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid, Fanta  Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach, market  position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's business  profile that has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio and constituting approximately 73% of the mix, the ratings consider  the multiyear declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued concern over  artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America, risks  associated with excise tax increases and slowing growth in other developing  countries. Fitch believes this risk is mitigated in part by Coca-Cola's market  strength in developing and emerging geographies with greater long-term growth  characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption characteristics,  urbanization, population growth, and expanding middle class that should provide  an important longer-term offset.  Coca-Cola along with the rest of the beverage industry have also modified their  price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both smaller  pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per unit  versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium and  smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the low-double-digit growth rates within  this packaging combination mix. Underlying Growth Should Improve Fitch expects underlying revenue growth in 2016 of approximately 3.6% with  volume growth of 1.8%, price/mix growth of 1.8% and foreign currency pressure of  4%. Beyond 2016, Fitch believes Coca-Cola should be able to improve organic  growth rates during the medium term to close to 5% on volume growth of 3% and  product/mix of 2%. Fitch expects underlying operating income growth will  increase in 2016 by almost 7% driven by productivity benefits and organic  growth. Coca-Cola's productivity savings program enables additional financial  flexibility over the next several years to cover incremental investments and  costs that will be used in part for increased media investments and brand  support development. Coca-Cola has already redirected $600 million in previous  productivity savings toward increased media spending and expects to increase  spending by up to $200 million-$400 million more during the next two years. CCR Ratings:  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola  Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low  at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the  notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our 2016 rating case for Coca-Cola include: -- Underlying revenue growth of approximately 3.6% with volume growth  approximately 1.8%, price/mix growth of approximately 1.8% and foreign currency  pressure of 4% in 2016; -- Underlying operating income growth is estimated to increase by almost 7%; -- Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations  (CFFO) with more than 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use. Free  cash flow (FCF) in excess of $1.5 billion in 2016; -- Total debt increases marginally as borrowings to fund domestic cash  requirements are expected to moderate; -- Net share repurchases of $2.25 billion; -- Capital spending of $2.5 billion; -- Gross leverage of 3.7x and net supplemental leverage of 2.7x. Over the forecast period through 2019 and once refranchising is complete,  assumptions include: --Gross margin increasing to the high 60% range; --Operating margins increasing to the mid 30% range; --Gross debt levels declining from a current level of $44.2 billion through  proceeds from asset sales combined with a more balanced capital allocation  policy; --Gross leverage of 3x times and net supplemental leverage reducing to less than  2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  stabilization of the rating outlook include:  --A public commitment toward a deleveraging policy over the next 12 months. This  commitment would be reflective of achieving a more balanced capital allocation  policy with a pullback in share repurchases and a commitment to reduce gross  debt levels. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  --A lack of deleveraging such that gross leverage is sustained above 3x and  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is sustained above 2x over the  long-term; --A lack of public commitment to debt reduction; --A lack of execution with refranchising plans; --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits;  --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A and share  repurchases. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Sizeable Offshore Cash Position Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and (FCF). For 2015, Coca-Cola generated $10.5 billion and $2.2 billion  (adjusting for dividend payment) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, modestly ahead  of Fitch's expectations of $10.3 billion and $1.8 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015,  Coca-Cola's approximate $28 billion liquidity position consisted of $19.9  billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, and $8.3  billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit  facility with rolling maturities through 2019. Coca-Cola's long-term debt  maturing in the next 12 months totals $2.7 billion. Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $19.9 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances will increase during the first  quarter of 2016, when Coca-Cola receives $2.4 billion for its ownership interest  in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. following its acquisition by JAB Holding Company.

413,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Coca-Cola Co's sales fell for the fourth straight quarter as demand weakened for its fizzy drinks in Europe and a strong dollar ate into revenue from other markets outside the United States, including Latin America.Shares of the world's largest beverage maker, which maintained its revenue and earnings growth forecasts for 2016, fell as much as 5.5 percent to $44.06 on Wednesday.

428,"   By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Martinne Geller | JOHANNESBURG/LONDON  JOHANNESBURG/LONDON SABMiller SAB.L and Coca-Cola (KO.N) have agreed concessions with the South African government to win approval for their plan to merge African soft drink operations into what would be the continent's biggest Coke drinks bottler.The concessions, announced on Wednesday, agreed with the South African Ministry of Economic Development, include a three-year freeze on layoffs and the companies investing 800 million rand ($54 million) to support small South African businesses.Brewer SABMiller, in the process of the being taken over by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), agreed in November 2014 to team up with Coke and the South African owners of local bottler Coca-Cola Sabco to create Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which would have annual sales of $2.9 billion and operations in 12 markets across Southern and East Africa.Upon completion of the all-equity deal, Coke will own 11.3 percent of the venture, the Gutsche family that owns Coke Sabco 31.7 percent and SABMiller 57 percent. Sources familiar with the situation said there is a change-of-control clause that would allow Coke to buy SAB's stake following SAB's takeover by AB InBev, expected in the second half of this year.Coke's ambitions are unknown, but some industry sources said a continuation of the current arrangement was unlikely. They point to AB InBev's status as a PepsiCo (PEP.N) bottler in Latin America and the fact that it does not have a history of keeping stakes and joint ventures like SAB. Coke has been moving away from outright ownership of bottling assets, which are more capital intensive and lower-margin than selling syrup and marketing, meaning there could also be an opportunity for other bottlers, such as Coca-Cola HBC (CCH.L) or Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX), to expand. Coca-Cola declined to comment on the terms of its agreements or plans for the stake, which one source said could be worth as much as $3 billion. Last week, during AB InBev's annual meeting, company executives declined to detail their plan for Coke in Africa.LAST HURDLE   The bottling deal was given a preliminary approval in December by South Africa's Competition Commission, which said it could go ahead on several conditions including limiting jobs cuts to 250 and making sure it buys cans, glass, sugar and crates from local suppliers.The Commission investigates deals for any antitrust issues and recommends remedies to the Competition Tribunal, which makes a final ruling. A Tribunal hearing on the proposed deal, which would be a last hurdle, is due to start on May 9.South Africa has a history of taking its time over approving deals, partly because regulators have a public interest mandate to safeguard jobs in addition to ensuring there is competition.  ""I am very happy that we have reached this agreement and hope we now have a clear path to the conclusion of this transaction,"" SABMiller Chief Executive Officer Alan Clark said.The $100 billion-plus takeover of SAB has also included concessions made to the South African government. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will account for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa, will be headquartered in South Africa, its largest market.The deal will also hand Coke an extra 20 brands, including  soft drink Appletiser, whose fruit juice concentrate is sourced from South African producers.Coca-Cola and SABMiller agreed to maintain and grow Appletiser operations for the domestic market and use it as a base for export.

429,"  JOHANNESBURG SABMiller SAB.L and Coca-Cola (KO.N) have agreed concessions with the South African government to win approval for a deal to combine their soft-drink operations, the companies said on Wednesday.The concessions, agreed with the South African Ministry of Economic Development, include a three-year freeze on layoffs and the companies investing 800 million rand ($54 million) to support small South African businesses.SABMiller, which is in the process of the being taken over by larger rival Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), agreed in November to team up with Coke to create Africa's largest soft drinks bottler, Coca Cola Beverages Africa. The business will have annual sales of $2.9 billion and ambitions to corner the fast-growing market on the continent.The all-equity deal was given a preliminary approval in December by South Africa's Competition Commission, which said it could go ahead on several conditions including Coca-Cola Beverages Africa limiting jobs cuts to 250 and making sure it buys cans, glass, sugar and crates from local suppliers. The Commission investigates deals for any antitrust issues and recommends remedies to the Competition Tribunal, which makes a final ruling. A Tribunal hearing on the proposed deal is due to start next Monday.South Africa has a history of taking its time over approving deals, partly because regulators have a public interest mandate to safeguard jobs in addition to an antitrust mandate to protect competition. ""I am very happy that we have reached this agreement and hope we now have a clear path to the conclusion of this transaction,"" said SABMiller Chief Executive Officer Alan Clark. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will account for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa, serving 12 southern and eastern African countries. It will be headquartered in South Africa, its largest market.The deal would also hand Coke an extra 20 brands, including sparkling soft drink Appletiser, whose fruit juice concentrate is sourced from South African producers. Coca-Cola and SABMiller agreed to maintain and grow Appletiser production operations to serve the domestic market and use as a base from which to export elsewhere in the world. The Gutsche family, Coke's South African bottling partner, will also be a shareholder in the Coca-Cola Beverages Africa.

443,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) multi-tranche proposed benchmark issuance of  senior notes including senior notes due 2019 and senior notes due 2026. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $46.8 billion of debt as  of April 1, 2016. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds for general  corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures,  acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets, redemption and repayment  of short-term or long-term borrowings and common stock purchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Persistently Elevated Leverage  The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross  leverage and supplemental net leverage basis) as high for the current ratings.  Moreover, Fitch needs to see progress related to refranchising and evidence that  Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital allocation strategy related to  share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction. The Outlook could be stabilized  with a public commitment over the next 12 months toward a deleveraging policy.  Fitch would need to see clear visibility and traction on gross leverage  declining below 3x and supplemental net leverage below 2x as the company  transitions to a franchising model, produces at least 3% organic top-line growth  and sees EBITDA improvement through targeted productivity initiatives.  Long-term Business Model Strengthened  Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result  of accelerated refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some  near-term EBITDA dilution, Coca-Cola will receive upfront cash proceeds that  will be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to bottling assets  to offset this decline. Moreover, over time, the refranchising will  substantially reduce SG&A costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range,  result in operating margins that improve to the mid-30% range from approximately  24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity. Consequently, upon completion of  refranchising in 2017, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows are expected to be more  stable providing greater support to its longer-term credit profile.  Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also  provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. While  Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand strength by  increasing media and R&D spending, cost reductions should help drive future  growth in operating profit. Consequently, Fitch views Coca-Cola's long-term  mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial  targets as achievable.  More Balanced Capital Allocation Expected  Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the  world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt including larger commercial paper (CP)  balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital  investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A activities.  Coca-Cola is in the process of implementing a more appropriate longer-term  capital allocation policy to improve the alignment of domestic cash generation  versus domestic cash requirements that should benefit its longer-term financial  structure. These steps include: a reduced reliance on CP usage to below $15  billion, a more balanced long-term share repurchase policy including reductions  for material M&A activity, a more conservative pace of dividend growth, and  using a portion of refranchising proceeds for debt reduction.  CP balances have declined to $14.9 billion at the end of the first quarter 2016  from a peak of approximately $19 billion as Coca-Cola has committed to reduce  its reliance on this funding source, although overall debt increased by $2.2  billion in 2015. CP as a percent of total debt is currently approximately 32%,  which compares to peak usage of approximately 50% of total debt. Fitch expects  Coca-Cola will maintain CP balances below $15 billion over the long term  compared to a past soft cap of $20 billion.  Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to Decline  For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers  with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental  adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of  tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced  by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing  expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for  shareholder-friendly actions. In its calculations, Fitch haircuts after-tax  foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate for share buybacks.  Fitch expects long-term gross debt, inclusive of CP, to decline during the next  several years with a more balanced capital allocation policy. Supplemental  adjusted EBITDA net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of the first quarter 2016  was approximately 2.7x compared to 2.3x at the end of 2014. Over the longer  term, Fitch expects supplemental net leverage will decrease to around 2x in  2018/2019 due to debt reduction and EBITDA growth.  Strong Global Brands  As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola's ratings are  supported by its strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong  distribution platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1  billion-plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute  Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach,  market position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's  business profile that has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio and constituting approximately 73% of the mix, the ratings consider  the multiyear declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued concern over  artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America, risks  associated with excise tax increases and slowing growth in other developing  countries. Fitch believes this risk is mitigated in part by Coca-Cola's market  strength in developing and emerging geographies with greater long-term growth  characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption characteristics,  urbanization, population growth, and expanding middle class that should provide  an important longer-term offset.  Coca-Cola, along with the rest of the beverage industry, have also modified  their price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both  smaller pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per  unit versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium  and smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the low-double-digit growth rates  within this packaging combination mix.  Underlying Growth Should Improve  Fitch expects underlying revenue growth in 2016 of approximately 3.6% with  volume growth of 1.8%, price/mix growth of 1.8% and foreign currency pressure of  4%. Beyond 2016, Fitch believes Coca-Cola should be able to improve organic  growth rates during the medium term to close to 5% on volume growth of 3% and  product/mix of 2%. Fitch expects underlying operating income growth will  increase in 2016 by almost 7% driven by productivity benefits and organic  growth. Coca-Cola's productivity savings program enables additional financial  flexibility over the next several years to cover incremental investments and  costs that will be used in part for increased media investments and brand  support development. Coca-Cola has already redirected $600 million in previous  productivity savings toward increased media spending and expects to increase  spending by up to $200 million-$400 million more during the next two years.  CCR Ratings:  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola  Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low  at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the  notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its 2016 rating case for Coca-Cola include:  --Underlying revenue growth of approximately 3.6% with volume growth  approximately 1.8%, price/mix growth of approximately 1.8% and foreign currency  pressure of 4% in 2016;  --Underlying operating income growth is estimated to increase by almost 7%;  --Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations  (CFFO) with more than 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use. Free  cash flow (FCF) in excess of $1.5 billion in 2016;  --Total debt increases marginally as borrowings to fund domestic cash  requirements are expected to moderate;  --Net share repurchases of $2.25 billion;  --Capital spending of $2.5 billion;  --Gross leverage of 3.7x and net supplemental leverage of 2.7x.  Over the forecast period through 2019 and once refranchising is complete,  assumptions include:  --Gross margin increasing to the high 60% range;  --Operating margins increasing to the mid 30% range;  --Gross debt levels declining from a current level of $44.2 billion through  proceeds from asset sales combined with a more balanced capital allocation  policy;  --Gross leverage of 3x times and net supplemental leverage reducing to less than  2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  stabilization of the Rating Outlook include:  --A public commitment toward a deleveraging policy over the next 12 months. This  commitment would be reflective of achieving a more balanced capital allocation  policy with a pullback in share repurchases and a commitment to reduce gross  debt levels.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  --A lack of deleveraging such that gross leverage is sustained above 3x and  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is sustained above 2x over the  long-term;  --A lack of public commitment to debt reduction;  --A lack of execution with refranchising plans;  --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits;  --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A and share  repurchases. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Sizeable Offshore Cash Position  Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and FCF. For the LTM period, Coca-Cola generated $9.6 billion and $1.2 billion  (adjusting for dividend payment) of CFFO and FCF, respectively. As of April 1,  2016, Coca-Cola's approximate $28 billion liquidity position consisted of $22.2  billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, and $8.3  billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit  facility with rolling maturities through 2019. Coca-Cola's long-term debt  maturing in the next 12 months is substantial, totalling $5 billion.  Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $22.2 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances increased during the first quarter  of 2016, when Coca-Cola received $2.4 billion for its ownership interest in  Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. following its acquisition by JAB Holding Company. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola and its subsidiary as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'.

448,"   By John Weavers  SYDNEY, May 31 (IFR) - Coca-Cola has announced details of a debut Kangaroo bond transaction with the global drinks giant expected to price four and eight-year bonds no later than tomorrow, June 1.ANZ, Deutsche Bank and RBC Capital Markets are joint bookrunners for the deal that follows last year's Kangaroo debuts from US corporate giants Apple and Intel, both of which opted for four and seven-year tenors. While a repeat of Aa1/AA+ (Moody's/S&P) rated Apple's stellar A$2.25 billion triple-tranche Kangaroo sale in August 2015 is unlikely, a A$1 billion-plus issue seems likely, especially amid the tepid corporate supply so far this year. Intel, rated A1/A+, followed three months after Apple, but disappointed with a A$800m dual-tranche trade as the world's biggest chipmaker struggled against a more difficult market backdrop and limited credit analyst coverage among Australian fund managers. Local funds are more familiar with Coca-Cola, especially since regional bottler Coca-Cola Amatil, rated A3/BBB+, has previously issued Australian dollar bonds.

449,"  Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX), said they agreed to buy Unilever's (ULVR.L) AdeS soy-based beverage unit for about $575 million as the soft-drinks giant bolsters its portfolio of healthy and non-fizzy drinks.AdeS, which is known for its soy-milk and fruit-juice mixed beverages, had revenue of $284 million in 2015. It sold 56.2 million unit cases in the same period.Founded in 1988 in Argentina, AdeS' drinks are sold in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia, the companies said in a statement.Coke has been investing in building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio and is expanding beyond North America, its biggest market, where sales have been falling due to a consumer shift towards healthier beverages.

Coke, whose non-fizzy brands include vitaminwater, Powerade and Minute Maid, said AdeS will be part of the non-carbonated beverage business that Coca-Cola Femsa shares with Coca-Cola in its franchise territories.  For Unilever, the sale is the latest in a string of divestitures aimed at moving away from slow-growing food brands in order to focus more on personal care businesses, which have higher margins and higher growth prospects.

450,"  NEW YORK The United States has seized low-calorie sweetener stevia imported from China by PureCircle Ltd, making it the latest company to be targeted by a new law that bans imports of products made by forced labor.U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it moved to crack down on imports of stevia extracts and their derivatives from China brought into the country by PureCircle after it obtained information that they are produced by convict labor.The plant extract is used as a sweetener in Coca-Cola Co's Coke Life, PepsiCo's True and other popular sodas.A spokeswoman for PureCircle disputed the allegation, stating the company has provided documentation it has not worked with Inner Mongolia Hengzheng Group Baoanzhao Agricultural and Trade LLC, which was also named in the complaint. ""We have an explicit policy prohibiting use of prison or forced labor in any part of our business,"" she said in an emailed statement, noting it is certified by independent auditors to ensure that. Singapore-based Olam International Ltd owns a 17.8 percent stake in PureCircle, a major supplier of sugar and aspartame alternatives, according to PureCircle's website.  The companies have three months to prove the stevia was not produced by force labor, a spokeswoman for the U.S. agency said on Wednesday.""It is imperative that companies examine their supply chains to understand product sourcing and the labor used to generate their products,"" the agency Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske said in a statement. Responding to the news, Coke said its supplier had confirmed it had not received stevia produced by the accused Inner Mongolia company. Company policy prohibits the use of forced labor in its operations and supply chain, Coke said in an email.The action is the latest sign that the new legislation, which bans imports of goods made by forced labor, could have a far-reaching impact on companies that buy ingredients from abroad as the United States pushes to improve transparency across global supply chains. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 was signed into law in February. This is the third product seizure since the law came into effect. Imports of potassium and other related products brought in by Tangshan Sunfar Silicon Industries have been impounded and shipments of soda ash and other chemicals by Tangshan Sanyou Group and its subsidiaries have been seized.

453,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Investors looking for stability and dividends have been pouring money into consumer staples stocks of late, ignoring warnings from Wall Street's analysts about pricey valuations for companies like Clorox (CLX.N) and Campbell Soup (CPB.N).Widely viewed as relatively safe bets in a world of macroeconomic worries, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like processed food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors in the past year, and fund flow data suggests investors expect more of the same.The number of new institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, of Campbell Soup in the last quarter has jumped 92 percent, according to research firm Morningstar. New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent.In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com.With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector. ""We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,"" said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies. ""The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,"" he said. The S&P consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data. Following the consumer staples index's 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P 500. ""On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar's impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods.But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for ""natural"" and organic food. The S&P 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago.

454,"   By James Davey | LONDON  LONDON Amazon (AMZN.O) has launched a British version of its U.S. AmazonFresh food delivery service, stepping up the pressure on the traditional big supermarkets already locked in a brutal price war.In a long-anticipated move to break into Britain's 178 billion pounds ($257 billion) grocery market, the world's largest online retailer launched AmazonFresh on Thursday in parts of central and east London.Britain has one of the world's most developed online grocery markets with the big four retailers Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury's (SBRY.L), Wal-Mart's (WMT.N) Asda and Morrisons (MRW.L) already competing with specialist delivery firm Ocado (OCDO.L).The online grocery bar is even higher in the capital.""The entry of AmazonFresh into the UK doesn't come out of the blue but it will further worry investors about the fundamentals and prospects of the UK food retail market,"" said Bernstein analysts, who estimate Amazon could eventually take up to 13 percent of all food sales in the country.Britain's online food market is expected to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD.""We are launching with a comprehensive offer in a limited area and will take our time to hone and improve our service,"" AmazonFresh vice president Ajay Kavan said.AmazonFresh will initially offer a full grocery service from a distribution center in the east of the capital. It plans to use small and medium-sized external carriers for deliveries, which could be on the same day as the order. UK ROLLOUT Shares in Britain's listed supermarkets have been hammered in recent years as the grocery market has been convulsed by changing shopping habits, the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and price competition, and analysts see AmazonFresh as a potential challenge to the whole industry over time.""We will be very methodical and considered in how we roll this service out further in the UK,"" Kavan said.Shoppers in the eligible London districts, or postcodes, who are members of the Amazon Prime subscription service will be able to choose from a range of more than 130,000 products, including about 20,000 grocery items. Amazon will offer fresh and frozen products from Morrisons, with which it struck a wholesale supply deal in February, brands including Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, Danone, Warburtons and Walkers as well as products from local food producers and shops in locations such as London's trendy Borough Market.Amazon Prime members in the United Kingdom pay an annual subscription of 79 pounds. They can sign up for a 30-day trial of AmazonFresh and would then pay 6.99 pounds per month for the service, with unlimited deliveries for orders over 40 pounds.IMPACT     In the short term, Bernstein analysts reckon AmazonFresh's focus on London and its upmarket bias could mean Sainsbury's is hit the most out of the Big Four. But they said Tesco and Ocado are also exposed as they have the largest share of London-based online food sales. There was, however, little impact on stock prices following the AmazonFresh launch.In April, Sainsbury's agreed a 1.4 billion pound takeover of Argos, a move which was seen as a defensive play against Amazon.One food retail executive from one of the big four players said Amazon would only significantly disrupt the market if it could successfully target the 60 percent of store sales that are just small baskets.""If Amazon can work out how to deliver those top up shops profitably and in a timely manner then I think we'll see other retailers respond and that's likely to grow the overall market share of online sales from around the 7 percent mark and accelerate the growth,"" he told Reuters.Amazon launched a fresh food delivery service in Seattle in 2007 and has since moved to a handful of other U.S. cities, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model.It has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to Prime members in Britain.

459,"   By Luc Cohen | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Flat beverages are helping overall sales at Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc stay fizzy in Mexico despite a tax on sodas. As Mexico moved toward implementing a soda tax to combat soaring rates of obesity and diabetes three years ago, the beverage industry fought back hard, warning that sales in the world's No. 2 consumer of sugary drinks could take a hit. But more than two years later, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have found ways to prosper in Mexico thanks to alternative beverages and resilient demand, a Reuters review of corporate filings and executive comments shows.On Thursday, PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi described the nation, the biggest for net revenue after the United States, as ""one of the brightest stars"" in Latin America amid turmoil in Venezuela and Brazil.""We feel good about our business in Mexico,"" she said in the company's second-quarter earnings call.    PepsiCo's shares popped to record highs on Thursday after its earnings of $1.35 a share beat analyst estimates.After the tax was implemented in January 2014, beverage sales volumes declined for one quarter in Pepsi's case and two quarters for Coke.Since then, both have posted consistent growth in volumes in Mexico. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo both declined to comment. Growth in other drinks the companies produce, like bottled water and juice, has contributed to that resilience. General economic growth in the country has also helped. As U.S. municipalities and states, as well as other countries, increasingly entertain the idea of slapping a tax on sugary drinks to help combat obesity and diabetes, the sales bounce-back in Mexico suggests that such policies are not necessarily calamitous for major beverage companies. Mexico is the biggest country with a nationwide tax on sugary drinks, and the outcomes in terms of health and revenue are closely studied by public health researchers and industry groups alike.Soda taxes are a concern for the sugar industry, which is worried about waning long-term demand for sweeteners.STICKER SHOCK The companies' growth in sales volumes has come as individual Mexicans drink less soda - a sign the tax is having its intended effect, public health advocates say.  Mexico's per-capita consumption dropped 4 percent to 134 liters in 2014, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. It continued to fall in 2015 and is forecast to inch down in 2016 to 132.2 liters per capita. Bottled water consumption, meanwhile, has soared 50 percent in the past decade. That mirrors declining soda consumption elsewhere in the world. The leading producers are well aware of this and have been diversifying accordingly. In 2010, still beverages - including waters, teas and juices - represented just 29 percent of Coca-Cola's U.S. volume and 22 percent elsewhere, a company filing shows. Sparkling beverages, namely sodas, made up the rest. By 2015, still beverages made up a third and 26 percent of U.S. and worldwide sales volume, respectively.    ""It's not just a carbonated soft drink game anymore,"" said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago. 'JUST THE BEGINNING' Despite the per-capita decline, overall soda volumes are bubbling up. After falling in 2014 and 2015, volumes grew 2 percent between January and April of 2016 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Anprac, Mexico's national beverage industry association. The per-capita drop is also leveling off, as the tax's sticker shock wears off. Despite the refreshing news, the industry has maintained opposition to soda taxes elsewhere. That could reflect concern that taxes are ""just the beginning"" of public policies aiming to reduce soda drinking, said Jeff Grogger, a University of Chicago economist who studied Mexico's tax. ""They have lots of ways to mitigate the financial impact,"" said Duane Stanford, the editor of Beverage Digest. ""But you have to look long-term too and you want to protect your competitive landscape.""

Mexico is the biggest country with a nationwide tax on sugary drinks, and the outcomes in terms of health and revenue are closely studied by public health researchers and industry groups alike.Soda taxes are a concern for the sugar industry, which is worried about waning long-term demand for sweeteners.STICKER SHOCK The companies' growth in sales volumes has come as individual Mexicans drink less soda - a sign the tax is having its intended effect, public health advocates say.  Mexico's per-capita consumption dropped 4 percent to 134 liters in 2014, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. It continued to fall in 2015 and is forecast to inch down in 2016 to 132.2 liters per capita. Bottled water consumption, meanwhile, has soared 50 percent in the past decade. That mirrors declining soda consumption elsewhere in the world. The leading producers are well aware of this and have been diversifying accordingly. In 2010, still beverages - including waters, teas and juices - represented just 29 percent of Coca-Cola's U.S. volume and 22 percent elsewhere, a company filing shows. Sparkling beverages, namely sodas, made up the rest. By 2015, still beverages made up a third and 26 percent of U.S. and worldwide sales volume, respectively.    ""It's not just a carbonated soft drink game anymore,"" said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago. 'JUST THE BEGINNING' Despite the per-capita decline, overall soda volumes are bubbling up. After falling in 2014 and 2015, volumes grew 2 percent between January and April of 2016 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Anprac, Mexico's national beverage industry association. The per-capita drop is also leveling off, as the tax's sticker shock wears off. Despite the refreshing news, the industry has maintained opposition to soda taxes elsewhere. That could reflect concern that taxes are ""just the beginning"" of public policies aiming to reduce soda drinking, said Jeff Grogger, a University of Chicago economist who studied Mexico's tax. ""They have lots of ways to mitigate the financial impact,"" said Duane Stanford, the editor of Beverage Digest. ""But you have to look long-term too and you want to protect your competitive landscape.""

Britain's FTSE 100 was flat in percentage terms at 6,697.37 points at its close, after closing on Monday at its highest since August last year.Rio Tinto's decline was among the largest; it fell.5 percent after its latest update. Traders said that Rio Tinto's second-quarter figures were a little disappointing, even as it reiterated its 2017 outlook.""Growth in iron ore output decelerated from 13 percent year-on-year in Q1 to 8 percent in Q2 but production growth accelerated in bauxite, aluminium and also copper, which will do little to ease the market's fears that key commodities could remain glutted for some time to come,"" said Russ Mould, Investment Director at AJ Bell, in a note. In all, FTSE 350 mining stocks dropped 2.4 percent, their biggest daily loss in a month.Top riser on the FTSE 100 was Coca-Cola HBC, up more than 3 percent after the bottling company was upgraded to ""overweight"" from neutral by JP Morgan Cazenove. ""The soft drinks category is very resilient to macroeconomic volatility, which bodes well for CCH given current uncertainty in Europe,"" analysts at JP Morgan said in a note.""We believe CCH is well placed to take on additional bottling assets in key territories.""Reflecting that uncertainty in Europe, the latest German ZEW showed a big fall in economic sentiment since Britain voted to leave the European Union nearly a month ago.In a similar vein, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cited Brexit-related uncertainty as it cut its global growth forecasts for the next two years.However, the FTSE 100 is up 5.6 percent since the vote, with its substantial international exposure and defensive composition meaning it has weathered the period since the referendum better than major European indexes.

Its EBIT margin was 7.5 percent, up from 7 percent a year ago.Sales revenue fell 3.4 percent to 3.04 billion euros ($3.4 billion), but rose 2.4 percent excluding currency fluctuations. It rose 3 percent excluding the impact of one less selling day, which will be given back in the second half of the year. The company cited price increases, selling more higher-priced drinks, and volume growth in markets including Nigeria and Romania.Overall volume though was up 0.1 percent.Despite tough comparisons with a strong year-earlier period, the company said volumes ""held up well"" in July, making it confident of ""volume growth for the year as a whole"". ""We do forecast an improvement (in the back half),"" Chief Executive Dimitris Lois told reporters. ""This improvement reflects one more selling day and additional initiatives we have focusing on very strong marketing calendars."" The company is also bringing forward some restructuring initiatives from 2017 into 2016, primarily in emerging markets like Russia and Nigeria. It now plans to spend 48 million euros this year, instead of 35 million euros, so it can more quickly benefit from the resulting operational efficiencies.  It said volumes in emerging markets should improve as declines in Russia slow and Nigeria grows, despite the recent depreciation of the Nigerian currency. After a slowdown in the second quarter, resulting from the devaluation, Lois said conditions in the country should normalize, and he reaffirmed his forecast for Nigerian sales to rise at a mid- to high-single-digit rate this year.In June, the company said its medium-term forecast called for average annual revenue growth of 4 to 5 percent through 2020, with operating expenses dropping to 26 to 27 percent of revenue and an EBIT margin rising to 11 percent.

479,"  JOHANNESBURG Africa's biggest Coke bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, will rethink its spending plans in South Africa if Pretoria's proposed tax on sugary drinks gets the green light, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. In a bid to fight a growing obesity rate in the continent's most lucrative market for Coca-Cola and fast-food chains in sub-Saharan Africa, the government has proposed a 20 percent tax on sugar sweetened drinks under a plan that has delighted health campaigners and angered drink makers.Coca-Cola Beverages Africa was created earlier this year through a combination of SABMiller and Coca-Cola African soft drink operations. The deal won an anti-trust go-ahead on several conditions that included a commitment to spend 800 million rand to develop farmers and retailers.""It is not what the company is wanting to do but when you look at the impact the tax would have, we will have relook at some investment commitments we have made,"" said Coca-Cola southern African spokeswoman Vukani Magubane. The proposed levy, which was first announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in February, is expected to be implemented this year. Last month, the Treasury has asked the public submit comments on the proposal by Aug. 22.It has already received endorsement from lobby group Public Health Association of South Africa, saying it was a cheaper intervention measure to fight obesity-linked diseases such as diabetes.

482,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) multi-tranche proposed benchmark issuance of  senior notes including senior notes due 2021 and senior notes due 2026. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $48 billion of debt as  of July 1, 2016. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds for general  corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures,  acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets, redemption and repayment  of short-term or long-term borrowings and common stock purchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Persistently Elevated Leverage  The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross  leverage and supplemental net leverage basis) as high for the current ratings.  To stabilize the Outlook, Fitch would need to see progress related to  refranchising and evidence that Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital  allocation strategy related to share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction.  The Outlook stabilization would be contingent upon demonstration of a public  commitment toward a deleveraging policy including: clear visibility and traction  on gross leverage declining below 3x and supplemental net leverage below 2x as  the company transitions to a franchising model, produces at least 3% organic  top-line growth and sees EBITDA improvement through targeted productivity  initiatives.  Long-term Business Model Strengthened  Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result  of accelerated refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some  near-term EBITDA dilution, the company will receive upfront cash proceeds that  will be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to bottling assets  to offset this decline. Moreover, over time, the refranchising will  substantially reduce SG&A costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range,  result in operating margins that improve to the mid-30% range from approximately  24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity. Consequently, upon completion of  refranchising in 2017, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows are expected to be more  stable providing greater support to its longer-term credit profile.  Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also  provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. While  Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand strength by  increasing media and R&D spending, cost reductions should help drive future  growth in operating profit. Consequently, Fitch views Coca-Cola's long-term  mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial  targets as achievable.  More Balanced Capital Allocation Expected  Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the  world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt including larger commercial paper (CP)  balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital  investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A activities.  Coca-Cola is in the process of implementing a more appropriate longer-term  capital allocation policy to improve the alignment of domestic cash generation  versus domestic cash requirements that should benefit its longer-term financial  structure. These steps include: a reduced reliance on CP usage to below $15  billion, a more balanced long-term share repurchase policy including reductions  for material M&A activity, a more conservative pace of dividend growth, and  using a portion of refranchising proceeds for debt reduction.  CP balances have declined to $13.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of  2016 from a peak of approximately $19 billion as Coca-Cola has committed to  reduce its reliance on this funding source. CP as a percent of total debt is  currently approximately 29%, which compares to peak usage of approximately 50%  of total debt. Fitch expects Coca-Cola will maintain CP balances below $15  billion over the long term compared to a past soft cap of $20 billion.  Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to Decline  For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers  with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental  adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of  tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced  by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing  expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for  shareholder-friendly actions. In its calculations, Fitch haircuts after-tax  foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate for share buybacks.  Fitch expects long-term gross debt, inclusive of CP, to decline during the next  several years with a more balanced capital allocation policy. Supplemental  adjusted EBITDA net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of the second quarter 2016  was approximately 2.75x compared to 2.3x at the end of 2014. Over the longer  term, Fitch expects supplemental net leverage will decrease to around 2x in  2018/2019 due to debt reduction and EBITDA growth.  Strong Global Brands  As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola's ratings are  supported by its strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong  distribution platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1  billion-plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute  Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach,  market position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's  business profile that has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio and constituting in excess of 70% of the mix, the ratings consider the  multiyear declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued concern over artificial  sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America, risks associated with  excise tax increases and slowing growth in other developing countries. Fitch  believes this risk is mitigated in part by Coca-Cola's market strength in  developing and emerging geographies with greater long-term growth  characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption characteristics,  urbanization, population growth, and expanding middle class that should provide  an important longer-term offset.  Coca-Cola, along with the rest of the beverage industry, have also modified  their price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both  smaller pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per  unit versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium  and smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the low-double-digit growth rates  within this packaging combination mix.  Underlying Growth Should Improve  Fitch expects underlying revenue growth in 2016 of approximately 3% with volume  growth of 1%, price/mix growth of 2% and foreign currency headwinds of 3%. Fitch  expects underlying operating income growth will increase in 2016 by almost 7%  driven by productivity benefits and organic growth. Coca-Cola's productivity  savings program enables additional financial flexibility over the next several  years to cover incremental investments and costs that will be used in part for  increased media investments and brand support development. Coca-Cola has already  redirected $600 million in previous productivity savings toward increased media  spending and expects to increase spending by up to $200 million-$400 million  more during the next two years.  CCR Ratings:  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between obligations issued by Coca-Cola  Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR), since default risk is very  low at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to  the notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for Coca-Cola include: --Underlying revenue growth of approximately 3% with volume growth approximately  1%, price/mix growth of approximately 2% and foreign currency pressure of 3% in  2016;  --Underlying operating income growth is estimated to increase by almost 7%;  --Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations  (CFFO) with more than 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use. Free  cash flow (FCF) in the range of $1.0 to $1.5 billion in 2016;  --Total debt increases as borrowings to fund domestic cash requirements are  expected to moderate;  --Net share repurchases of less than $2.25 billion;  --Capital spending of $2.5 billion;  --Gross leverage of 3.7x and net supplemental leverage of 2.7x.  Over the forecast period through 2019 and once refranchising is complete,  assumptions include:  --Gross margin increasing to the high 60% range;  --Operating margins increasing to the mid 30% range;  --Gross debt levels declining from 2015 of $44.2 billion through proceeds from  asset sales combined with a more balanced capital allocation policy;  --Gross leverage of 3x times and net supplemental leverage reducing to less than  2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --A public commitment toward a deleveraging policy over the next 12 months. This  commitment would be reflective of achieving a more balanced capital allocation  policy with a pullback in share repurchases and a commitment to reduce gross  debt levels.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  --A lack of deleveraging such that gross leverage is sustained above 3x and  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is sustained above 2x over the  long-term;  --A lack of public commitment to debt reduction;  --A lack of execution with refranchising plans;  --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits;  --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A and share  repurchases. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Sizeable Offshore Cash Position  Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and FCF. For the LTM period, Coca-Cola generated $9.2 billion and $841 million  (adjusting for dividend payment) of CFFO and FCF, respectively. As of July 1,  2016, Coca-Cola's approximate $32 billion liquidity position consisted of $24.1  billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, and $8.3  billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit  facility with rolling maturities through 2019. Coca-Cola's long-term debt  maturing in the next 12 months is substantial, totalling $4.9 billion.  Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $24.1 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances increased during the first quarter  of 2016, when Coca-Cola received $2.4 billion for its ownership interest in  Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. following its acquisition by JAB Holding Company FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola and its subsidiary as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

486,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) benchmark issuance of Euro senior notes due  2036. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $48 billion of  debt as of July 1, 2016. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this  release.

Of the $24.1 billion in  cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances increased during 1Q16, when  Coca-Cola received $2.4 billion for its ownership interest in Keurig Green  Mountain, Inc. following its acquisition by JAB Holding Company.

The bottled iced coffees, which will include milk and sugar in a variety of flavors, will be sold at supermarkets, convenience stores and in Dunkin' Donuts shops.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Dunkin' Brands Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters that the new venture will appeal to existing customers and also build brand recognition. ""Some of our Dunkin' consumers were drinking other people's products because we weren't there,"" Travis said.     The cold beverages, like the packaged coffees Dunkin' Donuts already sells through various retail channels, also are expected to introduce consumers to the chain's flavor profile. That can help build interest in the brand as it expands into new U.S. markets, Travis said. Dunkin' will split net profits from the sales of ready-to-drink coffee sold outside its shops with U.S. Dunkin' Donuts franchisees, with the highest revenue-producing operators receiving the largest percentage of that share.

501,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Gayathree Ganesan  The candy maker Mars Inc on Thursday said it would take full control of its Wrigley chewing gum business, acquiring the minority stake held by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).    Mars plans to combine Wrigley with its chocolate business, putting M&Ms, Snickers, Starburst fruit chews, Doublemint and Extra gum, and Altoids mints under one roof.In 2008, Berkshire invested in Wrigley when it acquired $2.1 billion of preferred stock and $4.4 billion of bonds in connection with privately held Mars' $23 billion purchase of the chewing gum maker.The bonds were repurchased in 2013, and Berkshire expected Mars to redeem half of the preferred stock, which carries a 5 percent dividend, by early January. Mars will instead redeem all of it. Terms were not disclosed.""I have enjoyed all of Berkshire's experiences with the Mars family and management and wish them the very best,"" Buffett said in a statement. ""Both Mars and Berkshire have profited from our investment and that's the way it should be.""The global confectionery business, worth $183 billion last year according to Euromonitor International, has struggled as more consumers move toward healthier foods, prompting some retailers to reduce shelf space for processed and sugary snacks. ""We are grateful for the strong and productive partnership we have with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway,"" Mars Chief Executive Grant Reid said in a statement. ""Sole ownership of Wrigley provides us with an opportunity to rethink how we simplify our chocolate and Wrigley businesses.""Mars, the world's largest candy maker ahead of rivals such as Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Hershey Co (HSY.N), expects to combine its chocolate and Wrigley businesses during 2017 into Mars Wrigley Confectionery, with about 30,000 employees.The combined business will be based in Chicago, Wrigley's longtime home, and led by Martin Radvan, Wrigley's president and a 30-year veteran of Mars. Mars is based in McLean, Virginia.    Known for his taste in less-than-healthy food, Buffett has made Berkshire the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), and helped Brazil's 3G Capital take over Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO), which owns Burger King and Tim Hortons. Berkshire also owns See's Candies. But unwinding the Mars stake will deprive Berkshire of a $105 million annual income stream from the preferred stock.The investment was one of several that Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate made during and soon after the financial crisis in brand name companies seeking to shore up their finances, and win the billionaire's imprimatur. From 2008 to 2011, Berkshire invested well over $20 billion in high-yielding securities from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N), General Electric Co (GE.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S) and Wrigley.But many have been repurchased, forcing Buffett to find other ways to invest Berkshire's $72.7 billion of cash.He lost $720 million of annual income in June when Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire still owns a 26.8 percent stake, redeemed preferred stock. The Wrigley notes had thrown off an 11.45 percent coupon.
