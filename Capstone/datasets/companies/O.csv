0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' credit rating to  the $350 million aggregate principal amount 3.875% coupon senior unsecured notes  due 2024 issued by Realty Income Corporation (NYSE: O, Realty Income). The notes  were priced at 99.956% of par to yield 3.88% to maturity, or 125 basis points  over the benchmark treasury rate.  Net proceeds from the offering of $347.6 million are expected to be used to  repay a portion of borrowings outstanding under the company's unsecured credit  facility and for other general corporate purposes and working capital, which may  include acquisitions.  In addition to the 2024 notes, Fitch currently rates Realty Income as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --$1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB+'; --$3.2 billion of senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'; --$609.4 million of preferred stock 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Realty Income's IDR of 'BBB+' is supported by the geographic diversity of the  company's predominantly net leased retail property portfolio, limited tenant  concentration and moderate tenant credit risk. Fixed charge coverage is  appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating, and Realty Income's management team has been  and remains cognizant of maintaining consistent credit metrics despite  fluctuations attributable to mergers and acquisitions. Liquidity and access to  capital are strong for the rating. Leverage has been elevated for the 'BBB+'  rating, though declined following the company's April 2014 $528.5 million equity  issuance. In addition, the company's recent focus on investing outside of net  lease retail has less of a track record within the context of Realty Income's  long history. Diverse Net Lease Portfolio As of March 31, 2014, Realty Income's portfolio consisted of 4,208 properties  across 49 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, protecting bondholders from possible  regional supply-and-demand imbalances. The most significant portfolio  transaction over the past two years was the acquisition of American Realty  Capital Trust, Inc. (ARCT) that closed in January 2013, totaling 501 properties  for $3.2 billion. Fitch views the portfolio's tenant industry diversification favorably. The  portfolio includes 47 tenant industries, and top segments based on 1Q'14  revenues were convenience stores (10.3%), drug stores (9.5%), dollar stores  (9.1%), casual dining and quick service restaurants (8.5%) and health and  fitness (6.9%). Industry expansion is consistent with Realty Income's strategic  plan to be less concentrated in net lease retail and more focused on improving  tenant credit quality. Improving Tenant Credit The company has 211 tenants and its top 15 tenants comprised 46.4% of 1Q'14  rent, which is somewhat concentrated. The top three tenants at March 31, 2014  were Walgreens at 5.4%, FedEx at 5.2% of rent, and L.A. Fitness at 5%. The  company has materially reduced the percentage of annualized rental revenue  derived from properties leased to speculative-grade companies since 2010 and,  somewhat relatedly, property-level cash flow coverage has also improved in  recent years. In addition, the company's weighted average lease duration is long  at 10.8 years, signaling durability in the cash flow that supports the ratings,  absent tenant bankruptcies.  Solid Fixed-Charge Coverage Fixed charge coverage is solid for the rating at 3.1x in 1Q'14 pro forma for the  April 2014 equity offering, recent acquisitions and proceeds from the senior  unsecured notes due 2024 (also 3.1x actual for the TTM ended March 31, 2014)  compared with 2.6x in 2012 and 2.8x in 2011. EBITDA growth from acquisitions as  well as contractual rent increases and occupancy gains in the same-store  portfolio, partially offset by increased fixed charges associated with debt  incurred to fund a portion of those acquisitions, drove the increase. Fitch  defines fixed charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less straight-line  rent adjustments less recurring capital expenditures divided by total interest  incurred and preferred dividends. Fitch's base case projection is predicated on contractual base rent increases  (1.5% same-store rent growth) and additional acquisitions (assumed to be $1.2  billion in 2014), which should result in coverage sustaining around 3.0x over  the next 12 to 24 months, which remains consistent with the 'BBB+' rating. In a  stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which tenant bankruptcies similar to the  Friendly's and Buffets bankruptcies in 2011-2012 reduce annual rent by  approximately 5%, fixed charge coverage would remain above 2.5x and remain  appropriate for a 'BBB+' rating. Forward-Looking Strategic Planning Realty Income has a long track record of growth since its formation in 1969,  having increased the portfolio to 4,208 properties across 47 tenant industries  in 1Q'14 from 630 properties across five industries in 1994. The original  initiatives of generating monthly income from retail properties leased on a  long-term triple-net basis (1969 to 1994) evolved towards being attuned to  portfolio diversity as well as focusing on cash flow coverage and underwriting  (1997 to 2007). Following the recession, the company has concentrated on  improving tenant credit and pursued new industries while re-underwriting and  ranking the portfolio.  Realty Income's strategy centers on owning real estate net leased to stronger  credit tenants, with a preference for services over goods. The company owns both  discretionary and non-discretionary retail as well as non-retail. However, its  experience owning non-retail such as industrial and distribution (10.7% of 1Q'14  revenue), office (6.5%), manufacturing (2.5%) and agriculture (2.4%) properties  is somewhat limited. Strong Liquidity and Access to Capital Liquidity coverage pro forma is strong at 5.0x for the period April 1, 2014 to  Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as sources of liquidity  (unrestricted cash, availability under the unsecured revolving credit facility  pro forma for the equity and bond offerings, and projected retained cash flows  from operating activities after dividends and distributions) divided by uses of  liquidity (debt maturities and projected recurring capital expenditures).  Longer-term, debt maturities are manageable with 1.1% maturing during the  remainder of 2014 followed by 6.1% in 2014 and 13.2% in 2016 pro forma.  Contingent liquidity is adequate for the rating with unencumbered asset coverage  of net unsecured debt of 2.8x at March 31, 2014 pro forma (assuming a stressed  8% capitalization rate). The company intends to further unencumber the portfolio  when prepayment penalties on secured debt assumed as part of the ARCT become  less onerous.  Fitch anticipates that the company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio will remain in the mid-to-high 80% range (85.5% in 1Q2014 2012,  although this ratio increased to 88.4% in 2013 as a result of the dividend  increase associated with the ARCT acquisition). Recent AFFO payout levels  indicate the company's ability to generate a modest amount of internal  liquidity. Decline in Recently Elevated Leverage  Net debt to recurring operating EBITDA was 6.1x at 1Q'14 but improves to 5.5x  pro forma compared with 6.6x in 2012 and 5.3x in 2011. Leverage was skewed  upward in 2012 due to the incurrence of debt prior to the close of the ARCT  transaction. Under Fitch's base case, leverage is forecast to remain around 5.5x  in 2014-2015, which would remain appropriate for the rating. In a stress case  (principally a material tenant bankruptcy) scenario not anticipated by Fitch,  leverage could sustain above 6.0x, which would be weak for the rating. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between Realty Income's IDR and preferred stock  rating is consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of  'BBB+'. Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x (pro forma  fixed charge coverage is 3.1x); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.0x (pro forma leverage is  5.5x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt sustaining above  3.0x pro forma coverage is 2.8x). The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.5x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x; --Tenant bankruptcies resulting in a weakening of the company's credit metrics.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency)  NEW YORK, November 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings for Realty Income Corporation (NYSE: O, Realty Income) as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; --$1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --$3.8 billion of senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'; --$395.4 million of preferred stock at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of Realty Income's IDR at 'BBB+' reflects the granularity of the  company's net lease predominantly retail property portfolio, the company's  disciplined acquisition strategy in an increasingly competitive industry, and  long management track record.  Credit strengths include strong expected  fixed-charge coverage (FCC), good liquidity position, and strong access to  multiple sources of capital.   The rating is balanced by leverage that has increased over the past several  years (5.8x for trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2014 compared to 4.4x at  year-end 2009). During this same period, the company improved the granularity  and tenant credit quality of the portfolio.  Fitch expects that leverage will  decline slightly over the next 12 to 24 months but remain somewhat elevated for  the 'BBB+' rating.  Unencumbered assets (unencumbered net operating income  divided by a stressed 9% capitalization rate) coverage of net unsecured debt is  also weak for the 'BBB+' rating. Granular Net Lease Portfolio As of Sept. 30, 2014, Realty Income's portfolio consisted of 4,284 properties  across 49 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, protecting bondholders from possible  regional supply-and-demand retail property imbalances. The most significant  portfolio transaction over the past two years to broaden portfolio granularity  was the acquisition of ARCT, comprising 501 properties, for $3.2 billion. Fitch views the portfolio's tenant industry diversification favorably.  The  company owns properties leased to discretionary and non-discretionary retailers.  However, it favors non-discretionary retail segments that are both resilient  through economic cycles (e.g. not investing in jewelry stores) and insulated  from e-commerce pressures (e.g. not investing in locations such as bookstores  that sell commoditized products).  The portfolio includes 47 tenant industries,  and top segments based on third quarter 2014 (3Q'14) revenues were convenience  stores (10%), dollar stores (9.6%), drug stores (9.4%), casual dining and quick  service restaurants (7.7%) and health and fitness (7%).   Improving Tenant Credit The company has 231 tenants; however, the top-10 tenant list is somewhat  concentrated, comprising 37.5% of 3Q'14 rent.  The concentration risk is  mitigated in part by the high tenant credit quality. The top three tenants at  Sept. 30, 2014 were Walgreens at 5.4% (Fitch IDR of 'A-' with a Stable Outlook),  FedEx at 5.1% of rent (IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook), and Dollar General  at 4.9%.   Realty Income has materially increased the percentage of annualized rental  revenue derived from properties leased to investment-grade rated tenants, from  2% in 2007 to 15% in 2011 to 46% as of Sept. 30, 2014.  Realty Income's current  investment-grade rated tenant levels are similar to American Realty Capital  Properties, Inc. (not rated by Fitch) at 46%, and above Lexington Realty Trust  (IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook) at 39% and National Retail Properties, Inc.  (IDR of 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook) at 20%.  In addition, Realty Income's  weighted average remaining lease term is long at 10.4 years, signaling  durability in the cash flow, absent tenant bankruptcies. Long Management Track Record Realty Income has a long track record of growth since its formation in 1969,  having increased the portfolio to 4,284 properties across 47 tenant industries  in 3Q'14 from 630 properties across five industries in 1994. The original  initiatives of generating monthly income from retail properties leased on a  long-term triple-net basis (1969 to 1994) evolved towards being attuned to  portfolio diversity as well as focusing on cash flow coverage and underwriting  (1997 to 2007). Since the recession, the company has concentrated on improving  tenant credit and pursued new industries while re-underwriting and ranking the  portfolio. Realty Income's current strategy centers on owning retail and non-retail real  estate net leased to stronger credit tenants. However, its experience owning  non-retail assets such as industrial and distribution (10.3% of 3Q'14 revenue),  office (6.7%), agriculture (2.4%) and manufacturing (2.3%) is somewhat limited.   The company continued to deepen its bench as a result of diversification outside  of retail and, in 2014, appointed Debra M. Bonebrake as Senior Vice President -  Industrial, Distribution and Office Properties. Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage FCC is strong for the rating at 3.2x for the TTM Sept. 30, 2014 and 3.5x in  3Q'14 pro forma for the redemption of class E preferred stock with the unsecured  revolving credit facility in October 2014 (pro forma), respectively, up from  3.1x in 2013 and 2.6x in 2012.  EBITDA growth from acquisitions as well as  contractual rent increases and occupancy gains in the same-store portfolio,  partially offset by increased fixed charges associated with debt incurred to  fund a portion of those acquisitions, drove the increase.  Fitch defines FCC as  recurring operating EBITDA less straight-line rent adjustments less recurring  capital expenditures divided by total interest incurred and preferred dividends. Fitch's base case projections are predicated on contractual base rent increases  (1.5% same-store rent growth) and additional acquisitions (assumed to be $650  million in 2015 and $500 million in 2016), which should result in coverage  approaching 3.5x over the next 12 to 24 months, which is strong for the 'BBB+'  rating. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which tenant bankruptcies  reduce annual rent by approximately 2.5% annually in 2015 and 2016, FCC would  fall to 3x, still strong for the 'BBB+' rating. Good Liquidity and Strong Access to Capital Liquidity coverage is good for the rating at 1.8x for the period Oct. 1, 2014 to  Dec. 31, 2016. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as sources of liquidity (readily  available unrestricted cash, availability under the unsecured revolving credit  facility pro forma, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities  after dividends and distributions) divided by uses of liquidity (debt maturities  and projected recurring capital expenditures). Longer term, debt maturities are manageable as of Sept. 30, 2014 pro forma, with  0.2% maturing during the remainder of 2014 followed by 5.4% in 2015 and 10.5% in  2016.   The company has a long track record of monthly dividend increases.  Fitch  anticipates that the company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout  ratio will remain at approximately 85% (85.7% in 3Q'14, although this ratio  increased to 88.4% in 2013 as a result of the dividend increase associated with  the ARCT acquisition). Recent AFFO payout levels indicate the company's ability  to generate over $80 million in organic liquidity annually. Somewhat Elevated Leverage Net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA was 5.8x at 3Q'14 pro forma, down from  5.9x in 2013 and 6.4x in 2012. The redemption of class E preferred stock  increased leverage from to 5.8x pro forma 5.5x during 3Q'14, as Fitch treats  REIT preferred shares as 100% equity for leverage purposes. Under Fitch's base  case, leverage is forecasted to remain between 5.5x and 6x in 2015-2016, which  would remain appropriate for the rating. In a stress case (principally a  material tenant bankruptcy) scenario not anticipated by Fitch, leverage could  sustain above 6x, which would place pressure on the 'BBB+' rating and/or  Outlook. Weak Unencumbered Asset Coverage Unencumbered assets (unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed capitalization rate  of 9%) cover net unsecured debt by 2x as of Sept. 30, 2014 pro forma, which is  weak for the 'BBB+' rating but reflects adequate contingent liquidity from the  company's unencumbered property pool. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between Realty Income's IDR and preferred stock  rating is consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of  'BBB+'. Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects strong FCC for the rating, a high degree of  portfolio granularity, adequate liquidity and strong access to capital, offset  by elevated leverage and weak unencumbered asset coverage for the rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (pro forma leverage is  5.8x); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3x (pro forma FCC is 3.5x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt sustaining above  3x (this ratio is 2x pro forma). The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --A more aggressive approach towards funding acquisitions heavily with debt  financing, which is not Fitch's expectation; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6x (Fitch has not changed  this sensitivity, as the improvement in tenant credit quality and portfolio  granularity has been offset to some extent by the company's shorter track record  of owning non-retail assets); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.5x; --Tenant bankruptcies resulting in a weakening of the company's credit metrics.

2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Realty  Income Corporation with the IDR at 'BBB+'. Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB+'  rating to the $250 million unsecured term loan due 2020.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of Realty Income's IDR at 'BBB+' reflects the granularity of its  predominantly retail net lease portfolio, its disciplined acquisition strategy  and management track record. Credit strengths include strong fixed-charge  coverage (FCC), ample liquidity, and access to multiple sources of capital.  The rating is balanced by leverage that has increased over the past several  years (5.5x for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 pro forma for recent  acquisitions compared to 4.4x at year-end 2009). The risks stemming from higher  leverage has been tempered in part but not in full by the improving granularity  and tenant credit quality. Fitch expects that leverage will decline slightly  over the next 12 to 24 months but remain somewhat elevated for the 'BBB+'  rating.  GRANULAR PORTFOLIO WITH IMPROVING TENANT CREDIT Fitch expects Realty Income's portfolio will exhibit durable and stable  operating cashflows through the cycle as a result of the granularity (4,378  stores), lease structure and generally improving tenant credit profile of its  portfolio. In addition, Fitch views the portfolio's tenant industry  diversification and focus on properties primarily leased to non-discretionary  retailers favorably. Moreover, O's underwriting focuses on non-discretionary  retail segments that are believed to be more resilient through economic cycles  and insulated from e-commerce pressures. Per the issuer, over 90% of the retail  tenants offer a service, are non-discretionary and/or have a low price point  component to the business. The portfolio's top segments for 1Q'15 were  convenience stores (9.6% of rental revenues), drug stores (9.6%), dollar stores  (9.3%), casual dining and quick service restaurants (8.4%) and health and  fitness (6.8%).  Realty Income has materially increased the percentage of annualized rental  revenue derived from properties leased to investment-grade rated tenants to 48%  as of March 31, 2015 from 2% in 2007 and 15% in 2011. Partially offsetting these  factors is some tenant concentration, albeit with highly rated tenants. At March  31, 2015, the top tenants were Walgreens (Fitch IDR of 'A-' with a Stable  Outlook) at 5.5% of revenue, FedEx (IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook) at 5.2%  of rent, and Dollar General at 4.8%. CONSISTENT TRACK RECORD Realty Income's consistent and generally conservative track record underwriting  investments and managing the balance sheet is a credit positive. Realty Income's  strategy centers on owning retail and non-retail real estate net leased to  stronger credit tenants. However, its experience owning non-retail assets such  as industrial and distribution (10.7% of 1Q'15 revenue), office (6.4%),  manufacturing (2.4% and agriculture (2.3%) and manufacturing is somewhat  limited. Moreover some of these asset classes have higher lease renewal risk  (i.e. office) and may be less financeable than investment grade non-retail (e.g.  agriculture), in Fitch's view.  ELEVATED LEVERAGE BUT STRONG FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE  Fitch expects Realty Income's leverage will sustain in the 5.5x - 6x range  through 2016 (5.5x at March 31, 2015 pro forma), which is towards the higher end  of the range for the rating. Fitch views leverage sustaining between 4.5x - 6x  as appropriate for the rating considering the portfolio quality and type. In a  stress case (principally a material tenant bankruptcy) scenario not anticipated  by Fitch, leverage could sustain above 6x, which would place pressure on the  'BBB+' rating and/or Outlook. FCC is strong for the rating at 3.4x for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 pro  forma up from 3.2x in 2014 and 2.6x in 2012. EBITDA growth from acquisitions as  well as contractual rent increases and occupancy gains in the same-store  portfolio, partially offset by increased fixed charges associated with debt  incurred to fund a portion of those acquisitions, drove the improvement. Fitch  defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring operating  EBITDA. Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating EBITDA less straight-line rent  adjustments less recurring capital expenditures divided by total interest  incurred and preferred dividends. AMPLE LIQUIDITY AND STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL Realty Income has ample liquidity pro forma for the expansion of its line of  credit by $500 million to $2 billion, the $250 million term loan and the $276.7  million equity issuance in April 2015. As a result, liquidity coverage is strong  for the rating at 2.7x for the period April 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016. Fitch  defines liquidity coverage as sources of liquidity (readily available  unrestricted cash, availability under the unsecured revolving credit facility  pro forma, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities after  dividends and distributions) divided by uses of liquidity (debt maturities and  projected recurring capital expenditures). Longer term, debt maturities are  manageable with 4.9% maturing in 2015 and 13.3% in 2016.  Fitch anticipates that Realty Income will be able to generate approximately $80  million - $100 million of retained operating cashflow despite the track record  of monthly dividend increases. Realty Income's dividends comprised 83.3% of  adjusted funds from operations in 1Q'15 as compared to the 83.1% - 92.5% range  from 2006 - 2014.  Realty Income has adequate contingent liquidity in the form of unencumbered  assets which covered unsecured debt by 2.4x at March 31, 2015. Fitch calculates  unencumbered asset coverage as unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed  capitalization rate of 9%. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for O include:  --Operating cash flows grow by 1.5% driven principally by contractual base rent  increases; --Net acquisitions totaling $650 million in 2015 and $500 million in 2016 at a  7% cap rate;  --Recurring operating EBITDA margins remain around 90%; --Equity issuances sufficient to maintain leverage below 6x.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (March 31, 2015 pro  forma leverage is 5.5x); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3x (1Q'15 pro forma FCC is 3.4x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt sustaining above  3x (this ratio is 2.4x as of March 31, 2015). The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --A more aggressive approach towards funding acquisitions heavily with debt  financing, which is not Fitch's expectation; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6x (Fitch has not changed  this sensitivity, as the improvement in tenant credit quality and portfolio  granularity has been offset to some extent by the company's shorter track record  of owning non-retail assets); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.5x; --Tenant bankruptcies resulting in a weakening of the company's credit metrics.

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  expected senior unsecured notes due 2027 issued by Realty Income Corporation  (NYSE:O). Net proceeds are expected to be used to repay borrowings outstanding  under the $2 billion revolving credit facility and, to the extent not used for  that purpose, to fund potential investment opportunities and/or for other  general corporate purposes. A full list of Fitch's current ratings on O follows  at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect the granularity of O's predominantly retail net lease  portfolio, its disciplined acquisition strategy, and management track record.  Credit strengths include strong fixed-charge coverage (FCC), ample liquidity,  and access to multiple sources of capital.  Leverage has increased over the past several years (5.1x for the trailing 12  months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 4.4x at year-end 2009), but is  still within O's financial policy and within Fitch's rating sensitivities. The  higher leverage has been consistent with O's growth strategy and has been  tempered in part by improved granularity and tenant credit quality. Fitch  expects that leverage will rise slightly over the next 12 to 24 months to the  mid-5x range but remain appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating.   GRANULAR PORTFOLIO WITH IMPROVING TENANT CREDIT Fitch expects Realty Income's portfolio will exhibit durable and stable  operating cash flows through the cycle as a result of the granularity (4,646  stores), lease structure and generally higher-quality tenant credit profile of  its portfolio. In addition, Fitch views the portfolio's tenant industry  diversification and focus on properties primarily leased to discretionary and  non-discretionary retailers favorably. O's underwriting focuses on  non-discretionary retail segments that are both resilient through economic  cycles and insulated from e-commerce pressures. The portfolio's top segments for  second quarter 2016 (2Q16) were drug stores (11% of rental revenues), casual  dining and quick service restaurants (8.9%), convenience stores (8.8%), dollar  stores (8.7%) and health and fitness (8.2%). Partially offsetting these factors is some tenant concentration, albeit with  highly rated tenants. At June 30, 2016, the top tenants were Walgreens at 6.6%  of rental revenue (Fitch IDR: 'BBB'), FedEx at 5.7%, and Dollar General at 4.5%. CONSISTENT TRACK RECORD Realty Income's consistent and generally conservative track record in  underwriting investments and managing the balance sheet is a credit positive.  Realty Income's strategy centers on owning retail and non-retail real estate net  leased to stronger credit tenants. However, its experience owning non-retail  assets such as industrial and distribution (12.8% of 2Q16 revenue), office  (5.8%) and agriculture (2.1%) is somewhat limited. Moreover, some of these asset  classes have higher lease renewal risk (i.e. office) and may be less financeable  than investment-grade retail, in Fitch's view. HEADLINE METRICS REMAIN APPROPRIATE O's net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA was appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating  at 5.0x and 5.1x for the quarter and TTM ended June 30, 2016, respectively. This  compares to 5.2x and 5.9x for the years ended 2015 and 2014. When including 50%  of preferred stock in total debt, O's leverage was 5.2x for the quarter and 5.3x  for the TTM ended June 30, 2016, still appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating. Free cash flow (FCC) is appropriate for the rating at 3.6x for the TTM ended  June 30, 2016, compared with the 3.5x in 2015 and 3.2x in 2014. The improvement  has been driven by EBITDA growth from acquisitions as well as contractual rent  increases and occupancy gains in the same-store portfolio, partially offset by  increased fixed charges associated with debt incurred to fund a portion of those  acquisitions. Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to  recurring operating EBITDA. Fitch defines FCC as recurring operating EBITDA less  straight-line rent adjustments and recurring capital expenditures divided by  total interest incurred and preferred dividends. AMPLE LIQUIDITY AND STRONG ACCESS TO CAPITAL Realty Income has ample liquidity due to its retained cash flow, limited  recurring capex, limited near-term debt maturities and $2 billion line of credit  due 2019. As a result, liquidity coverage is 1.7x for the period July 1, 2016 to  Dec. 31, 2018. Liquidity coverage improves to 2.0x under a conservative mortgage  refinancing approach whereby the company is only able to refinance 80% of  upcoming mortgage maturities with new mortgages. Fitch defines liquidity  coverage as sources of liquidity (readily available unrestricted cash,  availability under the unsecured revolving credit facility, and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends and distributions)  divided by uses of liquidity (debt maturities and projected recurring capital  expenditures). Near-term debt maturities are manageable with 5.6% maturing in  2016 and 6.5% in 2017. Fitch anticipates that Realty Income will be able to generate approximately $100  million - $130 million of annual retained operating cash flow despite the track  record of monthly dividend increases. Realty Income's dividends comprised 83.6%  of adjusted funds from operations in second quarter 2016 (2Q16) as compared to  the 82.4% - 92.5% range from 2006 - 2015. Realty Income has adequate contingent liquidity in the form of unencumbered  assets which covered unsecured debt by 2.2x at June 30, 2016. Fitch calculates  unencumbered asset coverage as unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed  capitalization rate of 9%. PREFERRED STOCK NOTCHING  The two-notch differential between O's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', these preferred securities are  deeply subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result  in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate default. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that O will operate within its  targeted metrics through the rating horizon and the issuer will have sufficient  capacity to address any potential tenant credit issues. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for O include:  --Operating cash flows grow by 1.5% driven principally by contractual base rent  increases; --O will make portfolio acquisitions through the use of proceeds from  divestments, equity issuances and unsecured debt issuances;  --Recurring operating EBITDA margins remain around 90%; --Sufficient equity and debt issuances throughout the rating horizon to repay  debt, fund acquisitions and maintain leverage below 6x.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage for TTM ended  as of June 30, 2016 was 5.1x); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3x (FCC for TTM ended as of June  30, 2016 was 3.6x); --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt sustaining above  3x (this ratio is 2.2x as of June 30, 2016); --Demonstrated market leading capital markets access across the broader REIT  universe. The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or  Rating Outlook: --A more aggressive approach towards funding acquisitions heavily with debt  financing, which is not Fitch's expectation; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6x (Fitch has not changed  this sensitivity, as the improvement in tenant credit quality and portfolio  granularity has been offset to some extent by the company's shorter track record  of owning non-retail assets); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.5x; --Tenant bankruptcies resulting in a weakening of the company's credit metrics. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates O as follows:  Realty Income Corporation  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured term loans at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.
