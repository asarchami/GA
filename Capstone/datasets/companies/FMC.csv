0,"  * FMC sees 2014 net profit of $1-1.05 bln* Reuters poll avg for 2014 net profit was $1.19 bln* FMC to close some U.S. dialysis clinics in savings drive* CEO says would consider bid for Swedish rival Diaverum* FMC shares drop over 7 pct, parent Fresenius drops 8 pct   (Adds CEO comments on Diaverum, cost cuts, analyst comment)By Maria Sheahan and Andreas KrönerFRANKFURT, Feb 25 Fresenius Medical Care , which makes kidney dialysis machines, forecast a shock fall in net profit for this year  due to healthcare spending cuts in the United States.Shares in the German company, which operates more than a third of dialysis treatment centres in the United States, dropped almost 6 percent on Tuesday after it reported its first decline in annual net profit in 12 years.Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) makes about a third of its revenue from Medicare, a U.S. government healthcare programme for elderly and disabled people.The U.S. federal agency that sets reimbursement rates for Medicare said in November it would spread a 9.4 percent cut, initially proposed to take effect in 2014, over the next three to four years. ""Looking ahead we are faced with a challenging environment, in particular with structural changes due to growing pressure on reimbursement systems,"" FMC Chief Executive Rice Powell said.FMC said it expected a 2014 net profit of between $1 billion and $1.05 billion, compared with $1.11 billion last year and analysts' average forecast of $1.19 billion in a Reuters poll.DZ Bank analyst Sven Kuerten said FMC's forecast for a second successive fall in annual profit was particularly surprising since the reimbursement cuts announced in November were not as harsh as had been expected.Analysts at Berenberg said FMC's outlook was ""shocking.""FMC's closest rival in the United States, DaVita, by contrast, raised its 2014 operating profit outlook earlier this month due to a slower rollout of new U.S. health insurance exchanges, where individuals can buy health coverage with income-based government subsidies. Fresenius, the diversified healthcare group that controls FMC, also issued a disappointing 2014 outlook on Tuesday. It expects only 2-5 percent profit growth at constant currencies, slowing from a 12 percent gain to 1.05 billion euros ($1.4 billion) last year.But it forecast annual net profit to jump to between 1.4 billion and 1.5 billion euros by 2017 as a result of its recent purchase of hospitals from Germany's Rhoen-Klinikum.FMC's shares closed 5.7 percent lower at 49.82 euros, the biggest faller on Germany's blue-chip DAX index. Fresenius stock was down 4.2 percent at 114.05 euros.COST CUTS  FMC launched a cost-cutting programme last year to cope with tougher conditions in the United States as part of which it could shut a ten or more clinics and freeze hiring.""We will close clinics that are not profitable and don't have any prospects,"" Powell said. He said closures were most likely in metropolitan areas where there are multiple facilities for patients to choose from.FMC has 3,250 clinics worldwide, more than 2,000 of which are in North America.The cost-cutting programme should yield savings of up to $60 million this year and higher sums in 2015 and 2016. Powell said the programme should be largely complete by 2016 or 2017.FMC is looking for growth elsewhere and Powell said he would consider buying Swedish rival Diaverum if owner Bridgepoint put it up for sale.Bridgepoint has been looking to offload the Swedish dialysis clinic operator, which could fetch more than 1 billion euros. Sources told Reuters last year that Bridgepoint had hired JP Morgan to review its options.Any attempt by FMC to buy Diaverum could face opposition from national anti-trust authorities, bankers have said, but FMC could allay their concerns by selling off parts of the company.""We have been talking to anti-trust authorities about such issues before,"" Powell said.($1 = 0.7285 euros)   (Editing by Mark Potter and Erica Billingham)",2014-02-25,FMC,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 12:03pm EST",UPDATE 3-Dialysis firm FMC warns health spending cuts to hit profit,http://www.reuters.com//article/fmc-results-idUSL6N0LU0E220140225?type=companyNews
1,"  * FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.5 pct* Fresenius, FMC both tank after update* CAC, FTSE retreat from multi-year highsBy Alistair SmoutLONDON, Feb 25 European shares pulled back on Tuesday from three weeks of sharp gains, as weakness in medical group Fresenius weighed on German stocks and many regional indexes edged off multi-year highs.Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) fell 6.9 percent after it unexpectedly forecast another decline in profit for 2014 amid budget cuts to healthcare from the United States. Shares in Fresenius, which controls FMC, fell 6.7 percent.The two stocks accounted for more than half the drop of 0.3 percent on the German DAX, which otherwise would have outpaced peers.Data showed that foreign trade growth had driven Europe's largest economy in the fourth quarter. While the headline 0.4 percent increase in gross domestic product was a confirmation of an earlier flash number, the pick-up in foreign trade, which had been weak in 2013, was encouraging, traders said, while weakening domestic demand left room for further policy easing by the European Central Bank.""Consumer demand inside Germany goes a long way to helping the inflationary environment of the EU, and we've reverted to a relatively unenthusiastic spender inside of Germany,"" Alastair McCaig, analyst at IG, said.""It's more likely that we'll get more stimulus (from the ECB) if Germany also needs to boost consumption demand.""The DAX was one of the only major European indexes not to have hit multi-year highs on Monday. The pan-European FTSEurofirst was down 0.5 percent at 1,345.96 on Tuesday, having gained 6.4 percent in the last 14 sessions to leave it at a six-year closing high on Monday and substantially overbought, with a 9-day relative strength indicator reading of 92.If a market has an RSI above 70, it indicates it is technically ""overbought"" while under 30 shows it is technically ""oversold"".The French CAC and British FTSE 100 closed Monday at 5-1/2 and fourteen-year highs respectively, well into overbought territory.The French index fell 0.5 percent on Tuesday. Leading it lower was telecoms group Vivendi, which fell 2.1 percent after delivering in-line results but failing to outline any detail on its outlook for the coming year. ""The company did not provide any guidance for any of its business units and made no announcement on 2013 dividend, which in light of the possible spin-off of SFR from the group is not totally surprising but it could pave the way for some slight disappointment in terms of market reaction,"" Espirito Santo analysts said in a note.Europe bourses in 2014:Asset performance in 2014:Today's European research round-up",2014-02-25,FMC,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 5:36am EST",REFILE-Fresenius weighs on overbought European shares,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-europe-stocks-idUSL6N0LU1EF20140225?type=companyNews

6,"  * First quarter Fresenius, FMC earnings miss market view* Hit by drug price cuts in China, U.S. reimbursement cuts* FMC shares down, Fresenius shares recoup initial losses   (Recasts, adds analyst comment, details on China, U.S., blood product)By Ludwig BurgerFRANKFURT, May 6 First quarter earnings at German healthcare group Fresenius SE grew more slowly than expected, hurt by spending cuts in the United States and China and lower sales of a blood substitute product.The drugmaker, which also operates hospitals and controls dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care, said on Tuesday adjusted net income rose 2 percent to 228 million euros ($316 million), short of the 244 million euro average estimate in a Reuters poll. Its generic injectable drugs business suffered from price cuts in China and lower sales of a blood substitute called HES, an emergency treatment for sudden blood loss. European regulators had advised physicians to no longer use it for certain patient groups.Commerzbank analyst Volker Braun said most negative effects, such as China and HES, had been known, but were hard to quantify. ""The picture remains relatively blurred,"" he said. Fresenius shares recovered from initial losses of as much as 2.5 percent, trading 0.6 percent higher at 0804 GMT.Its subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care, the world's largest kidney dialysis provider, said net income declined 9 percent to $205 million, less than the $225 million average expectation in a Reuters poll.The U.S. federal agency that sets reimbursements for Medicare in January cut dialysis payment rates, which cancelled out routine annual mark-ups to adjust for inflation, a move that will be repeated next year and possibly beyond. FMC fell 1.2 percent, among the biggest decliners on Germany's blue-chip DAX index as analysts said the company's full-year outlook for an earnings drop, confirmed on Tuesday, had previously been viewed as cautious but now looked more realistic.FMC is targeting net profit of between $1 billion and $1.05 billion this year, compared with $1.11 billion last year.""There is certainly less of a likelihood now of an improved outlook during the remainder of the year,"" said Commerzbank's Braun.($1 = 0.7205 Euros)   (Editing by John Stonestreet)",2014-05-06,FMC,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 5:05am EDT","UPDATE 1-Fresenius hit by U.S. cuts, weak blood substitute sales",http://www.reuters.com//article/fresenius-results-idUSL6N0NS1LH20140506?type=companyNews

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters the company's stake in Sound would be above 80 percent.FMC also said it was buying MedSpring Urgent Care Centers with operations in the U.S. states of Illinois and Texas, without providing financial details.Dialysis specialist FMC said at its investor day in April it aimed to expand its services to medical fields related to kidney failure in a push to almost double group sales to $28 billion by 2020. Analysts at Berenberg said the acquisitions should take FMC's annual revenues from so-called total care coordination to more than $1 billion, compared with a goal to reach $5 billion euros a year by 2020.""To put this in context, FMC will shortly be 20 percent of the way to its goal three months into a six-year programme. The market wanted progress, and that is what it appears FMC is making,"" they said. Sound Physicians employs and manages physicians working at more than 100 hospitals across the United States. It provides medical staff to hospitals, also offering services such as billing, accounting and purchasing management.Medical insurers in the United States are gradually moving towards a system of lump sum payments per chronically ill patient rather than reimbursing individual drugs and services.Insurers hope to cut costs because the system, called disease management or care coordination, encourages healthcare providers to work more diligently, reduce side effects and increase patients' compliance with the treatment regimens.FMC said it expects Sound to generate about $500 million in revenue in the next 12 months and sees it adding to its own operating earnings, adjusted for transaction costs, within the first year after closing. Closing is due in the next 10 days.It said it would fund the acquisition through available cash and committed credit facilities as well as additional debt financing.

Before that, they had been down 3.3 percent for the year so far. It outperformed Germany's blue-chip index , which was down about 1 percent. ""The share price jump was mainly due to strong results at hospitals unit Helios and at FMC,"" said Commerzbank analyst Volker Braun.Its subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care (FMC), the world's largest kidney dialysis provider, said second-quarter net income, adjusted for a one-off tax burden, slipped 4 percent to $252 million, in line with average expectations in a Reuters poll.Fresenius earlier this year wrapped up a 3 billion euro purchase of hospitals and outpatient facilities from peer Rhoen-Klinikum, resulting in a 48 percent jump in quarterly operating profit at its hospitals unit, Helios. ""I would have expected a lower contribution from the Rhoen hospitals,"" Commerzbank's Braun said.Shares in separately listed unit FMC, which derives about two-thirds of its revenue from North America, jumped 4.5 percent.DZ Bank analyst Sven Kuerten described its quarterly results as an encouraging sign ""after several disappointments on the operating line in the recent quarters"". The company, which operates more than a third of all dialysis treatment centres in the United States, has been grappling with healthcare budget cuts there.The U.S. federal agency that sets the Medicare insurance programme's reimbursements cut dialysis payment rates in January, cancelling out routine annual mark-ups to adjust for inflation, a move that will be repeated next year and possibly beyond.Even so, ""there's a certain transparency on pricing over the next three years and investor confidence is returning,"" Commerzbank's Braun said.Parent Fresenius raised its full-year outlook for sales to grow by a currency-adjusted 14 to 16 percent, accounted for by additional sales from acquired businesses. It had previously predicted growth of 12 to 15 percent.It continued to expect adjusted net income to grow by 2 to 5 percent at constant currencies.($1 = 0.7465 Euros)   (Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Jonathan Gould and Jane Baird)",2014-07-31,FMC,"Thu Jul 31, 2014 | 6:02am EDT","UPDATE 2-Fresenius hospital, dialysis units post solid quarter, shares up",http://www.reuters.com//article/fresenius-results-idUSL6N0Q61DO20140731?type=companyNews

12,"  (Adds attribution to two bullet points)* To pool 185 ships, save Maersk Line $350 mln/year* Alliance would have 35 pct of Asia-Europe route -FMC* Also 31 pct trans-Atlantic, 22 pct trans-Pacific -FMCBy Keith Wallis and Sabina ZawadzkiSINGAPORE/COPENHAGEN, Oct 9 Top container shipping companies A.P. Moller-Maersk and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co cleared the last regulatory hurdle to launch a vessel-sharing pact, but companies that use their services voiced concerns, particularly in China.The tie-up won U.S. approval on Wednesday after four out of five commissioners at the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) voted not to seek further information from the two shippers about the impact of the alliance on exporters and ports, one of the commissioners told Reuters.Maersk said the approval had been the last it needed from regulators around the world, including in China and the European Union, and that the alliance would begin operations in January.Under the alliance, the two carriers will pool 185 ships on European, trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes, saving Maersk Line, the container shipping arm of the group, $350 million a year, according to its own calculations. MSC, an unlisted Swiss-based company, has not provided similar figures.The two carriers control 28 percent of the global container shipping market and even more along some big trade routes, leaving exporters in both Europe and Asia worried about the potential for collusion and anti-competitive behaviour. ""You cannot ignore that Maersk and MSC each already hold a large share of the market, so we think that for China it's not a suitable arrangement,"" the China Shippers' Association, representing exporters and cargo owners, told Reuters.The China Shipowners' Association warned it would monitor the alliance.""The moment it shows signs it could damage consumers' interests or disrupt market competitiveness ... we will vigorously complain and ask the government to get involved,""    Zhang Shouguo, vice-president of the association, said. CALLS FOR MONITORING Approval of the alliance follows the rejection in June of a larger 'P3' venture involving Maersk, MSC and France's CMA CGM by China's Ministry of Commerce on competition grounds.Maersk has said the smaller alliance needed only to be registered with the Chinese Ministry of Transport and did not need approval from the Ministry of Commerce. On Thursday, a Maersk Line spokesman said the registration was complete.He also said that while the alliance's market share on the Asia-Europe trade routes amounted to 32 percent, which is above a level that would trigger a regulatory review by the European Union, Maersk had concluded that the alliance complies with EU rules.That statement appeared to indicate that the overall EU market share, including routes across the Atlantic, is below the 30 percent trigger point, although Maersk Line would not cite a figure. Container shipping lines have sought to pool resources in response to overcapacity and low freight rates, which have beset the industry since the financial downturn in 2008.Sixteen of the world's top container lines, which control over 76 percent of global shipping capacity, are grouped in four existing or planned alliances.Maersk and MSC said the alliance would cut costs for shippers and reduce harmful emissions.""In our view, this is a win-win situation. Due to a larger and more cost-efficient network, we can continue to provide our customers in North America, Europe and Asia competitive and reliable container shipping services,"" Vincent Clerc, chief trade and marketing officer at Maersk Line, said in a statement.The Maersk-MSC pact would have a 35 percent of the Asia-Europe route, 31 percent of trans-Atlantic trade and 22 percent of trans-Pacific, according to FMC figures.Richard Lidinsky Jr, the only FMC commissioner to vote against the alliance, told Reuters he thought the Commission should establish a vigorous monitoring system for the alliance.The European Shippers' Council wrote to the FMC last month saying the alliance would ""create a huge player that will be in a position to have such a power that they can distort the market for the purpose of price increases"".The Asian Shippers' Council, which represents 20 national and regional exporter groups, said watchdogs such as the FMC and China's Ministry of Commerce should toughen regulations on shipping alliances.

14,"  * Q3 adj net income 281 mln eur, slightly above market view* Confirms FY outlook* Subsidiary FMC posts 1 pct decline in Q3 net income   (Adds subsidiary FMC's results, details on deals)FRANKFURT, Nov 4 German healthcare group Fresenius SE said third-quarter adjusted net income edged up 4 percent as additional earnings from the purchase of new hospitals were tempered by higher borrowing costs.Quarterly adjusted net income rose to 281 million euros ($352 million), above the 275 million euro average estimate in a Reuters poll. Fresenius confirmed its full-year outlook on Tuesday for sales to grow by a currency-adjusted 14 to 16 percent. It said it continued to expect adjusted net income to grow by 2 to 5 percent at constant currencies.Fresenius earlier this year wrapped up a 3 billion euro purchase of hospitals and outpatient facilities from peer Rhoen-Klinikum to cement its position as the industry's No.1 in Germany, resulting in a 43 percent jump in quarterly operating profit at its hospitals unit, Helios. Interest payments to its lenders rose 9 percent to 148 million euros in the quarter, on higher debt related to deals such as the purchase of hospitals and that of a $600 million controlling stake in Sound Inpatient Physicians Inc by its separately listed subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) .FMC, the world's largest kidney dialysis provider, which is controlled by Fresenius, said in a separate statement that third-quarter net income eased by 1 percent as the effect of U.S. healthcare budget cuts slightly outweighed lower costs and the recent acquisition of Sound Inpatient. The German group, which derives about two-thirds of its revenue from North America, said quarterly net income came to $271 million, compared with average expectations of $277 million in a Reuters poll.The company still expects sales to grow 4 percent to $15.2 billion in 2014, excluding revenue of about $500 million from acquisitions completed during the first nine months of the year.It continues to target net income of $1.0-$1.05 billion in 2014 compared with $1.11 billion last year, not yet taking into account potential cost savings before income taxes of up to $60 million from an ongoing efficiency programme.FMC bought Sound Inpatient Physicians, which provides medical staff to hospitals and offers billing, accounting and purchasing management, as part of its drive to branch out into additional services linked to its core business of kidney dialysis.

15,"  * FMC pushes into care coordination with takeover* Aims to have $5 bln care coordination by 2020* Cogent to be folded into FMC's Sound Inpatient Physicians   (Adds background on care coordination, financial details)FRANKFURT, Nov 13 Germany's Fresenius Medical Care said it agreed to take over Cogent Healthcare, a U.S. provider of specialist physicians to hospitals, as part of its drive to offer additional services linked to its core business of kidney dialysis.The takeover of Cogent, with $250 million in expected 2015 sales, will be carried out by Sound Inpatient Physicians, in which FMC earlier this year took a majority stake. FMC, which did not disclose financial terms, aims to build a $5 billion care-coordination business by 2020 to offer a wider range of care for the chronically ill as part of an initiative to almost double group sales to $28 billion by then.Medical insurers in the United States are gradually moving toward a system of lump-sum payments for taking care of dialysis patients rather than reimbursing individual drugs and services, which FMC believes requires it to broaden its offering. Insurers hope that the system, called care coordination or disease management, will encourage healthcare providers to work more diligently towards preventing medical complications and increase patients' compliance with treatment regimens.For Sound Inpatient with $500 million in annual revenue, FMC paid more than 1.5 times expected sales, taking a majority stake which a person familiar with the matter at the time said was above 80 percent, for a purchase price of $600 million. That sales multiple, if applied to the Cogent purchase, would suggest a purchase price of more than $375 million.The German group expects the Cogent deal to improve group earnings within 18-24 months after closing, taking into account transaction and integration costs as well as synergies.The transaction will be financed through available cash and is expected to be closed by year-end.

He declined to comment on the unit's valuation, which was provided by sources close to the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America declined to comment. The alkali chemicals division is a global producer of natural soda ash and related products used in the glass, chemical processing and detergent industries.In March, FMC said it would split itself into two companies in a bid to separate its stable and growing agriculture, health and nutrition businesses from its cyclical minerals division. FMC's alkali chemicals unit was to be placed inside the company's minerals segment. FMC scuttled its plans to spin off of the minerals business, however, when it agreed to acquire Cheminova. FMC Chief Executive Pierre Brondeau has said the sale of alkali chemicals will allow FMC to cut its debt pile following the Cheminova deal. FMC's lithium unit, the other component of what would have been the minerals division, will remain with FMC following the sale of the alkali business.FMC will concentrate on its nutrition, agriculture and health business lines following the sale of the alkali business.Brondeau said on Sept. 8 he expected the sale of the alkali chemicals unit to be completed by mid-2015.

But FMC's 2016 guidance beat consensus expectations which had pointed to 14 percent profit growth on average. FMC's shares rose and were among the top gainers on Germany's blue-chip index in mid-morning trade.""The 2015 guidance did have the potential to create a repeat performance of last year's disappointments, but the fact that management has provided encouraging 2016 guidance should reassure investors that FMC is capable of delivering the kind of growth they expect of it over the long term,"" Berenberg analysts said in a note to clients.By 1001 GMT, FMC shares were up 1.8 percent at 66.65 euros, while the DAX was 0.1 percent lower. INVESTING IN SERVICES U.S. state-run insurer Medicare has changed the way it pays for medical services, giving clinic operators a financial incentive to reduce costs and use fewer drugs. Medicare no longer pays for the individual services and drugs provided in dialysis but instead makes a lump-sum payment.The programme is part of a trend in U.S. medical insurance towards making a fixed-rate payment to cover the cost of handling a chronically ill patient. As a result, FMC has bought up a number of healthcare services companies, seeking to offer bundled treatments for kidney and cardiovascular disease to Medicare and private-sector insurers, saying it can give high-level care at lower costs.FMC's fourth-quarter net income of $335 million, down 4 percent, was broadly in line with analyst expectations.FMC's parent, healthcare group Fresenius SE said separately it expected its net income to rise between 9 and 12 percent at constant currencies this year, helped by additional earnings from the purchase of new hospitals and demand for healthcare services.Fresenius's Kabi business, which makes generic infusion drugs and tube-feeding equipment, is to cut annual costs by about 40 million euros from 2018, with related one-off charges dragging pretax profit 100 million euro lower in 2015.Hospira, one of Kabi's largest rivals, is being bought by Pfizer for about $15 billion, which could open up new marketing channels for Hospira, especially outside the United States.($1 = 0.8792 euros)   (Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Jane Merriman)",2015-02-25,FMC,"Wed Feb 25, 2015 | 6:04am EST",UPDATE 3-Fresenius Medical Care sees strong profit growth in 2016,http://www.reuters.com//article/fresenius-medi-results-idUSL5N0VZ0KO20150225?type=companyNews

Previously, the company forecast adjusted net income growth of 13-16 percent.The company also narrowed its 2015 sales target range, predicting currency adjusted growth of 8-10 percent, where it had previously seen 7-10 percent.Kabi has for several years been able to step into the breach when rivals had to suspend production because of rebukes from U.S. healthcare regulators. While hampering the U.S. healthcare system, such shortages in dozens of drugs have created windfall profits for the German company, which in 2008 entered the U.S. injectable generic drugs market with the takeover of APP Pharmaceuticals.Second-quarter adjusted net income for the group, which also runs hospitals and kidney dialysis centres, jumped 35 percent to 350 million euros, beating the consensus estimate for 336 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts.Kidney dialysis specialist Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) , Fresenius's separately listed subsidiary, on Wednesday revised lower its projections for 2016 sales growth to 7-10 percent, where it had previously seen 9-12 percent, because of delays at its so-called care coordination business. FMC, which dominates the U.S. market for dialysis clinics, is branching out into a wider range of healthcare services related to dialysis, which it calls care coordination.FMC reported a 3 percent gain in quarterly net profit to $241 million, short of the $256 million average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts, while revenue rose 9 percent to a better-than-expected $4.20 billion.FMC confirmed its 2015 forecast for net income to stagnate or rise by up to 5 percent.(Reporting by Ludwig Burger; editing by Thomas Atkins and Dan Grebler)",2015-07-29,FMC,"Wed Jul 29, 2015 | 5:43pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Fresenius raises 2015 profit guidance on generic infusion drugs,http://www.reuters.com//article/fresenius-outlook-idUSL5N10966Y20150729?type=companyNews

Third-quarter adjusted net income for the group, which also runs hospitals and kidney dialysis centres, jumped 31 percent to 367 million euros ($401.20 million), beating the consensus estimate for 354 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts.The Kabi unit has for several years been able to step into the breach when rivals had to suspend production of products such as the blood-thinning heparin drip or anaesthetic propofol because of rebukes from U.S. healthcare regulators.

That compares with adjusted net income of 1.42 billion in 2015, which was broadly in line with market expectations.Fresenius Medical Care, the separately-listed kidney dialysis provider controlled by Fresenius, predicted 15 to 20 net income growth this year, adjusted for one-off items. The rise in obesity and diabetes is fuelling a persistent increase in kidney failure patients who require dialysis services. FMC is also expanding into chronic disease care and services related to its core dialysis business.Fresenius's Helios unit, a chain of more than 100 German hospitals, will likely see a 3 to 5 percent revenue increase, excluding newly purchased hospitals, and it will no longer incur  costs related to folding hospitals acquired from Rhoen-Klinikum AG into its organisation.The group's generic infusion drugs unit Kabi, a major profit driver in the past, however forecast flat operating earnings 2016, when adjusted for currency swings.Kabi saw several years of surprise earnings growth because rivals had to suspend production of products such as the blood-thinning heparin drip because of rebukes from U.S. healthcare regulators, but that effect appears to be petering out for now.

30,"   By Rod Nickel | TORONTO  TORONTO Climbing demand for the metal lithium at a time of broader commodity weakness has Canada's Nemaska Lithium Inc and Western Lithium USA Corp confident they can soon obtain scarce capital even as other junior miners struggle.A scramble to secure lithium has accelerated as prices have risen, driven by demand for smartphone, laptop and electric car batteries. ""Everyone can see the writing on the wall as we move toward 2020, and a need for new deposits to get into production,"" said Jon Hykawy, president of consultancy Stormcrow Capital. ""Problem is, the capital really isn’t there.""But Western, which aims to bring the world's next new lithium resource into production in 2018 in Argentina, is optimistic.""What we're really seeing is the equivalent of another industrial revolution, the switch to electric power for automobiles,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Hodgson said at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention in Toronto. ""Given the fundamental shift in energy demand, nothing's easy, but (raising capital is) very doable."" Vancouver-based Western's $314 million project would pump brine to the surface for evaporation.Western says one of its advantages is a commercial agreement it is negotiating with South Korean steelmaker Posco, a potential joint venture that would deliver Western's lithium to the doorstep of South Korean battery manufacturers LG Electronics Inc and Samsung SDI.Nemaska Lithium Inc, developing a mine in the Canadian province of Quebec, expects to raise the C$521 million  ($392.14 million) it needs within a year, Chief Executive Officer Guy Bourassa said, adding it has one of only three undeveloped projects in the world with full permits. Since lithium does not trade publicly, many investors, burned by other faltering commodities, do not realize that prices have steadily climbed, Bourassa said.Three large producers, SQM, Albemarle Corp and FMC Corp, and a new Argentina brine operation owned by Orocobre Ltd account for just over half of global production, according to advisory firm Global Lithium LLC.""End users we're talking with obviously don't like that situation because they're at the mercy of these four guys,"" Bourassa said. ""It's another advantage for us.""  Lithium carbonate prices are poised to keep rising in 2016, and demand will require a new large-scale plant every 18 months for the next decade, Global Lithium president Joe Lowry said.Western Lithium's shares have gained about 11 percent this year, as of Friday, while Nemaska has climbed 9 percent.

33,"   By Rod Nickel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Agriculture and nutrition company FMC Corp earns a sliver of its revenue from lithium, but the mineral used in electric car batteries has such a bright future that it's likely to remain part of FMC's business, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday.Lithium forms a small but irreplaceable component of rechargeable batteries, used in consumer devices like mobile phones and electric cars. It also has pharmaceutical and other applications.Prices have soared in the past year, and demand is set to outstrip supply by 2023, according to specialist consultants Stormcrow Capital.Even though it has doesn't naturally fit with crop chemicals and food ingredients, lithium is likely to stay part of Philadelphia-based FMC, said CFO Paul Graves, on the sidelines of BMO's Farm to Market investor conference in New York.  ""I think sometimes people get carried away with, 'you need to be more focused,'"" he said.""We've put a lot of capital into (lithium) and we'll reap the benefits in the next three to five years. I don't really want to pass that on to somebody else, so I think we'll continue to own the business.""FMC's $250-million lithium business is too small to spin off as a separate company, he said. In the near term, FMC's lithium has higher growth potential than agriculture or nutrition, Graves said. FMC forecasts lithium to earn about 7 percent of the company's $3.5 billion in revenue this year, compared to more than two-thirds for agriculture.Slumping farm prices and weakening U.S. farmer incomes have hurt agriculture sales, and FMC is cutting jobs in the business. While its lithium business is small in FMC's portfolio, the company has an outsized share of the 40,000 ton global market for lithium hydroxide, which Graves said is the preferred form of lithium for batteries. FMC fills nearly one-quarter of that demand.It's unlikely, however, that FMC would divest the much larger businesses to focus on lithium, Graves said. While the commodity's prospects are strong, it may never become as large a sector as FMC's agriculture business, he said.

39,"  BERLIN German healthcare group Fresenius SE (FREG.DE) raised its profit target for the year after reporting a 12 percent rise in adjusted net income for the second quarter bolstered by the launch of new generic intravenous drugs and rivals' supply shortages. Fresenius, controlled by a charitable trust, late on Monday said it now expected 2016 net income to rise by between 11 and 14 percent in constant currency, compared with a previous forecast of between 8 and 12 percent.It raised the outlook for drip infusion unit Kabi, saying it now expected earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at constant currency and organic sales to rise between 3 and 5 percent. It had previously predicted flat sales and earnings.Kabi, which makes drip feed equipment and injectable drugs such as sedatives, anesthetics, chemotherapy, has achieved several years of surprise earnings growth partly because rivals had to suspend production due to rebukes from U.S. healthcare regulators.For the second quarter, Fresenius reported group adjusted net income of 393 million euros ($439 million), topping the average estimate of 382 million in a Reuters poll of analysts. Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) (FMEG.DE), the separately listed kidney dialysis provider controlled by Fresenius, confirmed it was targeting 15 to 20 percent growth in adjusted net income this year, helped by a higher reimbursement rate by U.S. state insurer Medicare.FMC's second quarter net income rose 22 percent to $294  million, better than the $284 million average estimate in a Reuters poll. ""Despite unfavorable foreign currency developments and continuous cost pressure, we are confident we will achieve our full year guidance,"" FMC CEO Rice Powell said in a statement.The company is benefiting from a switch to cheaper anemia treatment Mircera, provided by Roche ROG.VX, at the expense of Amgen's (AMGN.O) more expensive drug Epogen. Fresenius and FMC were originally due to report second quarter results on Tuesday.
