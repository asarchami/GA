0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 22 (Fitch) According to Fitch Ratings, Northern Trust  Corporation (NTRS) reported lower fourth quarter 2013 (4Qâ€™13) earnings of $169.7  million relative to $206.5 million in the sequential quarter.  Fitch would note  that negatively impacting 4Qâ€™13 earnings was a pre-tax charge of $19.2 million  related to resolving a class action litigation and positively impacting 3Qâ€™13  earnings was a pre-tax $32.6 million gain related to the sale of an office  building in Miami, FL. Excluding these items noted above, on a core basis net income for 4Qâ€™13 would  have been $181.6 million which equates to a 9.3% return on average equity (ROE),  and for 3Qâ€™13 net income would have been $186.2 million equating to a 9.6% ROE.  While this result was still satisfactory from a credit perspective, it remains  below NTRSâ€™ long-term averages and is somewhat surprising given the tailwind the  company enjoyed from rising equity markets over the course of the year. Total revenue was flat relative to the sequential quarter as a 4% rise in trust  and servicing income was offset by a 19% decline in foreign exchange trading  income and a 13% decline in security commissions and trading income. Net  interest income (NII) rose 5% from the sequential quarter amid higher deposit  balances but the net interest margin (NIM) declined to 1.12% from 1.14% in the  sequential quarter.  The NIM declined amid overall lower yields partially offset  by lower premium amortization on mortgage backed securities (MBS). NTRSâ€™ overall expenses climbed 7% from the sequential quarter reflecting  negative operating leverage on the quarter.  Even excluding the one-time charge  related to settling a class action litigation noted above, NTRSâ€™ expenses still  climbed 5% relative to the flat revenue growth.  This was due largely to higher  compensation and benefits expense and higher outside services expenses primarily  due to increased legal costs. Fitch continues to believe that NTRSâ€™ revenue growth will remain challenging as  long as short-term interest rates remain low as it is causing the company to  continue to incur money market fee waivers as well as constrain its NIM.  While  higher equity markets have helped support earnings this has been offset by  continued cost pressures at the company. NTRSâ€™ overall credit quality remains good with a non-performing asset (NPA)  ratio of 0.93% at 4Qâ€™13 and an overall net charge-off (NCO) ratio of 0.20% at  4Qâ€™13. NTRSâ€™ low risk balance sheet and good capital position continues to be its main  ratings differentiator.  As of 4Qâ€™13, the companyâ€™s Tier 1 common equity ratio  (CET1) of 12.9% was down very modestly from the 13.1% ratio at 3Qâ€™13, but in  Fitchâ€™s opinion remains very strong.  Additionally, given the challenging growth  environment, the company continues to be an active share repurchaser, which  Fitch would expect to continue in 2014.

1,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | PACIFIC PALISADES, California  PACIFIC PALISADES, California Combine a fast start to the season with a favored venue and you have a near-perfect recipe for Dustin Johnson, who charged into an early one-shot lead at the Northern Trust Open on Thursday.The long-hitting American, who has relished playing at Riviera Country Club since his rookie PGA Tour campaign in 2008, took advantage of ideal scoring conditions to fire a five-under-par 66 in the opening round.Johnson, who tied for second at last week's Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, mixed six birdies with a lone bogey to finish one ahead of compatriots Robert Garrigus, Scott Stallings and Charley Hoffman, Italy's Francesco Molinari and Australian Matt Jones.PGA Tour veteran Jim Furyk opened with a 68 while U.S. Open champion Justin Rose of England, playing his first tournament of the year after recovering from tendinitis in his right shoulder, carded a 70.Among other big names competing in this week's PGA Tour event, 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa and English former world number one Lee Westwood returned matching 69s. None of the early starters, however, went lower than Johnson who reveled in a glorious morning of unbroken sunshine at Riviera where there was hardly a breath of wind.The 29-year-old American birdied four of his first nine holes and picked up two more shots after the turn, along with a bogey at the tricky par-three fourth, to surge to the top of the leaderboard. ""I just got off to a good start and continued to play really solid all day,"" Johnson, who has recorded top-10s in his first three starts on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, including victory at the WGC-HSBC Champions in November.""I kept it in play and hit a lot of greens, had a lot of looks at birdie. I've been playing pretty good all year, so the game's right where I want it to be. Coming off a good week last week, I'm definitely feeling good coming in this week.""Any score under par out here is a pretty solid round. It's a tough course ... but it's just a golf course that I really like. Right now it's in perfect condition and I have zero complaints about the course."" Johnson, an eight-times winner on the PGA Tour, has an impressive record at Riviera where he has posted three top-10s in six starts, including a tie for third in 2010 and a share of fourth in 2012.""Ever since the first time I came here, I've just really liked this golf course,"" he said. ""It's a great, great golf course, it's always in good condition and it's just a fun course to play.""It's tough but, you know, it's fair. It's in great shape right now, too.

2,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | PACIFIC PALISADES, California  PACIFIC PALISADES, California Just six months ago, Jimmy Walker commanded very little attention from the average PGA Tour fan as he toiled away almost anonymously as a journeyman on the highly competitive U.S. circuit.Fast forward to this week's Northern Trust Open at Riviera Country Club, and the long-hitting American is generating plenty of buzz, both inside and outside the ropes, as he bids for a fourth victory in the new 'wraparound' 2013-14 season.""I can feel it, I can hear it,"" Walker told reporters after recording birdies on his last three holes for a four-under-par 67 to sit just one stroke off the lead in Thursday's unfinished opening round.""It's different. It just is. It's really fun to have everybody watch last week and say, 'Good job' and 'Way to win' and 'Keep it going.' It's fun.""Walker had made 187 career starts on the PGA Tour without success before finally clinching his maiden victory at the season-opening Frys.com Open in October.He has since added further wins at the Sony Open in January and at last week's Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where he triumphed by one shot. Not since 2008, when Tiger Woods clinched his first three events, has a player made such a fast winning start to a PGA Tour season. In 1974, Johnny Miller recorded four wins in his first eight tournaments.Walker is the fourth player since 1995 to win three events in eight or fewer starts to begin a PGA Tour season, emulating the previous achievements of David Duval, Phil Mickelson and Woods, who did so a remarkable eight times.PROCESSING WINS  Asked to explain what it felt like to have posted three wins in such a short period of time, Walker replied: ""I don't know, I think I'm still processing it all.""I've never done this right here, stood in the room like this and talked and answered questions like this. It's always kind of been sitting down in the media room and stuff.""But this is where you want to be and this is why you want to play and play good, to answer questions I think."" Walker was talking to a group of reporters in a confined area in the clubhouse at Riviera Country Club, having signed his scorecard in an adjacent room moments earlier.Previously, he had spoken to golf writers only in the official interview rooms which are set up in the media centers at PGA Tour events.So far, however, Walker has embraced the heightened media interest in his golfing career.""You have to enjoy it,"" the 35-year-old Oklahoma native said. ""It's why you play. It's part of the deal.""I don't know what it's like for some of those guys that are winning 40 times and they have done this a ton... but right now, I enjoy it. It's fun, it's a good place to be.""(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by John O'Brien)",2014-02-14,NTRS,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 10:45pm EST",Walker embraces media frenzy after red-hot start to season,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-walker-idUSBREA1D05220140214?type=companyNews

Holmes was just one stroke off the pace with two holes remaining.Among those who had already signed for 67s were Americans Robert Garrigus, Charley Hoffman and Jimmy Walker, who has already won three times this season, Italy's Francesco Molinari and Australian Matt Jones.U.S. Open champion Justin Rose, playing his first event of the year after recovering from tendinitis in his right shoulder, shot a 70 while 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel and former world number one Lee Westwood carded 69s.Though four other players briefly reached five-under, only Johnson stayed there after reveling in a glorious morning of unbroken sunshine at Riviera where there was hardly a breath of wind.

Just go with it. I hit good shots and you try not to think about the next hole. I hit a really good shot into 16 to a foot and then two good shots into 17 and made a nice putt.""Though Walker found the intermediate rough to the right off the tee at the uphill par-four 18th, he struck an eight-iron from there to 30 feet and sank the birdie putt.""I hit a great shot to the back of the green and made that long putt, so it was nice,"" Walker said.

4,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | PACIFIC PALISADES, California  PACIFIC PALISADES, California South Korea's Bae Sang-moon learned the value of patience at Riviera Country Club last year and used it to his advantage on Friday as he seized a one-shot lead at the Northern Trust Open.On another picture-perfect day of unbroken sunshine with barely a breath of wind in the Santa Monica Canyon, Bae fired a flawless five-under-par 66 to take control in the second round of the PGA Tour event.The 27-year-old from Daegu, who tied for eighth on his debut at the tournament last year, carefully plotted his way around a course that offers a variety of options for shot selection to post a nine-under total of 133.Australian Aaron Baddeley, champion here in 2011, birdied the last four holes for a 65 to finish at eight-under, level with American Robert Garrigus (67) who played in tricky afternoon conditions as the firming greens became bumpy.Charlie Beljan, beaten by fellow American John Merrick in a playoff for last year's title, was alone at seven-under after a 68 with first-round leader Dustin Johnson (70) among a group of four players a further stroke back.Play was suspended for the day due to darkness at 8:50 p.m. ET with six players yet to complete the second round. Among those, the closest to the lead was American Harold Varner III, at one-under after 16 holes.Bae, who clinched his maiden PGA Tour victory at last year's Byron Nelson Championship, liked the look of Riviera the very first time he saw the classic layout and has clearly enjoyed himself so far this week. ""I had really, really solid two rounds,"" the Korean told reporters after covering the back nine in three-under 33. ""I love this course. Bit hilly and greens (are) small, so (you) need really good driver and irons into the holes.""Not really easy, this course is very tricky. I always aim to focus on my game and just (stay) patient.""RIVIERA LESSONS Bae, whose joint eighth last year came despite a 76 in the third round, said his first tournament outing at Riviera had been a ""really, really good experience"". Asked what he had learned most from his debut last year, Bae replied: ""Patience, that's it. Patience is one of the strongest points of my game.""The long-hitting Johnson, whose one-stroke overnight lead held up when the delayed first round was completed earlier on Friday, was delighted to remain in contention for a ninth victory on the PGA Tour.""Very comfortable with how I'm playing,"" said Johnson, who had opened with a 66 on Thursday. ""I'm playing really well right now.""Rolling the putter really well, too, so I've got a lot of confidence with it. I'm three back going into the weekend, and if I keep playing like I am, I'm going to give it a good shot."" Red-hot American Jimmy Walker, who has already won three times on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, ended the day five strokes off the pace after following his opening 67 with a 71.""Didn't hit it great today but just kind of kept it right there and I had a good chance to shoot a good score,"" Walker said after offsetting four birdies with four bogeys.""It didn't really materialize there at the end. But definitely happy to be in a decent spot going into the weekend.""U.S. Open champion Justin Rose, playing his first event of the year after recovering from tendinitis in his right shoulder, was at even par after carding a 72, level with fellow Englishman Ian Poulter (70).The cut was set to fall at one-over-par 143 with American world number nine Matt Kuchar and former Riviera winners Charles Howell III, Mike Weir and Fred Couples among those certain to miss out.Kuchar carded a 75 on Friday to end a run of 30 consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour since he failed to qualify for the weekend at the 2012 PGA Championship.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by Gene Cherry/Ian Ransom)",2014-02-15,NTRS,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 9:46pm EST",Korean Bae takes sole command at Riviera,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSBREA1D1P820140215?type=companyNews

6,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | PACIFIC PALISADES, California  PACIFIC PALISADES, California Whatever happens in Sunday's final round of the Northern Trust Open, American Jason Allred will be able to celebrate a fairytale week of the unexpected at Riviera Country Club.A graduate of the nearby Pepperdine University, Allred is playing his first PGA Tour event since the 2010 U.S. Open, where he tied for 47th, after earning one of four spots in the Riviera field via Monday qualifying.Allred had decided to try to qualify for this week because he and his wife are expecting their third child at the end of the month and so far, so good.The 33-year-old has amazingly strung together scores of two-over-par 73, 64 and 67 to surge into a tie for fourth place at nine-under after 54 holes, just three strokes behind leader William McGirt.""This is somewhat of a new situation for me but I sure am having fun,"" Allred told reporters after posting a nine-under total of 204 on Saturday. It feels so good to be out there and have a blast. ""I told my wife a couple weeks ago, if I can look back on the week and say I really enjoyed it and stayed present in the moment, whatever happens I'll be proud of myself for that.""It's so special to be back in this Pepperdine area. Coach is one of my best friends in the world and he had a lot of the team out here today so just a really special treat to be here.""Allred, who worked as a whitewater rafting guide after college, was a member of the PGA Tour in 2005 and 2008 but has otherwise played most of his professional golf on the satellite circuits. His most significant achievements include winning the 1997 U.S. junior title and competing in the British Open (2005) and the U.S. Open (2006 and 2010). This week's experience at Riviera can certainly be added to that list.""Gosh, yesterday I happened to hit a great shot at 14 and I made a great putt there (from 25 feet) today,"" Allred said of the reaction he has earned from the supportive fans at Riviera over the past three days. ""And making the (par) putt on 18 today (from 14 feet) is probably the most excitement I felt from the crowd really ever in my career.""Asked how much his expectations had changed this week after rocketing from qualifying into contention for the title, he replied: ""It's totally blown them out of the water.""But you know what ... even when I go out to practise, whether it's to prepare for a Gateway tournament or this week, I still have that belief in me that I have it in me to win big golf tournaments.""At times, even I have had a hard time believing that over the years, but it sure is fun to be out here and be able to have a chance.""(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by Ian Ransom)",2014-02-16,NTRS,"Sat Feb 15, 2014 | 8:50pm EST",Allred's Cinderella story not yet over at Riviera,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-allred-idUSBREA1F01P20140216?type=companyNews
7,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | PACIFIC PALISADES, California  PACIFIC PALISADES, California Little known American William McGirt, seeking his first PGA Tour win, broke clear of a congested leaderboard to seize a two-shot lead in Saturday's third round of the Northern Trust Open.Two strokes off the pace when the delayed second round was completed earlier in the day, the 34-year-old journeyman took advantage of several favorable pin positions with superb all-round golf to fire a six-under-par 65.McGirt birdied five of his first six holes, then picked up three more shots in the first four holes after the turn on the way to a 12-under total of 201 in the PGA Tour event at a firm and fast-running Riviera Country Club.""Played really solid, hit a lot of good iron shots and good putts,"" McGirt told reporters after mixing eight birdies with two bogeys on a day of hazy sunshine and occasional cloud cover. ""Just one of those days you could see the line.""On the putting green, my stroke felt fast and I've been working hard trying to slow it down. Nothing felt good warming up, the putter didn't feel good and the swing really didn't feel good.""Maybe there's something to it,"" McGirt said with a broad grin. ""I hit a lot of good shots and starting out, the hole looked like a washtub. All in all, it was pretty good all day.""George McNeill, a double winner on the U.S. circuit, carded a 66 after eagling the par-five first to finish at 10 under, level with fellow American Charlie Beljan (68). Two more Americans, left-hander Brian Harman (68) and Monday qualifier Jason Allred (67), were a further stroke back in a tie for fourth.PACKED LEADERBOARD Eleven players were within four strokes of McGirt's lead, including former Masters champions Bubba Watson (64) and Charl Schwartzel (68), multiple PGA Tour winner Dustin Johnson (69) and 2013 PGA Tour rookie of the year Jordan Spieth (67). ""This is what we strive to do, have a chance on Sunday,"" American left-hander Watson said after piling up seven birdies in a bogey-free display to finish four off the pace. ""I'm looking for the back nine tomorrow, having a chance.""You don't want to come to the back nine going, 'Well, if I shoot 30, then I still don't have a chance to win.' I want that chance to win going into the back nine tomorrow.""South Korea's Bae Sang-moon began the third round with a one-stroke advantage and he maintained that with a birdie at the par-four first before falling back with bogeys at the fourth and eighth.Five players held at least a share of the lead early on before McGirt stormed three strokes in front with birdies at the 10th, 11th and 13th, where he sank a 10-footer. Though McGirt recorded a three-putt bogey at the 15th to slip back to 12 under, he parred the last three holes to preserve his two-stroke cushion atop a crowded leaderboard.McGirt, who has twice been a runner-up on the PGA Tour but had not made the cut at Riviera in his two previous starts, had a simple strategy in mind for Sunday's final round.""It's just 18 more holes and whatever is going to happen is going to happen,"" the 34-year-old said. ""All I can do is go out and play the best I can.""Asked to explain why he had flourished at Riviera this week after missing the cut in 2011 and 2013, McGirt replied: ""The big thing is the golf course is playing much faster and getting some run and the ball can carry.""It's probably 15 degrees warmer than I've played it here ... and so the ball is kind of chasing a little bit. That helps me out a bunch.""(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by Gene Cherry)",2014-02-16,NTRS,"Sat Feb 15, 2014 | 8:10pm EST",American McGirt grabs two-shot lead at Riviera,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-idUSBREA1E10S20140216?type=companyNews
8,"   By Mark Lamport-Stokes | PACIFIC PALISADES, California  PACIFIC PALISADES, California Bubba Watson was rewarded for his impressive early season form when he stormed to his first PGA Tour title since the 2012 Masters with a two-shot victory at the Northern Trust Open on Sunday.Four strokes off the pace going into the final round, the American left-hander seized control with five birdies in the first eight holes on the way to a flawless seven-under-par 64 at a sun-splashed Riviera Country Club.Watson, who has long relished playing at the revered venue despite never having posted a top-10 finish in seven previous starts, capped his round in style, rolling in a 14-foot birdie putt at the last to post a 15-under total of 269.""I am hitting the ball really well ... and it worked out this week,"" an elated Watson told CBS Sports after clinching his fifth PGA Tour title and the winner's check for $1.206 million.""Things are great right now,"" said the American, who went bogey-free at Riviera over the weekend as he fired successive 64s.Watson's final round was the lowest by a champion at Riviera since Doug Tewell's 63 in 1986 sealed a seven-shot victory.He came into the tournament having recorded two top-10s in his first four starts on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, his best finish a tie for second at the Phoenix Open earlier this month.""Today, I got hot early, holed a bunker shot on six to really get it going and went bogey-free in the last round,"" said Watson. ""I was looking at: 'There's a number out there and I'm going to shoot it. I have to shoot it and I have to go out there and play good golf'.""You're always looking at trying to beat the golf course first, so that was my goal,"" said the American, who was embraced after the round by his wife Angie and their son Caleb, who will celebrate his second birthday in two weeks' time.Long-hitting American Dustin Johnson, one of four players who held at least a share of the lead during Sunday's final round at Riviera, closed with a five-birdie 66 to finish alone in second.Monday qualifier Jason Allred and fellow American Brian Harman signed off with 68s to share third place at 12-under, a stroke better than 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa, who also carded a 68. MAINTAINED ADVANTAGE American journeyman William McGirt, bidding for his first PGA Tour victory, began the last day with a two-shot lead but slid back with a 73 to finish five strokes behind Watson.McGirt had maintained his overnight advantage with a comfortable two-putt birdie at the par-five first, the easiest hole on the course.However, he stumbled with a bogey at the tricky par-four second, where his approach ended up just short of the green before he ran his first putt nine feet past the hole. On a course running fast and firm under a dazzling sun, several of McGirt's closest pursuers began to pile on the heat and, for a while, four players were tied at the top at 12-under: McGirt, Watson, Harman and Schwartzel.Watson, who had holed out from a greenside bunker to birdie the sixth, broke the deadlock by draining a 16-footer to birdie the par-four eighth before reaching the turn in a blistering five-under 30.The American left-hander, who made the cut by just two shots after scores of 70 and 71 before charging up the leaderboard with a sizzling 64 in the third round, then forged two strokes clear with a birdie at the par-five 11th.Watson did well to par the treacherous 12th, where he sank an eight-foot putt, before Johnson trimmed his lead to just one with a birdie at the 15th.Watson refused to buckle and held on to secure victory with pars on the next five holes before collecting his seventh birdie of the day at the par-four 18th.""He must be hitting the ball great and be in great control of his golf ball because the golf course, the greens, are really firm,"" Schwartzel said of Watson's performance. ""It's difficult.

This equates to a 0.73% return on average assets (ROA), which is  modestly higher than the 0.68% ROA in the sequential fourth quarter of 2013  (4Q13) and unchanged relative to the year-ago first quarter of 2013 (1Q13) ROA  of 0.73%. Additionally, the 1Q'14 results equate to a 9.28% return on average  equity (ROE). Fitch views the ROSE as satisfactory from a credit perspective but  below the company's long-term averages and Fitch's estimate of NTRS' long-term  cost of equity. NTRS' total revenue expanded 7% from the year-ago quarter and was flat relative  to the sequential quarter. Fitch believes the year-over-year revenue expansion  is largely reflective of higher equity markets over the course of the last 12  months, partially helped by some new business wins. The relatively flat  sequential revenue Fitch views as largely due to flat markets over the first  three months of 2013 as well as relatively higher money market fee waivers given  the protracted low short-term interest rate environment. NTRS net interest income (NII) grew 9% relative to the year-ago quarter given  balance sheet growth amid continued deposit inflows over the course of the year.  On a sequential basis NII declined 2% due to very modestly lower deposit levels  and some continued compression on asset yields due in part to less of a benefit  from slower premium amortization on mortgage backed securities (MBS). The  company's net interest margin (NIM) of 1.12% was 3 basis points below the  year-ago quarter's NIM and unchanged relative to the sequential quarter's NIM. Fitch continues to view NTRS' low NIM as reflective of a very conservative  balance sheet posture as the company continues to refrain from reaching for  incremental yield in its large securities portfolio. However, this posture,  while favorable from a credit perspective, also constrains the company's  earnings performance. Fitch would not expect a meaningful pick-up in earnings  growth for NTRS until short-term interest rates rise at some point, as this  would improve the company's NII and also alleviate the money market fee waivers  that are currently being incurred. Non-interest expense grew 5% from the year ago quarter and declined 3% from the  sequential quarter. The year-over-year growth is primarily due to higher  compensation, benefits, outside services and equipment expenses. The sequential  decline is more mixed as modest growth in compensation, benefits, and equipment  expenses were offset by a reduction in other expenses, which was in part due to  a $19.2 million litigation charge recorded in 4Q13. As noted above, NTRS' low risk balance sheet continues to be one of the key  factors for the company's strong ratings. This was also supported by the Federal  Reserve recently not objecting to NTRS capital plan under CCAR, which included  increasing the dividend to $0.33 per share from $0.31 per share and allowing for  $425 million of share repurchases through March 2015. Fitch views NTRS' capital position as sound, particularly given the company's  balance sheet positioning noted above. NTRS estimates that its fully phased in  Basel III Tier 1 Common (CET1) ratio as of the end of 1Q'14 would be 11.1% under  the advanced approach and 11.7% under the standardized approach.

12,"  While Tiger Woods mainly struggled in his first competitive round in three months, Australian Greg Chalmers birdied his last three holes to seize control of the Quicken Loans National in Bethesda, Maryland on Thursday.Chalmers, at the age of 40 still seeking his first victory on the PGA Tour, fired a five-under-par 66 on a difficult Congressional Country Club layout bristling with thick rough to take a one-shot lead in the opening round.The Australian left-hander picked up three shots in his first nine holes after teeing off at the par-three 10th, then bogeyed the second before ending his round in style with birdies at the seventh, eighth and ninth.That left Chalmers a stroke in front of long-hitting American Ricky Barnes and Swede Fredrik Jacobson, who carded matching 67s.""I really drove the ball well, probably the best I have driven it all year,"" Chalmers told PGA Tour Radio. ""That kind of set up the rest of the round, and finishing with three straight birdies is always nice.""Chalmers, who has twice finished second on the PGA Tour during his career, felt he was very fortunate to escape with pars on the only two occasions when he missed the fairway by more than a couple of feet off the tee, at the third and fourth.""It's nasty,"" he said of the lush rough at Congressional. ""I drove it in the rough twice, on my 12 and 13th holes, and I had real trouble. I had to lay it up and luckily I got them up and down (for par). ""You just have to be coming out of the fairway here (with second shots), and I did do that the majority of the time today.""TITLE DEFENSE Defending champion Bill Haas launched his title defense with a 68, ending the day level with fellow Americans Patrick Reed and Erik Compton, and South African Tyrone Van Aswegen. Eight players, including twice former U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa and South Korean K.J. Choi, were knotted on 69.Woods, playing in a high-profile grouping with compatriot Jordan Spieth and Australian Jason Day, initially looked rusty and struggled with seven bogeys in his first 12 holes before recording three birdies in his last six to shoot a 74.""I made so many little mistakes,"" Woods, who had surgery to repair a pinched nerve in his back in March, told reporters after finishing the round tied for 83rd in a field of 120. ""But I played a lot better than the score indicated, which is good. ""The hard part was just getting into the rhythm of playing competitively. You play with your buddies all day for cash and stuff but it's just not the same. It's not the same as tournament golf, different level.""Woods' playing partners also failed to break par in the tough scoring conditions, Spieth carding a 74 and Day signing for a 73.""It was a great group,"" said Woods, whose opening 74 was also matched by U.S. Open champion Justin Rose of England and reigning PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner.""Unfortunately, we didn't see a lot of each other on the front nine.

14,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 16 (Fitch) Northern Trust Corporation (Northern) second quarter  2014 (2Q'14) net income of $181.9 million was flat relative to the sequential  quarter and down compared to the year-ago quarter.  It is noteworthy, however,  that Northern's 2Q'14 earnings did include a pre-tax charge of $42.3 million for  severance costs and software write-offs, as Northern continues to look for  incremental ways to reduce costs amidst the challenging operating environment. These stated results equated to a 9.18% return on average equity (ROE) in 2Q'14,  compared to 9.28% in the sequential quarter and 10.2% in the year-ago quarter.   Fitch continues to note that these results remain satisfactory from a credit  perspective, but below the company's long-term averages and Fitch's estimate of  Northern's long-term cost of equity. Northern's total revenue was up 4% versus to the sequential quarter and 6%  relative to the year-ago quarter as growth in fee income from higher equity  markets globally and some new business wins were offset by continued weakness in  market-based revenue such as foreign exchange (FX) trading and securities  lending income. Fitch had expected this given still strong equity markets and  very low volatility in foreign exchange markets. The company's expenses for 2Q'14 climbed 6% sequentially and 11% from the  year-ago quarter, indicating some negative operating leverage in both periods.   The higher level of expenses has been primarily driven by higher compensation  expense and increased technology expense.  As a result, Fitch is not overly  surprised by the pre-tax charge noted above, since as long as the interest rate  environment remains low Northern may have to become more aggressive in managing  its expense base. Northern's net interest income (NII) remains a key component of the company's  earnings profile at 23% of overall revenue in 2Q'14.  Given the company's  conservative posture and short balance sheet duration, the company's net  interest margin (NIM) declined to 1.04% in 2Q'14.  This is largely due to  incremental deposit balances being placed at the Federal Reserve, which earn a  mere 25 basis points. Fitch believes that in a rising short-term interest rate environment, whenever  that may occur, Northern's NII has the potential to expand significantly and  therefore drive earnings growth.  In this type of scenario NII should become a  much bigger piece of the overall revenue profile as well. Fitch continues to view Northern's credit quality as sound, but does note that  credit metrics are likely at a cyclical trough.  Over time, Fitch would expect  some reversion in these metrics but given Northern's conservative underwriting,  would expect its credit metrics to remain well below industry averages. Fitch continues to view Northern's funding profile and capitalization as sound.   Deposits now constitute 67% of Northern's total liabilities and the company's  Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio under both the standardized and advanced  approach was 12.7% at 2Q1'4.  Fitch views this strong capital position, combined  with the company's relative low risk balance sheet, as key differentiators that  support Northern's high ratings.

18,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Bank of  New York Mellon Corporation (BONY) at  'AA-', Northern Trust Corporation (Northern) at 'AA-', and Brown Brothers  Harriman (BBH) at 'A+'.  The Rating Outlook for BONY, Northern, and Brown Brothers remains Stable.  In addition, Fitch has upgraded the ratings for State Street Corporation (State  Street) to 'AA-' from 'A+', and revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from  Positive.  These ratings actions were taking in conjunction with Fitch's U.S. trust and  processing bank peer review.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VR, AND Senior Debt Today's rating actions equalizes the ratings of the largest standalone trust and  processing banks (trust banks) in the United States at 'AA-/F1+'. Brown  Brothers, a privately held partnership, remains one notch lower at 'A+/F1' given  its smaller scale and comparatively less financial flexibility than the larger,  publicly traded companies. The upgrade of State Street's ratings and Outlook revision reflects the  company's improved and more seasoned risk management practices and procedures,  continued relatively conservative overall balance sheet posture, and continued  efforts in streamlining its business, which Fitch believes will lead to more  significant positive operating leverage in a higher short-term interest rate  environment. The high ratings for all the trust banks noted above reflect business models  with high barriers to entry and sticky customer relationships, which would be  extremely difficult for a new entrant into the marketplace to replicate.  Furthermore, the strong franchises of the trust banks are further supported by a  sound funding profile, consisting mainly of core custody deposits, strong  capital ratios supporting comparatively low risk balance sheets, and good asset  quality metrics. Further, while there has been significant pressure on these firms' results amid  the protracted low interest rate environment coupled with a period of extremely  low volatility, these firms' returns on equity (ROE) have still remained  satisfactory from a credit perspective at around 10% on average, though these  results are below the trust banks (excluding Brown Brothers, whose returns  remain relatively good) long-term averages and Fitch's long-term cost of equity  assumption for the trust banks of between 12% to 15%. Fitch believes these  company's current level of operating performance amid the difficult market and  interest rate environment of the last several years, indicates a significant  amount of resiliency in the trust bank business model. While the resiliency of the business model is in part due to high barriers to  entry noted above, which has resulted in a somewhat oligopolistic industry, the  trust banks have not benefited from pricing power which one would think given  the competitive positioning of the industry. Rather, those with the lower cost  operating model can typically achieve greater scale, which can lead to more  aggressive pricing, though also outsize returns for the low-cost provider. As such, each firm has had a laser focus on managing its expense base over the  last few years. This has included optimizing each firm's respective workforce as  well as improving efficiencies and streamlining operations through significant  technology investments. While the results to date have been mixed, as much of  the expense savings noted above have been offset by significant additional  expenditures on regulatory and compliance functions and personnel, Fitch  believes that the groundwork for good positive operating leverage has been laid  for each of the firms. To wit, the trust banks are very sensitive to higher short-term interest rates,  whenever that may occur, as well as higher volatility, particularly in the  foreign exchange (FX) markets. As such, Fitch expects a meaningful acceleration  in each of the trust bank's earnings once some of the regulatory and compliance  costs the firms are currently incurring level-off, and as soon as the companies  begin to benefit from higher short-term interest rates or increased FX  volatility, or both simultaneously. This eventual earnings acceleration should  boost ROEs back to historical levels and in line with Fitch's cost of equity  assumptions and is embedded with Fitch's Stable Rating Outlook on the trust  banks. Offsetting the strengths noted above is an elevated level of operational risk  inherent in the trust bank's business models, which serves as limiting factor  for upwards rating momentum.  To this end, Fitch believes that the main threat to each firm's business model  and ratings would result from a large technological mishap or operational loss  that is idiosyncratic to one company resulting in reputational damage causing  clients to flee the firm. Fitch does believe these risks are well monitored and  controlled, but also acknowledges that they are inherently difficult to predict  and quantify. As such, a large occurrence at any one firm would likely prompt  Fitch to review ratings to determine if a negative rating action was appropriate An industry wide event that causes a significant operational loss that affects  each firm equally may still impact ratings, but may also allow each firm to  better maintain its client base. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR, AND SENIOR DEBT With today's actions, Fitch now believes that the trust bank's ratings are  solidly situated at their current rating levels and Stable Rating Outlooks. However, it is possible that over a very long-term time horizon there is some  potential upside to Brown Brother's ratings. This could be predicated on  increasing scale and revenue diversity, particularly through increasing the  revenue contribution from the asset management segment. In addition to the operational risks noted earlier in this release, there are  some key risks from currently evolving regulatory changes that could impact the  trust banks and their rates. The most significant on the horizon is the proposed regulatory changes regarding  the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) in the U.S. for both BONY and State  Street. Given their smaller size, Northern and Brown Brothers are not subject to  the SLR. The SLR requires a leverage ratio of 5% at the holding company and 6%  at the main bank subsidiary for each firm. While Fitch believes that each firm will be in compliance with SLR requirements  when they are finalized and come into practice, given the countercyclical nature  of some of the deposit flows to BONY and State Street during periods of market  stress, each firm has the risk of falling below their SLR minimums in such a  scenario. There is still a small possibility that the rule could be altered to give relief  to the companies during times of market stress. The companies are also looking  at alternative mechanisms or structures to move deposits off-balance sheet into  money funds or other vehicles to help manage the SLR. To the extent that these  strategies cause unintended increases in risk to the respective balance sheets  could also impact ratings. Further, additional regulation including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net  Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), Basel III operational risk weightings, and  potential minimum debt requirements, while all aimed at reducing explicit risks  to various stakeholders, also has the potential to create unintended risks,  which Fitch will evaluate over time for any risks created. For example, should some of the regulation noted above force firms to divest  themselves of core businesses or move away from core competencies such that it  negatively impacts the franchise, could be a negative ratings driver over time. Ratings for BONY and State Street are highly sensitive to Fitch's ultimate  position on potential minimum debt requirements, which were published in a paper  on March 27, 2014 titled 'U.S. Bank HoldCos & OpCos:  Evolving Risk Profiles'.  This paper indicated that Fitch could decide to notch key banking subsidiaries  from holding companies (either the holding company is downgraded or the bank  level subsidiary is upgraded) should Fitch determine proposed minimum debt  requirements along with the FDIC's Orderly Liquidation Authority changes the  risk profiles of the two entities. Fitch would also note that it considers various market risks on the trust banks  and has complied a stress test on the company's earnings which include scenarios  such as a simultaneous 40% decline in equity markets, 5% decline in fixed income  markets, and interest rates remaining flat at today's current low levels. In  this scenario, Fitch believes that each firm's annual earnings should remain  around break-even or at a modest loss incorporating very large litigation  charges in the stress. Fitch believes this result adds support to each firm's  ratings and Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATINGS (SR) AND SUPPORT FLOOR  RATINGS (SRF) BONY and State Streets' current SRs and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation that  there remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government  (rated 'AAA'; Outlook Stable by Fitch) if required. This expectation reflects  the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its  strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain.  Specific to BONY and State Street our view of support likelihood is based mostly  on their systemic importance in the U.S., their global interconnectedness given  their size and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market  share and their positions as key providers of financial services to the U.S.  economy. BONY and State Street's IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit  from support because their VRs are all above their SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. The SRs and SRFs are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance. Fitch expects the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term. However, regardless of  its finalization, Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues  to be made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise  BONY and State Street's SRs to '5' and SRFs to 'No Floor' within the next one to  two years; likely to be some point in late 2014 or in 1H15.  Absent a material in change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone  credit profiles a revision of the SRFs to 'No Floor' would mean no change to  BONY or State Street's Long-term IDRs and debt ratings because their viability  ratings are all above their SRFs. Northern and Brown Brothers already have SR's of '5' and SRF's of 'No Floor' and  are not designated G-SIFIs so would not likely have a potential minimum debt  requirement. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG AND SHORT TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The trust bank's uninsured deposit ratings at the subsidiary banks are rated one  notch higher than the company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S.  uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference  gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by the trust banks and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in the company's IDR. This  means that should a Long-term IDR be downgraded, deposit ratings could be  similarly impacted.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by the trust banks and by  various issuing vehicles are all notched down from the holding company or its  bank subsidiaries' VRs in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each  instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profiles. BONY, Northern, and Brown Brothers' subordinated debt has been  affirmed due to the affirmation of those companies VRs. State Street's  subordinated debt has been upgraded in concert with the upgrade of the company's  VR. VR's. Ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs, where the notching  would be realigned in conjunction with any change in the VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of BONY, State Street, and Northern are equalized with those  ratings of its operating companies and banks, reflecting its role as the bank  holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength  for its bank subsidiaries. All have modest double leverage. Should any of the holding companies become under-capitalized or have cash flow  coverage of less than 18 months to meet obligations, there is the potential that  Fitch could notch the holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the  operating companies.  Brown Brothers does not have a holding company structure. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY RATING The IDRs and VRs of the trust banks' bank subsidiaries are core to each  company's business and therefore IDRs and VRs are equalized across the group. Ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of the associated bank  subsidiaries.  Fitch would also note that the ratings of any foreign bank subsidiaries could  change (be downgraded) should there be a change in the foreign country ceiling  rating in a particular geography.

27,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 22 (Fitch) Northern Trust Corporation's (Northern) third  quarter 2014 (3Q'14) results were relatively flat compared to the year-ago  quarter, but did improve relative to the sequential quarter, according to Fitch  Ratings.  The company's return on average equity (ROE) clocked in at 10.09% in  3Q'14, down from 10.64% in the year-ago quarter and up from 9.18% in the  sequential quarter. Fitch continues to view Northern's results as satisfactory from a credit  perspective, but below both the company's long-term averages and Fitch's  estimated cost of equity for the company of between 10%-12%. Overall revenue growth for Northern remains challenging.  Relative to the  year-ago quarter revenue expanded by 3%, but was flat compared with the  sequential quarter. Fitch would note, however, that the year-ago quarter did  include a gain on a real estate sale, which if excluded would indicate 6% year  over year growth. Core trust and servicing revenue grew 11% from the year-ago quarter and 2%  relative to the sequential quarter amid still strong global equity markets and  some new business wins.  This growth continues to be largely offset by weakness  in market based revenue such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending  income. The company's net interest income (NII) grew 5% relative to the year-ago quarter  and 1% relative to the sequential quarter largely driven by lower interest  expense.  This was due in part due to a greater preponderance of non-interest  bearing demand deposits in the company's funding profile.  The company's net  interest margin (NIM) remained relatively stable. Given the revenue environment noted above, Northern continues to focus on  expense management as a key lever management can use to improve earnings.  While  expenses did increase by 5% relative to the year-ago quarter indicating some  negative operating leverage, they did decrease by 4% relative to the sequential  quarter.  This decrease was attributable to lower compensation expense due to  higher severance in the sequential quarter and some lower technology spend as  well. Fitch would continue to expect Northern to try to hold the line on expenses,  though notes that it may be difficult given continued increases in regulatory  and compliance costs as well as supporting the company's growth initiatives. Northern's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio remained strong, in  Fitch's opinion, and given the company's low risk balance sheet is a key ratings  strength of the company.  Northern's transitionally phased-in Basel III CET1  ratio under the Advanced Approach was 12.7% and phased-in standardized approach  was 12.8%, and Fitch notes that the company exited its parallel run period in  2Q'14.   Given this, the Advanced Approach ratio would be Northern's binding constraint,  which given its business model, Fitch believes to contain a substantial  component of operational risk weighted assets. Additionally, Northern bought back $77 million of shares in 3Q'14, and Fitch  would expect additional buybacks over the next couple of quarters.

30,"   By Chris Vellacott | LONDON  LONDON Japanese and European assets, much maligned after a run of sluggish growth, could perform well in 2015, a top money manager said, though a rising dollar could bury the gains for U.S. investors.Wayne Bowers, head of asset management for EMEA and Asia at Northern Trust, said European markets could defy the ""structural pessimism"" of many investors, with central bank stimulus lifting asset prices even if the economic impact takes many months to filter through.Low energy prices and a weaker euro EUR= -- making the region's exports more competitive -- could also lift sentiment, Bowers said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit on Monday.On Japan, Bowers said that though economic data makes grim reading, cheap money and low bond yields mean it is still easy for Japan to service high levels of public debt while expansionist monetary policies will continue to lift markets.The fact that the bulk of Japanese government bonds are held by domestic investors means the public debt burden is more manageable than if it were exposed to international markets, he said. ""They can still sell Japanese government bonds on a very regular basis, not only to themselves through the QE (Quantitative Easing) program but to the pension fund community and to the retail saving community,"" he said.Bowers' comments come after Japan reported that its economy slipped into recession in July-September, shrinking by an annualized 1.6 percent and surprising economists who had forecast growth.However, while European and Japanese equities may be poised for gains next year, Bowers said he recommends an ""underweight to neutral"" stance on both regions for dollar investors compared with an overweight position in U.S. equities. A rising U.S. dollar will most likely snuff out returns from holdings elsewhere, he argues. He is underweight investment-grade bonds and overweight high-yield bonds. Bowers said he remains negative on emerging markets, having been ""disappointed"" to find many failing ""to take more ownership"" of their economic fortunes, remaining dependent on the stimulus spilling over from U.S. monetary stimulus.He is also gloomy on Russia where policy regarding Ukraine appears to be driven by political aims with little regard for the economic impact. On Britain, which holds elections in 2015 that could eventually lead to a referendum on leaving the European Union, Bowers said he does not expect a political shock.""At the moment it is popular to suggest that the UK would do better outside the European Union ...

32,"  Greg Chalmers won the Australian PGA Championship on Sunday after a dramatic three-way playoff with Adam Scott and Wade Ormsby.Chalmers clinched the title for the second time in his career when he safely parred the seventh extra hole and Scott three-putted for bogey after the trio had finished the fourth round tied at 11-under-par.Replaying the par-4 18th hole over and over again, Ormsby missed a four-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole that would have won him the championship.Ormsby was then eliminated from the playoff on the third extra hole when Scott and Chalmers both made birdies and he missed with his third shot, a chip from just off the green.Scott and Chalmers then proceeded to par the 430 meters (470 yards) hole three more times before Scott three-putted from less than 30 feet to hand the 41-year-old Chalmers his 10th professional title.Scott and Ormsby had started the final day in a three-way tie for the lead with Scott Strange and both shot final rounds of 71 to join the left-handed Chalmers at the top of the leaderboard after he closed with a brilliant eight-under-par 64. Chalmers made eight birdies in a flawless round that featured two monster putts in excess of 50 feet. The 2011 Australian PGA champion hit 16 greens in regulation and took only 26 putts for the round.Scott, defending the title he won last year at the Royal Pines Resort on Queensland's Gold Coast near where he was raised, found himself trailing Chalmers by a shot with four holes to play in regulation. The 2013 Masters champion drew level when he birdied the par-5 15th. The 34-year-old played the par-5s in 15-under for the tournament but struggled with the flat stick.He missed long birdie putts on the 16th and 17th holes and finished level with Chalmers and Ormsby, who won his first professional title in India last year.Scott and Ormsby played together as juniors and remain good friends with Ormsby staying at Scott's Gold Coast home during the tournament. Ormsby sank a long birdie putt on the 18th to get into the playoff but blew his chance to win when he lipped out after hitting his approach from a fairway bunker to within four feet of the pin.New Zealand's Michael Hendry closed with a 71 to finish fourth at nine-under, one stroke ahead of American Scott Stallings (71) and two clear of Boo Weekly (74) of the United States.

33,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 21 (Fitch) Northern Trust Corporation's (Northern) fourth  quarter 2014 (4Q'14) net income was $244 million, which equated to a return on  average common equity (ROE) of 11.5%. Fitch Ratings notes that this includes  $9.5 million income tax benefit related to Northern's decision to reinvest the  pre-tax earnings of a foreign tax subsidiary indefinitely outside the U.S. Excluding this income tax benefit would imply net income of $234 million and an  ROE of 11%, which Fitch would still note that is a better result than many of  the company's prior quarters. Northern drove positive operating leverage relative to the sequential and  year-ago quarter. Total revenue in 4Q'14 grew 8% year-over-year, while expenses  declined by 2 percentage points. Similarly total revenue in 4Q'14 grew 5%  relative to the sequential quarter, while expenses only climbed 1%. The revenue improvement relative to both the sequential and year-ago quarters  was driven by higher foreign exchange (FX) trading revenue in 4Q'14 amid higher  FX volatility. Additionally there was also a significant improvement in  securities commissions and trading income. Fitch would continue to note that  these market based revenues while having been weak for a number of quarters, can  be volatile. Trust, investment, and other servicing fees increase 8% relative to the year ago  quarter and 1% relative to the sequential quarter due to a mix of higher equity  markets and some new business wins.  Northern's total assets under custody (AUC) now amount to $5.96 trillion, 1%  higher than the sequential quarter and 7% higher than the year ago quarter.  Similarly, Northern's total assets under management (AUM) amount to $934.1  billion, up 1% from the sequential quarter and 6% from the year-ago quarter. Expense management continues to be an area of focus for Northern, as well as  many other banks. In general, while the company's compensation increased in  4Q'14 both sequentially and relative to year-over-year comparisons, it grew less  than revenue. Additionally Northern was able to squeeze some savings of its  employee benefits expense as well. Fitch would expect Northern to continue to try to manage expense growth to be  less than revenue, particularly in quarters where it doesn't have as great a  benefit from market based revenues. Northern's capital ratios remain strong for the risk of the company's balance  sheet, and help to support the company's strong ratings, in Fitch's opinion. As  of 4Q'14, Northern's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 12.4%. Contact: Justin Fuller, CFA Senior Director  +1-312-368-2057 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

60,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and Short-Term  Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) and its  subsidiaries at 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively. NTRS' Viability Rating (VR) has  also been affirmed at 'aa-'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable.  These rating actions were taken in conjunction with Fitch's U.S. trust and  processing bank peer review. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS VR, IDR, AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT The affirmation of NTRS' IDR and VR reflects the company's continued solid  operating performance, its conservative risk appetite, and a sound capital  profile in the context of what Fitch views as a low risk balance sheet. Like the other trust and processing banks, NTRS' ratings benefit from a business  model that possesses high barriers to entry and supports strong customer  relationships due to large fixed technology costs and high switching costs.  Fitch believes NTRS has established a strong franchise in asset custody and  wealth management, which has created a good competitive position for the company  and supports its high ratings. NTRS' conservative risk profile and balance sheet are a key tenet of the  company's rating, according to Fitch. The majority of the company's securities  portfolio is composed of U.S. government and agencies securities, and nearly 90%  of the portfolio carries an 'AAA' rating. Additionally, NTRS' balance sheet has  a large cash position and a loan portfolio with strong credit metrics. To this  end, Fitch notes that net charge-offs (NCOs) have been just 6 basis points (bps)  of average loans during each of the past two years and were 3bps of average  loans during the first quarter of 2016 (1Q16). Fitch believes NTRS' management  team has been responsible for cultivating the company's conservative risk  culture over many years, which is a key ratings differentiator relative to many  other financial institutions. Fitch considers NTRS' capital levels to be well situated relative to peer  institutions, with Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 under the standardized  approach of 10.6% at the end of 1Q16. While there has been a modest decline in  NTRS' capital ratios during recent years, Fitch notes that this has largely been  driven by deposit inflows which have caused the balance sheet to expand. That  said, these incremental deposits continue to be invested very conservatively. Despite the continued headwinds of a low interest rate environment, NTRS'  earnings have remained satisfactory from a credit perspective, but below the  company's long-term averages. To combat pressure from low interest rates,  management has initiated several expense management measures to improve  efficiency, along with reviewing custody relationship pricing to better align  revenues and costs in the core business. Some current investment initiatives  related to information technology (IT) and regulatory and compliance staffing  have elevated non-interest expense. Fitch notes that some of the IT investments  should improve efficiency in the long run, thereby helping to position the  company for meaningful operating leverage in the future. Though returns are still somewhat lower than pre-crisis levels, fees from  custody and asset management continue to grow as a result of upward global  equity market valuations over the past few years along with some new business  wins and the aforementioned repricing initiatives. Fees from foreign exchange  trading remain volatile and securities lending remains challenged. Due to NTRS'  short-term asset mix, Fitch believes NTRS' earnings have potential to show  meaningful improvement if short-term interest rates continue to rise. At this juncture, Fitch does not expect the affirmative BREXIT vote to overly  impact NTRS' business though Fitch does note it may change the way that it  conducts business with some of its foreign clients. Finally, Fitch considers NTRS' funding profile strong with deposits accounting  for approximately 89% of liabilities. Fitch views NTRS' custody deposits to be  core in nature given the stickiness of these relationships. Additionally, Fitch  believes NTRS' deposits to be somewhat countercyclical, such that deposit  inflows tend to occur during times of market stress. As noted above, deposit growth continued to be strong through the end of 1Q16,  with $97.7 billion of total deposits, compared to $84.1 billion at year-end  2013. NTRS has continued to place these deposits at a mix of highly rated  financial institutions, at the Federal Reserve, in its securities book, and to a  lesser extent in the loan portfolio. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR NTRS' Support Rating (SR) of '5' reflects Fitch's view that external support  cannot be relied upon. The Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'No Floor' reflects  Fitch's view that there is no reasonable assumption that U.S. government support  would be forthcoming to NTRS. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID INSTRUMENTS NTRS' subordinated debt rating is notched one level below its VR of 'aa-' while  NTRS' preferred stock rating is notched five levels below its VR. These ratings  are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments'  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles. Thus, these ratings have been  affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS  The uninsured deposit ratings for the Northern Trust Company are one notch  higher than NTRS' IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits  benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit  liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY The IDR and VR of NTRS are equalized with those of the operating company, the  Northern Trust Company, reflecting its role as a bank holding company, which is  mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiary. RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDR, AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT Fitch views NTRS' VR as currently well situated, with limited potential for  upward movement given the already high level of ratings. Upward rating momentum  is limited by elevated operational risk inherent in the trust and processing  bank business model. Current ratings incorporate a view of the potential for  positive earnings momentum that produces earnings metrics closer to pre-crisis  levels.  Fitch believes the most significant risk to NTRS is a large operational or  technological event that causes significant reputational damage and causes  clients to leave the firm. NTRS has a good track record of performance and  minimal operational losses, and Fitch considers these risks to be well managed.  That said, negative rating action could be driven by an operational loss or  similar event result in a fine, loss, or revenue reduction equivalent to 5% of  annual revenue or more. Finally, Fitch also notes that NTRS and its peer trust and processing banks are  beginning to be at risk of certain technology potentially being disruptive to  its business, though this is likely over a very long-term time horizon.  Blockchain, or distributed ledger, is an electronic means of settling,  reconciling, and reporting on transaction--the core of NTRS and its peer banks'  businesses.   While Fitch believes that it is highly probable that NTRS and its peer trust and  processing banks jointly work to harness this technology to drive efficiencies  across their respective platforms, it's also possible that over a long period of  time a technology company offers a blockchain solution that causes clients to  leave NTRS for their core custody business.  At present, Fitch views this risk  as well outside of the Rating Outlook horizon. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change in  the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, Fitch views  this as highly unlikely. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID INSTRUMENTS  The ratings for NTRS and its operating company's subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change in NTRS' VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS  The long- and short-term deposit ratings for the Northern Trust Company are  sensitive to any change to NTRS' Long- and Short-Term IDR. HOLDING COMPANY Fitch could notch the holding company's ratings from the operating company's  ratings if holding company liquidity were to deteriorate, and raise concerns  relative to the parent's ability to meet its obligations.
