0,"   By Clare Baldwin and John Ruwitch | ZHENGZHOU, China  ZHENGZHOU, China Asia's top mergers and acquisitions bankers gathered two years ago at the swanky Island Shangri La in Hong Kong to celebrate the top deals of 2012. As the transactions were being toasted, one was unraveling.Advisers on Caterpillar Inc's $677 million purchase of ERA Mining Machinery Ltd picked up an award for cross-border deal of the year. The purchase was billed as a coup for Caterpillar, the world's top maker of tractors and excavators. ERA was the holding company for Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical & Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Co Ltd, one of China's biggest makers of hydraulic coal-mine roof supports. Siwei would help Caterpillar gain traction in the world's largest coal industry.""Siwei was going to be our Chinese business card,"" said a person with direct knowledge of Caterpillar's strategy.The night of the awards on November 16 three Caterpillar lawyers were wrapping up an eight-hour grilling of Wang Fu, Siwei's chairman. Major accounting problems had been unearthed at Siwei headquarters in the gritty Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Two months later, on January 18, 2013, Caterpillar said it had discovered ""deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct"" at Siwei.Wang was sacked. Caterpillar took a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $580 million - 86 percent of the value of the deal. The company says it was caught unaware by the problems at Siwei and only discovered them in November 2012, five months after the deal closed.A Reuters review of hundreds of pages of public documents, as well as interviews with former employees, board members, bankers and advisers, reveals a more complex story. Accounting problems were rampant at Siwei before Caterpillar bought it. Yet at multiple junctures, Caterpillar chose to ignore existing or potential problems and push ahead with the deal.A year and a half after directors of the Peoria, Illinois-based company signed off on the deal, it has become a case study in how a foreign company with decades of experience in China can still flounder in that market. It also shows how willing some multinationals are to accept risks they might otherwise avoid to establish themselves in the world's second-largest economy.The deal has triggered legal action against Caterpillar. In May, Caterpillar announced it had settled a dispute with Siwei's controlling shareholder, owned by an heir to the Crown Worldwide logistics company fortune and the former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Four shareholder suits filed in the United States in Caterpillar's home state of Illinois are continuing.Meanwhile, Siwei has foundered. Former employees told Reuters that as of September, the company had no new orders in 2013, and it had fired or furloughed about half of its workforce.Siwei's former CEO, Wang, says his books were a mess but he committed no wrongdoing.""We were a legend in the industry,"" Wang, 52, told Reuters, in his first media interview since the announcement of the write-off. Wang is now pursuing a second act: He has launched a new company with a nearly identical name in the same business. He has yet to build a factory, but says he can take Siwei's old customers when he does.BECOMING A CHINESE MANUFACTURER When it bought Siwei, Caterpillar had been doing business in China for more than 30 years. It had amassed 20,000 China employees, dozens of manufacturing, research, logistics and parts centers and a broad dealer network. It had nine new facilities under construction, and had just completed the $8.8 billion purchase of Bucyrus, a mining and earth-moving company with significant China operations.When former Chinese president Hu Jintao dined with a group of American businessmen in 2011, Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman was included.But the company was slow to ramp up production of construction machinery in China and lost out on market share as a result, says Anthony Farmer, a former executive at Caterpillar. It didn't want to make the same mistake in coal mining equipment.China's coal industry is the largest in the world, but it also insular. Local companies, particularly state-owned enterprises, prefer locally made products, said Farmer, now at construction and mining consultancy Millton Group.Siwei was attractive. It once was state-owned, but no longer. That, and the fact that it was listed in Hong Kong - under the name of ERA - made it much easier for a foreign company to buy.Moreover, the roof supports it made - spatula-like hydraulic arms that keep underground coal mines from collapsing - were lucrative, since 80 percent of China's mines are underground.Siwei retained close ties to the government. In 2012 alone, it was visited twice by the Communist Party leader of Zhengzhou.AMERICAN CONNECTIONS Adding to the appeal, Siwei also had three high-profile investors with American ties.Li Rubo, an American-trained mining engineer and an early Siwei investor, had arranged mining deals in Russia and Mongolia - sensitive undertakings that would have required political connections.Emory Williams, an American business associate of Li, was a major shareholder and chairman of Siwei's parent. He had invested in a Beijing concrete business back in the mid-1990s. The son of a former senior Sears executive, Williams had also served as chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. And along with Li, he had founded another Chinese mining company recently sold to another American mining equipment maker.The third investor was Jimmy Thompson. He was Li Rubo's son-in-law - and the son of billionaire Jim Thompson, who founded Crown Worldwide, the transport, relocation and storage giant. Li and Williams were part of the reason Caterpillar felt comfortable with the acquisition, several people with direct knowledge of the situation said.""They provided loans, they helped finance the company,"" one of those people said.Beyond that, their influence was limited. ""The show was run out of Zhengzhou on a day-to-day basis. Unfortunately, they were further away from the business than I had expected,"" that person said. ""Our reliance on them was the blind leading the blind.""Li, Thompson and Williams declined to comment for this story.PROJECT SEQUOIA Steve Wunning, the Peoria-based president of Caterpillar's mining equipment division, Resource Industries, and then-Chief Financial Officer, Ed Rapp, pitched the idea of buying Siwei to the company's board of directors in October 2011. It was codenamed ""Project Sequoia."" The board expressed support for the strategy, according to court documents filed in the United States.The first sign of trouble surfaced quickly. On November 7, 2011, the board received a two-page memo explaining that Siwei would need an immediate $50 million loan for working capital. Excerpts of the memo were contained in the court documents.The memo explained that Siwei's customers weren't paying what they owed. It also noted Siwei hadn't made overtime payments to its workers and didn't hold operating permits required by Chinese regulations. Fixing these and other issues, the memo said, would cost CAT as much as $30 million.The board was unfazed. That same day, the directors voted for the acquisition, authorizing the purchase of Siwei for up to $964 million. It would be the biggest foreign machinery acquisition in Hong Kong or China since the country opened up for business in 1978. The board also authorized the loan for working capital.Four months later, in March 2012, the board received another memo signaling trouble at Siwei, court documents showed. The company had missed its 2011 financial targets, and its parent company, ERA, was going to report a $2 million loss rather than a $16 million profit. Wunning also told the board that Siwei's average receivables had grown to an extraordinary 371 days, according to filings in connection to the court case.Corporate filings show the amount owed to Siwei by customers had risen 58 percent per year since 2008, overtaking total sales in 2011. Some 90 percent of those debts were overdue when Caterpillar launched its bid.Mining equipment companies typically finance at least part of their customers' purchases. However, once accounts are more than 90 days old, they are almost always disqualified from being counted as collateral for loans. At six months, they are widely recognized as needing to be turned over to a collection agency, or they are written off or reserved in full, according to one of the four shareholder suits filed in the United States. The complaint says the receivables issue rendered Siwei's revenues and assets ""highly suspicious and most likely wholly illusory.""Unsold goods were also a problem for Siwei. At the end of 2010, the average number of days Siwei's products sat in storage was 414, double what it was during China's economic slowdown in 2009. NO 'RED FLAGS' Caterpillar spokesman Jim Dugan said the company would not comment directly on matters of ""pending litigation.""But he said Siwei's accounting problems were unrelated to the profit warning and other issues the company found during its due diligence of the acquisition.""The Siwei accounting issues that led to the goodwill impairment charge involved Siwei's falsification of its books,"" Dugan said in an email. ""Therefore, Siwei's profit warning and failure to meet its 2011 targets, the $50 million working capital loan to Siwei, and other issues that came up in the course of Caterpillar's diligence were not 'red flags' as to the accounting fraud.""The news release announcing Caterpillar's tender offer went out on June 6, 2012.Documents produced for one of the Illinois court cases show that Caterpillar's board of directors did not ask for the results of the due diligence investigation, which ran from about September 2011 until June 2012. The board also did not look into whether Siwei's financial problems had been resolved. And it did not adjust the offer price, the documents indicate.Siwei had been focused almost entirely on gaining market share. Getting customers to actually pay their bills came to seem like an afterthought, former executives told Reuters.""They would take orders without down payments, so they had to finance the whole thing,"" said a person with direct involvement with Siwei. The point ""was to try to get market share."" This person added: ""These were all things we felt we could fix once we were on board.""Caterpillar was so bullish on China, it may have been willing to overlook some of Siwei's problems, former insiders say.""There was also a lot of euphoria. We were really going to dominate. Not only in mining but also in China,"" the person said, and old China hands Williams, Li and Thompson would help. ""Obviously it was too much, and we got burned.""LEGEND IN THE INDUSTRY At first, Wang Fu was equally exuberant about the deal. Siwei's former CEO is a native of the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning with nearly 30 years experience in the machinery industry. His first job out of college in 1984 was with the state-owned company from which Siwei would eventually be spun out in 2003. In Siwei's first year of operation after the spinoff, sales were less than 20 million yuan. Growth came quickly amid China's insatiable hunger for coal. By 2011, revenue approached 2 billion yuan ($500 million).On June 8, 2012, two days after the acquisition was completed, Caterpillar executives addressed Siwei's first post-merger board meeting in Zhengzhou. They pledged to preserve Siwei's culture and way of doing business.Wang says he was inspired. Siwei would retain independence, but be able to draw upon the experience and expertise of its new Fortune 500 parent.The excitement faded quickly. Accounts of what went wrong, why and how, now diverge completely in Peoria and Zhengzhou.In the interview, Wang said he knew Siwei's accounting methodology was bad, and its finance team too inexperienced to make improvements. He said as CEO, his primary concern had been chasing market share. ""Better to have market share than to solve every single problem and lose the market."" But his finance team, he said, couldn't keep up as the firm grew and orders poured in.Wang said he was proactive about the accounting problems. He raised it two or three times at Siwei board meetings, he said, hoping Caterpillar's more experienced finance team could help. He said the board gave him half a year to resolve the issue.Caterpillar denies that. Spokesman Dugan said Wang never brought the issue up and said Siwei's accounting problems - including the existence of a second set of books - were only discovered in November 2012, after Caterpillar found inventory discrepancies.Wang says there was no second set of accounting books.THE GAME IS UP Wang said he mobilized employees in finance, sales, manufacturing and technology to dig into the accounting issues following the acquisition. At the time, Wang said, nobody knew exactly how bad things were.By October 2012, Wang found that costs were sometimes allocated to incorrect projects. Other times, the company had simply not capitalized costs, or had accounted for them improperly on Siwei's balance sheet. Siwei had also double-booked some sales, which led to inventory discrepancies.At the same time, however, by Wang's estimates, the company's income had been underreported by about 170 million yuan because it had under-valued equipment made in-house.Caterpillar spokesman Dugan said this account was not accurate, but did not respond to specific questions about whether Caterpillar had written off too much. Requests to interview Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Oberhelman were declined.In the months to follow, Wang's relationship with Caterpillar soured. Every decision, it seemed to Wang, had to go through Caterpillar's lawyers, and Wang said he rarely interacted with senior Caterpillar executives.At the end of Wang's marathon grilling by Caterpillar attorneys on November 16, the day of the awards ceremony in Hong Kong, the attorneys concluded there had been mismanagement but no fraud, Wang said.Two months later, Wang says he was told to drop by Caterpillar's China headquarters in Beijing at the tail end of a business trip. Company lawyers fired him, he says, and refused to answer his questions.The written notice said: ""Your misconduct and serious dereliction of duty have caused severe damage to the company. You have also seriously violated company rules.""Since Caterpillar bought Siwei, it has had no new orders for hydraulic roof supports, two former employees with knowledge of customer accounts said.The number of working employees fell to about 1,900 in September from about 4,300 at the start of the year, one former office employee said. Four other former employees corroborated the scope of the cuts.Wang feels Caterpillar never had a ""comprehensive understanding"" of Siwei's financial situation and believes he was the scapegoat.""It looks like it is precisely to justify and cover up a dereliction of duty by their so-called elite teams that an easily discovered management issue is labeled as deliberate, intentional fraud,"" he said.Caterpillar stands by its allegation of fraud. And it is trying to open a new era at the company it acquired.On November 8 it announced the company name had been changed to Caterpillar (Zhengzhou) Ltd. The Siwei brand, it said, would be phased out.(Reporting by John Ruwitch and Clare Baldwin. Additional reporting by Alina Selyukh.

4,"   By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Jan 25 North American members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers on Saturday nominated challengers seeking to replace top union leaders, a move that could lead to a tougher negotiating stance toward major companies.At stake is control of about 339,000 dues-paying members at companies ranging from aerospace and defense giants Boeing Co  and Lockheed Martin Corp to United Airlines , heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc, a factory owned by furnishing retailer Ikea AB, and even Maine lobstermen.On Saturday, members at several of roughly 800 local lodges nominated candidates to challenge current IAM President R. Thomas Buffenbarger, General Secretary-Treasurer Robert Roach and eight general vice-presidents, members and union officials said.Results of the nomination are expected next week after the lodges submit results to national leaders.The nominations could spark a runoff Feb 8 to decide which nominees the lodges will endorse. If the challengers win support from at least 25 local lodges, an election would be held in April, the first contested IAM ballot in more than 50 years. If fewer than 25 lodges support the challengers, the incumbent leaders would automatically be elected.Jay Cronk, a Metro-North Railway mechanic in New Haven, Connecticut, who is challenging Buffenbarger for IAM president, said he's opposed to what he and other members see as high spending by the current leaders. With membership declining, top leaders' salaries should not keep rising and they should not have a private jet for travel,""We have developed a culture of privilege at the top,"" said Cronk, who also served as staff member of the national union organization for 14 years. According to Department of Labor records, Buffenbarger was paid $304,000 in total compensation in 2012, the latest figure available, up from $293,000 in 2011. Roach's total compensation was $271,000 in 2012 and $258,000 in 2011.Membership has declined to 577,000 active and retired members in 2012 from about 731,000 in 2000, according to the Department of Labor.The incumbent leaders say the challengers lack experience and skills to run a union with a $1 billion strike fund, a $9 billion health and pension fund and annual spending of more than $160 million. It was unclear whether the challengers could obtain the 25 lodge endorsements needed to trigger an election, said Richard Sloan, a spokesman for the IAM's current leaders.""We have not had a contested election since 1961,"" Sloan said. ""That means no candidate except the incumbents have ever exceeded the requirement of 25 locals nominating. Much of the reason for that is the candidates that run are fools and flakes and fops and didn't come up to the level of seriousness required of candidates.""Of the Learjet, Sloan noted IAM members make plane at Bombardier Inc and it costs less than commercial flights for the 250 days a year Buffenbarger travels.While the issues in the contest initially revolved around spending and management of the union, a leadership change also could affect the direction the union will take on pensions and other key contract elements. The IAM recently made headlines when it negotiated an eight-year extension to the IAM labor contract with Boeing that would ensure the company's newest jetliner, the 777X, would be built in Washington state, where IAM has about 31,000 members. In exchange, workers agreed to replace their pension with a defined-contribution retirement plan. They also accepted lower raises and higher health care costs.The contract was widely rejected by Seattle-area members in November. In January, international leaders held a second vote on a revised contract, despite objections from local union leaders in the Seattle area, who said the new offer was too similar to the first one that had been rejected.The contract was approved by 51 percent of members who voted. The decision roiled the membership, exposing deep divides on pensions versus job security, and has prompted members to file unfair labor practice charges against the union and Boeing.Jason Redrup, an elected business representative of the local 751 in Seattle, who is running for one of the eight general vice president positions, said he would have tried to persuade members not to vote away their pensions.""As a leader I would not advocate that members give up so much,"" he said. ""If they decided to do it, that's their right.""The IAM nominations are being rerun after a complaint filed last year prompted the U.S. Department of Labor to investigate. It found that there was insufficient notice of the nominations, and ordered the union to hold them again.",2014-01-26,CAT,"Sat Jan 25, 2014 | 9:49pm EST",North American machinists union slate challenges top leaders,http://www.reuters.com//article/machinist-election-idUSL2N0KZ0FB20140126?type=companyNews

15,"   By James B. Kelleher  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Thursday that sales of its construction equipment had surged in recent months, driven by an especially large jump in demand in North America, where a series of severe winter storms and arctic temperatures failed to keep builders out of dealer showrooms.The Peoria, Illinois-based company, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment used by builders and miners, said that worldwide retail sales to end users in the construction industry rose 9 percent in the three months ended January 31, driven by a 12 percent increase in North America.Those gains came even as the much of the United States experienced its worst winter in a generation, according to meteorologists, with temperatures across a vast area of the country running 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) below normal for two-and-a-half straight months.In recent weeks, a host of U.S. companies - including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), GNC Holdings Inc (GNC.N), La-Z-Boy Inc (LZB.N) and Panera Bread Co (PNRA.O) - have blamed the bad weather for disappointing results or reduced earnings outlooks.But the relentlessly cold weather, which also resulted in unexpected drops in retail sales, manufacturing output and housing starts in January, according to recent official reports, failed to put a chill into Caterpillar's construction equipment business. The good news, however, largely ended there for the company, which also makes railroad locomotives and power-generating engines and turbines.Total worldwide sales of Caterpillar's distinctive yellow tractors, graders, excavators and other earth-moving equipment fell 8 percent in the three months ended January 31, pulled down by continued weak demand from mining customers. Global dealer sales to the mining industry tumbled 37 percent year-over-year in the rolling three-month period, with the largest declines in the Asia-Pacific region, where weak demand in Australia and other key markets sent sales plunging 53 percent.When Caterpillar reported fourth-quarter earnings in January, it said it expected the mining business to remain tough this year as resource companies continue to come under pressure from investors to cut costs and retrench.Sales to the mining sector had been one of Caterpillar's most profitable businesses in recent years, prompting the company to double down through acquisitions. But over the past year and a half, mining customers - facing a backlash over unpopular takeovers, budget overruns and falling metals prices - have postponed or canceled new equipment orders.Caterpillar sells its machines through a worldwide network of more than 200 independent dealers.

17,"   By Caroline Stauffer | SAO DESIDERIO, Brazil  SAO DESIDERIO, Brazil Brazilian farmers are battling a voracious caterpillar that likely arrived from Asia, challenging the agricultural superpower's widely touted mastery of tropical farming just as it is on the verge of becoming the world's top soybean producer.The caterpillar, a variety known as helicoverpa armigera that thrives in dry heat, was spotted for the first time in the Americas on cotton farms in drought-prone western Bahia in early 2012, fuelling panic among farmers who had no idea what it was.The caterpillar was soon in soybean fields thousands of kilometers away thanks to the long-distance flying power of its moths, consuming everything from tomatoes to sorghum.While crop losses have thus far been limited, Brazil is now on red alert over the nation's third major pest outbreak in 30 years. Officials have stepped up port controls, farmers are rethinking planting patterns and the hardest hit are blaming the government's cumbersome bureaucracy for not allowing the import of pesticides that have helped control the bug in other nations.Most importantly, the caterpillar appears to be eating away at Brazil's proud claim to have conquered the craft of growing reliable crops in a tropical region where pests and disease can spread more quickly than for other major growers.""When you find helicoverpa armigera you have to act immediately, while they are still small,"" said Rudelvi Bombarda, who farms 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) with his brother in São Desidério, a dusty farming hub in western Bahia.Bombarda found his first helicoverpa armigera in a bean plant. He knew by the way the fattened, worm-like creature had chewed its way inside the pod, beyond the reach of chemicals, that it was not one of Brazil's usual leaf-eating pests.""If you wait and send it to a lab it will be too late,"" he said.Bahia, one of Brazil's newest farming frontiers, lost 3 million tons of soy and cotton, nearly half of its usual grains production, between the caterpillar and the drought last year, according to the National Confederation of Agriculture. Still, Brazil produced an 81.5 million ton soybean crop.To be sure, the caterpillar has not reduced forecasts for an even larger soybean harvest that could dethrone the United States as the world's leading grower this year.But it has provided a wake-up call on the risks of farming in the bug-ridden tropics, especially as more farmland is put into use. It also shows how Brazil's emergence as a major breadbasket has made it the fastest-growing market for biotechnology firms like Monsanto, which could benefit from the outbreak by selling its new caterpillar-resistant genetically modified soy and cotton seeds.'IT CHANGED EVERYTHING' The government's agricultural research agency Embrapa determined helicoverpa armigera was a new species in Brazil last February, a year after farmers in Bahia had noticed it was different from other pests and seemed immune to pesticides.""No one was expecting a species like this,"" said Alexandre Specht, the researcher whose microscope identified the caterpillar at a laboratory outside Brasilia.A small display case at the Embrapa Cerrados research center compares brown helicoverpa armigera moths with the nearly identical helicoverpa zea, already known in South America. The government is still studying how helicoverpa armigera arrived in Brazil. In the absence of a conclusive explanation, rumors of a bioterrorist attack occasionally surface.Most likely, the caterpillar arrived with cargo on a plane or ship from Asia, said Luis Rangel, director of the sanitation department at Brazil's agriculture ministry.""With the intensification of this transit of goods it is natural that sooner or later one of these pests would show up,"" he said in an interview. ""The Chinese bring in a lot of plants, it could have come in through this transit.""China is Brazil's No. 1 trade partner and buys most of its soybeans.In response to the outbreak, the government has added organic material detectors in its main ports and airports, technology that Argentina and Chile already had, Rangel said. Further measures will be taken in conjunction with the national intelligence agency when the World Cup starts in June, he said.Embrapa researchers said Brazil was also looking into building a pest-identification database at its main ports, like the helicoverpa armigera-free United States.The government had hoped to beat a pest cycle that has plagued Brazil once each decade since it started large-scale commercial agriculture.First there was the silverleaf whitefly in the 1990s, followed by soy rust fungus 10 years later, and both are still problems. Brazil was also the world's top cocoa producer until Witches' Broom disease devastated the industry in the 1990s. The country's soy area expanded by some 40 percent in the past five years, meaning the helicoverpa armigera outbreak has had a more significant economic impact, Rangel said. The tendency of farmers to plant soy repeatedly instead of rotating crops has also made Brazil more vulnerable to pests, he said.To prevent another outbreak, the government is promoting ""integrated agriculture,"" which involves monitoring pests, rotating crops and seed varieties, and using biological controls and natural enemies, with chemicals as a last resort.It is a completely new approach, according to Rangel. ""The helicoverpa changed everything about phytosanitary policy in Brazil,"" he said.BRAZILIAN BUREAUCRACY ""The solution for helicoverpa is to bring in products to control the helicoverpa - immediately,"" said Bombarda, an agronomist from southern Brazil who was lured by the potential to work with irrigation in western Bahia's frontier and employs full-time bug monitors on his farm.The Bahia state government announced that Emamectin Benzoate, a substance manufactured by Swiss crop chemical maker Syngenta, would be available in March 2013, shortly after Embrapa identified the new caterpillar.Yet a year later, farmers still do not have access to it.""It turned into an unprecedented bureaucracy... the government created a bunch of rules and obstacles,"" said Celito Breda, a cotton consultant in Bahia who has traveled across Brazil to discuss helicoverpa armigera and believes Emamectin Benzoate would provide the most efficient control. Syngenta said the company awaited decisions from federal and state governments on regulations and permits needed to import the product, which is sold all over the world, including the United States and parts of Latin America.Rangel said bureaucratic hurdles had been worked out and Emamectin Benzoate would be available with special approval on an emergency basis. He defended the government's caution, saying that as a top commodities exporter, Brazil must be careful about what pesticides are used to avoid retaliation from buyers.President Dilma Rousseff's government has authorized 36 other chemical and biological products to combat helicoverpa armigera, Rangel said.SYNGENTA'S LOSS, MONSANTO'S GAIN? Two weeks from harvest, Bombarda's soybean crop looks healthy. He applied pesticides 10 times, including five coats of Belt, a product he had never used before, made by Germany's Bayer AG.Syngenta has so far lost out on what would have been a lucrative opportunity to sell Emamectin Benzoate in Brazil. But Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, had better luck.Over the past 11 years, Monsanto developed a caterpillar-resistant soybean strain specifically for South America, with an eye on Brazil's growing pesticide reliance.""Today there is basically 12 months of continuous planting and you don't break the pest cycle,"" said Renato Carvalho, an insect control specialist at Monsanto in Sao Paulo. ""Over the years pressure increases, the pests become resistant to the insecticides and increase in population.""China approved imports of the new seed, Intacta RR2 Pro, in June and it was first sold on the Brazilian market in July. The seeds accounted for some 4 percent of soybean area planted this season and are so far proving resistant to helicoverpa armigera.The company is also selling Bollgard Cotton seeds, which have helped control helicoverpa armigera in Australia. Some 90 percent of soybeans planted are genetically modified in Brazil, where international companies including Syngenta and Dow Agrosciences also sell seeds.More Intacta seeds will be available for next season, though not nearly enough to cover local demand, Monsanto said. Intacta seeds cost 115 reais per hectare, five times more than the 22 reais Brazilian farmers paid for the company's previous technology, herbicide-resistant Roundup Ready.Jose Schreiner, a vice president at the National Agriculture Federation, said Intacta was proving resistant to helicoverpa armigera in his state of Goiás, but he hopes GMO technology will be just one of many tools used to combat the caterpillar.""I think working with biological control, natural enemies, is the road we should pursue,"" Schreiner said, referring to viruses that can be applied to crops to kill caterpillars.""We won't be able to eliminate it but we should be able to have a good level of control at a lower cost.""(Editing by Todd Benson, Jonathan Leff and Dan Grebler)",2014-02-27,CAT,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 9:11am EST",New threat to Brazil's breadbasket: a pesky caterpillar,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-brazil-agriculture-caterpillar-idUSBREA1Q19L20140227?type=companyNews

20,"  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Monday it had filed formal complaints challenging a decision by its home state of Illinois to award an important locomotive contract for a high-speed rail project to its rivals.In late 2013, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) awarded a $226 million contract to build up to 35 high-performance diesel-electric locomotives to a partnership formed by Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Cummins Inc (CMI.N).IDOT's decision was bigger than the dollar figure might suggest because the agency is leading a multistate locomotive procurement task force and its decisions are likely to influence the choices that other key states - including California, Michigan, Washington, and Missouri - ultimately make. In February, Caterpillar filed a formal protest with IDOT, but it was denied.In a statement released on Monday, the company said it had taken the protest to the next stage by filing formal complaints with the state's Procurement Policy Board as well as the Chancery Court in Cook County, Illinois. Caterpillar said it believed that IDOT ""unfairly evaluated and scored offers and improperly relaxed the specified performance requirements when making its selection."" A spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a voicemail or e-mail seeking comment.(Reporting by James B.

21,"   By James B. Kelleher  Caterpillar Inc has a long tradition of proudly - and publicly - proclaiming how much it loves its dealers.In recent years, the Peoria, Illinois-based company has called the 178 independently owned businesses that distribute its earth-moving products worldwide everything from ""a critical competitive differentiator"" to ""the foundation"" of its success.Now the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment is adopting a cooler tone with those dealers, asking them: ""What have you done for us lately?""Caterpillar believes its distributors are missing out on somewhere between $9 billion and $18 billion in easy-to-capture revenue each year because they are falling down in at least three ways. They are not tapping into the wealth of real-time customer data now at their fingertips; they are not communicating with each other; and they are not providing customers across the globe with a consistent experience when it comes to everything from e-commerce to parts and services pricing.So Caterpillar, which is in a hunt for new revenue because of weakness in key markets, is giving dealers until the end of the year to come up with a three-year plan to capture those lost sales. Distributors who fail to meet their targets could have their dealership agreements terminated, though top executives insist a cull of dealers probably won't be needed.""That would be the last resort, the last outcome and certainly not desirable,"" says Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman.Like its rivals, Caterpillar has integrated all kinds of diagnostic technology into its machines that throws off a torrent of real-time information about the health of the products. The data helps owners track their equipment, optimize its utilization and manage fuel and maintenance costs.Better exploited by the dealers, the information could immediately increase part and service sales to existing customers, Caterpillar says. Dealers could anticipate problems, schedule preventive and predictive maintenance and help customers manage their equipment fleets more efficiently.The company says its best dealers already do that pretty decently and have, in the words of Stu Levenick, the group president in charge of dealer relations, ""an awareness of about 90 percent of their parts demand by customer, have it very well segmented and understand where 90 percent of the opportunity exists.""Many more dealers are missing out. ""The average dealer, or lower-performing dealer, he only knows 40 percent of his opportunity,"" Levenick says. ""And we demonstrated that if we just take the best practices of the first group and apply it to the other group, they automatically get a 6 to 8 percent aftermarket share improvement ... just by doing something obvious. But they haven't done it because we haven't directed them to do it or helped them to do it.""BYPASSING BILLIONS IN SALES Caterpillar is the latest company to see big dollars in so-called Big Data. There are, by its reckoning, more than 3.5 million pieces of Caterpillar equipment in the field, many of them fitted with sensors that send out continual status updates about important mechanical systems and operator performance.Caterpillar believes dealers could be billing for billions of dollars more each year if they did a better job of thinking of those machines as smart digital devices, constantly pinging them with sales and service opportunities - not just dumb pieces of iron.The push, code-named Across the Table, was unveiled last month at a private meeting of distributors and made public earlier this month at an analyst meeting in Las Vegas.Company executives say dealers are missing out on additional billions in sales by not coordinating better with one another and not offering consistent e-commerce solutions to customers who, in many cases, work with more than one Caterpillar dealer across the globe. ""Customer expectations have changed,"" says Levenick, who is in charge of the initiative. ""If they work with multiple dealers, they want to have a common experience wherever they go.""Oberhelman says cooperation and communication among Caterpillar dealers often is ""disjointed,"" especially when it comes to locating parts and serving customers. He cites the example of Australia, where the four dealers that have carved up the country - and Caterpillar itself, which sells a handful of specialized products directly to customers - operate dozens of supply depots whose order and inventory systems aren't meshed.""I don't know how many individual parts warehouses there must be among four dealers and ours,"" Oberhelman says. ""But it's probably over 100. And we don't really today … have those talk to each other. You need a part in Perth. Our warehouse in Melbourne may not have it, but it may not communicate with all the other places in Australia before we have to go overseas to get it.""A big chunk of any incremental revenue the dealers pick up with the push would flow to Caterpillar, says Levenick. ""It can't go to them without going to us.""A SCRAMBLE FOR REVENUE Caterpillar is also challenging dealers to do a better job of navigating the sea change that's taken place in the construction machine market, where sales of equipment to rental companies now outnumber sales to contractors.That creates problems because the independent dealer model, which Caterpillar embraced shortly after its founding in the 1920s, ""was never designed originally to handle the financial loads or the operational capabilities of running a rental organization,"" Levenick says. ""If you look at a CAT dealer, they're not structured in a way that United Rentals is.""Jason Marx, a director in the heavy-equipment practice of AlixPartners, an industry consulting group, says the rental business requires ""a huge amount of working capital"" and can divert money away from other parts of a dealer's business that might require some funding for growth. Oberhelman acknowledges the strain the switch to rental is putting on the company and its dealer network. ""It moves the financial pressure from the customer to the dealer and ultimately up to us,"" he says. ""And we just have to figure out how to deal with that.""The push is not without risk. Caterpillar has long touted its independent dealers, whose 162,000 workers more than double its global headcount, as a key competitive advantage, especially in recent years as lower-priced Asian rivals with less robust dealer support networks rose up to challenge its supremacy in the construction equipment market.Messing with that could sour the special relationship that Caterpillar says has been critical to its success in remaining the world's No. 1 maker of construction and mining equipment.But the company is in a scramble for additional revenue. After peaking at $65.9 billion in 2012, sales plunged nearly 16 percent in 2013 as capital investment by the global mining industry tanked. The company has warned that sales could slip another 5 percent in 2014 in part because of the slow-motion recovery of the global construction market.Analysts say that hasn't completely derailed Caterpillar's goal of reaching $100 billion in annual revenues by 2020, but it has made the target a little harder to reach. Hence the focus on dealer performance, which Caterpillar says is a way to significantly lift sales even if construction and mining fundamentals don't improve dramatically anytime soon.Caterpillar is focused on nine or 10 dealer metrics, most of which it refuses to discuss with analysts or the media. That has made it difficult for investors to assess the likelihood the move will deliver the promised results.Ann Duignan, an analyst at JP Morgan, is among those who say they have more questions than answers about the dealer effort and remain dubious about the effect it will have on the company's top and bottom lines. ""It's hard to assess accurately because they didn't give us enough detail,"" Duignan says. But in conversations about the program with Reuters, top executives have made it clear that dealers need to significantly increase the performance of their parts and service departments and to boost their share of the global parts and service market.A key gauge here is something Caterpillar calls ""the absorption rate,"" which measures how long a dealership could keep its doors open if it never sold another piece of equipment and had to survive on the profits booked from servicing existing machines in its territory.If a dealer's gross profit from those parts and service sales can cover its total overhead and interest expenses for a year, the dealer is said to have a 100 percent absorption rate. For years, 100 percent was considered good enough.No more. Dealers' new absorption-rate goals will be different, but they have all been given until 2018 to improve performance. Leveraging the insights the embedded technology affords them is one way to get there.Even the best dealers in the network are being assigned new goals that Jim Parker, the owner of Carter Machinery, a Caterpillar dealership in Salem, Virginia, says ""won't be a lay-up.""Tapping into the technology already deployed on Caterpillar's machines could make their task a little easier.For years now, Caterpillar has been installing all kinds of cameras, sensors and satellite-based positioning control and guidance systems on its machines to help customers increase their productivity and efficiency and eliminate workplace accidents.Those electronic gadgets and the remote monitoring they make possible have created a huge opportunity for dealers to move beyond the equipment and parts and services sales and into the potentially much-more lucrative fleet-management business.Dealers already offer a tiered fleet-management program, which is marketed as CAT Equipment Management Solutions (EMS).Indeed a highlight of Caterpillar's exhibit at the recent ConExpo trade show in Las Vegas was a demonstration of how the system works for customers and dealers.Caterpillar wants dealers to move more customers into higher-levels of EMS, where dealers take over monitoring of the equipment and - at the highest level - actually take over the management of customers' fleets.The company has tried to increase dealer buy-in to the plan by asking 20 of its top-performing distributors - including Parker in Virginia - to help design its carrots and sticks. So far, Levenick says there has been little resistance to the basic goals.

22,"   By James B. Kelleher | March 20  March 20 Caterpillar Inc has a long tradition of proudly - and publicly - proclaiming how much it loves its dealers.In recent years, the Peoria, Illinois-based company has called the 178 independently owned businesses that distribute its earth-moving products worldwide everything from ""a critical competitive differentiator"" to ""the foundation"" of its success.Now the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment is adopting a cooler tone with those dealers, asking them: ""What have you done for us lately?""Caterpillar believes its distributors are missing out on somewhere between $9 billion and $18 billion in easy-to-capture revenue each year because they are falling down in at least three ways. They are not tapping into the wealth of real-time customer data now at their fingertips; they are not communicating with each other; and they are not providing customers across the globe with a consistent experience when it comes to everything from e-commerce to parts and services pricing.So Caterpillar, which is in a hunt for new revenue because of weakness in key markets, is giving dealers until the end of the year to come up with a three-year plan to capture those lost sales. Distributors who fail to meet their targets could have their dealership agreements terminated, though top executives insist a cull of dealers probably won't be needed.""That would be the last resort, the last outcome and certainly not desirable,"" says Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman.Like its rivals, Caterpillar has integrated all kinds of diagnostic technology into its machines that throws off a torrent of real-time information about the health of the products. The data helps owners track their equipment, optimize its utilization and manage fuel and maintenance costs.Better exploited by the dealers, the information could immediately increase part and service sales to existing customers, Caterpillar says. Dealers could anticipate problems, schedule preventive and predictive maintenance and help customers manage their equipment fleets more efficiently.The company says its best dealers already do that pretty decently and have, in the words of Stu Levenick, the group president in charge of dealer relations, ""an awareness of about 90 percent of their parts demand by customer, have it very well segmented and understand where 90 percent of the opportunity exists.""Many more dealers are missing out. ""The average dealer, or lower-performing dealer, he only knows 40 percent of his opportunity,"" Levenick says. ""And we demonstrated that if we just take the best practices of the first group and apply it to the other group, they automatically get a 6 to 8 percent aftermarket share improvement ... just by doing something obvious. But they haven't done it because we haven't directed them to do it or helped them to do it.""BYPASSING BILLIONS IN SALES Caterpillar is the latest company to see big dollars in so-called Big Data. There are, by its reckoning, more than 3.5 million pieces of Caterpillar equipment in the field, many of them fitted with sensors that send out continual status updates about important mechanical systems and operator performance.Caterpillar believes dealers could be billing for billions of dollars more each year if they did a better job of thinking of those machines as smart digital devices, constantly pinging them with sales and service opportunities - not just dumb pieces of iron.The push, code-named Across the Table, was unveiled last month at a private meeting of distributors and made public earlier this month at an analyst meeting in Las Vegas.Company executives say dealers are missing out on additional billions in sales by not coordinating better with one another and not offering consistent e-commerce solutions to customers who, in many cases, work with more than one Caterpillar dealer across the globe. ""Customer expectations have changed,"" says Levenick, who is in charge of the initiative. ""If they work with multiple dealers, they want to have a common experience wherever they go.""Oberhelman says cooperation and communication among Caterpillar dealers often is ""disjointed,"" especially when it comes to locating parts and serving customers. He cites the example of Australia, where the four dealers that have carved up the country - and Caterpillar itself, which sells a handful of  specialized products directly to customers - operate dozens of supply depots whose order and inventory systems aren't meshed.""I don't know how many individual parts warehouses there must be among four dealers and ours,"" Oberhelman says. ""But it's probably over 100. And we don't really today  have those talk to each other. You need a part in Perth. Our warehouse in Melbourne may not have it, but it may not communicate with all the other places in Australia before we have to go overseas to get it.""A big chunk of any incremental revenue the dealers pick up with the push would flow to Caterpillar, says Levenick. ""It can't go to them without going to us.""A SCRAMBLE FOR REVENUE Caterpillar is also challenging dealers to do a better job of navigating the sea change that's taken place in the construction machine market, where sales of equipment to rental companies now outnumber sales to contractors.That creates problems because the independent dealer model, which Caterpillar embraced shortly after its founding in the 1920s, ""was never designed originally to handle the financial loads or the operational capabilities of running a rental organization,"" Levenick says. ""If you look at a CAT dealer, they're not structured in a way that United Rentals is."" Jason Marx, a director in the heavy-equipment practice of  AlixPartners, an industry consulting group, says the rental business requires ""a huge amount of working capital"" and can divert money away from other parts of a dealer's business that might require some funding for growth.Oberhelman acknowledges the strain the switch to rental is putting on the company and its dealer network. ""It moves the financial pressure from the customer to the dealer and ultimately up to us,"" he says. ""And we just have to figure out how to deal with that.""The push is not without risk.

25,"   By Patrick Temple-West | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Caterpillar Inc's offshore tax strategies will come under scrutiny on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate hearing expected to examine dealings by the world's largest mining and construction equipment maker in Switzerland, Bermuda and Luxembourg.With many multinationals being criticized for tax avoidance, veteran tax sleuth Senator Carl Levin will chair another session of his Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, with three current and former Caterpillar executives slated to testify.Levin's panel dives deeper than any other on Capitol Hill into the minutia of tax law and accounting, with its Caterpillar probe expected to center on the tax aspects of Caterpillar's corporate restructurings in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which advised Caterpillar on its tax strategies, is also sending three officers to the hearing as witnesses.A Caterpillar spokeswoman declined to answer questions about the company's tax strategies. A spokeswoman for Levin declined to comment. PricewaterhouseCoopers also declined to comment. Levin's panel has not detailed its findings, but a lawsuit involving the restructurings that was settled in 2012 may offer clues about the hearing's focus, said Richard Harvey, a former Internal Revenue Service official who reviewed court records from the lawsuit that detailed some of Caterpillar's dealings.""One would hope the IRS took a very close look at these transactions,"" said Harvey, now a tax professor at Villanova University. He testified before Levin's committee last year. Beginning in 1999, Caterpillar shifted a ""replacement parts"" division from the United States to Switzerland and executives said one purpose was to reduce taxes, according to the records.In 2005, Caterpillar set up units in low-tax Bermuda and Luxembourg, according to the court filings.In a memo dated November 21, 2006, Caterpillar chief tax officer Robin Beran said: ""Two internal reorganizations were completed, leveraging the Bermuda/Lux structure, allowing repatriation of nearly $1.5 billion cash to the U.S. without incremental U.S. tax."" Beran is one of the Caterpillar officers set to testify. He declined to comment on Friday.Daniel Schlicksup, a former Caterpillar tax official, sued the company in 2009, alleging he was retaliated against by executives for raising concerns internally about its tax dealings.Schlicksup said Caterpillar's offshore tax structures helped it avoid more than $2 billion in U.S. taxes, according to his complaint.

31,"  WASHINGTON, April 1 Executives for Caterpillar Inc will defend the company's offshore tax strategies at a U.S. Senate hearing on Tuesday held by a panel known for shedding light on corporate tax avoidance.In a 99-page report released on Monday, the Senate the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said Caterpillar avoided paying $2.4 billion in U.S. taxes from 2000 through 2012 by moving profits from sales of replacement parts through a low-tax unit it set up in Switzerland.Democrat Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee and one of Capitol Hill's most dogged questioners, said on Monday Caterpillar set up the Swiss structure for no other reason than to avoid U.S. taxes.Caterpillar, the world's largest mining and construction equipment maker, said on Monday the Swiss structure is legal and is a standard business move for many multinational companies. ""Caterpillar stands by this structure,"" said Julie Lagacy, vice president of Caterpillar's finance services division, according to prepared testimony released ahead of the hearing.Along with three Caterpillar executives, representatives of Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which advised Caterpillar on the restructuring, are expected to testify. ""In the fantasy land that is international tax law, tax lawyers waved a magic wand to make millions of dollars in the U.S. taxes disappear,"" Levin said.

32,"  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman's compensation declined 33 percent last year because of the company's failure to meet promised profit and performance targets, according to a filing on Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Oberhelman still took home nearly $15 million in total compensation in 2013, according to the SEC filing, more than half of it in the form of stock options awards.Oberhelman was hardly the only employee at Caterpillar to take a pay cut in 2013, and like a lot of workers with the company, he knew it was coming. Last summer, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment put workers on notice that its short-term incentive plan, the centerpiece of its performance-based, profit-sharing program, would make its smallest payout since the recession.In updates to the plan's roughly 60,000 participants, and in quarterly disclosures to investors, Caterpillar said it expected 2013 outlays related to the program to be down as much as 40 percent from 2012, reflecting sharply reduced payments to employees. The reason: Cancellations from mining customers weighed on high-margin sales to that key sector, forcing the Peoria, Illinois-based company to cut its full-year earnings forecast several quarters in a row and to implement major cost cuts. In the end, Caterpillar's earnings per share fell 32 percent in 2013 to $5.75.

34,"  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) released unaudited dealer sales data on Wednesday that showed a deepening deterioration in global demand for its mining equipment but a continued, albeit modest, rebound in sales of construction equipment as well as reciprocating and turbine engines.The numbers suggested the company's first-quarter earnings, due early Thursday, will be another mixed bag, unlikely to surprise investors on the upside.The world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment said global dealer sales of its yellow earth-moving machines fell 12 percent year-over-year in March, after falling 8 percent in both January and February.Equipment demand from mining customers was especially weak, Caterpillar said, with global dealer sales of those high-margin products tumbling 46 percent in March after falling 37 percent in both January and February.That overshadowed a modest but continued recovery in global sales of machines to construction customers, which rose 9 percent year-over-year in March after growing at a similar rate in both January and February. The downturn in demand for mining equipment was especially dramatic in the Asia-Pacific region, where dealer sales slumped 65 percent in March after falling 55 percent in February and 53 percent in January. South America was another region of pronounced weakness with mining equipment sales down 60 percent year-over-year in March after falling 49 percent in February and 36 percent in January.The news was better on the engine side of Caterpillar's business. The company said global dealer sales of its gas turbines, diesel engines and generators rose 7 percent year-over-year in March after rising 2 percent in both January and February. Double-digit increases in dealer sales of engines to industrial and power generation customers offset weakness in sales to customers in the transportation industry. Sales to oil and gas customers, which were down single-digits in January and February, stabilized in March and were unchanged year-over-year, the company said.Caterpillar sells its equipment and engines through a worldwide network of nearly 180 independent dealers. So the unaudited dealer sales figures provide a useful, though incomplete, glimpse of the company's underlying business ahead of its official quarterly filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. After peaking at $65.9 billion in 2012, Caterpillar's global sales plunged nearly 16 percent in 2013 as capital investment by the global mining industry tanked.The company has warned that sales could slip another 5 percent in 2014 if that weakness continues, though a pickup in the construction market could provide a positive offset.(Reporting by James B.

42,"   By James B. Kelleher  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) on Thursday posted a quarterly profit that topped analysts' estimates and raised its full-year outlook, citing a stronger-than-expected rebound in sales to the construction industry.The news sent shares in the world's largest maker of earth-moving machinery up as much as 4 percent though the stock, which has outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, gave back more than half those gains by early afternoon.The results were also lifted by continued cost cuts as well as share repurchases. Caterpillar has laid off 8,295 full-time employees, or nearly 7 percent of its global workforce, over the last 12 months.It has also repurchased $3.7 billion of its shares since January 2013, which translates into a higher profit-per-share on the lower outstanding share count.The company's success in managing costs, and translating sales gains into profits, was evident its construction equipment segment, where operating profit rose $460 million in the first quarter on a sales increase of just $840 million.Caterpillar expects its sales to builders to increase 10 percent from 2013, up from a previously forecast increase of about 5 percent.But it cautioned 2014 would be ""another very tough year"" for mining, another key market, and that its outlook reflected an anticipated drop of about 80 percent in sales of large mining trucks from the company's peak year in 2012.Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar, said he was pleasantly surprised by the company's ""very solid cost control in construction in particular,"" where operating margins continued to grow and ""were at their highest quarterly level in several quarters"", even though they were typically more compressed than in the mining equipment category. Fleck said the weakness in mining ""wasn't terribly surprising"" and added that because the once-critical business made up just 17 percent of first-quarter sales and 12 percent of operating profit, any continued weakness in the sector was ""more of a headline risk than a true economic one.""Caterpillar posted a first-quarter net profit of $922 million, or $1.61 a share, compared with $880 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.With restructuring costs factored in, Caterpillar made a profit of $1.44 a share.Revenue at the company, which also makes locomotives and diesel and turbine engines, was little changed at $13.24 billion.Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.24 a share on sales of $13.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In an interview with Reuters, Brad Halverson, the company's chief finance officer, said: ""We're very happy with the quarter, with profit being up - fairly significantly excluding restructuring - on flat sales. We're also very happy with … how we did that: a little price, some market share improvement and good cost reduction.""Price increases played a minimal role in the first-quarter results, Halverson said. He said Caterpillar's arch-rival Komatsu Ltd (6301.T) was ""being a little bit more aggressive in their pricing structure"" thanks to the weakness of the Japanese yen. That, coupled with continued uncertainty in Europe and signs of a construction slowdown in China, kept a lid on prices.""If you go back to '07 or '08, we had pretty healthy price increases in our profitability,"" Halverson said. ""But I would say that in the current environment, the ability to have decent-sized price increases is difficult.""The report was nonetheless tinged with caution. Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said the Peoria, Illinois-based company was watching several regions closely. Having visited China recently, he said the construction industry there was facing challenges. Caterpillar was also concerned about the situation in Ukraine and Russia, he added.""We are hoping for a peaceful resolution, but business confidence around the world could dampen, and trade and world GDP could slow should the situation deteriorate,"" Oberhelman said. ""The global economy remains fragile, and as such, one or two setbacks could create substantial downside risk for the global economic recovery.""FULL YEAR EARNINGS OUTLOOK UP Caterpillar raised its full-year earnings outlook to $6.10 per share from $5.85, citing growing demand from builders. Oberhelman warned, however, of ""a range of macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties that could slow the growth of global GDP"" and upend Caterpillar's new forecast.The company kept its forecast for full-year revenue unchanged at about $56 billion, plus or minus 5 percent, and said it would continue to work to restructure its operations to cut costs. It said those efforts would be ""widespread across the company"" throughout 2014 and would cost the company between $400 to $500 million and negatively impact full-year earnings by 50 to 60 cents a share.In the first quarter, the company spent $149 million on restructuring efforts, Caterpillar said, primarily related to a reduction in workforce at plant in Belgium.In early afternoon trading, Caterpillar shares were up $1.70, or 1.6 percent, at $105.08 after earlier trading as high as $107.40.

With two-thirds of his business and perhaps half of his company's 100 jobs dependent on deals Ex-Im helps finance, ""I need to meet with Kevin McCarthy and let him know, this is not a good thing for America.""The 80-year-old bank provides about $37 billion a year in direct loans to foreign buyers of U.S. products, credit guarantees to American companies and credit insurance to aid exports.

52,"  * Caterpillar ranks as best YTD performer on the Dow* Latest entries to the index are negative for the year; Alcoa, booted, soars* Dow's performance lags S&P 500, Nasdaq, Wilshire 5000By Rodrigo CamposNEW YORK, July 3 Wall Street on Thursday celebrated its love of zeros - the ones that come after commas, that is - as the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped the 17,000 mark for the first time.The natural appeal of round numbers notwithstanding, the attention to the Dow as it crosses this latest milestone highlights not only the resilience of the current bull market but also the less-than-stellar relative performance of blue chip stocks this year. The Dow is up less than 3 percent so far this year, while broader measures of U.S. stocks such as the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000 are up around 7 percent.As an index, the Dow is overlooked by many Wall Street insiders that consider it out of date, since its price-weighted construction has kept companies like Apple and Google  - recent engines of growth and the new all-American staples - on the sidelines.About $13 billion is benchmarked globally to the Dow compared with $1.575 trillion to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data through 2012, the most up-to-date. But even as Wall Street looks elsewhere to measure performance, the Dow has retained a broad appeal for the occasional investor. ""When we make noise at round numbers it's for obvious reasons. It's a milepost, it gets attention not just from the folks that watch this on a minute-to-minute basis, but also from Main Street and that's why it's important,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.""But it is up less than half of the move the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq have made. It's a different kind of index so if you have two, three large-cap names that aren't performing well, like Visa or IBM that have large stock prices, that's going to drag it down.""Had it tracked the 7.2 percent year-to-date gain on the S&P 500, the blue-chip index would be trading above 17,700.At the close on Wednesday only eight of the Dow's 30 components were outperforming the S&P 500 this year, while 11 were posting negative year-to-date readings. Three of those in the red for the year are the index's newest additions, blue-chips since last September: Nike, Goldman Sachs and Visa.Meanwhile, Bank of America, Alcoa and Hewlett-Packard, the three stocks that were booted from the index last year, are all up for the year with HP up 21 percent and Alcoa up 40 percent.With the index at record highs, it certainly is not all bad news for the blue-chips. Caterpillar, the best performer so far this year, has gained 21 percent in 2014 and is on track for its best performance since 2010.The record ""is a powerful reinforcement to people on the sidelines that this is the strongest bull market they will see in their lifetime and many have missed it,"" said Craig Callahan, CEO of Icon Funds in Denver, Colorado. Three healthcare companies (Merck, Johnson & Johnson , and UnitedHealth Group ) rank among those beating the S&P this year, helped by the higher prices in a sector that has more than $100 billion in completed and pending mergers and acquisitions in 2014 in the U.S. alone.""Healthcare is the tip of the M&A sword of late,"" said Wunderlich's Hogan. ""Large caps have been making extremely interesting acquisitions, so that's part of it.""Intel and Microsoft are also among the Dow's top performers in 2014, both breaking out to their highest in more than a decade, as so-called ""old technology"" catches up to the market rally.Intel on Thursday hit $31.36, the highest since February 2004, and Microsoft is near last week's peak of $42.29, the highest since April 2000. But while Intel is up around 160 percent from the lows of March 2009 and Microsoft has risen about 180 percent, the S&P 500 has gained more than 190 percent in roughly the same period.""It may give people pause to think what could go wrong. I wouldn't be anything more than vigilant,"" said John Manley,  chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York.""This market is driven by fundamentals; 17,000 is a psychological thing, probably not much more.""

55,"   By James B. Kelleher  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings and raised its full-year forecast on Thursday but said sales fell as a continued slump in the global mining industry offset a rebound in the North American building sector.The stock was down 3.5 percent at $104.54 on Thursday afternoon.The company, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, raised its full-year profit outlook to $5.75 a share, from $5.55 a share. The outlook was lifted, in part, by a $2.5 billion stock repurchase it said it would make during the current quarter.But Caterpillar, which had forecast full-year sales in the range of $53.2 billion to $58.8 billion, adjusted its outlook lower to a range of $54 billion to $56 billion.It said the cut reflected weak construction sales in once fast-growing overseas markets including China, as well as concern about the effect rising interest rates will have on sales in Brazil.Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's point man for business risk management, said tensions in the former Soviet republics - often referred to as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - were also hurting activity in the region. ""The CIS is not huge for us. But even though it's not big, it's come off a lot.""  Second-quarter sales in Latin America fell 16 percent, ""primarily due to lower end-user demand for mining equipment.""Ann Duignan, analyst at J.P.Morgan, said the selloff reflected investor concerns about ""growing macro headwinds"" in emerging markets. Caterpillar reported quarterly earnings of $999 million or $1.57 a share, up from $960 million, or $1.45 a share, last year. The company, which also makes railroad locomotives as well as diesel and turbine engines, said sales fell 3 percent to $14.15 billion.In North America, sales increased 6 percent, primarily due to improving demand for construction equipment in the United States.    Sales of mining equipment, which have been in a multiyear decline, fell 29 percent during the quarter, offsetting an 11 percent increase in construction equipment.Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman complained that mining customers were not only not buying new equipment but also delaying maintenance on the machines they already own, hurting part sales. Nevertheless, he said he was encouraged because Caterpillar's mining equipment sales did not decline between the first and second quarters - the first time that metric has not experienced a quarter-over-quarter deterioration since 2012.""I fully believe, as do our customers, that the bottom is just behind us,"" he said.Caterpillar said it pared its full-time payroll by more than 7,000 workers year over year – about 6 percent of its workforce.But Kwame Webb, a Morningstar analyst, pointed out the company's temporary and contract workforce grew by nearly 400, a sign, he said, of a ""strategy to make the business model more variable over time.""

58,"  (Adds response from Republican congressman in paragraphs 7, 8)By Mark FelsenthalWASHINGTON Aug 23 President Barack Obama on Saturday urged business owners to press Congress to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which could halt any new financing Sept. 30 - as some conservative Republicans hope it will - if lawmakers fail to act.The little-known institution provides loans to buyers of U.S. products abroad. Obama said in his weekly radio address that if Congress lets the bank close, it would be stunting U.S. export growth and impeding economic expansion.""If Congress fails to act, thousands of businesses, large and small, that sell their products abroad will take a completely unnecessary hit,"" the president said.While playing a relatively small role in the U.S. export universe, the bank has become a political flashpoint. Conservative Republicans single it out as an unnecessary and potentially risky government program, while moderates and most Democrats defend it as providing a useful boost to businesses seeking new markets. Household names such as Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc  and General Electric Co are big beneficiaries of the bank's services. Ex-Im Bank's critics say aiding well-established firms such as those serves little purpose and puts taxpayers at risk.Opposition to renewing the bank's charter includes influential lawmakers such as new House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, both Republicans.Hensarling, in a statement on Saturday, said the Ex-Im Bank amounted to ""foreign corporate welfare"" that benefited mostly ""a handful of powerful politically connected corporations."" ""What would really help American manufacturers and small businesses compete on a level playing field are pro-growth tax, energy, regulatory and liability policies that the House has already passed but are being blocked by Democrats in the Senate,"" he said.Fueling concerns about the bank's role, Delta Airlines  charges that the institution provides an unfair advantage to foreign competitors of the U.S. carrier.

59,"   By Mark Felsenthal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Aug 23 President Barack Obama on Saturday urged business owners to press Congress to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which could halt any new financing Sept. 30 - as some conservative Republicans hope it will - if lawmakers fail to act.The little-known institution provides loans to buyers of U.S. products abroad. Obama said in his weekly radio address that if Congress lets the bank close, it would be stunting U.S. export growth and impeding economic expansion.""If Congress fails to act, thousands of businesses, large and small, that sell their products abroad will take a completely unnecessary hit,"" the president said.While playing a relatively small role in the U.S. export universe, the bank has become a political flashpoint. Conservative Republicans single it out as an unnecessary and potentially risky government program, while moderates and most Democrats defend it as providing a useful boost to businesses seeking new markets. Household names such as Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc  and General Electric Co are big beneficiaries of the bank's services. Ex-Im Bank's critics say aiding well-established firms such as those serves little purpose and puts taxpayers at risk.Opposition to renewing the bank's charter includes influential lawmakers such as new House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, both Republicans. Fueling concerns about the bank's role, Delta Airlines  charges that the institution provides an unfair advantage to foreign competitors of the U.S. carrier.""If left to do business as usual, the Bank has proven that it will continue to help all foreign airlines indiscriminately, including well-funded and state-supported ones that competitively threaten U.S. airlines and their employees,"" Delta Senior Vice President Andrea Fischer Newman wrote to Hensarling this week.

66,"   By James B. Kelleher  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) shares jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday after it reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its 2014 outlook, citing strong demand from the North American energy and construction industries.Sales to those markets offset continued weak sales of its earth-moving machines to the mining industry, a market Caterpillar bet on heavily through acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 - right before a slump in commodity prices prompted resource companies to slash their investment in new equipment. Since then, Caterpillar has focused on cutting production costs and boosting margins, a process that has involved thousands of layoffs but permitted the Peoria, Illinois-based company to grow earnings even as sales have flat-lined. That was the case in the most recent quarter, when the company managed to boost its net profit by more than 7 percent, on sales growth of just 1 percent. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Caterpillar earned $1.1 billion, or $1.63 a share, up from $946 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier.Analysts, on average, expected it to earn $1.36 a share on sales of $13.2 billion.Excluding restructuring costs, Caterpillar said it now expects to earn $6.50 a share in 2014, against an original forecast of $5.85. ""They crushed the estimates,"" said Brian Langenberg, principal at the independent research firm Langenberg & Co.Overall sales rose 1 percent to $13.54 billion, lifted by a 15 percent increase in North American sales, driven by demand for equipment and diesel and gas engines from oil and gas companies and builders. RISKS AND A FLAT 2015 Caterpillar, which also makes diesel-electric locomotives,  got a boost during the quarter as railroads raced to buy engines ahead of tough U.S. emission rules that take effect in 2015.But those sales gains were offset by a 21 percent sales slump in Latin America, a 7 percent sales drop in most of the Asia-Pacific region, and flat sales in China, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Looking toward 2015, Caterpillar said there was “a reasonable likelihood that world economic growth could improve.”      But it warned a number of “significant risks” – including tensions in the former Soviet Union and the Middle East and slowing growth in China – could hurt business confidence and weigh on sales.  As a result, the company said revenue was expected to be essentially flat in 2015. “Caterpillar is being cautiously optimistic, which is really all they can be, given all the gremlins out there,” said Lawrence De Maria, an analyst at William Blair & Co. “But even with revenue flat, they’ve shown they can deliver solid (earnings per share) growth.”Caterpillar shares, which lagged the S&P 500 during the third quarter, were up 5.5 percent at $99.80 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

70,"  * Risk sentiment hit by first Ebola case in NY* Caterpillar, 3M earnings underpin sentiment* U.S. and euro zone economic data positive* European shares seen falling 0.5-0.7 pctBy Hideyuki SanoTOKYO, Oct 24 U.S. stock futures tumbled while safe-haven assets such as the yen and U.S. bonds gained on Friday after a doctor who returned to New York City from West Africa tested positive for Ebola.S&P 500 mini futures fell as much as 0.7 percent, slipping from two-week highs hit the previous day on budding optimism from corporate earnings and the global economy.European shares looked set to slip, with France's CAC 40 seen falling by as much as 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX  and Britain's FTSE by 0.5 percent.In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent, though Japan's Nikkei share average bucked the trend rising 1.0 percent, led by gains in drug companies.""Just when markets got some relief on the world economy, we had this news. Obviously people who have just made bullish bets (on the economy) will close their positions as no one can tell exactly what is going to happen,"" said the head of currency trading at a Western bank's Tokyo branch. The first diagnosed case of Ebola in the world financial hub of New York sent investors rushing to traditional safe-haven assets.As U.S. bond prices gained, the 10-year U.S. yield fell back to 2.250 percent from Thursday's two-week high of 2.300 percent .In the currency market, the yen gained 0.3 percent to 107.95 yen to the dollar.Risk asset prices had risen on Thursday after upbeat U.S. corporate earnings, solid U.S. economic data, and an unexpected uptick in euro zone business sentiment helped ease concerns that the global economy was losing momentum.Results from Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co  reassured investors that companies with large overseas revenue streams could deliver solid profits, despite concerns about global economic growth. The markets had ignored positive earnings earlier this month, when the world's share prices hit multi-month lows, overwhelmed by fears that sluggishness in Europe and Asia could deal a severe blow to the U.S. economy as well.But a steady flow of solid earnings helped to ease many such concerns for now.With 177 of the S&P 500 companies having posted third-quarter results, 69.5 percent have beaten expectations, better than the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, and higher than the 20-year average of 63 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed.New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits also held below 300,000 for a sixth straight week last week. In the euro zone, a survey showed businesses performed much better than anyone expected this month, even though it also pointed to strong deflationary pressure in the region.The euro drew some support from the surprise strength in the euro zone data, but was still near a two-week low of $1.2614 hit on Thursday. It last stood at $1.2657.Investors are turning cautious ahead of Sunday's release of the European Central Bank's stress test results on the euro zone's 130 biggest banks.In addition, some focus could fall on the parliamentary election in Ukraine on Sunday. Stability could benefit the European economy, which has suffered from the fall in trade with Russia on tit-for-tat sanctions between the West and Moscow.""I suspect one often overlooked reason for the market's rebound since the middle of this week was signs of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine,"" said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Daiwa SB Investments, pointing to progress in gas talks between Russia and Ukraine last week.President Petro Poroshenko's bloc holds a big lead, but if the populist Oleh Lyashko's Radical party makes a very strong showing, Poroshenko may have the awkward task of seeking the support of a politician who has been sharply critical of his peace plan and his contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Sunday will also see presidential election in Brazil, where stocks and the currency have suffered on expectations that the current President Dilma Rousseff is likely to beat her rival, Aecio Neves, who is seen as more market-friendly.The Bovespa stock index hit a six-month low while the Brazilian real slumped to a 9-1/2-year low on Thursday.(Editing by Eric Meijer)",2014-10-24,CAT,"Fri Oct 24, 2014 | 2:24am EDT",GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S. stock futures tumble on reports of NY Ebola case,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-global-idUSL3N0SJ03820141024?type=companyNews

77,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) on Tuesday cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned the plunge in oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business, sending shares tumbling as much as 8 percent.The world's largest construction and mining equipment maker also posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit.During the fourth quarter, Caterpillar's energy business helped offset falling construction equipment sales and weakness in mining equipment orders due to lower copper, coal and iron ore prices. Caterpillar said it expects only a modest improvement in the global economy in 2015. The nearly 60 percent drop in oil prices since June will not only affect Caterpillar's energy business, but will also hurt construction projects in oil-producing regions, the company said. Caterpillar expects lower construction equipment sales in China in 2015 due to a weaker market. The stronger dollar should hit revenue from products sold overseas.Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said in a statement 2015 will be ""tough"" for the company. Caterpillar said it expected full-year 2015 revenues of around $50 billion, about 9 percent below the 2014 total. The company had said last October it expected 2015 revenue to be flat or slightly up versus 2014.On a conference call, company officials said around 50 percent of the expected sales decline was directly or indirectly related to low oil prices.   Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson said that with housing starts and the construction sector expected to do well in 2015 - outside the energy sector - North America is one of ""few bright spots"" for Caterpillar.How low oil prices will affect consumer sentiment, the economy and ultimately Caterpillar's business is hard to tell at this point, executives said.  Q4 REVENUES TUMBLE The Peoria, Illinois-based company reported fourth-quarter net profit of $757 million, down nearly 25 percent from $1.03 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share were $1.23, compared with $1.54 a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.55 for the most recent quarter. Revenue totaled $14.24 billion, down from $14.4 billion a year earlier, but above estimates of $14.18 billion.Caterpillar expects full-year 2015 earnings per share of $4.60, or $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. Analysts had estimated $6.67 for the year.During the fourth quarter, energy and transportation sales rose 11 percent to $6.2 billion, but that was not enough to offset falling mining and construction equipment sales.Caterpillar shares fell as low as $79.16 before cutting losses to $79.40, down 7.7 percent.

The company had said last October it expected 2015 revenue to be flat or slightly up versus 2014.On a conference call, company officials said around 50 percent of the expected sales decline was directly or indirectly related to low oil prices. Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson said that with housing starts and the construction sector expected to do well in 2015 - outside the energy sector - North America is one of ""few bright spots"" for Caterpillar.How low oil prices will affect consumer sentiment, the economy and ultimately Caterpillar's business is hard to tell at this point, executives said.Q4 REVENUES TUMBLE  The Peoria, Illinois-based company reported fourth-quarter net profit of $757 million, down nearly 25 percent from $1.03 billion a year earlier.Earnings per share were $1.23, compared with $1.54 a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.55 for the most recent quarter.Revenue totaled $14.24 billion, down from $14.4 billion a year earlier, but above estimates of $14.18 billion.Caterpillar expects full-year 2015 earnings per share of $4.60, or $4.75 excluding restructuring costs. Analysts had estimated $6.67 for the year.During the fourth quarter, energy and transportation sales rose 11 percent to $6.2 billion, but that was not enough to offset falling mining and construction equipment sales.Caterpillar shares fell as low as $79.16 before cutting losses to $79.40, down 7.7 percent.

The Nikkei was flat at 17,762.13 in mid-morning trade after opening 0.9 percent lower. On Tuesday, it rose 1.7 percent to its highest close since late December.     U.S. stocks fell more than 1 percent in the wake of poor results from Microsoft while heavy machinery maker Caterpillar gave an outlook below expectations, which dragged down Japanese construction equipment makers.     Komatsu Ltd and Hitachi Construction Machinery  dropped 3.3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.     But the Nikkei's losses were being trimmed as U.S. futures rose during Asian trade, a sign that U.S. stocks will likely rebound the next trading day, analysts said.     The S&P futures gained 0.3 percent.     Analysts also said sentiment was supported as the dollar stayed relatively resilient against the yen during Asian trade.      ""The recent U.S. earnings were disappointing, but the mood is not too bad to the point where investors want to be entirely risk averse,"" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.     The dollar was little changed at 118.00 yen, although it was but off last week's high of 118.80 after soft spending data cast doubts about the U.S. economic outlook.     A gauge of U.S. business investment plans unexpectedly fell in December.      Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp  falling 0.4 percent, Honda Motor Co dropping 1.9 percent, and Panasonic Corp rising 1.3 percent.

87,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) on Thursday gave a somber outlook for the rest of 2015, facing stiffening competition thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, weak oil prices bringing a tough energy equipment market and geopolitical tensions posing risks to growth. ""We're still very much focused on market share but ... the competition for every deal has got greater as we've seen the dollar strengthen,"" chief executive Doug Oberhelman said in a call with analysts. The world's largest construction and mining equipment maker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit despite lower sales. It maintained its 2015 forecast and raised its full-year earnings per share outlook. Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar said the strong dollar lowered the cost of imported goods in the first quarter, especially from Japan.     The company said it expected sales and profit for the remaining three quarters of the year to be lower than the first quarter. Caterpillar reported quarterly net income of $1.11 billion or $1.81 per share, up 20 percent from $922 million or $1.44 per share a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, earnings per share totaled $1.86. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.35.  The profit beat came despite a 4 percent decline in sales to $12.7 billion from $13.24 billion a year earlier. That also beat analyst estimates of $12.38 billion.Energy and transportation sales rose slightly, but Caterpillar said that was unlikely to continue amid low oil prices. The company's mining equipment business has already suffered as commodity prices have fallen, while construction equipment sales in North America have remained a bright spot.The company said it expected global gross domestic product growth to hit 2.7 percent in 2015, slightly higher than the 2.6 percent growth in 2014.  But it said ""risks and uncertainties"" including political conflicts and social unrest in the Middle East, Africa and the former Soviet Union could temper growth. Caterpillar also cited ""ongoing uncertainty"" over U.S. monetary policy actions. Chief financial officer Brad Halverson told Reuters Caterpillar hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve takes a cautious approach to raising interest rates, as the company is concerned that raising rates too quickly could cause an economic slowdown. ""It's a question of not moving too fast,"" Halverson said.Caterpillar maintained its 2015 sales outlook of $50 billion and raised its earnings per share forecast to $4.70 from its previous forecast of $4.60.Caterpillar shares were up 45 cents or 0.55 percent at $85.32.

91,"  (Adds comments from Brookings expert, President Obama and senators Schumer, Ayotte)By David LawderWASHINGTON May 14 The Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia revived concerns on Thursday about the crumbling infrastructure in the United States and Washington's failure to address the problem, with U.S. House Speaker John Boehner lashing out at Democrats who linked the two.Boehner, a Republican, said Democrats were wrong to suggest that Amtrak funding cuts were partly to blame for the train crash on Tuesday that killed eight people.Dismissing a reporter's question about Amtrak's budget in light of the accident as ""stupid,"" he said the passenger service's safety programs were adequately funded.""Obviously, it's not about funding,"" the Republican leader told a news conference.""The train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds were there, no funding has been cut from rail safety and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak and authorize a lot of these programs."" But rail experts and Democrats contend that Amtrak budget cuts have caused delays to the installation of ""positive train control"" technology, which can automatically slow or stop a train to prevent an accident.Although Congress in 2008 mandated it for all rail lines by the end of 2015, it was not deployed on the rail yard curve where the train derailed.""There's a lot we don't know, but it does appear clear that if there was this positive train control technology deployed throughout the corridor, particularly around this curve, which has been historically dangerous, that the crash could have been prevented or could have been mitigated,"" said Robert Puentes, an infrastructure expert at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution in Washington.Senator Charles Schumer, the Senate's third-ranking Democrat, called Boehner's comments ""patently false"" and said insufficient funding has delayed positive train control. ""To deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality,"" the New York Democrat added.President Barack Obama called for more investment in infrastructure.""We are a growing country with a growing economy. We need to invest in the infrastructure that keeps us that way. And not just when something bad happens, like a bridge collapse or a train derailment, but all the time,"" he said at a news conference at Camp David in Maryland. In an apparent change of heart, Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte said Congress should re-examine the timing of adoption of positive train control and asked the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to schedule a hearing on the issue.Ayotte was a co-sponsor of legislation passed by the committee that would have given the rail industry five more years, until 2020, to deploy the technology.""The committee should use this hearing to examine the circumstances of the crash in Philadelphia and revisit the issue,"" Ayotte wrote in a letter to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota.The Republican-controlled House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday approved a $262 million cut in Amtrak's capital investment programs as part of a $54 billion spending bill for transportation and housing programs.Tensions on infrastructure funding were rising as a May 31 deadline approached to renew federal Highway Trust Fund spending authority for road, bridge and rail transit projects.Boehner joined other lawmakers on Thursday in acknowledging only a short-term extension of the fund could be arranged by May 31. Some lawmakers pressed for only a two-month extension, while others want to extend transportation authority until the end of 2015.

92,"  (Adds details on House measure, McCarthy comment)By David LawderWASHINGTON May 19 The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed on Tuesday a two-month extension of federal spending authority on transportation projects, delaying decisions over longer-term funding until the Highway Trust Fund is depleted in July.The bipartisan, 387-35 vote sends the measure to the U.S. Senate for approval. Current authority for road, bridge and rail transit projects is due to expire on May 31.The two-month extension resulted from lawmakers' inability to agree on a funding formula for a six-year transportation bill that would cost nearly a half trillion dollars, as well as disagreements over an extension through the end of 2015. Because it relies on the remaining money in the Highway Trust Fund, the House measure requires no offsetting savings.Passage by the Senate and a signature from President Barack Obama would avoid disruptions to job sites as the road construction season reaches full swing. But it sets up a new deadline in July, when the trust fund is due to run dry again. Fed by fuel taxes that have not changed since 1993, the fund has experienced chronic shortfalls in recent years due to rising vehicle fuel economy, fewer miles driven and construction cost inflation. Lawmakers from both parties have ruled out a fuel tax hike despite support for that from trucking and industry groups.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said the two-month extension ""is not the ideal solution."" He blamed Democrats for failing to agree on spending cuts to fund a longer transportation bill. ""Because of that, we were only able to pass a two-month patch and may be forced to yet another short-term patch in the future,"" McCarthy said.State transportation officials and many lawmakers contend that a series of short-term funding patches may keep existing work going, but they do not provide enough long-term funding certainty to launch major new projects.That may cloud the demand outlook for major construction materials, equipment and engineering suppliers such as Cemex , Caterpillar Inc, and Granite Construction .(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Eric Beech)",2015-05-19,CAT,"Tue May 19, 2015 | 6:54pm EDT",UPDATE 1-U.S. House passes transportation spending extension,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-transportation-congress-idUSL1N0YA2MW20150519?type=companyNews

95,"  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported a lower quarterly net profit and sales on Thursday due to weakness in mining, slower construction in Brazil and China, and declining orders for oil-related applications, sending its shares lower in premarket trading. The world's largest construction and mining equipment maker reported second-quarter net income of $710 million, or $1.16 per share, down from $999 million, or $1.57 a share a year earlier. Earnings per share excluding restructuring costs were  $1.27, meeting analysts' expectations, compared with $1.69 in the same quarter a year earlier.  Lower sales volume and weakening currencies including the euro, Japanese yen and Brazilian real led to a decline in second-quarter revenue which fell to $12.3 billion, down 13 percent from $14.2 billion a year earlier.Shares were down nearly 3 percent in premarket trading. The company said the 2015 outlook for profit per share was unchanged at $4.70, or $5.00 excluding restructuring costs. The company expects 2015 revenue of about $49 billion, down $1 billion from its previous forecast, with the downward revision pegged to unfavorable currency exchange rates.  ""We originally set the $50 billion sales and revenues estimate in January, and our expectations haven’t changed much since then. However, currency impacts from a stronger U.S. dollar are causing sales in many countries to translate into fewer dollars than we initially expected,"" Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement.Caterpillar plans to repurchase nearly $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter of 2015.  ""We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and some of that value should be returned to shareholders,"" Oberhelman said on CNBC Thursday morning.

125,"  WASHINGTON Oct 23 U.S. lawmakers will begin voting on Monday on legislation to revive the shuttered Export-Import Bank, a spokeswoman for a leading Republican backer of the bank said on Friday.A so-called ""discharge petition,"" a procedural maneuver that has been successful only a handful of times in the past century, to renew the trade bank's charter matures on Monday.The petition has support from 218 lawmakers, a majority of  the chamber, including 42 Republicans, effectively overruling House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a vocal critic of the bank.Representative Stephen Fincher, who circulated the petition, will start the voting process with a floor motion on Monday, his spokeswoman said. There could be several procedural votes before a vote on final House passage, possibly on Tuesday.House passage could move Congress toward reopening the bank, which offers loans, loan guarantees and trade insurance to U.S. exporters and buyers of U.S. goods such as Caterpillar Inc  heavy equipment and Boeing Co airplanes. But the effort to renew the bank's charter faces obstacles in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is among those who oppose it. The bank's charter expired on June 30, after Hensarling refused to move legislation to extend it, and it has been unable to conduct new business for more than three months. Several companies have announced the loss of export contracts due to the resulting lack of financing.Some conservative Republicans and political groups have targeted the bank as an example of ""corporate welfare"" for large, wealthy companies although supporters point out it also supports small businesses.The move to force a House vote reviving the Export-Import Bank's charter is unusual. ""This is what happens when one chairman refuses to acknowledge the desires of two-thirds of the House and Senate,"" Republican Representative Mike Simpson said.

131,"  (Adds detail on announcement, expected demand, background on rivals)By Joseph WhiteDETROIT - Nov 20 The head of Daimler AG's  commercial truck operation told Reuters Friday the company will invest $375 million at a complex near Detroit to build diesel engines for medium duty trucks, expanding a strategy of building and selling trucks, engines, transmissions and axles as a package.Daimler had previously expanded its Detroit operations to produce heavy-duty automatic transmissions, which have been ""a runaway success,"" Wolfgang Bernhard, head of Daimler's global commercial truck operations, said ahead of an appearance in Detroit Friday.Bernhard said he expects demand for medium and heavy trucks will be ""slightly softer"" in North America next year, but should still be above relatively strong 2014 levels. European demand will be flat and Brazil will ""continue to be very difficult,"" he said. Earlier this week, rival truck maker AB Volvo said it planned to idle its North American factories for a total of 2.5 weeks in December and January to reduce swelling inventories.Bernhard said Daimler, which controls about 40 percent of the U.S. heavy truck market, is not cutting back. Production at its Detroit engine and transmission factories is still running around the clock, seven days a week, he said. Daimler's latest investment in Detroit builds on a strategy Bernhard has pursued to bring engineering and manufacturing of the company's commercial trucks under one roof.Traditionally, especially in North America, heavy truck makers such as Paccar Inc or Navistar International Corp have purchased engines, transmissions, axles and other major components from suppliers such as Cummins Inc , Eaton Corp PLC, Caterpillar Inc or Dana Holding Corp. Government demands to cut carbon dioxide emissions are putting more pressure on commercial vehicle makers. Bernhard said Daimler's response will be to design and engineer itself more of the technology in its vehicles.""We can perfectly optimize those components to each other to get the best fuel economy and reliability,"" he said.Bernhard said Daimler is also using its own technology to develop autonomous driving systems for future commercial vehicles. He said trucks that could drive themselves on open freeways could be available by 2020. Daimler is testing autonomous driving technology on heavy trucks in Germany and the United States.(Reporting By Joe White; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2015-11-20,CAT,"Fri Nov 20, 2015 | 10:11am EST",UPDATE 1-Daimler to invest $375 mln to build diesel engines,http://www.reuters.com//article/daimler-trucks-idUSL1N13F0W620151120?type=companyNews

146,"   By Alwyn Scott and David Lawder | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON A delay in appointing U.S. Export-Import Bank board members threatens to cost Boeing Co (BA.N) sales, the company's chief executive said on Thursday, flagging an issue that also affects General Electric (GE.N) and other U.S. companies that depend on the agency's export financing.Boeing is on the verge of losing orders because only two of five seats on the agency's board are filled, not enough to approve deals over $10 million, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said at EXIM's annual conference in Washington.The appointment of a third board member would allow the agency to help finance billions of dollars in sales of U.S. aircraft, rail, power and communications equipment around the world, EXIM Chairman Fred Hochberg said. ""We've got about $10 billion (worth of loans and guarantees) in our pipeline right now,"" that are being held up because of the short-handed board, Hochberg said in an interview. ""If exports slow in the areas that require our financing, it will also hit the supply chain"" of 14,000 U.S. companies that supply Boeing, and jobs, he added. Confirmation of a third member has been halted by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby's moratorium on some of the 16 Obama administration financial nominees who have been awaiting panel confirmation, effectively blocking sales for Boeing, GE, Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and other companies. Muilenburg said Ethiopian Airlines [ETHA.UL] was among the customers concerned that a lack of EXIM financing could prevent it from buying more Boeing planes. Banks have been cautious about offering loans of 10 years or more to smaller carriers or ones with higher credit risk without a government guarantee, and some experts have voiced concern that if Boeing self-financed such deals, it would drain resources from product development.Industry sources say Boeing already has had to provide or arrange bridge financing for several airlines because of the gap in EXIM funds. Last year Boeing said it lost two signed or potential satellite deals after EXIM's charter lapsed on June 30. The charter was renewed later in the year.General Electric decided to move some production overseas to use foreign export credit.This year, global jetliner sales have slowed as an industry-wide boom in orders fades, making export credit more important.  Boeing plans to trim production of its 777 jetliner in 2017. On Thursday it said it delivered 176 airliners in the first quarter. That pace is below Boeing's target of 740 to 745 deliveries for the year, but many deliveries are made later in the year.Muilenburg also voiced support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that has been an issue in the U.S. presidential campaigns. He said the pact would not put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. He added that the defense industry needed a ""dependable, robust"" U.S. defense budget so it could invest.

149,"   By Meredith Davis  Caterpillar Inc, the world's largest maker of heavy machinery, on Friday lowered its 2016 sales and earnings outlook as steep declines in revenue from its construction, oil and gas and rail business segments hurt quarterly profit.Caterpillar, which has seen demand for equipment used in the energy and mining industries hit hard by a drop in commodity prices, experienced lower sales in the first quarter across all regions. To help stem the slide, Caterpillar cut about 8,600 jobs and closed nearly 15 facilities so far as part of a restructuring plan announced in 2015.Even so, Caterpillar said it is encouraged by improvement in demand for heavy machinery in China. ""Infrastructure projects are starting and for the first time in a few years, we're seeing stronger demand from China,"" said Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson. In fact, Chinese sales of construction equipment are up slightly year-over-year, the company said. The Peoria, Illinois company now expects 2016 earnings per share at $3.00, or $3.70 per share excluding restructuring costs. The previous forecast was $3.50 per share, or $4.00 per share, excluding restructuring costs. The company also trimmed its 2016 sales outlook range to $40 billion to $42 billion against a previous forecast $40 billion to $44 billion. ""Our sense is that investors will continue to worry that second half of the 2016 forecast are still a stretch as revenue and pricing trends will both need to improve to hit targets,"" Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said in a note.  In the first quarter the company’s dealers said global retail machinery sales were down 13 percent, compared with the previous year. PROFIT SLUMPS Caterpillar reported operating income of $494 million, or 67 cents per share in the first quarter, down from a revised $1.70 billion, or $2.07 a share, a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 68 cents.  Including restructuring costs, Caterpillar earned 46 cents per share, compared with a revised $2.03 a year earlier. Revenue fell to $9.46 billion from $12.7 billion a year ago.While all regions reported slumping revenue, the hardest hit was Latin America, where sales fell 43 percent, due to the area's widespread economic weakness, a company statement said.    Caterpillar said while its cash flow has decreased from $1.04 billion to $218 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to lower profits, it is focused on maintaining its credit rating and dividend.

155,"   By Fang Yan and Lee Chyen Yee | BEIJING/SINGAPORE  BEIJING/SINGAPORE Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), the world's largest maker of heavy equipment, has raised hopes that China's battered construction sector may be showing signs of life, pointing to its strongest post-holiday period in three years after a government boost.Ahead of a key week for the heavy equipment sector, with progress reports expected from rivals like Japan's Komatsu (6301.T) to China's Sany Heavy Industry (600031.SS), Caterpillar said late on Friday that it was seeing shipment activity holding up almost three months after the Chinese New Year holiday.""It is not a hockey stick, it is not a boom, it is not a 2010 - but it is the first time we have seen that happen and we have lifted our schedules as a result of that this year,"" said Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive.""We will see how long that goes.""China's economic growth slowed down in the first quarter to its weakest pace since 2009, but signs that the quarter ended on a stronger note have prompted some analysts to raise their forecasts for GDP in 2016.One of the strong notes is a pick up in the property sector, where investment growth quickened in March. Premier Li Keqiang, worried about pressure on the economy, has also promised new infrastructure projects will be launched in a timely manner. These factors have spurred a rally in China's commodities markets. Rebar steel futures have shot up more than 50 percent this year.A bellwether for global industrial demand, Caterpillar has been exporting bulldozers and diggers to China for almost four decades - and since 2012 has also been one of many high profile casualties of the country's slackening construction and mining sectors, having failed to predict the downturn.Its positive comments now, analysts said, hint at signs of life in a sector that is still debating the long-term impact of the effort to boost construction - for example, the improvement in Chinese local government's budgets to carry out projects.Some local rivals agree with Caterpillar's assessment and say they see signs of life, crediting state stimulus efforts, as well as tougher emissions standards, which mean buyers are advancing purchases to avoid tougher rules and pricier models. According to UBS analysts, Chinese excavator sales by non-Chinese manufacturers have increased year on year in February and March this year - the first rise in two years.But, as with Caterpillar, the jury is still out on the  sustainability of the rebound.While players like Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd (601100.SS), which feeds into the industry's domestic supply chain, are targeting a jump in revenues - a fifth for Hengli in 2016 after a flat 2015 - others are less certain. ""Even if there is a recovery, it's still very vulnerable,"" said Liu Chunyu, vice president in charge of domestic sales at Shantui Construction Machinery Co (000680.SZ).Late last week, for example, loss-making, debt-burdened Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Co (1157.HK) (000157.SZ) posted a record quarterly loss, hot on the heels of its lowest annual profit in 15 years.As for Caterpillar, Oberhelman said the worse may not be over, despite a post Chinese New Year period that has seen almost 90 days of sustained shipments.""I'm not going to declare a bottom in China,"" he said. ""I am cautious, but that is a better statistic than we have had.""

167,"   By Lucia Mutikani and Malathi Nayak | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. business investment, already heading for its worst slowdown since the global financial crisis, could decline further as Britain's vote to leave the European Union creates more risks for companies, economists say.With growth tepid at home, North American companies as diverse as plane maker Boeing Co (BA.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and oil producer Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) now will find themselves trying to plan overseas spending without knowing whether Britain's departure from the EU will upend tariff rules.""The 'leave' outcome has introduced substantial uncertainty that likely would dampen U.S. growth by delaying and or reducing business investment and consumption expenditures,"" said William Lee, head of North America Economics at Citigroup in New York.Lee said U.S. multinational corporations face difficult strategic challenges - including assessing the U.K.'s future status as a gateway to the E.U. and London's role as a financial center - that could crimp spending enough to reduce potential growth levels and real incomes.U.S. business spending on capital equipment dropped over the last two quarters and contracted in the first quarter at its quickest pace in seven years. A further decline in the second quarter would be the first time since the 2007-09 recession that it contracted for three straight quarters.Jim Farley, top European executive for automaker Ford, had warned a ""Brexit"" outcome could impact ""potential future investment.""Caterpillar has voiced concern any changes in trade rules for its UK base would impact its European supply chain. While recognizing that UK exit negotiations will be complex, Caterpillar's UK chief Mark Dorsett urged leaders in a statement to ensure ""single market access issues be prioritized to lessen the negative impact on business.""And Exxon, the world's largest-publicly traded oil company, said ""the barrier-free movement of goods, people and capital across borders is important for a business like ours with operations across Europe.""After the Brexit vote, Boeing said in a statement that as a global business ""we constantly manage changes in political circumstances and we will continue to do so now with the evolving situation in the UK and Europe.""Mark Grayson, a spokesman for PhRMA, the trade group representing pharmaceutical companies, said it is not yet clear whether Britain will move to set up its own agency to approve drugs, or opt to simply follow EU rules. SOFTER SPENDING AT HOME Data from the U.S. Commerce Department on Friday showed non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell for a second straight month in May. These so-called core capital goods orders have increased in six of the last 17 months. ""Remember too that Brexit is occurring while the U.S. economy is in the later stages of its current business cycle, meaning the U.S. is more susceptible to economic shocks,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York. ""There is, happily, a lot less leverage in the system than there was in 2007, meaning no recession of equal magnitude is threatened,"" Blitz said.Economists said heightened uncertainty over Brexit could spill into the labor market and hurt consumer sentiment headed into November's U.S. presidential election.""Concern over another euro area crisis could slow U.S. growth in the next couple of quarters through weak financial markets and declining business and consumer confidence,"" said Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.He estimates Brexit could lower gross domestic product growth by an average of two-tenths of a percentage point over the next six quarters.""This could be reinforced by concern about the U.S. presidential election,"" Harris added.

According to Caterpillar, the largest decline in machinery sales was in Latin America, down 38 percent from a year ago.""The demand environment continues to be weak in Latin America,"" Lawrence De Maria, an analyst at William Blair said in a research note. ""There is limited visibility on how long the recession lasts,"" De Maria said.Caterpillar, the world's largest heavy equipment manufacturer, is scheduled to report second-quarter results on July 26 and analysts expect earnings per share to be 96 cents on $10 billion in revenue.

In June, a company spokesperson said Caterpillar's first-quarter outlook reflected expectations of 2016 as the fourth down year of sales and revenues. Total machinery sales were also down 12 percent in North America, down 7 percent in the Asia Pacific region, and down 4 percent in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region for the rolling three month period ending in June.  All four main geographic regions, North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa, were down double digits in Caterpillar's Resource Industries segment, which mainly sells equipment for the mining industry. ""Mining-related businesses have taken another leg down because of the depressed commodity prices, but there is some optimism that it could stabilize next year,"" De Maria said.

170,"   By Meredith Davis  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) shares rallied Tuesday on better-than-expected second quarter earnings, even as the heavy machinery maker lowered its full-year forecast amid sluggish demand in mining and other industries.Caterpillar shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, rose 4.7 percent to their highest level this year. ""They cut (full-year) guidance but they did beat this quarter. They seem to be setting themselves up for at least being able to meet or beat expectations in the future by addressing it now,"" said Jim Corridore, analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""The company controlled costs during the quarter and, given a very difficult environment, they are executing well,"" Corridore said.  Caterpillar said global uncertainty persists, and the recent vote in Britain to leave the European Union and the attempted coup in Turkey have heightened risks, especially in Europe.A weakened global economy, combined with persistent political uncertainty, kept sales of new machinery sluggish. Sales fell 16 percent to $10.34 billion from a year ago. ""We're not expecting an upturn in important industries like mining, oil and gas and rail to happen this year,"" Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman said in a statement.     The company said commodity prices ""appear to have stabilized, but at low levels."" EARNINGS BEAT  The company's $1.09 in earnings per share, excluding restructuring costs, was above analysts' expectations of 96 cents. Despite better-than-predicted second-quarter earnings, the world's largest construction and mining equipment maker lowered its full-year sales and profit forecast for the second time this year. It now expects 2016 sales between $40 billion and $40.5 billion, down from $40 billion to $42 billion.Caterpillar expects 2016 earnings of $2.75 per share, or $3.55 excluding restructuring costs, down from $3.00, or $3.70 excluding restructuring costs. It also raised estimated expenses for restructuring during 2016 to $700 million, from $550 million.In 2015, Caterpillar announced a restructuring plan that would cut more than 10,000 jobs and consolidate or close manufacturing facilities through 2018. So far, it reduced global full-time and flexible workforce by 13,900 to 100,000 employees, and said Tuesday there are plans for additional reductions. With regard to the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson noted there has been a lot of discussion about trade. The company would like to see policy that would help create jobs, one of which is free trade, Halverson said, as over half of the company's products manufactured at two plants in Illinois are exported.""Our ability to be able to compete in a global environment is important to our business.

199,"   By Meredith Davis  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) has had a slight increase in aftermarket equipment part sales and dealer quotes to rebuild large mining trucks in recent months, but not enough to call it a sales recovery, company executives said on Tuesday. The world's largest construction and mining equipment maker  posted a third-quarter profit of $283 million, or 48 cents per share, down from a revised $559 million, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, earnings per share came to 85 cents, exceeding analysts' estimates of 76 cents. ""Really this is the first time in a long time, that's  happened. We have not had big numbers, but a little increase,"" Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson said in a telephone interview.  While the slight increase in part sales and rebuild quotes hint at a change in customer sentiment, the machinery manufacturer gave an overall downbeat forecast when it reported a lower third-quarter profit. Revenue fell to $9.2 billion from about $11 billion. Analysts had expected $9.8 billion.  Shares of Caterpillar were down 1.7 percent at $84.53. Caterpillar said demand for new heavy machinery has suffered because of global economic weakness and an abundance of used equipment.""When demand goes down, dealers want to hold onto less. So that has put some downward pressure on our sales (to dealers),""  Caterpillar Vice President of finance Mike DeWalt said in a telephone interview.The company also cut its full-year revenue outlook for the second time while increasing its estimate of 2016 restructuring costs. The company estimated 2016 restructuring costs at $800 million, compared with a previous forecast of $700 million.So far, it has reduced its global full-time and flexible workforce by 14,100 to 108,800 employees as part of the restructuring plan, which runs through 2018.The company said it expected construction-related equipment sales for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 to be lower than  previously anticipated.  ""Many of our businesses, including mining, oil and gas, rail and construction, are currently operating well below historical replacement demand levels in many parts of the world,"" Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman said in a statement. Caterpillar forecast 2016 profit at $3.25 per share, excluding restructuring costs. Analysts were expecting $3.50.  The company said it expected full-year revenue of about $39 billion, down from a prior outlook of $40.0 billion to $40.5 billion.Last week, Caterpillar said Jim Umpleby, who heads its energy and transportation division, would replace Oberhelman as CEO on Jan. 1.

204,"  Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) said on Friday its global retail sales declined 12 percent for the three months ended October, but the pace of the decline is less steep than in previous months, the data shows. Three-month rolling retail sales ending in September and August were down 17 percent and 18 percent respectively. A year ago three-month sales ended in October were down 16 percent. While the retail sales decline rate slowed in both the North American and Europe/Africa/Middle Eastern regions, the Asia/Pacific region saw some growth. Total retail sales in Caterpillar's Asia/Pacific region were up 12 percent, boosted by construction machinery sales, resulting in the third consecutive month of sales growth in the region. Overall, the company's retail sales remain weak, but are not getting worse, Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said in a research note published on Friday.While Caterpillar shares are up more than 30 percent from a year ago, most recently the shares have jumped nearly 9 percent since November 8, U.S. Election day.  Investors expect President-elect Donald Trump will be pro-U.S. infrastructure spending, though funding details of his proposed $1 trillion plan are not yet clear, analysts have said. Even so, the company would not likely benefit from any U.S. infrastructure investment until late 2017, Amy Campbell, Caterpillar's director of investor relations, said last week during a conference.  ""It's going to take some time for large infrastructure projects, for the funding to come in, for the projects to be planned, and for orders of equipment to be delivered,"" Campbell said.
