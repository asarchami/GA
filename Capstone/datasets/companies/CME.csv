0,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Jan 6 CME Group Inc, the world's largest futures exchange operator, said on Monday it moved its primary backup data center to New York from Chicago last month to make its backup facilities more secure and reliable.CME, owner of the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange, moved the backup center to space in the building that houses the Nymex trading floor in lower Manhattan, Securities and Exchange Commission documents show.The center is the company's ""primary backup for electronic trading, clearing and regulatory infrastructures,"" according to the documents.CME's backup site for electronic trading, which comprises the majority of its trading volume, had previously been located in Chicago, about 50 miles from the company's main data center in Aurora, Illinois.The move makes CME the latest financial firm to increase the physical distance between its main and backup data centers to reduce risks from large-scale disruptions in one geographic area, such as those caused by extreme weather. CME told regulators the change ""will help to ensure that CME has sufficient physical, technological and personnel resources to enable the timely recovery and resumption of operations following disruptions, resulting in an increase in reliability and security of its backup data facilities,"" the SEC said in a Dec. 31 order approving the move.The move also will decrease the risk of disruptions in connectivity because the New York data center ""will feature single IP connectivity,"" according to the order. Chicago-based CME had been developing plans for an out-of-region backup data center for more than a year, a company spokeswoman said on Monday. She declined to detail the costs of the switch and said it was unrelated to a cyber attack on CME in July.The New York site previously operated ""in part as a tertiary data center"" for CME, according to SEC documents. CME told regulators it planned to redesign the site to make it an ""all disaster recovery data center.""Regulators have been encouraging firms to increase the physical distances between main and backup sites since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, crippled New York's financial system for days. Direct Edge, a stock exchange operator, last year completed a move of its backup data center to Chicago from New Jersey, which also was home to its main data facility.The company wanted more distance between its main and backup data equipment and a ""diversity of infrastructure"" that supports the equipment, such as electrical power, said Kevin Carrai, head of market data and connectivity services.""We really haven't seen any negatives from our decision to do this,"" he said.BATS Global Markets, a stock and options market operator, also moved its backup data center to Chicago from New Jersey, which was home to its main data center.",2014-01-06,CME,"Mon Jan 6, 2014 | 6:32pm EST",CME Group relocates backup data center to New York,http://www.reuters.com//article/cme-data-move-idUSL2N0KG1YC20140106?type=companyNews
1,"  CHICAGO Jan 29 CME Group Inc has sold the building that housed the Kansas City Board of Trade to a Kansas-based real estate company for an undisclosed sum, representatives of the exchange operator said on Wednesday.The 166,000-square-foot building was sold to Mariner Real Estate Management in all-cash transaction, according to a statement from Holly Duran Real Estate Partners, CME Group's real estate adviser.CME Group owned a majority of the building, and Highwood Properties Inc held a minority stake. Terms of the deal were not being disclosed, a CME spokeswoman said. Chicago-based CME Group has reduced its real-estate portfolio as the shift to electronic trading made it less attractive for exchange operators to own real estate for traditional open-outcry pits. Last year the company sold the home of its New York Mercantile Exchange for $200 million and agreed to lease back the trading floor and some office space. In 2012, it sold most of the historic Chicago Board of Trade building to a consortium of real-estate companies for $151.5 million and leased back space.CME Group bought the Kansas City Board of Trade in 2012 and shifted trading of its wheat futures and options to Chicago in 2013.",2014-01-29,CME,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 2:08pm EST",CME Group sells Kansas City Board of Trade building,http://www.reuters.com//article/cmegroup-kcbt-idUSL2N0L31RU20140129?type=companyNews

Chief Executive Phupinder Gill, 53, kept his base salary of $1 million.CME Group, the largest U.S. futures exchange operator, had no immediate comment on the executives salaries. Duffy, whose prior contract was due to expire at the end of 2015, will remain in his position through the end of 2017, according to the extended employment contract.

3,"  By Aruna ViswanathaWASHINGTON, March 10 Parts of a lawsuit filed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp against the top U.S. derivatives regulator in a fight over swaps data will be allowed to proceed, a U.S. federal judge ruled.The DTCC sued the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the way it allowed DTCC rivals CME Group Inc and IntercontinentalExchange to gather potentially lucrative swap trading data.U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson dismissed three claims in the DTCC lawsuit and said the court could not review them because the allegations did not deal with any final action by the CFTC, according to an order on Monday.Underlying the dispute is a struggle between Wall Street, represented by the DTCC, and Chicago's powerful commodity trading companies over who will control swaps data. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law called for the creation of swap data warehouses tasked with storing all transactional trade data for over-the-counter derivatives to help regulators police the market for potential abuses.The DTCC filed its lawsuit last May after the CFTC gave the two futures exchanges the OK to send client data to their own proprietary data warehouses.A swap is a financial instrument that derives its value from something else, such as an interest rate, and is typically used to hedge against potential future risks. DTCC, a financial services group controlled by investment banks that deals in post-trade transactions, operates its own rival data warehouse and said the CFTC's decision is anticompetitive. DTCC wants clients to have the choice where their data go.One of the DTCC claims Jackson dismissed dealt with some revisions the CFTC made in answers to frequently asked questions that it had posted on its website to help guide the industry. The other two claims targeted a rule by ICE that went into effect automatically through ""self-certification,"" a process that fast-tracks rule approvals if the CFTC opts not to act on it.Jackson said only ""final agency actions"" are reviewable by the court under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs how federal agencies draft rules.Under that reasoning, she did allow DTCC's claims against a similar CME rule to move forward because the CFTC had approved that rule through a formal rulemaking process.""We are pleased that the judge has given the green light to the core of our case,"" DTCC general counsel Larry Thompson said in a statement. ""We continue to believe that CME Rule 1001 is anticompetitive and undermines the core pro-competitive principles of the Dodd-Frank Act.""A CFTC spokesman had no immediate comment.",2014-03-10,CME,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 5:05pm EDT",UPDATE 2-U.S. court OKs part of DTCC lawsuit against CFTC,http://www.reuters.com//article/cftc-lawsuit-swaps-idUSL2N0M71A320140310?type=companyNews

6,"  * CME aluminium contract to be physically deliverable* CME sees contract as ""robust and significant"" in 2-3 years* MillerCoors sees contract as ""a potentially useful tool""   (Adds details about warehousing, paragraphs 9-12)By Susan ThomasLONDON, March 18 CME Group Inc will launch a North American physically deliverable aluminium futures contract in May that could compete with the London Metal Exchange's (LME) $54 billion market.The move comes after the LME has implemented sweeping reforms to its metals warehousing system after a years-long crisis that has undermined its own aluminium futures contract.""We have had a high level of engagement from major market participants, as well as smaller players, who are looking for an alternative to the exchange contract they have today and who want to be able to manage price risk,"" Harriet Hunnable, managing director of metals at CME Group, told Reuters.Hunnable said a CME team had been signing up participants for months, and that in two or three years it will be ""robust and a significant size"". The new contract will begin trading on May 5, pending regulatory approval, she said.CME said in October it would launch the contract and has been canvassing producers, traders and end-users for months. The new contract has the approval of at least one large consumer of aluminium, MillerCoors, which uses aluminium to make drinks cans.""It's one of the single largest commodity price risks we face today as a company and an industry,"" Tim Weiner, MillerCoors global risk manager, said in the CME's statement.""We see this North American aluminum contract, which will combine both the underlying price of aluminum along with the premium, as a potentially useful tool to help us eliminate many hedge accounting issues.""JPMorgan Chase & Co's Henry Bath unit, Scale Distribution, part owned by Australia's Macquarie Group , and C Steinweb have applied to be warehousing firms in three different cities for the new contract. If approved, Henry Bath will be in New Orleans, Scale Distribution will operate in Ypsilanti, Michigan and Steinweg in Baltimore, the CME said in a notice to members following the announcement.Ypsilanti is near Detroit, the focus of regulatory and legal scrutiny in a long-running controversy over the LME's warehousing policy.Long wait times and incentives paid by LME-registered warehouse operators, owned by Wall Street banks and big merchants, have distorted supplies and inflated physical prices in a market awash with an estimated 10-million tonne surplus, metals consumer and manufacturers have said.U.S., British and European regulators are now investigating the issue and the exchange, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Glencore Xstrata PLC are among those targeted in a series of class-action lawsuits. NEW MEASURES The LME's new owners, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing  will implement a series of measures on April 1 aimed at curbing wait times for users to take delivery of metal, placating users and protecting its stronghold in the global base metals market.Some aluminium users have said the measures do not go far enough while Russian aluminium producer Rusal says it goes too far.Rusal is seeking court permission for a judicial review, hoping to quash the LME moves it says may undermine the price at which the company sells its products.Still, despite the uncertainty over the LME's warehousing  revamp, the CME might find it hard to lure money away from a deeply entrenched benchmark, which took some seven years to win over producers after its launch in 1978.There are very few examples of new commodity contracts dislodging a critical portion of liquidity from an established market.The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), now owned by CME, struggled for 10 years to gain traction with a North American aluminium contract before delisting it in 2009. It was unable to lure established users away from London.

7,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Andy HomeLONDON, March 19 CME Group will launch a physically delivered North American aluminium contract this May.It represents the most credible challenge to the London Metal Exchange's (LME) pricing franchise in the global aluminium market since ... well, since the CME's previous aluminium contract.It's easy to forget now, but CME has been here before. Twice.The first foray by CME predecessor COMEX into aluminium trading fizzled out in 1989. It tried again in 1999 with a fully deliverable contract.At one stage in 2003, COMEX-registered warehouses in Owensboro, Maceo and Clarksville held almost 200,000 tonnes of aluminium. But by then the initial trading impetus had already faded, and the contract lapsed into a long period of dormancy before being finally put out of its misery in 2009.Will it be third time lucky for CME?Certainly, the breakdown of the existing aluminium pricing model, starting in the U.S. Midwest, has created a genuine need for a new hedging tool-kit.The question is whether CME can capitalise on this before the LME itself reacts.PRICING BREAKDOWN Pricing in the aluminium market has historically been similar to other industrial metals traded on the LME.The LME generated a global reference price, overlaying which was a physical premium representing the additional cost to be paid by an aluminium user to get the stuff delivered to the door-step.The relationship between the parts and the whole, the ""all-in"" price, was generally stable, albeit with regional variability depending on local supply-demand dynamics.Over the last few years, however, that pricing model has splintered, with the premium accounting for an ever-rising part of the ""all-in"" price.  *******************************************************  Graphic on global aluminium premiums:  link.reuters.com/cyr27v  Graphic on Japanese quarterly premiums vs ""all-in"" price:  link.reuters.com/der27v  ******************************************************* Views in the aluminium industry as to why this has happened are polarized.Aluminium consumers including drinks companies such as MillerCoors have laid the blame on the LME warehouse system, specifically the long load-out queues to get metal out of locations such as Detroit. Some are even pursuing legal action against the LME and its warehouse operators.Producers and parts of the analyst community are not so sure, arguing that the queues themselves are symptoms of deeper problems, particularly the combination of huge legacy stocks and investors' appetite for financing those stocks in a negative real interest rate environment.The only thing that both sides of this often heated argument agree on is that, as of now, there is a real risk-management problem for the entire aluminium supply chain.The premium, or as it is now frequently described, the discount to the ""all-in"" price, cannot be properly hedged.When it was a relatively stable and small component of the ""all-in"" price, that was not a problem. When it accounts for 20 percent and more, as it did at the start of this year, it opens up a black hole in risk management programmes. GETTING PHYSICAL The CME has already moved into that pricing gap with the launch last April of a cash-settled contract based on Platts' assessment of the U.S. Midwest premium <0#AUP:>Its volumes last year were 3,475 tonnes. They have surged to over 16,000 tonnes in the first two months of 2014.Fanning the jump in activity was the early-year explosion in the Midwest premium to over 20 cents per lb (equivalent to over $440 per tonne).The move, which caught just about everyone by surprise, appears to have been caused by a distressed short or shorts among the financial players who started to get involved in the premium market last year.That pinpoints one of the weaknesses of the existing contract, namely its lack of deliverability.Being short any commodity futures market can prove costly if the price moves higher. Being short a physical premium without having the physical units to deliver or the option of deliverability exponentially compounds the problem.Which is why CME is now looking at a fully physically delivered offering with warehouses in New Orleans, Baltimore and Ypsilanti, Michigan, which is just outside Detroit, where the LME's aluminium warehouse woes started. LIQUIDITY, CREDIBILITY That there is demand for such a product is not in doubt. Whether CME is the best provider of that contract remains to be seen.It has two major hurdles to overcome for the new contract to be successful, the same two problems that stymied its previous moves into the aluminium market.The first is liquidity. A physically deliverable product must be fed with physical metal liquidity.CME can boast early buy-in from aluminium users such as MillerCoors and sheet manufacturer Tri-Arrows Aluminium, both of which contributed positive quotes to Tuesday's press announcement.But physical liquidity requires the buy-in of producers and merchants as well, precisely the players who have been benefiting from the recent surge in premiums thanks to their natural long positioning.There are only a handful of such big players operating in the North American aluminium market, and most, if not all of them, are already wedded to LME pricing.Which is the second big hurdle facing CME. How does it take on an existing LME reference point that is deeply and intricately embedded within the industry's pricing model, even if that model looks increasingly flawed?That challenge could prove even more daunting if the LME itself decides to go down the regional premium pricing route as it has publicly indicated it might.Any commodities hedger would naturally prefer to use a single exchange for risk management, simply to avoid duplication of costs and processes. Since most active aluminium hedgers will already be using the LME basis price, an LME regional premium contract has a built-in advantage over a new rival such as that being proposed by CME.Assuming, of course, that the LME does indeed go ahead with its own premium contracts.CME has just thrown down the gauntlet. Will the LME pick it up to defend its $54 billion franchise?If it does, the ensuing battle would mark the opening of a new chapter in the history of base metals pricing.

8,"  (New throughout, adds comments from CME Group, option traders)By Frank TangNEW YORK, March 20 U.S. derivatives exchange operator CME Group Inc said on Thursday it will launch shorter-term weekly energy and metal option contracts beginning in April in a bid to boost trading volume.Chicago-based CME Group said it will launch crude oil, natural gas, gold, silver and copper weekly options on the trading floors and the Globex electronic platform effective Sunday, April 13 for trade date Monday, April 14.The options, which expire on Fridays, offer participants greater flexibility to manage risk and speculate around major U.S. economic indicators such as the monthly nonfarm payrolls, said Miguel Vias, CME Group's director of metal products. Vias said the products also offer a new opportunity to arbitrage with the options of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold exchange-traded fund. The gold ETF options also expire on Fridays.""Structurally, they fit a need that the market doesn't have right now,"" said Vias. ""If we start to get volatility in the short term, they offer people a real opportunity to protect themselves and to speculate."" CME Group said the new products are based on the popular weekly options in other asset classes such as interest rates, equities and agricultural products.In 2012, CME Group also launched short-term gold options, which offer daily expiration five business days forward. Those options are rarely traded due to low interest. COMEX gold options floor trader Jonathan Jossen said the weekly options could very well boost trading volume for the CME Group because new option products are likely to increase trading flows to its existing monthly options.The new product could also help the CME Group win market share from the over-the-counter option market, which offers more customized products in terms of duration and strike prices, traders said.""If it was to catch a following and have open interest and market makers providing liquidity, I would be interested to participate in that market,"" said Albert Ng, a market maker in COMEX gold options and portfolio manager at Aurum Options Strategies.

10,"   By Josephine Mason | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A British court ruling that has set back the London Metal Exchange's sweeping warehouse reforms has handed CME Group an unexpected windfall just weeks before it launches an audacious challenge to the world's biggest aluminum contract.The High Court in London ruled on Thursday in favor of Russia's United Company Rusal, the world's biggest aluminum producer, which feared prices of its products would suffer from the LME's efforts to make owners of warehouses in the exchange's global network deliver metal more quickly to consumers.It was a major setback for the LME just days before it was due to introduce measures it hoped would solve a deepening crisis over its aluminum contract, its biggest and most liquid.While a blow for metal users, which have complained for years above logjams in the warehouse networks, the ruling cheered producers such as Alcoa Inc., whose shares rose more than 6 percent. It could also be a short-term boon to warehouse owners such as Goldman Sachs and Glencore.But many say those gains will prove fleeting, as the LME will likely find some way to forge ahead with new rules.Instead, the most lasting benefits may go to the CME, which is now in the process of convincing the 50 million-ton aluminum industry to upend three decades of LME pricing and switch to the CME's upstart contract.It's not easy feat, with doubts whether there is sufficient interest, but Thursday's ruling will go a long way toward helping. ""There are still some question marks about liquidity, but if they wanted a perfect storm to attract some volume, then this provides it,"" said Nicholas Snowdon, a base metals analyst at Barclays Capital.The CME declined to comment on Thursday.UNCERTAINTY RETURNS With just over a month before the CME is due to launch a contract that will challenge the LME's long-held dominance, the UK ruling has plunged the metal industry back into uncertainty. It is unclear whether the LME will appeal the ruling or restart what could be as much as a year-long review process. Logjams in its vast network of warehouses and record high physical premiums have plagued the exchange's management for four years, sparking a U.S. regulatory probe and angering consumers, which say the higher prices are costing them billions of dollars each year.Some market participants have questioned whether the Chicago-based exchange is ready for the launch, with many details still to be announced officially.The CME's director of metals research, Young-Jin Chang, told a conference last week that three shapes of aluminum - ingot, sows and T-Bar - will be deliverable against the contract, according to participants at the conference. But it is not clear which producers' metal will be deliverable. Three warehousing companies have applied to run storage in three U.S. cities for the new contract, and others are expected to follow.The new contract has the approval of at least one large consumer of aluminum, MillerCoors, which uses the metal to make drinks cans and has criticized the LME's handling of the problem.But some market participants have questioned if the exchange has enough in its arsenal to woo users from the LME's deeply entrenched benchmark.Snowdon said business from consumers, traders and producers will be critical for the success of the new contract, since it is unlikely to attract much institutional interest.There are very few examples of new commodity contracts dislodging a critical portion of liquidity from an established market.""How can you launch a new contract when the full spec hasn't been published yet?"" said one market source.(Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2014-03-28,CME,"Fri Mar 28, 2014 | 3:37am EDT",LME ruling creates 'perfect storm' for CME's aluminum bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-metals-warehouse-cme-analysis-idUSBREA2R0CL20140328?type=companyNews

12,"  (Adds timing in 10th paragraph)By Douwe MiedemaWASHINGTON, March 31 A U.S. Treasury Department unit said on Monday it had signed a formal agreement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to help it sort out a raft of derivatives data and get a better handle on the global $690 trillion market.The CFTC, which oversees futures and swaps, has complained it still is not getting a full and clear picture of what is  happening in the derivatives market because the data it receives from market participants is not adequate.""Each of the (companies) has different systems architecture and reporting technology,"" said the memorandum of understanding between the CFTC and the Treasury's Office of Financial Research. ""These differences have created challenges to CFTC's efforts to review, analyze and aggregate the data."" The OFR was set up after the 2007-09 financial crisis to help regulators get better data on the institutions and markets they oversee, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law gave it sweeping powers to collect the data.Reuters reported last week that infighting between market parties is one reason why CFTC still does not get good quality swaps data, something it has been complaining about ever since buyers and sellers were required to report trades more than a year ago. Also, the three main data providers, or Swap Data Repositories, use different formats, making it all but impossible to aggregate the information.A CFTC working group is now meeting regularly with the industry to agree on standards, harmonizing such data fields as a timestamp. The joint OFR/CFTC project would build on this work and would involve another working group with staff of the two agencies, they said. The swaps market is dominated by large financial service companies like Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase & Co  and Citigroup Inc.

13,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON, March 31  WASHINGTON, March 31 A U.S. Treasury Department unit said Monday it had signed a formal agreement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to help it sort out a raft of derivatives data and get a better handle on the global $690 trillion market.The CFTC, which oversees futures and swaps, has complained it still is not getting a full and clear picture of what is  happening in the derivatives market because the data it receives from market participants is not adequate.""Each of the (companies) has different systems architecture and reporting technology,"" said the memorandum of understanding between the CFTC and the Treasury's Office of Financial Research. ""These differences have created challenges to CFTC's efforts to review, analyze and aggregate the data."" The OFR was set up after the 2007-09 financial crisis to help regulators get better data on the institutions and markets they oversee, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law gave it sweeping powers to collect the data.Reuters reported last week that infighting between market parties is one reason that the agency still does not get good quality swaps data, something it has been complaining about ever since buyers and sellers were required to report trades more than a year ago. Also, the three main data providers, or Swap Data Repositories, use different formats, making it all but impossible to aggregate the information. A CFTC working group is now meeting regularly with the industry to agree on standards, harmonizing such data fields as a timestamp. The joint OFR/CFTC project would build on this work and would involve another working group with staff of the two agencies, they said.The swaps market is dominated by large financial service companies like Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase & Co  and Citigroup Inc.

14,"  * CME, ICE models curb queue lengths, rents* U.S. more liberal in pricing matters than Europe* Testing competition law is lengthy, highly detailedBy Susan Thomas and Veronica BrownLONDON, April 4 The way U.S. commodities exchanges are dealing with warehouses could offer a template for the London Metal Exchange (LME) to reform its chronically logjammed storage system, the backbone of the world's biggest metals marketplace.But this route to reform could prove difficult, not least because competition law in Europe may rule out solutions that are acceptable in the United States.A London High Court judge last month quashed a key part of the LME's long-awaited plan to shorten the queues that users of aluminium can face to withdraw metal, which they have bought via the exchange, out of warehouses that the LME oversees.Big banks and trade houses that own many of the warehouses in the global network, and charge rent on the stored metal, have profited from letting companies such as drinks can makers wait for months or longer to get hold of the raw material they need.After a tough, divisive consultation among stakeholders, the LME, which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing  had been poised this month to act on the issue.But the court upheld an objection from aluminium producer Rusal, saying the LME consultation process was ""unfair and unlawful"" as it presented only one viable option: reduce queues by limiting how much can be brought in and out each day.The judge said the LME should have publicly considered another alternative that it and many experts said repeatedly would be deemed anti-competitive: banning or capping rent that warehouse operators charge on metal sitting in queues.The ruling handed an opportunity to CME Group, which is launching a challenge to the LME's aluminium contract.Mindful of problems plaguing the LME, CME has imposed rules that will prevent warehousing companies from profiting unduly from long queues and lucrative rents.CME director of metals research Young-Jin Chang told a recent conference in the United States that the exchange would be prepared to intervene to deal with queues longer than 20 days, according to delegates at the conference.It would first tell the warehouse it cannot charge rent on the portion of metal that is late. And if CME needs to take further action, the exchange could forbid the facility from accepting more metal until the late deliveries are resolved.The CME is finalising its rules ahead of launch on May 5, and being ready to clamp down on long wait times will be crucial for the contract's success, market participants have said. For copper in CME warehouses, if deliveries go beyond five days the exchange has a right to tell the warehouse to stop loading in metal.Rusal, which has indicated that it might eventually fall into line with the LME's plan, endorsed CME's approach.""I'm familiar with structures on the COMEX exchange. I think something of that type could work very well but it's really a question for the LME, not Rusal,"" said Steve Hodgson, Rusal's sales and marketing director.The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, which regulates commodities markets, restricts clearing houses and exchanges from adopting rules that could result in unreasonable restraint to trade or impose a material anti-competitive burden.But exchanges could impose major changes, such as on rent charges, if it was considered necessary to keep trade orderly.A U.S. antitrust lawyer said changes could be implemented if they were ""necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act"".""That's baked into U.S. law,"" said the lawyer, who did not want to be named. ICE ACTS Intercontinental Exchange stepped in quickly when some traders and warehouses in cocoa and coffee, seeing how the practices adopted in metals gave players a competitive edge, started looking at the viability of building lucrative queues.ICE brought in new rules, which became effective on April 1, forcing warehouses to stop charging rent for goods that have not been moved within 60 days after a request is made and require additional information to justify warehouse charges.The changes followed ICE's acquisition of NYSE Liffe, including the London-based cocoa and robusta coffee contracts in November, and aligned Liffe's grading and warehouse keeping procedures with those of ICE.But, encouraged by the court ruling against the LME,  European coffee and cocoa warehouse companies plan to seek legal advice on ICE's new rules.While that law sets the standards for U.S. commodity markets, if a U.S. exchange has a subsidiary in Europe which is registered as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) or a registered clearing house (RCH), then the rules are less clear.""If it's ICE Europe and it's registered as a DCO or an RCH, there's some ambiguity as to where the line is. If it's a European exchange or clearing house, it would be a European matter,"" the lawyer said. So the European coffee and cocoa warehouse companies could have a case, and this also highlights the LME's dilemma.A blanket global rule on rents would not work.""In general the U.S. can take a slightly more liberal view on vertical pricing matters, so they take a rule of reason approach to a greater degree than the European Commission typically does,"" said James Marshall, a senior associate at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner LLP.COMPETITION LAW OBSTACLE In Europe, one of the LME's key concerns is probably that banning or influencing rents would be seen as a form of ""resale price maintenance"" which will nearly always breach European competition law, Marshall said.Effectively this means the LME cannot interfere in warehouse rent-setting because companies need to be able to set their prices independently.The LME has said it is unable to comment on the legal advice it is receiving.The other big issue is the LME's unique position as the key metals trading platform for global price setting - it also handles metals including copper, nickel, zinc, lead and tin.""That level of importance restricts the LME's ability to implement new pricing initiatives because that again raises a number of competition issues,"" Marshall said.""But it's not an entirely open and shut case where you can say, yes 'you definitely can or can't do it', there's not always a black line here. Unfortunately it can be a gray area.""There may well be very good reasons for capping or banning rents, but any pro-competitive and pro-consumer benefits would need to outweigh any potential detriment to competition.""There may be ways you can get around the prohibitions if there are very good reasons to do so, but that's the kind of thing that has to assessed on a case by case and granular basis,"" Marshall said.""It's a complicated issue to look at in isolation, and it could take a lot of time and analysis to get to the answer.""

15,"  (Adds comments from CME, broker)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO, April 22 CME Group Inc, the world's largest futures market operator, said on Tuesday it will overhaul the system for setting daily price limits for U.S. grain and oilseed futures to reflect fluctuations in crop prices.Starting on May 1, CME, owner of the Chicago Board of Trade and other exchanges, will apply limits to markets including corn, soybeans and wheat that reset twice a year based on underlying price levels, according to a notice from the exchange operator.CME said it also will remove price limits for all grain and oilseed options. Both changes were approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to the notice. The revised system for futures limits offers traders more flexibility and transparency by allowing price limits to expand under higher prices or retract when prices fall, CME spokesman Chris Grams said.The limits will be reset on the first trading day in May and the first trading day in November. On May 1, the initial daily limit for corn will drop to 35 cents a bushel from 40 cents. The initial daily limit will rise to $1.00 from 70 cents for soybeans and drop to 45 cents a bushel from 60 cents for CBOT wheat, the notice said.To determine the adjusted limits, CME collected daily settlement prices for July futures contracts over 45 consecutive trading days before April 16. Average prices for each contract were calculated based on the collected settlement prices and then multiplied by seven percent. The November limit will be determined in a similar fashion. The markets currently have daily price limits that remain unchanged throughout the year. CME had sought feedback from market participants on the changes.The new system could hurt participation in the markets by exposing traders to greater risks when crop prices are high and by sedating low-priced markets where risk is already muted, said Terry Linn, broker for the Linn Group.""It seems counterintuitive,"" he said about the variable limits. ""I personally just wish they would set it and leave it.""

19,"  NEW YORK May 7 CME Group Inc's upstart aluminum contract has won the support of Russian producer Rusal  and major consumer MillerCoors, uniting two industry heavyweights whose views clash over the London Metal Exchange's warehousing crisis.In a statement on Wednesday a day after the launch of its North American aluminum contract, CME said Macquarie Bank Ltd executed the first trades, underscoring the Australian bank's efforts expand its U.S. commodities business.In the same release, Steve Hodgson, Rusal's director of sales and marketing, threw his weight behind the new contract, which he said offers an alternative pricing and hedging tool in North America to the LME's global benchmark.Tim Weiner, MillerCoors' global risk manager, reiterated his support for the new contract, saying he will use it to hedge his company's aluminum exposure.Both Rusal and MillerCoors are staunch critics of the LME and its handling of a years-long crisis over its warehousing policy, which has led to inflated physical prices and distorted supplies of metal, upending global futures and physical trading. But the unity ends there. Consumers such as MillerCoors say the London exchange has not gone far enough to deal with the problem.At the opposite end is Rusal, which launched a successful legal case to get proposed rule changes blocked. With 56 contracts traded on Tuesday and 116 on Wednesday, the latest incarnation of a North American aluminum contract is a long way from rivaling the LME's benchmark, which sets the global price and is the exchange's biggest product by turnover and liquidity.The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), now owned by CME, struggled for 10 years to gain traction with a similar product before being delisted in 2009. It was unable to lure established users away from London. Even so, the unlikely alliance of the world's No. 1 producer and a major user of metal will likely fuel the debate over the potential success of the contract's latest incarnation.Some say uncertainty over the LME's warehousing policy has given the CME the best chance yet to challenge the London exchange, while others say it will struggle to lure cash from an entrenched benchmark.(Reporting by Josephine Mason.

20,"  LONDON May 12 CME Group's European clearing house and the post-trade arm of Swiss exchange operator SIX Group have teamed up to create a platform to manage collateral used to back derivatives trades.Collateral management has become a top priority for banks and financial institutions due to new rules requiring that more derivatives trades be conducted through electronic platforms, pushed through clearing houses and backed by collateral, often cash or top-quality government bonds.SIX Securities Services (SIS) said on Monday the new service allowed market participants to place collateral directly in CME Clearing Europe's account at its central securities depository, giving greater clarity on how collateral is being used and what is available to meet margin requirements. It also provides automated segregation, or ring-fencing, of one client's assets from another.Once regulators give the system the green light, it will first be available for Swiss-based insurance companies. CME and SIX plan to later roll out the service to other markets and buy-side institutions. A number of companies have introduced new collateral management services to capitalise on the market reforms. Last week, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Euroclear announced a joint venture to simplify settlement of trades and ease access to collateral. Separately on Monday, CME said the Bank of England had approved its full segregation client protection model, the first such model that gives clients control of the securities they use to back trades at all times and creates legal certainty about how assets would be treated if a clearing member or a number of clearing members went bust.The service, which goes beyond the requirements of the European Union's European Markets Infrastructure Regulation, will be available for the clearing house's over-the-counter financial and commodity derivatives as well as futures products, CME said.

21,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO May 20 CME Group Inc, the world's largest futures market operator, aims to win shareholder approval on Wednesday to halve the number of board members who represent Chicago Mercantile Exchange users.Trimming three of the six board members who represent market users would help the company, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and four other markets, reduce what is the largest board among companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The board is set to drop to 24 directors from 29 this year, still topping the next-largest board at BlackRock Inc  by five members, according to Institutional Shareholder Services.Company executives are expected to face questions from investors about the proposal at Wednesday's annual meeting in Chicago. At least three directors, three candidates for CME's board, and five former board members have publicly opposed the plan.CME, which launched its first overseas market in London last month, argues the company's growth has eliminated the need for six directors representing one exchange. Keeping three will maintain ""the appropriate expertise,"" according to the company. If approved, the reduction will take effect next year. ""It reflects the evolution of the company away from its member-owned roots and away from sort of the traditional community of liquidity providers,"" said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston.The directors, known as B-shareholder representatives, are often linked with traders who built their careers in open-outcry pits. Their influence has waned due to the rise of electronic trading, with about 86 percent of CME's business executed electronically, up from less than 15 percent in 2000.Individual CME memberships, which provide discounts on trading, became attached to ""B shares"" when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in 2002. Traders say B-shareholder directors remain important because of their deep understanding of the futures industry. Other board members include Dennis Hastert, a former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Dennis Chookaszian, a former CNA Financial Corp boss.""The board is getting rid of the wrong people"" by cutting B-shareholder representatives, said Ray Cahnman, a former Chicago Board of Trade director who is running for CME's board. Cahnman said that, if elected, he will push CME to buy all the B shares and rent trading permits to increase revenue. CME should eliminate the category for B-shareholder representatives on the board and all candidates should compete for the same spots, he said.CME declined to comment on B-share purchases. Executives have previously been cool to the idea.Still lacking on the board will be a representative of a high-frequency trading firm. The practice that accounted for about 30 percent of CME's volume in the first quarter.""It's good to have a mix of people from the outside and true insiders who understand the business,"" said Jeff Carter, a former CME director who opposes the proposal to reduce B-shareholder representatives.

Last week, the National Grain & Feed Association said CME should temporarily suspend open-outcry trading if its electronic trading platform crashes to ensure fair access to markets.Some brokers in the grain and livestock markets affected by the electronic outage also have said that CME should close the pits because electronic trading accounts for roughly 95 percent of the volume in agricultural futures. However, most market participants are able to access open-outcry trading, Duffy said. ""As long as we're willing to offer a vibrant two options, I think that's the smart thing for us to do,"" Duffy said about keeping the pits open during an electronic outage.""If we felt that nobody had access to the marketplace, then we'd have to re-evaluate that situation,"" he added.

24,"   By Karl Plume | CHICAGO, July 11  CHICAGO, July 11 An upcoming river lock repair project in south Chicago has attracted the attention of exchange operator CME Group because the lock's closure could disrupt deliveries against its Chicago Board of Trade grain and soybean futures contracts.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will close the 64-year-old T.J. O'Brien lock and dam on the Cal-Sag Channel for two phases of repairs beginning on Nov. 3 and again on Jan. 19. It is the northernmost of eight locks on the Illinois Waterway system, near the entrance to Lake Michigan.Each closure will halt traffic there for 47 days and could make it more difficult or costly for buyers of futures contracts to take delivery of grain housed in Chicago since the lock lies within the contracts' delivery zone 1.The exchange has no plans in place yet to revise its delivery rules but is monitoring the situation, said David Lehman, CME's managing director of commodity research and product development.Grain analysts said the closure is not likely to trigger a force majeure declaration by the exchange because grain housed in Chicago could feasibly be moved by truck or rail or shipped around the closure via Lake Michigan and the Chicago River via the smaller Chicago Lock. But CME action cannot be ruled out, particularly if low cash market prices due to heavy post-harvest supplies spur deliveries, they said.""This comes at a time when I think basis levels are going to be extremely depressed and deliveries may be the best sale for some guys. But I don't see shutting off the northern part of the river as being that important because the biggest share of the crop's going to be south of Chicago,"" said Roy Huckabay, analyst with The Linn Group. The delivery period for November soybeans starts Nov. 3 and December corn and wheat deliveries begin on Dec. 1.Difficulties taking delivery could widen spreads, analysts said. Full carry on the December/March corn spread, for example, is around 18 cents, and the spread itself was near 11 cents on Friday.There have been no major objections to the timing of the lock project, which was announced this spring, said the Army Corps' Illinois River operations manager, Mike Zerbonia. A month-long break between the project's two phases will allow cargo backed up by the closure to pass.Repair work is needed to replace several worn components of the lock, which opened in 1960 and continues to operate with many original components.If a part of the lock and dam structure known as a sheet pile cell were to rupture, navigation would be halted for at least 60 days, resulting in economic losses of $18.3 million, an Army Corps evaluation found.While the vast majority of cargo passing through T.J. O'Brien is manufactured goods and energy products, as much as 15 percent of cargo can be food and farm products, according to Army Corps data.

Moncada entered and canceled within seconds numerous orders for 200 or more wheat contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade, the regulator said in its complaint. Moncada attempted to create a misleading impression of increasing liquidity to move prices upward and downward at different times, according to the complaint, which seeks monetary fines from Moncada.In March, McMahon entered default judgments against BES and Serdika, which shared offices and ownership and had ceased trading by the time of the complaint. In Tuesday's order, McMahon set a trial on Nov. 17 to address attempted market manipulation claims against Moncada, despite agreeing with the CFTC ""that the most compelling inference one might draw from the trading records is that Moncada was indeed trying to manipulate the market.""McMahon will preside over the trial without a jury.

27,"   By Clara Denina  and Jan Harvey | LONDON  LONDON The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) said on Thursday it would be happy to administer, with Thomson Reuters, the global price benchmark for gold known as the ""fix"", a day after banks effectively called time on the current arrangement. The century-old gold fix is a standard price for the metal that banks set twice a day over the telephone. It is based on transactions between their clients such as central banks and mining companies. Regulators have focused on the precious metal benchmarks since the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal broke in 2012. Some observers say the system for pricing the metals leaves it equally vulnerable to manipulation. An official at Britain's Financial Conduct Authority told lawmakers this month that collusion among banks in setting the gold benchmark was possible, although there was no proof for now that it was happening.The watchdog has studied the gold fix and fined Barclays (BARC.L) 26 million pounds for failures in internal controls that allowed a gold options trader to manipulate the setting of gold prices. London Gold Market Fixing Ltd, the company working on behalf of gold fixing banks Barclays, HSBC <HSBA.L,> Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO), said it would ask for proposals so it could appoint a new administrator for the benchmark.  CME managing director of metals products Harriet Hunnable was first out of the blocks, saying the exchange would bid to be involved in a new process, which may turn the current twice-daily price-setting conference call into an electronic auction.The Chicago exchange's parent company CME Group (CME.O) and Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO) were named last week as the new operators of the electronic benchmark for silver that will also include an increased number of participants, in a move likely to precede sweeping reforms of the way precious metals are priced. ""Having won the silver price mandate in partnership with Thomson Reuters, CME Group would be delighted to be part of this proposal process with Thomson Reuters and look forward to engaging with the London Gold market participants,"" Hunnable said in a statement.  A spokesman for Thomson Reuters declined to comment on the CME statement, but Thomson Reuters GFMS head of research Rhona O'Connell said earlier: ""Everyone who contributed to the recent discussions on the future of the silver price mechanism was absolutely mindful of the need to establish a method that is also applicable to other precious metals."" Eight companies had submitted proposals to run the silver fix, which also included the London Metal Exchange (LME), which had joined forces with technology provider Autilla. The LME had yet to state whether it would submit a formal proposal to administer the gold fix, but said in a statement: ""We are ready to expand our range of price discovery and post-trade tools to further service the precious metals market."" Autilla CEO Mike Greenacre said the electronic platform they proposed for silver had initially been designed to support changes in the gold market and that the company was continuing to develop it. One of the other companies that submitted proposals to administer a replacement to the silver fix, McGraw Hill Group's MHFI.N subsidiary Platts, said dialogue with market participants and interested parties was ongoing. A source close to the matter said other companies that had not bid for the silver benchmark replacement could now come forward with new proposals.

29,"  CME Group delayed the start of trade on its electronic platform by four hours on Monday due to technical problems, the latest glitch to hit the world's largest futures market operator.But traders in Asia said the delay would have only a limited impact, with volumes likely thin on Monday morning in the absence of major market-moving news over the weekend.The start of trade in all contracts on the Globex Markets platform, apart from Bursa Malaysia derivatives, was halted because of an unspecified technical glitch, the top U.S. exchange operator said on its website. Trade eventually began at 2200 EST, but a spokesman for CME in Singapore declined further comment.Among contracts traded on CME include the benchmarks for U.S. crude and agricultural markets such as wheat, corn and soybeans. U.S. gold and silver futures are also traded on the system. The delay marks another headache for CME, which shut electronic trade for leading agricultural contracts on April 8 in the worst-ever trading outage for those markets.CME Executive Chairman Terrence Duffy has said that outage was triggered when sophisticated technology tripped over a trading halt in a single market. CME, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange, said in July that it would slash costs by reducing hiring and employee travel amid weak trading volumes that led to a 15 percent drop in second-quarter net profit.All day and session orders, including so-called good-through-date orders with an Aug. 24 trade date would be canceled, CME said on Monday. All open orders that have been acknowledged would remain working, the exchange operator said.

30,"   By Julie Ingwersen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Bovine avatars with funny hats in an app are being corralled into helping to teach young people in the United States about agricultural markets and risk.The CME Group futures exchange launched the app, called ""Risk Ranch,"" for tablets and smartphones as an electronic version of a board game called ""Commodity Carnival"" - first bought to state fairs in 2013 by CME and the 4-H youth organization.This year, as fair season winds down, the app offers a way for children, and parents and teachers, to take the single-player game with them and play all year.""We heard from educators who asked us, 'How can I get this in my classroom?'"" said Laurie Bischel, CME's executive director of corporate marketing and communications.The app has been downloaded about 2,500 times since its launch this summer. here The goal of the game is to bring a cartoon steer to market at the best price, with a maximum score of $2,200 - roughly in line with current cash prices, which are near historic highs.Players start by naming their steer and choosing its body color. Optional accessories include a hat or sunglasses, or an authentic-looking ear tag. Players then get five coins to spend on feed, farm equipment and medicine.The next stage of the game sends the bovine avatars into a virtual pinball machine where they careen through a series of exploding red pegs that represent threats to profits ranging from a disease outbreak to rising gas prices and even price-depressing news. As the avatar cows tumble, players tilt the device to try to collect more coins. In later rounds these coins can buy ""futures"" offering temporary protection from the hazards.The CME drew on animal science experts at Ohio State University, who helped determine the relative value of inputs such as feed versus medicine, in designing the game. An internal competition among CME staff threw up a best score of $1,966, CME spokesman Chris Grams said.Jeanne Alling, a high school agriculture teacher, said the Commodity Carnival booth was a hit at her fair in northwestern Wisconsin, and Risk Ranch could win even more fans.""It was very successful, as far as getting kids interested in what it took to raise an animal,"" Alling said. ""But to have something for kids to use on a smartphone, oh my gosh, they would be all over that.""

33,"  (Adds byline, comment from traders' lawyer)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO, Sept 16 Veteran traders from Chicago's grain pits on Tuesday dropped a lawsuit against CME Group Inc  that sought to reverse a change to end-of-day settlement rules they said was killing open-outcry business.The traders, who work on the Chicago Board of Trade's 140-year-old agricultural trading floor, agreed to abandon their claims against the world's largest futures exchange operator without receiving any payment, CME Group said in a statement.The traders sued CME Group, owner of the CBOT, in June 2012, claiming a decision to factor electronic trades into settlement prices would put them out of business and was implemented without proper approval from exchange members. Prior to the change, the CBOT had a century-old tradition of settling futures prices for crops like corn and soybeans based on transactions executed in open-outcry pits.The traders agreed to dismiss the case in light of an Illinois judge's refusal in March to suspend the use of electronic trades in settlement procedures, their lawyer George Sang said in an interview. The traders wanted to avoid the stress and expense of pursuing the matter, he added, noting the each side will pay its own legal bills.""My clients made a business decision that it was in their best interests to dismiss the case at this time,"" Sang said. The lawsuit was seen by traders as something of a last stand by open-outcry traders, as business has declined sharply since the rise of electronic trading. The floor traders traditionally did much of their business at the close of trading and said the new settlement procedures made the pits largely irrelevant.Chicago-based CME Group called the dismissal of the lawsuit a decisive victory for the company.""It is unfortunate that the plaintiffs wasted so much of their own time and money, not to mention that of the court and CME, chasing these baseless claims,"" CME said in its statement.The case was Anthony McKerr et al v.

""To go from zero to five (percent), it was incredibly difficult. We've done the hard climbing, we need to keep going and keep working at it,"" Singapore-based Bannister said. He did not say by when the U.S.-based exchange will hit the target.CME's growth goals for Brent come as weak trading volumes hurt its second-quarter revenues. Energy volumes were down 19 percent in the quarter. Its executive chairman said geopolitical uncertainty from conflicts in Israel, Ukraine and other hot spots kept energy traders on the sidelines. Brent is an international benchmark based on production in the North Sea and is used to price more than two-thirds of the global crude supply. About 500,000-600,000 lots of Brent crude futures trade daily. Brent futures were first launched by CME's rival, Intercontinental Exchange.   CME is offering the Brent contract to traders for free and is providing an 80 percent discount on margin calls for a spread trade between the global oil benchmark and West Texas Intermediate (WTI).""This is the biggest exchange giveaway that energy markets have ever seen,"" Bannister said. ""It's likely to be free or very cheap for a foreseeable future.""The free contract has gained traction among proprietary trading firms where exchange fees make up a sizeable portion of profit margins, Bannister said. New entrants to energy - from proprietary trading firms to hedge funds - have also led to a 10-15 percent growth in volumes in Asia as traders gravitate towards Brent and CME's top  products WTI and Henry Hub, he said.CME, which clears about 75 percent of all coal derivatives in the world, has seen strong growth in Asia, Bannister said.Trade volumes for CME's coal derivatives contracts for China, Australia and Indonesia jumped to just under 8,000 lots in July from a monthly average of below 2,000 lots in 2013, according to the exchange.

39,"   By Theopolis Waters | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 3 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group decided to scale back electronic trading hours for its livestock markets following customer feedback, the exchange announced on Friday.The markets affected are CME lean hogs, live cattle and feeder cattle futures and options effective on October 27 following response to a survey of its customers including producers, commercial customers and traders. ""Over the past several months, we have been engaging with a broad cross section of customers and industry participants... and based on that feedback we have determined we should reduce electronic trading hours for our livestock products,"" said Tim Andriesen, CME Group managing director of Agricultural Commodities and Alternative Investments.Amended livestock electronic trading hours will be Monday from 9:05 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. CDT (1405 GMT to 2100 GMT), Tuesday to Thursday at 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. CDT (1300 GMT to 2100 GMT), and Friday 8:00 a.m to 1:55 p.m CDT (1300 GMT to 1855 GMT).

40,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 9 The compliance officer of a futures brokerage that was a top player in a market on the Chicago Board of Trade floor never reviewed company policies on floor operations or oversaw activities related to the trading floor, U.S. regulators said on Thursday in a lawsuit charging the firm with violations.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in a civil complaint filed in U.S. district court in Chicago, said Futures International and its chief operating officer, Amadeo Cerrone, failed to properly supervise employees, created trading records with false information and engaged in unauthorized trading.Kent Woods, who ran the brokerage from 2009 to 2012, agreed to pay $200,000 to settle similar charges as part of an agreement with the CFTC.Futures International declined to comment on the lawsuit. Woods, who left the firm last year and now works for another Chicago brokerage, could not be reached for comment. The company was one of the largest participants, if not the largest, in the soy crush market on the CBOT floor, which soybean processors often use to manage their risks, according to the CFTC.Woods, a longtime CBOT floor broker, habitually failed to obtain or record order instructions from his customers and improperly made trading decisions on their behalf, the lawsuit said. He placed trades without knowing which accounts would eventually receive them and then ""shopped"" the trades to potentially interested customers, according to the complaint. Futures International had a compliance officer from 2004 to 2012 who had no experience in trading floor operations, never visited the floor to observe employees and did not oversee floor activities, the lawsuit said.A senior clerk whom Cerrone said was responsible for ensuring compliance with CFTC rules about trading desk activities was never told that those were her responsibilities, according to the complaint. The employee and others at the firm were involved in a practice of improperly stamping ticket orders on the trading floor with false timestamps to disguise unauthorized trading practices, the complaint said. False data from the ticket orders was transmitted to the CBOT, owned by CME Group Inc, according to the lawsuit.Neither the compliance officer nor the clerk were named in the lawsuit.The case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Futures International and Amadeo Cerrone, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 14-cv-7877.

41,"  * BGC commences all-cash tender offer of $5.25 a share for GFI* GFI made ""unreasonable demands"" in negotiations - BGC CEO* BGC says has secured financing from Morgan Stanley   (Adds GFI response in paragraph 8)Oct 22 Interdealer broker BGC Partners Inc  went ahead with the formal launch of its hostile $675 million bid for rival GFI Group Inc on Wednesday after talks between the two companies reached a deadlock.Interdealer brokers match wholesale buyers and sellers of currencies, bonds and other instruments but analysts have long expected the industry to consolidate since new regulations forced their traditional investment banking clients to reduce risky trading activities.The industry has also faced challenges as regulators have pushed more derivatives trading onto electronic platforms in a bid to make the market more open and safer. Low interest rates also have dampened market volatility, adding to brokers' woes.BGC said on Wednesday it had commenced an all-cash tender offer of $5.25 per share for the 86.5 percent of GFI that it does not already own.The terms remain unchanged from BGC's Sept. 9 proposal that topped exchange-operator CME Group Inc's $4.55 per share all-share bid. ""Despite our best efforts to engage with GFI regarding a negotiated transaction we have been met with only unreasonable demands and delay tactics,"" BGC's chief executive Howard Lutnick said in a statement.BGC said it remains open to seeking a negotiated transaction with GFI and CME. Its tender offer will expire on Nov. 19.GFI said a special committee would review the offer and make its position known by Nov. 4. Until then it advised its stockholders to take no action with respect to the tender offer. CME Group was not available for comment.GFI's board has backed CME's deal, saying last month it had still not determined whether the BGC offer ""constitutes a superior proposal"" despite BGC saying its $5.25 cash offer was worth over 15 percent more than CME's all-share bid.If the BGC bid is successful, a BGC-GFI merger would create a strong rival to market leader ICAP and the enlarged group's estimated revenue would dwarf that of next closest rival, Britain's Tullett Prebon.""We expect the combination will also produce increased productivity per broker, meaningful synergies, substantial earnings accretion and stronger cash flow,"" Lutnick said in Wednesday's statement. Talks between BGC and GFI hit a roadblock over negotiations relating to a confidentiality agreement that would give BGC access to inside information about GFI's energy markets trading platform Trayport and its pricing and data business known as Fenics.In return for the information GFI had sought a pledge from BGC not to recruit its key employees.""In light of your rejection of the terms of our proposed confidentiality agreement covering the Trayport and FENICS information, we have reached an impasse,"" BGC president Shaun Lynn wrote in a letter to GFI's board on Tuesday.Fierce competition between the big five brokers, which also includes Switzerland's Tradition, has long hampered deal-making in the industry.Most of the companies' chief executives have had high-profile feuds, with BGC, Tullett and ICAP in particular having engaged in regular battles over poaching staff and patent infringement, many of which have ended up in court.BGC, which was spun off from Cantor Fitzgerald LP in 2004, said it has secured committed financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and its offer has no financing condition.

49,"  (Adds share performance, comments in paragraphs 3-5)By Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO Nov 24 BM&FBovespa SA  wants to buy up to 15 percent of every major stock exchange operator in Latin America in a move to assert the influence of Brazil's sole listed bourse across the region, Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto told the Financial Times.São Paulo-based BM&FBovespa, which was created after the tie-up of two arch-rivals in 2008, hired two banks last month to acquire stakes in the main exchanges of Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, Pinto said in an interview with the FT  published on Monday. According to the FT report, Pinto said the goal of those purchases is to ensure a board seat on each bourse. According to JPMorgan Securities executives led by Domingos Falavina, BM&FBovespa could spend about $270 million on the plan.""We view this initiative with skepticism,"" Falavina wrote in a client note. ""Integrating exchanges is largely dependent on integrating clearing houses and also the custody of assets, and we sense local governments unwilling to forfeit the control over their financial assets."" Shares of BM&FBovespa gained 1.3 percent to 10.70 reais on Monday.Pinto's remarks underscore a trend among the world's largest exchanges, which are building up stakes in some rivals to tap into the potential of some of the world's fastest-growing capital markets. CME Group Inc, which owns a stake in BM&FBovespa, and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc are among bourse operators increasing their foothold in countries across Latin America and Asia. The media office of BM&FBovespa confirmed the content of the FT story.According to the FT, BM&FBovespa would be interested in buying some of the capital of Mexico's Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB, Bolsa de Valores de Colombia SA, Argentina's Mercado de Valores de Buenos Aires SA, Chile's Bolsa de Comercio de Santiago SA and Peru's Bolsa de Valores de Lima SA.The largest exchange in Latin America outside Brazil is Bolsa Mexicana, which earned about $60 million, or the equivalent of 8 percent of BM&FBovespa profits last year. Assuming the company acquires 15 percent stakes in the five bourses, earnings at BM&FBovespa could climb by $14 million annually, according to JPMorgan's Falavina.

51,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO CME Group Inc, the world's largest futures market operator, should continue to develop strategies to detect an illegal manipulative trading practice known as ""spoofing,"" the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday.Spoofing involves rapidly placing orders to create the illusion of market demand. Unsuspecting traders are then tricked into buying or selling at artificial prices, only to later find that the orders were canceled.The practice gained notoriety last month after high-frequency trader Michael Coscia was charged with manipulating commodity futures prices in the first U.S. federal criminal prosecution of spoofing. The CFTC recommended that CME work more on identifying spoofing after the agency's Division of Market Oversight reviewed rule enforcement at the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013. Both exchanges are owned by Chicago-based CME.CME said it was reviewing the CFTC's findings and had already addressed a number of issues noted by the agency. During the review period, the exchanges’ “messaging” research program, which CME initiated in January 2013 to identify spoofing and other problematic messaging behaviors, did not lead to the initiation of any spoofing cases, the CFTC said. Of 10 cases opened involving potential spoofing, eight were initiated from complaints. The messaging research program began conducting regular reviews in April 2013, and after the target period it initiated two spoofing cases based on activity during the target period, the CFTC said. CME, in a rule that took effect in September, clarified what constitutes spoofing on its markets. On Thursday, the exchange operator said it ordered a trader, Shlomi Salant, to pay a $30,000 fine and serve a 10-day trading suspension for entering large orders in the 10-Year Treasury note futures market for the purpose of inducing other market participants to trade against small orders Salant placed. The violations occurred on multiple occasions from September 2011 to December 2012, according to CME. The CFTC, in a separate recommendation based on reviews of CME from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2013, said the company must maintain sufficient enforcement staff to promptly prosecute possible rule violations. CME also should take measures to ensure internal deliberations do not delay disciplinary action, according to the CFTC, which said it identified nine disciplinary cases that were delayed by as many as 17 months due to ""protracted deliberations"" by senior CME staff.

52,"  (Adds CFTC recommendations, spoofing background)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO Nov 24 CME Group Inc, the world's largest futures market operator, should continue to develop strategies to detect an illegal manipulative trading practice known as ""spoofing,"" the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday.Spoofing involves rapidly placing orders to create the illusion of market demand. Unsuspecting traders are then tricked into buying or selling at artificial prices, only to later find that the orders were canceled. The practice gained notoriety last month after high-frequency trader Michael Coscia was charged with manipulating commodity futures prices in the first U.S. federal criminal prosecution of spoofing.The CFTC recommended that CME work more on identifying spoofing after the agency's Division of Market Oversight reviewed rule enforcement at the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013. Both exchanges are owned by Chicago-based CME. CME said it was reviewing the CFTC's findings and had already addressed a number of issues noted by the agency. During the review period, the exchanges' ""messaging"" research program, which CME initiated in January 2013 to identify spoofing and other problematic messaging behaviors, did not lead to the initiation of any spoofing cases, the CFTC said. Of 10 cases opened involving potential spoofing, eight were initiated from complaints. The messaging research program began conducting regular reviews in April 2013, and after the target period it initiated two spoofing cases based on activity during the target period, the CFTC said.CME, in a rule that took effect in September, clarified what constitutes spoofing on its markets. On Thursday, the exchange operator said it ordered a trader, Shlomi Salant, to pay a $30,000 fine and serve a 10-day trading suspension for entering large orders in the 10-Year Treasury note futures market for the purpose of inducing other market participants to trade against small orders Salant placed. The violations occurred on multiple occasions from September 2011 to December 2012, according to CME.The CFTC, in a separate recommendation based on reviews of CME from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2013, said the company must maintain sufficient enforcement staff to promptly prosecute possible rule violations. CME also should take measures to ensure internal deliberations do not delay disciplinary action, according to the CFTC, which said it identified nine disciplinary cases that were delayed by as many as 17 months due to ""protracted deliberations"" by senior CME staff.

53,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Dec 18 CME Group Inc briefly halted electronic trading in U.S. wheat futures overnight on Thursday after prices sank 1.6 percent in one second as concerns about Russian export curbs roiled the market.The 10-second pause represented only the fourth time this year that the world's largest futures exchange operator has interrupted trading in its grain markets as part of a so-called ""stop logic event."" Such a halt is designed to slow extreme price moves to allow liquidity to form.CME Group stopped trading in the most-active Chicago Board of Trade March wheat contract at 3:49:37 a.m. CST (9:49:37 GMT), company spokesman Chris Grams said. Charts show prices sank to $6.54 a bushel from $6.64-3/4 a bushel during that second. Ten seconds later, the market re-opened at $6.55 a bushel. Trading was volatile due to uncertainty about the impact of export restrictions in Russia, a major wheat trader. Russia is restricting grain exports to try to cool domestic prices as it tackles a currency crisis linked to plunging oil prices and Western sanctions. Traders said stop logic events typically occur in thinly traded markets when major news events are driving prices.The pause ""lets the liquidity come back,"" said Tom Grisafi, a risk manager for Advance Trading, who had bids in the wheat market when activity was halted. At CME Group, ""their computers are fast enough to know that something is not right so they just halt it,"" he added.The exchange operator previously implemented stop logic events in wheat futures on March 31, in soybean futures on July 16 and in mini-soybean futures on Aug. 12, according to the company. Stop logic events are more common in precious metals markets, traders said.

54,"   By Valerie Parent and Gus Trompiz | PARIS  PARIS CME Group is moving forward with plans for an alternative European wheat futures market, encouraged by French producers who say incumbent provider Euronext has not fixed shortcomings exposed by poor harvest quality in 2014.Chicago-based CME, the world's biggest derivatives exchange, has met with the French agricultural cooperatives this month to discuss its project and indicated it could launch its wheat futures as soon as March, with September 2015 as a first delivery position, sources familiar with the discussions said.CME is due to hold more discussions with French operators in January, according to the sources. The talks are an indication of its continued interest despite its low profile since it confirmed in June it was considering wheat as part of a push into Europe.At the same time, the cooperatives are also talking with Euronext about further changes to its Paris-based wheat futures <0#BL2:>. Operators are reluctant to ditch a proven price benchmark whose liquidity continues to grow, the sources said.Cooperatives handle most of the grain grown in France, the European Union's top producer, and so are key market actors.InVivo, a grouping of some 200 cooperatives, confirmed it had participated in discussions with both Euronext and CME.""Euronext and CME have each proposed solutions that make sense,"" Stephane Bernhard, head of trading at InVivo, said, declining to give details. ""I think there will be some announcements very soon."" A spokeswoman for CME reiterated that the group was exploring a European wheat contract in response to requests from customers, without commenting further.Euronext's Head of Commodities, Olivier Raevel, said the exchange was in ongoing discussions with market participants. Issues included delivery points and how the market would operate until new quality specifications are introduced in 2017, he said, declining to give further details.SILOS AND QUALITY TERMS  Heavy rain turned much of the 2014 French crop into lower-grade wheat and prompted the two Rouen port silos that take delivery of wheat traded on Euronext to impose higher quality standards to protect export sales.Euronext's later decision to toughen its own quality criteria sought to end confusion about whether it was pricing milling wheat or cheaper animal-feed wheat, but the changes will not apply until 2017.""We had to put up a lot of money this summer to cover ourselves against the lack of clarity about what Euronext prices represented,"" one source involved in the discussions with CME said. ""The problem has not been fixed for 2015 and 2016.""Euronext's reliance on the Rouen export hub for delivery is seen by some as the root of the problem. CME is proposing a wider network of delivery points in France and this has won support from cooperatives active in inland zones, sources said. However, French operators fear complications if a CME contract traded in dollars and fell under non-French law, they said.CME is proposing less strict quality terms than in Euronext's 2017 revamp, such as a minimum 180 for Hagberg falling numbers, a measure of bread quality, compared with the relatively high 220 minimum set by Euronext, sources said.This has led some operators to call for Euronext to add another contract that reverts to a basic milling standard.Others argue that there is no room for new wheat contracts in Europe, and that the CME should join forces with Euronext.

CME Europe will also launch a cash-settled dollar-denominated cocoa futures contract on March 30 as it seeks to break ICE's current dominance of cocoa futures trading.ICE currently operates two cocoa futures contracts, one denominated in sterling and the other in dollars.""The probability is that there won't be the same number of contracts in existence in a couple of years' time.

68,"  CHICAGO Jan 30 GFI Group Inc  shareholders on Friday rejected a proposed takeover by CME Group Inc, forcing the companies to terminate a merger agreement, according to the companies.CME Group, the world's largest futures exchange operator, for months has been locked in a bidding war for derivatives broker GFI Group with inter-dealer broker BGC Partners Inc . CME Group first agreed to acquire GFI Group last July for a total of around $820 million. In September, BGC Partners topped CME Group's initial offer in a hostile bid. CME Group had pursued GFI Group to acquire two GFI units that would allow it to expand its reach in the European energy and global foreign exchange markets. GFI Group's stock price has climbed 80 percent since the day before CME announced its takeover offer in July. CME Group shares have advanced about 15 percent over the same period, while BGC Partners' shares are down slightly.

71,"  (Adds dropped word ""Neo"" in fifth paragraph.)NEW YORK, March 4 The CME Group Inc will launch a physically delivered crude oil storage futures contract in the U.S. Gulf Coast at the end of March that traders say may be timely given record levels of stockpiles nationwide.Under the agreement, each futures contract represents the right to store 1,000 barrels of crude at LOOP LLC's Clovelly Hub in Louisiana. The new contract will begin trading on March 29, for trade day March 30, pending regulatory approval.There are 7 million barrels of storage available for the contract, according to Terry Coleman, a spokesman for LOOP. The move comes after the U.S. crude oil contract  flipped into a contango late last year, opening up a key trading opportunity for traders to buy oil today and sell higher later. Meanwhile, the physical Gulf Coast crude oil complex is also trading at a contango.As part of the deal, Neo Markets Inc will host monthly auctions of physical LOOP sour crude oil storage contracts on its platform. ""All commodities are subject to storage costs, and much of that is dependent on the forward curve. We're hoping this contract will help price transparency of prompt storage,"" Peter Keavey, CME's executive director and head of North American energy products, told Reuters.""We think it will be a logistical storage solution,"" he said, adding there has already been commercial interest. He declined to discuss specific companies. The CME Group is also broadening specifications of its sour crude contract to include Poseidon, Mars and the LOOP Segment 17, it said.As the largest privately-owned U.S. crude oil terminal, the LOOP's primary business is offloading foreign crude oil from tankers and storing and distributing inventory via connecting pipelines to refineries through the Gulf and Midwest, according to its website.Some traders, though, were wary, particularly as a contango play requires strong pipeline connectivity, which makes the U.S. storage hub at Cushing particularly attractive.

74,"  * CME and ICE launching new contracts on March 30* Euro contracts could reduce currency risk for someBy Nigel Hunt and Sarah McFarlaneLONDON, March 10 ICE's sterling-denominated cocoa futures contract faces a challenge from two euro-based contenders this month, but the odds look stacked in favour of the established market.Launching new commodity contracts has proved difficult in markets where they do not already exist, let alone in spaces where there are already firmly entrenched products, such as cocoa where futures and options have been traded since 1928.CME Group and ICE are both launching euro denominated cocoa contracts on March 30.Dealers said cocoa is too small a market to support two or three European contracts and historically it has been difficult for new commodity products to gain traction.Examples include the CME's Black Sea wheat contract launched in 2012 and ICE's robusta coffee contract in 2007, which were virtually illiquid within weeks of launching. ""If they allow a proliferation of contracts then they'd better be prepared for a disorderly market, because if liquidity is not huge in one market, it's going to be even less spread across three markets,"" Derek Chambers, head of cocoa at Sucden said.""I think it's absurd and the sooner two of the three in London die, the better.""ICE also operates a U.S.-based cocoa futures market which is not expected to be threatened by the new contracts.Success will hinge on whether market participants are sufficiently disgruntled to take risk on a new product. ""Loads of people are upset but when it comes down to it they don't put their money where their mouth is,"" an analyst said.AGAINST THE ODDS A switch to a euro-denominated contract would reduce currency risks for the major cocoa processors who operate in euro zone countries. The currency of the world's top cocoa grower, Ivory Coast, is also pegged to the euro. CME has also sought to capitalise on concerns that ICE's in-store contract does not always align closely with the physical market in Europe and dealers said its free on truck (FOT) basis should correlate more closely.""There's no justification for the paper and cash markets to diverge so dramatically in a well-functioning futures market,"" said Peter Johnson, Jr., vice president at Transmar Group, a New Jersey-based cocoa bean trader.""The CME has succeeded in developing a well-considered contract that offers the best opportunity to rectify that problem.""Challengers must overcome the fact that a significant proportion of the 2015/16 cocoa crop, to be harvested from October, has already been hedged against the sterling contract.""We've already probably got 30 to 40 percent of the crop hedged for the 2015/16 year now. In another three or four weeks more volume will be done,"" one trader said, making it difficult for the euro contracts in the early stages.And a slow start could prove fatal.""Very quickly the market will adopt one contract and place all its liquidity in that one,"" a trader said.
