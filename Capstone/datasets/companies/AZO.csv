0,"  Mississippi State demolishes Rice in Liberty BowlMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Dak Prescott's roller-coaster 2013 ended at a high point in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl on Tuesday.Accounting for 361 total yards and a game-record five touchdowns, the Mississippi State quarterback led his team to a record-breaking 44-7 rout of Rice.In earning Most Valuable Player honors, Prescott completed 17 of 28 passes for 283 yards and three scores. He also rushed 14 times for 78 yards and two touchdowns, both in the third quarter, before departing for backup Damian Williams as the fourth quarter started.It was a perfect ending to a tumultuous season for the sophomore. He lost his mother, Peggy, to cancer in November and battled through a spate of injuries to lead his team to an upset win over archrival Mississippi on Nov. 28 to clinch bowl eligibility.""It's really been about Mississippi State and this football team just being there for me,"" Prescott said. ""They've made the hardest thing of my life easier, I guess. I can't be thankful enough for what everyone's done for me.""That extended to Tuesday's game. After missing a couple of easy throws while starting 3-for-7, Prescott started zeroing in on wide receiver Jameon Lewis, who couldn't be stopped under any defensive scheme. The 5-foot-9, 195-pound Lewis grabbed nine passes for a school and Liberty Bowl-record 220 yards, including catches of 17, 28, 35 and 65 yards. Most were short throws on which Lewis made most of the yardage after the catch against a defense that failed to keep containment.""The game plan was to rely on the run, but the defense wasn't going to allow us to run,"" Lewis said.""Rice is a big, physical team,"" Bulldogs coach Dan Mullen said. ""We had to put our athletes in a position to make plays. Couldn't be prouder of how we executed after a bit of a slow start."" The Owls (10-4) actually scored first on a 1-yard run by running back Charles Ross with 6:41 left in the first quarter, capping a nine-play, 45-yard drive. However, Rice gained only 66 more yards in the game as Mississippi State's speed in the back end of its defense, plus its heft up front, kept the Owls from establishing their ground game.Entering the day averaging 240.2 rushing yards, the Conference USA champs managed only 61 yards on 32 attempts. Over the last three quarters, they were restricted to 22 yards on 19 carries.""This one's on me,"" Owls coach David Bailiff said. ""When we had a chance to make plays, we just couldn't. But we can't let this game define us. We accomplished all our goals this year but winning this game.""Prescott's 10-yard pass to running back LaDarius Perkins with 2:01 remaining in the first period tied the score at 7. Running back Ashton Shumpert's 1-yard plunge with 9:49 left in the first half gave the Bulldogs the lead for good. Prescott hooked up with tight end Malcolm Johnson on a 13-yard screen pass at the 4:32 mark of the second quarter to make it 20-7. After Lewis lugged a short pass 65 yards to the Rice 5, Prescott flipped a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Artimas Samuel with 10 seconds left in the half for a 27-7 halftime advantage.It never got any better for the Owls. Prescott found the end zone on runs of 5 and 11 yards in the third quarter, and backup placekicker Taylor Earhart converted a 19-yard field goal with 4:45 left in the game to wrap up the most lopsided contest in the bowl's 55-year history.""We knew we had to play our best game of the year to win it,"" Bailiff said. ""Obviously, we didn't.""Owls senior quarterback Taylor McHargue completed eight of 15 passes for 84 yards.Mississippi State outgained Rice 533 yards to 145.NOTES: Mississippi State S Nickoe Whitley, who leads all active Football Bowl Subdivision players in career interceptions with 15, missed the game due to surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Whitley suffered the injury Sept. 14 at Auburn but played nine games after he was hurt. ... Rice PK Chris Boswell tops all active FBS kickers with 13 field goals of 50 yards or longer. He also led the FBS this year with a 77 percent touchback rate on kickoffs. ... The Bulldogs and Owls met for just the second time. Mississippi State's 28-14 win on Oct. 11, 1975, was later forfeited to Rice.",2014-01-01,AZO,"Tue Dec 31, 2013 | 7:47pm EST",Mississippi State demolishes Rice in Liberty Bowl,http://www.reuters.com//article/fbc-rice-mississippistate-writethru-idUSMTZEA11P5HG2K20140101?type=companyNews

8,"   By Marty Graham | SAN DIEGO  SAN DIEGO A federal jury in California awarded nearly $186 million to a San Diego area woman who sued AutoZone Inc. saying she was demoted and fired after being told pregnant women can't do the job of managing a store, court records showed.The award on Monday by a six-person jury, which follows a two-week trial, includes $872,720 in compensatory damages and another $185 million in punitive damages for plaintiff Rosario Juarez, 43.     ""We were able to prove that AutoZone engaged in rather extraordinary discrimination against Ms. Juarez,"" said attorney Charles Moore, who is part of the legal team representing her.Representatives for the auto parts retailer did not immediately respond to requests for comment by phone and email. But company spokesman Ray Pohlman told the San Diego Union Tribune that the company intends to appeal. According to the complaint, Juarez was hired by AutoZone in 2000 as a customer service representative at a store south of San Diego. In April 2001, she was promoted to parts sales manager and in October 2004 to store manager. Then in September 2005, Juarez became pregnant with the first of her two children. The district manager told her she could not handle the demands of the job and urged her to return to parts sales throughout her pregnancy, the complaint said. After her son was born, Juarez was demoted and took a pay cut.  After she waited the required year from the demotion to seek her former job, the district manager refused to promote her, and she was terminated in 2008, the complaint said. By then, she had filed claims with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the complaint added.At trial, a former district manager testified that an AutoZone vice president berated him for having so many women in management positions, saying: ""What are we running here, a boutique? Get rid of those women."" The jury ruled that the harassment against Juarez was ""severe and pervasive,"" and found unanimously that she was discriminated against and later fired because of her pregnancy, according to the verdict form. (The story corrects to remove remarks from lawyer who is no longer trial counsel in case, replaces with remark from current counsel, paragraphs 1-3.)

AutoZone's lawyer also said that the verdict was based on passion and should be overturned.Rosario Juarez, 43, began at AutoZone in 1999 as a cashier and worked her way up to store manager.She was demoted in 2005 after she told her manager she was pregnant and later filed a complaint over the demotion. Juarez was fired in 2008 amid allegations that she stole $400 from the store. But the loss prevention manager who got Juarez fired later testified she was told to target Juarez. After eight days of trial and less than two days of deliberations, a federal jury awarded Juarez $870,000 in damages and another $185 million in punitive damages.The judge, U.S. Magistrate William Gallo, called the award “the largest verdict in the history of the United States in regards to employment discrimination.” He did not rule on Wednesday, but urged the two sides to work toward a settlement. On Wednesday, AutoZone's lawyers cited two incidents involving jurors in their request for a new trial. In one, they said, a lawyer from Juarez’s team sought and obtained the contact information of one juror. In another, they said, Juarez’s lead attorney warned the entire jury that anything they said to AutoZone’s lawyers could be used to overturn their verdict, according to court documents.Juarez’s lawyer, Douglas Butz, argued that neither action tainted the verdict, while conceding that making contact with a juror during the trial was unethical. “The defense is raising every issue they can to try to deal with this verdict,” Butz said.AutoZone also argued that the punitive damages were out of line with the actual damages.

But the loss prevention manager who got Juarez fired later testified she was told to target Juarez.After eight days of trial and less than two days of deliberations, a federal jury awarded Juarez $870,000 in damages and another $185 million in punitive damages.The judge, U.S. Magistrate William Gallo, called the award ""the largest verdict in the history of the United States in regards to employment discrimination."" He did not rule on Wednesday, but urged the two sides to work toward a settlement. On Wednesday, AutoZone's lawyers cited two incidents involving jurors in their request for a new trial.In one, they said, a lawyer from Juarez's team sought and obtained the contact information of one juror. In another, they said, Juarez's lead attorney warned the entire jury that anything they said to AutoZone's lawyers could be used to overturn their verdict, according to court documents. Juarez's lawyer, Douglas Butz, argued that neither action tainted the verdict, while conceding that making contact with a juror during the trial was unethical.""The defense is raising every issue they can to try to deal with this verdict,"" Butz said.AutoZone also argued that the punitive damages were out of line with the actual damages.(Editing by Sharon Bernstein and Andrew Hay)",2015-03-05,AZO,"Wed Mar 4, 2015 | 8:11pm EST",AutoZone seeks retrial in $186 mln discrimination case,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-california-discrimination-idUSL1N0W635C20150305?type=companyNews

17,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to  AutoZone, Inc.'s (AutoZone) $650 million of new senior unsecured notes composed  of a $400 million issue of 10-year notes and a $250 million issue of three-year  notes. Proceeds from the new issues will be used for general corporate purposes.  Fitch rates AutoZone's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'/Stable  Outlook. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects AutoZone's leading position in the retail auto parts and  accessories aftermarket, its strong operating performance, and steady credit  metrics. The ratings also consider the company's aggressive share repurchase  posture.  AutoZone is a leader in the large, growing and fragmented auto parts  aftermarket, and competes in two markets. It is the number one player in its  primary sub-sector, the $51 billion 'Do-It-Yourself' auto aftermarket (79% of  AutoZone's sales) and a small but growing player in the $64 billion  'Do-It-For-Me' commercial auto aftermarket. Approximately 84% of AutoZone's  merchandise mix consists of either maintenance or replacement of failed  products, for which demand is relatively stable. Comparable store (comp) sales were up 3.8% in fiscal 2015 and were up 3.6% in  the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. Going forward, Fitch expects AutoZone can  sustain low-single-digit comps supported by 1%-2% comps on the retail side of  the business and relatively faster growth in the commercial business. Overall  sales growth should be in the mid-single digits due to the addition of around  200 units annually.  AutoZone has among the strongest operating margins in the retail sector. The  company's size, national footprint (it owns around half of its real estate), and  retail-orientation have contributed to its industry leading EBITDA margin of  22.3% in the 12 months ending Feb. 13, 2016. Fitch believes that there is modest  additional upside to this margin, but that it will be limited longer-term by a  gradually increasing mix of lower-margin commercial and online sales.  AutoZone's credit metrics have been stable despite aggressive share repurchase  activity that is partly debt-financed. AutoZone's adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio  has remained steady at 2.7x over the past four years (capitalizing operating  leases on an 8x rents basis). Fitch expects AutoZone will generate free cash flow (FCF) of around $900 million  to $1 billion annually over the next two years. Excess FCF, together with some  incremental borrowings, is expected to be directed towards share buybacks.  Overall debt levels are expected to grow in line with EBITDAR, enabling the  company to maintain its current leverage profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects AutoZone can sustain low-single-digit comps supported by 1%-2%  comps on the retail side of the business and relatively faster growth in the  commercial business. Overall sales growth should be in the mid-single digits due  to the addition of around 200 units annually;  --Modest upside to the company's EBITDA margin of 22.3% but limited longer-term  by a gradually increasing mix of lower-margin commercial and online sales; --FCF of $900 million to $1 billion annually;  --Debt levels are expected to grow in line with EBITDAR, enabling the company to  maintain its current leverage profile. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action could be driven by stronger than expected operating  results with a commitment by management to manage leverage in the low to mid-2x  area. A negative rating action could be driven by softer operating results, including  sales growth that trails the industry, a FCF margin below 8%-10% and/or an  EBITDA margin below 20% for an extended period, or more aggressive share  repurchase activity resulting in an increase in adjusted debt/EBITDAR to the low  3x area. LIQUIDITY AutoZone has adequate liquidity. The company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving  credit facility due December 2019 and a $500 million 364-day facility, primarily  to support commercial paper (CP) borrowings, letters of credit and other  short-term unsecured bank loans. The available balance is reduced by CP  borrowings and certain letters of credit. As of Feb. 13, 2016, AutoZone had  approximately $180 million in available capacity. Combined with readily  available cash of $208 million, total liquidity amounted to approximately $389  million. AutoZone has the option to increase the 2019 revolver to $1.5 billion. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates AutoZone, Inc. as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Bank credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.
