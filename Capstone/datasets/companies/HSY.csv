0,"  DENVER Hershey Co has sued a Colorado maker of marijuana edibles, saying the packaging of its products is too similar to those made by the Pennsylvania-based chocolate and candy company. The trademark infringement lawsuit, filed this week in the U.S. District Court in Denver, says the Ganja Joy bars made by TinctureBelle LLC and TinctureBelle Marijuanka LLC too closely resemble Almond Joy produced by Hershey. It also says three other marijuana edibles - Hasheath, Hashees and Dabby Patty - are knock-offs of Hershey's Heath, Reese's peanut butter cups and York peppermint patty candies. In addition to trademark infringement, the lawsuit said TinctureBelle's behavior ""also creates a genuine safety risk with regard to consumers, including children, who may not distinguish between Hershey’s candy products and defendants’ cannabis"" and might eat the marijuana edibles by mistake.  It was not immediately possible to contact TinctureBelle for comment on Friday. A website in their name was out of action. Voters in Colorado approved a landmark ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana for adults in 2012.  Last month, Governor John Hickenlooper tightened controls on edible and concentrated forms of marijuana as concerns mount about safety issues over pot-infused goodies after two adult deaths possibly linked to such products.  Among the steps taken was the creation of a task force to design packaging for marijuana edibles such as cookies and candy that makes them easily distinguishable from regular foods.

4,"   By Daniel Wallis | DENVER  DENVER A Colorado maker of marijuana edibles says it was surprised to be sued by Hershey Co, which accused it of ripping off the design of the company's iconic chocolates and candies, because it changed its packaging six months ago.Hershey sued TinctureBelle LLC in U.S. District Court in Denver last week, alleging trademark infringement. It also said  there was a safety risk because consumers, especially children, might eat the pot products by mistake.

6,"  WASHINGTON, July 12 Swiss-based chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli is in advanced discussions to acquire family-owned U.S. candy business Russell Stover, and the two companies could announce an agreement as early as next week, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.Quoting unnamed sources close to the matter, the Financial Times said that while it is unclear whether an exact price had been agreed upon, a figure of $1.4 billion is being discussed. The newspaper reported that talks were ongoing and no deal was certain.Russell Stover, known for its boxed chocolates, is the third-largest U.S. candy company by sales. Lindt is the Swiss-based maker of Lindor chocolate balls and gold foil-wrapped chocolate bunnies. A deal with Russell Stover would enable Lindt to diversify further beyond the European market, where it gets a big chunk of its revenues, and get a strong presence in the U.S. market. Russell Stover has annual sales of about $600 million, the Financial Times reported. The Ward family put Russell Stover up for sale earlier this year and has been working with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, to find a buyer, the newspaper reported. The company has won the attention of a number of private equity firms as well as strategic buyers including Hershey Co and Godiva, the newspaper said. The company also produces Whitman's brand chocolates and has its products in more than 70,000 drug stores, card and gift shops, grocery stores, department stores and retail stores throughout the United States and in more than 20 countries worldwide, it says on its website.

17,"  (Adds ICCO statements, detail on U.S. stocks)By Luc CohenNEW YORK Oct 17 U.S. chocolate manufacturer Hershey said on Friday that U.S. cocoa stocks are high enough to prevent disruption to supplies well into 2015, playing down concerns that Ebola in West Africa could roil the $12 billion global cocoa market.More than half of the annual cocoa supply needed for the United States is already in the country, one of the world's top consumers, a company spokesman said in an email to Reuters.The comments from the maker of Hershey's Kisses, some of the most candid from the industry, came as the global death toll from the disease that has ravaged three West African countries rose and calls for a U.S. travel ban from West Africa grew louder.Ivory Coast and Ghana, which together produce 60 percent of the world's cocoa beans, have not reported any cases of the deadly Ebola virus, which has killed more than 4,500 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. But concerns are mounting the epidemic may spread across the border, cutting off critical supplies of raw materials from Ivory Coast, which produces 40 percent of global supplies.Major suppliers have contingency plans in place, which they are prepared to roll out in the event of a supply disruption, one source said.""Our suppliers have assured us they will be able to continue to supply our cocoa orders without interruption, even if the disease begins to impact the major cocoa-growing countries in the region,"" a Hershey spokesman said. Stocks in warehouses registered with ICE Futures U.S. are just under 250,000 tonnes, down 5 percent from a year ago. That accounts for about half of the country's total annual demand.Cocoa prices on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange have surged to 3-1/2 year highs in recent weeks. Soaring prices have already forced Kraft, Hershey and Mars to hike retail prices. In the medium term, the Ebola outbreak is unlikely to significantly disrupt the market, though it has ""seriously curtailed"" production in the three hardest-hit countries, all minor producers, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)said in a statement on Friday.Hershey, which relies on third-party suppliers to source its beans, said it was prepared to source cocoa from other tropical origins in the event of a supply disruption, including Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Peru.Still these countries combined accounted for just 9 percent of world production in the 2013/14 crop year, according to ICCO projections.Trader Archer Daniels Midland, which has cocoa processing operations in Ivory Coast and Ghana, said its operations had not been impacted, while manufacturer Nestle   said it was too early to predict how Ebola would impact business.The chocolate industry is no stranger to supply scares from the often volatile region. Ivory Coast experienced two civil wars in the past 12 years, yet cocoa continued to flow out of the country, traders said.

20,"  Chocolate maker Hershey Co (HSY.N) cut its full-year earnings and revenue growth forecasts, citing higher dairy prices, a stronger dollar and weak sales growth in some markets.The maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, said higher milk prices were hurting its gross margins. The company's shares fell 3.7 percent in premarket trading.Hershey hiked chocolate prices in July for the first time in three years, in response to soaring cocoa and dairy prices. [ID:nL4N0PQ57G]Rivals Mars Chocolate North America and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) have also raised prices this year.U.S. milk prices have been increasing since 2008, when China started sourcing foreign-made milk powder and infant formula after several children fell ill due to local milk products contaminated with melamine. Hershey cut its 2014 adjusted earnings per share growth forecast on Wednesday to 8 percent from 9-11 percent and its revenue growth forecast to 4.75 percent from 5-7 percent. The company said full-year gross margins are expected to decline by about 0.75 percentage point.Hershey also said it expected percentage rise in international organic sales to be in low double digits in 2014 - weaker than the 15 percent it had estimated earlier - due to a stronger dollar.  International sales accounted for about 17 percent of the company's net sales in 2013. Hershey's net income fell to $223.7 million, or $1 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 28 from $232.9 million, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.05 per share.

22,"   By Chang-Ran Kim and Ritsuko  Shimizu | OSAKA  OSAKA Nov 7 For the first time in its 92-year history, Japanese snacks maker Ezaki Glico is getting serious about growing overseas, aiming to fatten its Pocky biscuit into a $1 billion brand to rival global giants such as Hershey's and Oreo.The company's Glico brand and its 48-year-old stick-shaped, chocolate-coated Pocky pretzels are household names in Japan but elsewhere the marque has stalled, capping the firm's overseas business at just a tenth of its $3 billion revenue.Now, the company is rewriting its branding and marketing strategies for Pocky, targeting a more than doubling in sales to $1 billion by 2020. Only 21 snack brands in the world belong to the billion-dollar club, none of them Asian.The plan involves the adoption of the Pocky name everywhere except Europe, where a joint venture is complicating matters, plus uniform new packaging and a universal tagline: ""Share Happiness"".""The hurdles are high, but if they succeed it would mean a huge boost to profits,"" said Tomonobu Tsunoyama, senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center, the research arm of Tokai Tokyo Securities.The task has fallen on Tsuyoshi Matsuki, appointed as global brand manager for Pocky, a post created in Thailand in 2012.To strengthen the product's brand identity, Matsuki standardised the package design to a red box for regular chocolate-flavoured Pocky, and came up with the new marketing slogan. This year in Malaysia, he re-branded the snack from ""Rocky"", its name there for the past four decades.""Sales were left mostly up to local distributors in Malaysia,"" Matsuki told Reuters at Ezaki Glico's office in Osaka. ""Now, we're going to the stores directly for marketing and maybe next year we'll start running TV commercials to give brand recognition and sales a boost.""That tactic has worked in Indonesia, where sales quintupled in 2013 as Glico enlisted popular girl band JKT48 to plug Pocky on TV. Sales staff also regularly visit Jakarta's schools to hand out free samples from red Pocky vans.Such efforts boosted Pocky's worldwide sales across 30 markets by a third to around $400 million in 2013. BLAZING THE TRAIL Still, challenges abound.While rivals such as Hershey's, Oreo and KitKat are big in the West, Pocky's global push is starting in Southeast Asia, where Pocky is priced out of reach for many. ""One major difficulty is penetrating the low-income groups. We lose on price against simple snacks like Oreo,"" Matsuki said, noting that lowering the price was one option.""But then, Pocky has the advantage of being unique.""Indeed, the snack requires an elaborate production process.At a factory near Tokyo, noodle-shaped lines of dough disappear into a 45-metre-long oven whose temperature varies from start to end. Cuts are made in the dough just deep enough to ensure the biscuit breaks off after - not before - it's baked to form a straight edge. The chocolate-coating process is tightly guarded as a company secret.But that hasn't prevented the inevitable copycat products, whose quality Matsuki concedes is improving. ""They're also cheaper than ours, so it's a bit of a headache.""Another challenge is the brand name itself.In Europe, Pocky is sold as Mikado in a joint venture with Mondelez International - the maker of Oreo, Nabisco and other billion-dollar snacks - and Ezaki Glico would need its partner's agreement if it wanted to re-brand.""For now, we'll stay with Mikado,"" Matsuki said.In the United States, meanwhile, Pocky is still a niche, sold mainly at Asian stores or the Asian section of supermarkets. Big retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Costco mainly carry generic brands, leaving room for just a few non-generic products.By 2020, Matsuki expects Pocky to have only a limited foothold in the U.S. west coast - perhaps establishing a stick-snack section with its non-chocolate cousin Pretz - but not enough sales to pay for TV advertising.""It's incredibly difficult to enter the United States as a newcomer,"" Matsuki said. ""But if we succeed in North America, we're talking about billions of dollars in sales.""Whether Matsuki succeeds could determine how Ezaki Glico as a whole does on the global stage.""I look at my job as paving the path overseas for our other brands,"" he said.""If we're too slow with Pocky, everything behind it will get delayed. That's a huge responsibility.""

23,"  (Updates with link to FACTBOX, additional comments from Sugar Coalition in paragraph 12)By Chris PrenticeNEW YORK Nov 18 At first blush, the powerful U.S. sugar industry seemed to clinch a big win last month when U.S. trade authorities struck a deal to restrict rising imports from Mexican rivals.With a closer look, however, it appears that big cane refiners - including the maker of household brand Domino Sugar - might be the biggest losers because the deal could choke off imports of raw sugar from Mexico, cutting critical feedstock.The pact setting quotas and prices on Mexican sugar imports for the first time appeared to be the best possible outcome to a months-long dispute that had threatened to escalate into an all-out trade war.Facing global refined prices languishing at multi-year lows and a market that has been in surplus for years, U.S. sugar producers accused Mexico in March of flooding the heavily protected U.S. market with cheap, subsidized refined sugar and called for penalties on imports.Domino, the top U.S. refiner, is owned by ASR Group, which is the only cane processor that signed onto that case.For Mexican mills and U.S. food manufacturers such as Hershey Co, the eleventh-hour deal might be a better alternative to the import penalties threatened by the trade case. The new reference prices are about half those including duties.The U.S. Department of Commerce has slapped duties of over 50 percent on imports, but has said it will drop them if the pact is sealed. Refiners not involved in the trade case, such as Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV, which owns Imperial Sugar, are also worried, according to filings to the Commerce Department on Tuesday ahead of the deadline for comment.Six of the country's 10 cane refineries, which represent some 4 million to 4.4 million tonnes of capacity, are located at ports, rely on imports and would be starved of raw sugar, Imperial Sugar's President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Gorrell said in a letter.""Mexican exporters could ship all of their sugar quota to the United States as direct consumption sugar,"" he said.The American Sugar Coalition, which represents the petitioners on the case, criticized the deal in a Nov. 18 letter to the Commerce Department, saying the refined sugar specification and listed reference prices would cause ""gross distortions"" in the U.S. market. ""Our ultimate objective is to stop Mexico's unfair trade practices ... and the final pact has yet to do that,"" said Phillip Hayes, a spokesman for the industry group representing the petitioners, in a separate statement.The alarm from within the U.S. sugar industry might surprise many market participants who viewed the influential lobby as having the most to gain from restrictions on refined sugar imports after pushing for years to end free trade with Mexico.Tweaking the terms to assuage the U.S. industry might also delay the deal, increasing the uncertainty about supplies and boosting domestic prices.U.S. refiners ASR Group, Imperial Sugar and U.S. Sugar Corp declined to comment on this story. Cargill Inc and AmCane Sugar did not respond to requests for comment. REFINED VS RAW One of the central worries is the definition of refined sugar in the agreement as having a minimum polarity, a measure of purity, of 99.9 percent. Refiners believe that will skew how much and what Mexico imports through the new quota system, expert trade sources said.Mexican sugar above a 99.5 percent polarity, but under 99.9 percent would not technically be refined under the new deal, potentially dealing a double whammy to refiners.While refined sugar will still be flowing in - perhaps even more heavily because of limits in the draft proposal - it will be categorized as raw under the government's standards.The 99.5 percent polarity sugar can be sold directly to food manufacturers, sidestepping refiners, and is used in drinks or as sugar crystals in baked goods where the whiteness of the sugar does not matter, traders said.Refiners' options for alternative supplies are limited by the so-called tariff rate quota that permits imports from elsewhere if the U.S. government deems the market to be short.""Their access to (Mexican raw sugar) could disappear,"" said Tom Earley, a food policy consultant at Agralytica in Virginia who consults for the Sweetener Users Association, which opposes restrictions on imports.

An announcement could come as soon as this week, they added.The sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential. Hershey declined to comment, while a Krave representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Hershey, which is set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, has been looking at ways to expand its products outside of its iconic confectionary brands into portable snacks, according to a source familiar with the company's thinking. Hershey's most recent acquisition, a majority share of Chinese candy maker Shanghai Golden Monkey Food Co for $584 million in late 2013, was largely intended to build up the company's international footprint.Krave manufactures jerky snacks with flavors such as basil citrus, lemon garlic, chili lime and sweet chipotle. It sells to retailers that include Target Corp, Vitamin Shoppe Inc  and Safeway Inc. Krave was founded in 2010 by Jon Sebastiani, a fourth-generation winemaker looking for a healthy way to regain energy while training for the New York City Marathon.The company received an investment from private equity firm Alliance Consumer Growth in 2013 for a minority stake.

30,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Hershey Co's 	 announcement on Thursday that it will buy jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc reflects a growing appetite for healthy snacks in the United States, even those that were once considered gas station staples. [ID:nL4N0V85VE]Changes in Americans' eating habits are fueling the trend. According to Nielsen data released earlier this month, 30 percent of U.S. consumers specifically look for food that is high in protein. That includes jerky: Sales of Slim Jim jerky were up 20 percent over the last 13 weeks, thanks to the success of bacon jerky products, according to ConAgra Foods Inc.Companies and analysts say that more people are snacking instead of eating full meals. A Nielsen survey from last year found that 49 percent of North Americans say they replace breakfast with a snack. The deal for Krave, which is lower-calorie than traditional meat jerky brands, comes at a time when packaged food companies are looking to expand into faster-growing categories that are perceived as healthier.  ""What it shows is that the large food and beverage companies have a very difficult time of creating brands,"" Paddy Spence, chief executive of Zevia, the maker of a naturally sweetened soda, said in an interview. ""In this case, Hershey felt that it was easier to buy rather than build.""Other potential brands that could be targets for larger packaged food companies include cold pressed juice company Suja Juice, gluten-free popcorn company PopCorners and healthy potato chip company Popchips, according to industry investors and bankers. All three companies, which did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday, are considered prospects because they are high-growth brands in the health and wellness space. Other recent deals in the so-called better-for-you category have included JM Smucker Co's acquisition of fruits and nuts manufacturer Sahale Snacks in August and TreeHouse Foods Inc's purchase of trail mix maker Flagstone Foods in June.Companies are also launching items developed in-house. Last year, Kraft Foods Group Inc  started selling an Oscar Mayer product called the P3 portable protein pack with Oscar Mayer meat, Kraft cheese and Planters nuts. In Hershey's case, the chocolate maker had long said it would consider getting into other categories. Erin Lash, senior analyst at Morningstar, said the company's foray into meat is noteworthy. ""I think it could signal that they may look at deals in a similar vein,"" she said in an interview.

34,"  (The author is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)By Mitch LipkaFeb 11 If you plunk down some big bucks for organic chocolate this Valentine's Day, your sweetie may or may not be impressed.Despite what some people say, such candy does not taste better just because the ingredients are organic, according to experts. The manufacturing process plays a major part.Andy Ciordia, owner of The Secret Chocolatier in Charlotte, North Carolina, says consumers are most likely to notice that mass-produced chocolates using a cacao solution taste flatter than those made on a smaller scale and with natural ingredients.Among the best-known organic brands are Dagoba from Hershey Co, Green & Black's from Mondelez International Inc's  Cadbury and Newman's Own.To be called ""organic,"" a chocolate bar must consist only of certified organic ingredients. That means pesticides and genetically modified ingredients cannot be used.Other chocolates, including the high-end and artisanal kind, may use similar standards but simply lack the certification. Most of what you find at fancy chocolatiers is not organic. The certification costs money, which is one reason organic chocolate costs more.You can pay still more if you buy from the growing number of bean-to-bar organic chocolate makers.Acquiring beans from small co-ops and farms rather than the bulk market and the time-intensive way to produce a chocolate bar results in the big premium.A typical 1.8-ounce bar made by Raaka Chocolate in Brooklyn, New York, for example, retails for $7.99, or $4.44 an ounce. At a Walmart store, though, you can find a 3.5-ounce  organic Green & Black's bar for 94 cents an ounce. Ounce for ounce, that is still more expensive than what the chain charges for a premium Lindt bar, which is not organic, at 71 cents or a giant bar of Hershey's Special Dark for 29 cents.But bean-to-bar chocolate is likely to have only two or three ingredients, usually the beans and sugar, sometimes cocoa butter.By contrast, a bar of Hershey Special Dark has sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, cocoa processed with alkali, milk fat, lactose, soy lecithin, PGPR (emulsifier), vanillin, artificial flavor, milk.A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE  U.S. sales of organic chocolate and organic candy bars were up 16.5 percent in 2013, according to the latest Organic Trade Association data.That is quadruple the growth rate for the overall chocolate market, says Curtis Vreeland, president of confectionery industry market research firm Vreeland & Associates.However, he notes, the organic side represents only about 1 percent of the $20 billion U.S. chocolate market.Perhaps that is because buying organic is more about principles than product.""The primary reason for purchasing organic chocolate is the social and environmental motivation,"" says Carl Jorgensen, director of global consumer strategy-wellness for the branding firm Daymon Worldwide.Amy Grey, 24, a writer for exercise bike retailer Spinning's website in Venice, California, says eating organic chocolate makes sense.""You wash your fruit and vegetables to get the pesticides off before you eat them, but you can't really wash your chocolate to get rid of those chemicals,"" Grey says. ""Organic chocolate means no pesticides and no harmful chemicals being put into your body.""

37,"  (Repeats for wider distribution with no changes to text)By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Siddharth CavaleApril 23 ""There's a Smile in Every Hershey's Bar"", the famous slogan goes, but Hershey Co Inc doesn't seem to have a lot to smile about in China these days.Sales of the maker of The Great American Chocolate Bar nearly halved in the world's most populous country in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period of 2014.The company said on Thursday it was sticking to its plan for China. It had set an annual sales target of $450 million for the country in February.Analysts said a slowdown in discretionary spending has put made that target difficult to meet. ""It doesn't seem like that's achievable,"" said Philip Van Deusen, director of research at Tigress Financial Partners.With China's economic growth slowing to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first quarter, consumers held back on spending on gifts and indulgences, even during the festive Chinese New Year period in February.""While we were seeing some slowdown, in December we weren't planning for as poor a performance (during the Chinese New Year quarter),"" Chief Executive John Bilbrey said on a post-earnings call. China is key to Hershey if it is to achieve its goal of $10 billion in global sales by 2017. The company reported sales of $7.4 billion in 2014.Hershey does not break out sales by region. But based on the company's 2015 target, sales in China were about $333 million in 2014, according to Reuters calculations.Hershey's shares fell as much as 5 percent to a more than five-month low of $93.82 on Thursday. The candy maker's woes in China come at a time when it is struggling to woo consumers in the United States, who increasingly prefer healthier snacks over chocolates. High dairy and cocoa costs are adding to its problems.Hershey boosted its presence in China by buying candy maker Shanghai Golden Monkey Co (SGM) for $584 million in 2014.""We did not anticipate the lower levels of growth in China within the biggest cities and hypermarkets,"" Mark Pogharian, Hershey's vice president of investor relations, said on the call.The setback in China led Hershey to lower its overall 2015 organic sales growth to 3.5-4.5 percent from 4-6 percent.The company also said it would make some ""adjustments,"" including pulling forward its expansion plans into Chinese Tier-2 cities and increasing levels of in-store sampling.

39,"  Hershey Co (HSY.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit due to weak sales growth in China and higher spending on advertising and marketing. The maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups cut its net sales growth forecast for 2015 for the second time, citing higher impact from a strong dollar.The company's shares fell 2.8 percent to $95.50 in premarket trading.Hershey said it now expects net sales to grow 4.5-5.5 percent, down from its previous forecast of 5.5-7.5 percent.The new forecast assumes strong dollar to hurt net sales growth by about 1.5 percentage points.Sales of its chocolates in China grew slower from a year earlier due to ""a decline in consumer confidence related to mixed macroeconomic data,"" Hershey said on Thursday.The company said in February it expects China sales to grow 35 percent to $450 million in 2015. Hershey bought a majority share in Chinese candy maker Shanghai Golden Monkey Food Co in December 2013 to cut its dependence on North America, where health-conscious consumers are shying away from chocolates.The company's net income fell to $244.7 million, or $1.10 per share, in the first quarter ended April 5, from $252.5 million, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.Total costs rose 5 percent to $1.54 billion, with advertising costs increasing about 8 percent and selling and marketing expenses jumping about 15 percent.Hershey said in January it expected earnings per share growth to be pressured in the first quarter due to higher spending on advertising and promotions for ""brand building"". Excluding items, the company earned $1.09 per share.Net sales rose 3.5 percent to $1.94 billion.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.16 per share on revenue of $1.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

46,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Chocolate maker Hershey Co (HSY.N) reported flat quarterly sales for the first time in over five years as volumes fell in North America due to price hikes and demand was weak in China.The maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups also cut its full-year sales forecast for the fourth time.The company's shares fell about 4 percent on Friday. Slowing economic growth in China has weakened spending on non-essential consumer items, including Hershey's Kisses chocolates, which are popular gift items.Hershey said it faced more competition in China as rivals increased discounts and promotions to boost sales after weak consumer spending during the Chinese New Year shopping period.The company also said that profit and sales in its China-based Shanghai Golden Monkey candy and snacks business have been way below its expectations.""None of us are happy with the developments around the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition and integration,"" Chief Financial Officer Patricia Little said on a conference call. Hershey said it would replace Shanghai Golden Monkey's chairman. The company also said it expected to buy the remaining 20 percent stake in the business in the fourth quarter and was determining the price.Hershey bought 80 percent in Shanghai Golden Monkey last year for about $394 million and was scheduled to buy the remaining stake for about $98 million in September. The 121-year old company is under pressure also in the United States, its biggest market, as consumers increasingly turn calorie-conscious.  Hershey's volumes in North America were hurt in the second quarter also after it raised prices last year to reflect higher cocoa and milk costs. The price hikes boosted North America net sales by 1.8 percent to $1.40 billion in the quarter ended July 5.Sales in markets outside North America fell 12.1 percent.

The market has touched record highs, benefiting from near-zero interest rates for almost a decade. Nonfarm payrolls increased 215,000 last month, fewer than the 223,000 forecast by economists, but the unemployment rate held at a seven-year low of 5.3 percent.""The jobs report confirms that the market is progressing at a rate that will allow the Fed to raise rates in September,"" said James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds.The Fed has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy. An improving labor market is key to the Fed's decision to raise rates.

The Nasdaq biotechnology index  fell to a one-month low.Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday as weak earnings reports from media companies stirred fears that more viewers are ditching cable TV, dragging the sector to its worst two-day loss since the financial crisis. Earnings continue to remain in focus. With about three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies having reported, second-quarter earnings are estimated to have increased 1.6 percent while revenues are projected to have fallen 3.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.Nvidia's shares rose as much as 11.2 percent to a four-month high of $22.74, a day after the chipmaker reported a surprise rise in second-quarter revenue.Groupon fell 3.7 percent to $4.51, while Hershey  was down 4.1 percent at $88.41 after the companies reported results.Noodles slumped as much as 25 percent to a life low of $11.37 after the pasta and sandwich restaurant chain forecast full-year adjusted profit and revenue below analysts' estimates.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,562 to 1,265.

50,"  (Adds comments from Wilmar, Kerry)By Martinne Geller and Freya BerryLONDON, Sept 29 The owners of Quorn, a line of meat-free packaged foods, is facing takeover interest from a range of parties from Asia, Europe and North America, as they look to cash in on the world's growing appetite for healthier food.Monde Nissin from the Philippines and Wilmar International  from Singapore are among the parties to have shown an interest, according to sources familiar with the matter.An auction for Quorn, which is owned by Exponent Private Equity, kicked off earlier this month with detailed information  sent to a range of potential bidders, said the sources, who declined to be identified. French yogurt company Danone and Canadian French fries company McCain are also looking at the business, said one of the sources, as well as Ireland's Kerry Group.First-round bids are due in mid-October, but a pre-emptive deal -- in the range of about 500 million pounds ($759 million) -- could be announced as soon as this week, one source said.Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil processor which also sells consumer brands in sugar and sweeteners in Australia, said it did not make a preemptive bid. Exponent, based in London, Danone and Kerry declined to comment. Monde Nissin did not respond to requests for comment. McCain was not immediately available. Quorn is a mycoprotein meat substitute, made by fermenting a type of fungus. It is sold on its own, in ready-meals or in products that replicate burgers, sausages or chicken fillets.The brand capitalises on consumers' growing health consciousness and desire to eat less meat. The deal would be the latest in a string of transactions for foods seen as healthier, such as General Mills' $820 million purchase of organic macaroni-and-cheese maker Annie's, Mondelez International's deal for Enjoy Life Foods, which makes allergy-friendly foods and Hershey Co's buy of Krave Pure Foods, which makes lower-calorie meat jerky.Philippines-based biscuit and noodle maker Monde Nissin, which is planning an IPO as early as 2016, wants to grow outside its traditional businesses. Earlier this year, it bought Australia's Black Swan, a brand of chilled dips, and Nudie, which sells premium juices. Monde has ambitions to do larger deals and emerge as a ""health and wellness company,"" according to one person familiar with the company.Others that have been named as possible suitors for Quorn include Nomad Foods, which recently bought the maker of Birds Eye vegetables, and WhiteWave Foods, which recently announced a deal for a maker of plant-based powdered shakes and snacks.($1 = 0.6587 pounds)   (Additional reporting by Denny Thomas in Hong Kong, Neil Jerome Morales in Manila and Rujun Shen in Singapore; editing by Adrian Croft and David Evans)",2015-09-29,HSY,"Tue Sep 29, 2015 | 12:48pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Quorn fields takeover interest from range of parties -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/quorn-ma-asia-idUSL5N11Z2VB20150929?type=companyNews
51,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chocolate maker Hershey Co (HSY.N), long a staple of middle-class U.S. households, is getting squeezed as consumers either pay up for fancier sweets or seek more savings.    The maker of Hershey kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups reported lower-than-expected U.S. sales on Wednesday and cut its profit forecast for the year, sending shares down 6.5 percent. It has cut such forecasts for five quarters in a row.    Hershey executives said the company is grappling with a growing gap between low and high-income households in the United States, which has changed buying patterns for many consumer goods. On the high-end, consumers are more willing to pay up for premium brands like Green & Black's organic chocolate bars. On the low end, families hunt for greater discounts for products.     Across the board, consumers are making fewer trips to stores, a trend that reduces impulse buying of chocolate bars and other items. Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) are devoting less space to promote products from Hershey and other manufacturers as they respond to the new trends.     “We think the consumer bifurcation has been an important driver,” Hershey Chief Executive John P. Bilbrey said on an investor call, referring to the growing wage gap. Bilbrey said the company has secured more merchandising space for its products in the holiday season and expected trends to improve in the fourth quarter.    Companies ranging from Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) to Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) have spoken of similar pressures in the United States. Some have tried to introduce more products to appeal to low-income consumers at convenience stores and dollar stores.     “We are seeing a widening disparity between upper-income and lower-income” consumers, said Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld in an interview.  The maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies has responded by increasing the variety of sizes, and prices, of its products on sale.    Hershey has tried to keep up by diversifying its portfolio and changing existing products to satisfy consumer preferences for natural ingredients and protein. Earlier this year, the company bought jerky-maker Krave Pure Foods Inc, and said it would use simpler ingredients in its namesake chocolate bars and kisses.      ""The question now is whether Hershey's chocolate could see a new era of somewhat slower growth based on health and wellness concerns among consumers and the premiumization of the chocolate category in the U.S.,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard in a note.

Hershey said it expected sales to be flat to slightly up this year, down from the 1.5-2.5 percent growth it forecast in August. This is the fifth time the company is cutting its sales forecast.Profit is now expected to be $4.10 per share compared with the $4.10-$4.18 it anticipated earlier, as it expects to ""markedly"" ramp up spending during the holiday quarter.

It did not give a reason for the stay. Canada had charged Nestle and others in 2013 with colluding to fix the price of chocolate. At the time, the Competition Bureau recommended lenient treatment for the Canadian arm of Hershey Co, which cooperated with the investigation and reached a deal to plead guilty to a single count of price fixing. Nestle said at they time they intended to ""vigorously defend"" themselves against the allegations. The Competition Bureau spent years probing the allegations of price fixing in a case that also resulted in a class-action suit. Hershey, Mars Inc and Nestle all agreed to settlements as part of that suit.

To date, the Bureau's investigation involving motor vehicle components has resulted in some eight guilty pleas and over C$58 million in fines imposed by the courts since April 2013.The fine comes just a day after John Pecman, the head of the agency vowed that the Bureau would not go soft on cartel and bid-rigging cases, despite a couple of setbacks in some recent cases. Last month, Canadian prosecutors dropped proceedings against the local arm of Nestle in a multi-year investigation into alleged price-fixing of chocolate products. Canada had charged Nestle and others in 2013 with colluding to fix the price of chocolate. At the time, the Bureau recommended lenient treatment for the Canadian arm of Hershey Co, which cooperated with the investigation and reached a deal to plead guilty to a single count of price fixing.""Cracking down on cartels has been, and continues to be, a top priority for the Bureau,"" said Pecman in a speech at law firm Goodmans in Toronto on Tuesday.""We have had some setbacks.

80,"  (Corrects typographical errors in paragraph 5)By Lauren Hirsch and Lisa BaertleinNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, July 1 An elaborate structure put in place to preserve Hershey Co's ties to its local community has been roiled by scandal, creating an opening that Mondelez International Inc seized on to launch a $23 billion for the chocolate giant.While Hershey's board of directors unanimously rejected Mondelez's offer on Thursday, its once impenetrable defenses are now looking weaker due to an investigation into the charitable trust that controls it, as well as controversy facing the Pennsylvania Attorney General (AG), who also has a say in any change in Hershey Co's ownership.The Hershey Trust, set up by the company's eponymous founder a century ago, holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock and without its approval, a sale is impossible.The Trust has blocked Hershey deals in the past, including a 2002 takeover bid for the company, which makes Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.But the Trust set up over 100 years ago to help underprivileged children is now being investigated by the Pennsylvania AG's office for how much it spends and how long its directors have served for. The AG's office has called for the resignation of three of its longest tenured employees. Separately, this year, the Trust fired its executive vice president, after he pled guilty to wire fraud associated with campaign contributions.The Trust is one of Pennsylvania's wealthiest charities. Its shares in the chocolate giant have created a $12 billion endowment that helps to fund a school as well as an amusement park and resort in Hershey, a small town about 100 miles (160 km) west of Philadelphia.Another hurdle to the Mondelez bid is the Pennsylvania AG's office, which has the right to intervene in a Hershey deal if it deems it ""unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company."" The current AG in Pennsylvania, Kathleen Kane, is set to go on trial next month for allegedly leaking lewd and bigoted emails between prosecutors and judges to a reporter. The scandal has been dubbed 'Porngate' by local media.Joel Glenn Brenner, author of the 2000 book 'The Emperors of Chocolate: Inside the Secret World of Hershey and Mars', said that the troubles facing the Trust and Kane could make them less resolute in opposing a deal.""This time, what makes it different is these investigations,  the chaos at the attorney general's office, and the fact that there has been a turnover at the trust,"" he said. The fiduciary duty of the Trust, laid out in a 1909 deed, is to support the Milton Hershey School, an establishment created for children from low-income families, not Hershey's shareholders.In 2002, when Wm. Wrigley Jr. wanted to buy Hershey for $12.5 billion, the Trust called off the sale at the last minute. It also thwarted a deal in 2007, when confectionary company Cadbury entered into conversations about a tie-up and, in 2010, the Trust prevented Hershey from bidding for Cadbury.The Pennsylvania AG's office also helped pull the plug on the Wrigley deal in 2002.The Trust declined to comment on the offer for Mondelez, which would create the world's largest confectioner, but said it hoped to address the AG's concerns.""We expect to appropriately resolve outstanding concerns the Attorney General's office has concerning the interpretation of the 1909 deed of Milton S. Hershey, where he outlined his wishes to provide a funding mechanism to provide the Milton Hershey School with sustainable financial resources in perpetuity,"" said Kent Jarrell, a spokesman for the Hershey Trust board.A spokeswoman for Kane was not immediately available to comment.

83,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Hershey Co (HSY.N) said on Thursday it had rejected a $23 billion takeover bid by Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) that would seek to expand the latter's limited U.S. footprint and create the world's largest confectioner.The snub underscores the challenges Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld faces in wooing Hershey's controlling shareholder, the Hershey Trust, a $12 billion charity created by the eponymous company's founder a century ago. The maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups saw its shares trade above Mondelez's bid of $107 per share in cash and stock, indicating investors expected a new offer.A merger of two of the world's top five candy makers would add Hershey's strong U.S. business to Mondelez's global footprint.     Earlier, a source said that Mondelez had sought to provide assurances to Hershey that it would keep its name and preserve jobs. Mondelez sees little antitrust risk given the limited geographic overlap of the two companies' businesses, the source added.""The board of directors of the company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the company,"" Hershey said in a statement.    Hershey shares ended trading on Thursday up 16.8 percent at $113.49, while Mondelez rose 5.9 percent to $45.51.    Mondelez, the maker of Oreos cookies, is the second-largest confectionary company globally, while Hershey ranks number five. Their merger would put them in the top place at 18 percent of the market, according to market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd. The combined company would leapfrog Mars Inc, which has 13.3 percent of the global market.A fusion of the two would give Mondelez control over the production and distribution of Cadbury brand chocolates in the United States, which Hershey currently holds the license to produce, paying royalties to Mondelez.  It would also give Mondelez the U.S. production and distribution rights for Kit Kat, one of the most popular chocolate brands in the world, which industry sources said would be a significant boost to Mondelez.Nestle SA (NESN.S) manufactures Kit Kat worldwide, but Hershey has the rights in the United States, paying Nestle royalties from sales. Mondelez's bid could put pressure on Nestle to consider its own bid for Hershey. Upon change of control at Hershey, the license would revert back to Nestle for free, depriving value for a potential acquirer.HERSHEY TRUST TROUBLE  The bid pits Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez against the Hershey Trust, one of Pennsylvania's wealthiest charities. The trust has about 81 percent of Hershey's voting rights and in 2002 prevented the Hershey, Pennsylvania-based company from being acquired by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co for $12 billion.Pennsylvania's attorney general also sued to block the Wrigley deal, arguing it would hurt the local community.Created by Hershey founder Milton Hershey to provide for the Milton Hershey School, a private school for children from low-income families, the trust has been the subject of an investigation recently by Pennsylvania's attorney general over conflicts of interest and mismanagement. The trust's chief compliance officer was put on leave last month after a leaked memo showed the board had spent nearly $4 million investigating conflicts of interest and insider-trading accusations against board members. A top trust official was also sacked in May and pled guilty to wire fraud. STARTING POINT Tigress Financial Partners LLC analyst Philip Van Deusen said he expected the offer price to increase, given the rise in Hershey's shares.""I think ($107) is a good starting place,"" he said.Analysts have been skeptical of takeover bids for Hershey in the past.    ""The Trust ... is outwardly very committed to keeping the company independent,"" Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said in June last year. ""So it's pretty much impossible for an activist to get involved or for the company to be bought."" Last year, William Ackman revealed his activist hedge fund Pershing Square had built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez, in what was seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself.Ackman joined fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez.

The town of Hershey, where the company's staunchest loyalists are referred to as ""Hershey-ites"", has real influence over corporate decisions.The Hershey Trust, a $12 billion school charity and the company's controlling shareholder, has become increasingly involved in the local community over the decades, and has appeared to listen to its concerns in the past.Pennsylvania's attorney general, who supervises the trust and can ask a court to block any deal, holds an elected office and is sensitive to local concerns, though the current office holder is not planning to seek reelection.Pennsylvania law requires any charitable trust to consider, when selling an asset, the “special relationship of the asset and its economic impact as a principal business enterprise on the community” and the “special value” of its ties to the community.Since the company was founded by Milton Hershey 122 years ago, residents here have fought many plans that would have changed Hershey Co. and, in turn, a community built around one of the world's most famous confectioners.Although the Hershey Trust rejected the bid by the maker of Oreos cookies, a spike in Hershey's share price above the bid of $107 per share has indicated investors expect a new offer.Many in the rural town of around 14,000 people voiced apprehension to Reuters about a sale, despite apparent reassurances from Mondelez. The food and beverage multinational has offered to keep Hershey's name, move its headquarters to Hershey, and preserve jobs, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because Mondelez has not disclosed details of the bid.

House prices and income levels in Hershey are substantially higher compared to neighboring towns in Pennsylvania, according to government data. Today, the heart of the ""Hershey legacy"" is arguably found in the Milton Hershey School, a private boarding school for around 2,000 students from low-income families.

When some residents complained about the planned demolition of parts of an old Hershey factory in 2012, the company went ahead anyway.""People like things to stay the way they are,"" said a 63-year-old resident who has lived in Hershey since 1978. To be sure, not all Hershey residents are attached to the status quo. Some younger residents voiced indifference to the future of the candy maker, saying practical business considerations should take precedence.On paper, a sale to Mondelez could benefit Hershey. Hershey has a strong U.S. presence while Mondelez has a global network. A marriage of the two would create the world's largest confectionary company with an estimated 18 percent of the market share, said market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd.While Mondelez has vowed to keep Hershey's name and preserve jobs, some said such promises would ring empty with loyal ""Hershey-ites.""U.S. food giant Kraft, now known as Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), drew controversy in 2010 after it shut a factory in southwest England following its takeover of Cadbury, now owned by Mondelez, reneging on an earlier promise to keep the factory open.

When some residents complained about the planned demolition of parts of an old Hershey factory in 2012, the company went ahead anyway.""People like things to stay the way they are,"" said a 63-year-old resident who has lived in Hershey since 1978. To be sure, not all Hershey residents are attached to the status quo. Some younger residents voiced indifference to the future of the candy maker, saying practical business considerations should take precedence.On paper, a sale to Mondelez could benefit Hershey. Hershey has a strong U.S. presence while Mondelez has a global network. A marriage of the two would create the world's largest confectionary company with an estimated 18 percent of the market share, said market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd.While Mondelez has vowed to keep Hershey's name and preserve jobs, some said such promises would ring empty with loyal ""Hershey-ites.""U.S. food giant Kraft, now known as Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), drew controversy in 2010 after it shut a factory in southwest England following its takeover of Cadbury, now owned by Mondelez, reneging on an earlier promise to keep the factory open. ""Would I like it to be sold? No,"" said the 63-year-old resident. ""There is the legacy and the history of Mr Hershey, and what becomes of the Trust? I don't know what will become of the school and the Trust.""

90,"   By Lauren Hirsch  A board member of the charitable trust that controls Hershey Co (HSY.N) has resigned, the fourth such departure in less than 12 months, the trust said on Monday, at a time when the chocolate company is a takeover target for Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O).While no explanation for the move was provided, the resignation came as the trust is locked in a bitter dispute with its direct overseer, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office, over its governance.The $12 billion trust, set up by Hershey founder Milton Hershey over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children, must approve any sale of the company. Its affairs have been in the spotlight since Hershey rejected Mondelez's $23 billion offer two weeks ago.Joan Steel, a Hershey trustee, resigned over the weekend, trust spokesman Kent Jarrell said. He did not provide a reason for her resignation, but said the trust's board would continue to function with its nine remaining members until her replacement is named.Steel could not be immediately reached for comment. Hershey shares rose 2 percent after Reuters first reported the news and were trading down 0.6 percent at $110.00 at mid-afternoon in New York. Mondelez's offer last month, which was half in cash and half in stock, was worth around $107 per share, sources have previously said.Steel's departure follows the resignations of Hershey trustees Richard Zilmer, John Fry and Stephanie Bell-Rose over the past year. Bell-Rose resigned this spring, three months after her appointment, because the position required more time than she had expected and interfered with her responsibilities as senior managing director at TIAA-CREF Financial Services, Jarrell said. Fry, the president of Drexel University, informed the board earlier this year he was saddened to leave, but that his additional responsibilities at Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce mean he would be unable to fulfill his many responsibilities, Jarrell said. Zilmer gave no reason for his resignation, Jarrell added. The attorney general's office is investigating the trust for excessive spending and allowing board members to overstay their terms. The office has been asking three of the Hershey trustees, Velma Redmond, Joseph Senser and Robert Cavanaugh, to step down because they have exceeded the customary board term limits of 10 years.Chief Deputy Attorney General Mark Pacella is seeking a voluntary settlement with the trust by the end of July, the Philadelphia Enquirer reported on July 8, citing internal memos.

102,"   By David DeKok | HARRISBURG, Penn.  HARRISBURG, Penn. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's office on Friday unveiled the terms of a reform agreement with the charitable trust that controls Hershey Co (HSY.N) that includes a 10-year term limit for trustees and limits on their compensation to $110,000.The trust has been in the spotlight since Hershey rejected a $23 billion cash-and-stock offer for the candy maker by Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate, last month. The agreement, which comes after an investigation of several months by the Attorney General's office over the trust's governance, compensation and expenses, could offer the clarity needed for Mondelez to make a new bid to acquire Hershey.      The Attorney General's office had accused the trust of breaking the terms of a 2013 reform agreement. Created by Hershey Co founder Milton Hershey and his wife Catherine over a century ago, the trust runs a school for underprivileged children in Hershey, Pennsylvania.""All the efforts that led to this agreement were made to ensure that the vision of Milton and Catherine Hershey remains intact,"" Attorney General Kathleen Kane said in a statement.Kane also said that making a recommendation on the sale of Hershey would be outside the authority of her office, and that it is up to the company's board to decide on such a matter. The new reform agreement with the Attorney General's office, as first reported by Reuters last week, requires three trustees, Joseph Senser, Robert Cavanaugh and James Nevels, to step down by the end of the year.Senser and Cavanaugh have been trustees since 2001, while Nevels has been a trustee since 2007.Hershey Trust Chairwoman Velma Redmond, who joined the trust in 2003, will step down by the end of 2017, along with James Mead, a trustee since 2007.Cavanaugh, Senser and Mead are also on the board of Hershey Co. The Hershey Trust may continue to elect trust board members to serve on the board of Hershey Co, though no more than three individuals are allowed to be on both boards at the same time. Neither the president of Hershey school nor the CEO of Hershey Trust is allowed to be on the board of Hershey Co.The trust board, which now has nine members, should use their ""best effort"" to have thirteen members, according to the agreement. The trust should seek to hire directors with training and experience that includes childhood education and financial management, the agreement states.The Pennsylvania Attorney General's office will be given a 30-day window to review new board members and must be notified of any relationship to incumbent board members. Trustee compensation will be capped at $110,000. Trust board members who serve on other Hershey company boards, Hershey Co and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, will have their salary capped at $80,000. Additional compensation for board chairs is capped at $30,000, and additional compensation for committee chairs is capped at $10,000.The agreement was filed on Friday in the Orphan's Court Division of the Dauphin County Court.The new deal with the Attorney General's office follows a period of internal dissent and turmoil at the trust. Trustee Joan Steel resigned earlier this month, following the departures of Richard Zilmer, John Fry and Stephanie Bell-Rose over the past year.The Attorney General's office, the trust's sole overseer, had threatened legal action to remove trustees unless a settlement over its governance was reached by the end of July. (Reporting by David DeKok in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Additional reporting by Lauren Hirsch in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Jonathan Oatis)",2016-07-29,HSY,"Fri Jul 29, 2016 | 4:33pm EDT",UPDATE 3-Pennsylvania attorney general announces Hershey trust reform deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/hershey-trust-idUSL1N1AF1TN?type=companyNews

105,"   By Hillary Flynn  NEW YORK, Aug 2 (IFR) - Chocolate-maker Hershey and Google's parent company Alphabet spearheaded another deluge of deals in the US high-grade bond market Tuesday as companies seize the day to raise fresh cash.Eight deals in all joined the fray in the primary market, which priced more than US$23bn on Monday to kick off what is expected to be one of the largest Augusts ever.With a host of headline risks in the air - fallout of Britain's EU departure, a possible rates hike before the end of the year and the unpredictable US election - borrowers are acting quickly.And they are being met by a willing buyside with plenty of money to put to work in a market where yields have turned negative in Europe and Japan.""The market is very robust and the strongest we have seen it for some time,"" said one Wall Street head of syndicate who asked not to be named.""There is a lot of overseas cash coming into the market.""Marquee names have been leading the way, including Microsoft, which sold the fifth-largest corporate bond ever on Monday, a US$19.75bn deal to fund its purchase of LinkedIn. Other boldface credits hitting the market Tuesday include International Paper and Fortune 500 stalwart Mattel, the toymaker behind the iconic Barbie doll.With so many reasons to come to market now, syndicate bankers said they had been expecting in the neighborhood of US$70bn to print in August - typically a slower month for issuance.But the primary was already a third of the way there after Monday's session, and after Tuesday it will be even closer. ""If you look at where Treasuries are, spreads are attractive,"" said another high-grade syndicate manager.""For issuers the time to come is now.""US high-grade bond spreads have widened by 4bp to T+150bp over the past week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data - but remain below wides hit in the aftermath of Britain's shock vote to leave the EU.Ten-year Treasury yields meanwhile are also at attractive levels for issuers, yielding around 1.54% from 1.739% before the UK vote. Alphabet (Aa2/AA) was offering a benchmark 10-year trade, setting initial price thoughts at Treasuries plus 80bp area. JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are active bookrunners.It is the first offering from the company since it overhauled its corporate structure in October 2015, creating Alphabet as the parent of Google and other entities.International Paper, National Grid and Rabobank were also out with benchmark-sized deals, while Hershey (A1/A) was marketing a US$800m two-part trade.The US chocolate company set initial price thoughts of T+90bp area on a 10-year bond at T+90bp area and T+120bp area on a 30-year, sources told IFR.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JP Morgan and RBC are active bookrunners on the Hershey deal.Rounding out Tuesday's menu were a US$700m 10-year bond from state-owned Chilean oil company ENAP and a US$250m 10-year from Weingarten Realty Investors, a real estate investment trust.

107,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Lauren Hirsch and Lisa BaertleinAug 10 The board of the $12 billion charitable trust that controls Hershey Co. will meet this week to discuss appointing new members, a spokesman for the trust's board said, as it embarks on its biggest overhaul in more than a decade.Under a reform agreement announced last month with the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, its sole overseer, the trust will appoint up to nine new board members by the end of 2017. The agreement dictates that the trust must try to recruit members with training and experience in financial investments, in addition to education and social care -- a requirement that could influence its stance on any renewed bid by Mondelez International Inc for Hershey Co.Hershey Co. rejected Mondelez's $23 billion bid in June without providing a reason publicly, though sources familiar with the deliberations said Hershey Co.'s board deemed the price offered to be too low for the trust to seriously consider it.With two-thirds of the trust's investment comprising of Hershey Co. stock, some financial experts say it should consider  opportunities to diversify its holdings and reduce its exposure to risks such as a major fall in commodities prices.""If the trust is bringing financial people on board, I would expect that they would look at it primarily from a financial standpoint. And that is to say if [a deal] makes good financial sense, let's at least pursue a very good offer,"" said Bill Brill, a former member of the alumni board of the Milton Hershey School, which the trust funds and operates.The reform agreement calls for the trust's board to be expanded from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign in order for 10-year terms to be enforced. One trustee resigned last month, leaving a total of nine openings.The attorney general's office has to be given 30 days notice under the agreement to review new trust appointments. The trust is working with executive recruitment firm Heidrick & Struggles International Inc to identify and hire new trustees, sources familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Heidrick & Struggles declined to comment.The attorney general's office pushed for the reform agreement to improve the trust's governance amid allegations of profligacy, self-dealing, and disregard for term limits.FEASTING ON HERSHEY CO.  The trust was set up more than a century ago by Hershey Co.'s founder Milton Hershey with a mandate to run a school for underprivileged children ""in perpetuity"", with the remainder in assets such as mutual funds and real estate.Feasting on Hershey Co. stock has paid off handsomely for the trust thus far. The shares have returned a 384 percent gain for the trust, including dividends. The S&P 500 Index, by comparison, has posted a 133 percent total return.However, some experts argue that more trustees with an asset management background are likely to express concern that a commodities shock or a sharp consumer shift to healthier food options could deal the trust a serious blow.Hershey Co.'s growth has already slowed in the last two years as competitors such as Mars Inc. expand their offerings and premium players such as Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spruengli AG entered the U.S. market. ""What's wrong with the Hershey Trust is that it has a breathtaking concentration in the stock of a single company,"" said Robert Sitkoff, a Harvard Law School professor specializing in wills, trusts, estates, and fiduciary administration.Mondelez's offer was half in cash and half in stock, sources have said. This means the new board members of the trust, whose approval is needed for a sale of Hershey Co., could use such a transaction to substantially reduce its exposure.""The (trust's) board is satisfied that the asset portfolio is being managed in a responsible manner,"" said Kent Jarrell, the spokesman for the trust's board. Hershey Co. declined to comment.Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey Co., it can still be overruled. In 2002, the trust put Hershey Co. up for sale, citing a need to diversify its holdings. At the last minute, it pulled the plug on a sale to chewing gum maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co for $12.5 billion, after the attorney general's office successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid local community protests.Pennsylvania state senator John Rafferty, the Republican candidate for attorney general in the upcoming November election, has said he does not think diversification is always necessary, and has expressed ""serious reservations"" about a potential sale to Mondelez.Democrat candidate Josh Shapiro has said he will ""vigorously protect Hershey's continued success in Pennsylvania"" and protect it from ""multi-national corporations and Wall Street investors willing to destroy Pennsylvania jobs for their own profit.""(Reporting by Lauren Hirsch in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Stuart Grudgings)",2016-08-10,HSY,"Wed Aug 10, 2016 | 7:00am EDT",RPT-Hershey trust to discuss new appointees this week,http://www.reuters.com//article/hershey-trust-idUSL1N1AQ1ZX?type=companyNews

116,"   By Anya George Tharakan  MediaBrix, a fast-growing startup whose software delivers ""moment-based"" mobile advertising, is going after one of the most difficult demographics in the ad business - teens.MediaBrix gives advertisers a chance to target people based on what is happening when they are using an app, as well as on the emotions commonly associated with those circumstances.For example, a game player who has moved up level may get an extra ""life"" through an ad delivered by MediaBrix from a company such as chocolate maker Hershey Co.The combination of moving to the next level, plus getting an extra life, gives the ad greater impact and builds a positive connection between the user and the brand, MediaBrix says.On the other hand, a player facing the unhappy prospect of having to pay for a premium feature may be targeted with a video ad from, say, Ford Motor Co, that will reward the player with the feature in return for watching the ad.Again, a positive relationship is established, the New York-based company says.The formula is used in more than 1,000 messaging, fitness, sports, lifestyle and other apps. The company also does surveys to ask app users what they are feeling while they are using the app. So, for example, if most people using a fitness app say they are happy with a workout, MediaBrix knows it is probably a good time to target an ad.""From day one, MediaBrix has focused on putting the human experience at the center of mobile advertising,"" co-founder and Chief Executive Ari Brandt said in an interview.""When brands put a user's needs before their own, they have a receptive user who appreciates the brands – a win-win situation,"" Brandt said. ""That's what we cultivate.""It's a strategy the company hopes will allow it to generate $100 million in revenue in 2018. MediaBrix said it is operating at a current run rate of $30-$35 million in revenue for 2016. Teenagers are a particular target. ""Teens are notoriously anti-advertising and finicky about how brands participate in their space, so our approach ... is perfectly suited for and embraced by the mobile-first generation,"" Brandt said.Apart from Hershey and Ford, clients include Starbucks Corp, Nike Inc and AT&T Inc. The company, whose investors include Edison Partners, Revel Partners and Horizon Technology, has raised a total of $18 million since launching in 2011.The potential is huge.

117,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch  Hershey Co, the U.S. chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to acquire earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1.The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about the trust's plans for the company.The selection of the new CEO could determine not just the company's financial performance, but also whether the trust will continue to rely on Hershey as its main asset. About two-thirds of the trust's $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. During Bilbrey's five-year tenure as CEO, Hershey doubled its market value to $20 billion, improved its profit margins, and increased its market share in the United States to 31.3 percent from 28.3 percent. Hershey also began to diversify beyond its core confectionary business into other types of snacks. The Kisses chocolate maker said on Friday it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, helped by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The committee is considering internal and external candidates for the CEO job, and Hershey Chief Operating Officer Michele Buck is one of the contenders, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. FAMILY TIME Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company also maintained its full-year earnings outlook.Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer.   ""All of the decisions in my career have been made in consultation with my wife, Teresa, with the impact to our children and our family being paramount. And so it is with that in mind that I have shared with our board, and now you, my decision to retire next year in order to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren who have faithfully and selflessly supported me for so long,"" Bilbrey wrote in a note to Hershey employees on Friday.Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011 after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co.Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, or about $24.5 billion overall, Reuters reported at the time.  Hershey responded that it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time.    The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval.    Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board to 13 members from 10, and for five members to resign by the end of the year.With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings.""Everybody wants clarity. The more ambiguity there is about a situation, the more difficult it is to recruit into it,"" said Peter Crist, chairman of recruiting firm Crist Kolder Associates, referring to the impact the turnover at the Hershey trust will have on the Hershey CEO search.

118,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch  Hershey Co, the U.S. chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to acquire earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1.The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about the trust's plans for the company.The selection of the new CEO could determine not just the company's financial performance, but also whether the trust will continue to rely on Hershey as its main asset. About two-thirds of the trust's $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. During Bilbrey's five-year tenure as CEO, Hershey doubled its market value to $20 billion, improved its profit margins, and increased its market share in the United States to 31.3 percent from 28.3 percent. Hershey also began to diversify beyond its core confectionary business into other types of snacks. The Kisses chocolate maker said on Friday it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, helped by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The committee is considering internal and external candidates for the CEO job, and Hershey Chief Operating Officer Michele Buck is one of the contenders, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. FAMILY TIME Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company also maintained its full-year earnings outlook.Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer.   ""All of the decisions in my career have been made in consultation with my wife, Teresa, with the impact to our children and our family being paramount. And so it is with that in mind that I have shared with our board, and now you, my decision to retire next year in order to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren who have faithfully and selflessly supported me for so long,"" Bilbrey wrote in a note to Hershey employees on Friday.Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011 after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co.Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, or about $24.5 billion overall, Reuters reported at the time.  Hershey responded that it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time.    The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval.    Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board to 13 members from 10, and for five members to resign by the end of the year.With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings.""Everybody wants clarity. The more ambiguity there is about a situation, the more difficult it is to recruit into it,"" said Peter Crist, chairman of recruiting firm Crist Kolder Associates, referring to the impact the turnover at the Hershey trust will have on the Hershey CEO search.    Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans.On Friday, one of the people who agreed to resign from the trust's board by the end of the year, James Nevels, said he would not stand for re-election on Hershey's board in 2017. Nevels currently serves as Hershey's lead independent board director.
