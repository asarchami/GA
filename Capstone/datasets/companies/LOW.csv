5,"  (Adds response from company, background on lead dangers, updates share price)By Julia EdwardsWASHINGTON, April 17 Lowe's Home Centers , the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retail chain, has agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty for violating federal rules governing lead paint exposure, U.S. authorities said on Thursday.The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice said Lowe's had also agreed to implement a new compliance program at more than 1,700 stores nationwide. Lead exposure can cause a range of health problems, from behavioral disorders and learning disabilities to seizures and death. Young children are at the greatest risk because their nervous systems are still developing.Lead-based paint was banned in the United States in 1978 but remains in many older homes and apartments. Dust hazards can occur when the paint deteriorates or is disrupted during home renovation and remodeling. An EPA investigation found that Lowe's could not provide documentation to prove that contractors it hired to work at 13 stores across nine states were certified by the agency, or had used its approved kits to test for lead paint at work sites, the EPA said. ""Today's settlement sends a clear message to all contractors and the firms they hire: Get lead certified and comply with the law to protect children from exposure to dangerous lead dust,"" said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.In a statement Lowe's said it ""has had an aggressive lead-based paint renovation compliance program in place since the EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule went into effect"" and that there had been no reports of lead-based paint health issues associated with projects completed by its  contractors.Lowe's shares were up nearly 0.3 percent at $46.85 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

At the time, the central bank looked past a dismal reading on first-quarter U.S. growth and gave a mostly upbeat assessment of the economy's prospects as it announced another cut in its massive bond-buying stimulus.

New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said on Tuesday inflation should ""drift upwards"" towards the Fed's 2 percent goal, but a swift climb in inflation was unlikely. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said the $2.5 trillion in reserves accumulated by banks could trigger more rapid inflation.Tiffany & Co jumped 8.6 percent to $95.81 as the best performer on the S&P 500 after the jewelry retailer reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year profit forecast.Lowe's Companies slipped 0.6 percent to $45.26  after the world's second-largest home improvement chain said sales picked up in May and it would maintain its full-year sales growth forecast, even as it reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results.

8,"   By Maria Ajit Thomas  Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N), the world's No.2 home improvement chain, said sales picked up in May, after a severe winter in the United States hurt its quarterly results.The company also maintained its sales growth forecast of 5 percent for the year ending January 30.Lowe's sales rose 2.4 percent in the first quarter ended May 2, as strong demand for indoor products such as lightbulbs and faucets more than offset the impact of weakness in outdoor categories, including lumber, building materials and paint.Chief Executive Robert Niblock told Reuters that the company was witnessing a pickup in sale of outdoor power equipment, exterior paint and other weather-dependent categories.""We do believe that we will recoup the majority of those (lost) sales in the second quarter,"" Niblock said.Spring is an important season for home improvement retailers as building renovations pick up and households prepare their gardens.Bigger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) said on Tuesday that its May sales were ""robust"" and it expected to realize in the current quarter most of the sales lost in the first quarter. ""Similar to Home Depot ... Lowe's guidance implies the difficult winter weather in (the first quarter) delayed spring seasonal sales rather than eliminated them,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Laura Champine wrote in a note.Some analysts said the recent slowdown in the U.S. housing market was a risk for home improvement chains, but Lowe's joined Home Depot in downplaying the concerns.Lowe's said stronger job and income growth and loosening credit conditions were favorable for spending on home improvements.""The backdrop for home industry growth remains positive,"" Niblock said on a post-earnings call. However, Lowe's comparable store sales growth lagged that of Home Depot in the first quarter. The world's biggest home improvement chain is benefiting from improved merchandising, strong relationships with contractor clients and better store-level execution, Champine said.Home Depot, which gets most of its business from building contractors, posted a 2.6 percent rise in comparable store sales, while Lowe's posted a 0.9 percent increase.Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected Lowe's comparable store sales to rise by 5 percent. Lowe's raised its full-year earnings forecast to $2.63 per share from $2.60 per share due to a lower tax rate.Analysts on average were expecting $2.61 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Lowe's first-quarter revenue rose to $13.40 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $13.86 billion.Net income increased 15.6 percent to $624 million, or 61 cents per share.Excluding items, Lowe's earned 58 cents per share, below analysts' estimate of 60 cents per share.Lowe's shares were down slightly at $45.30 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

12,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | July 18  July 18 The success of General Electric Co's  impending initial public offering for its private-label credit card unit could ride on investors' willingness to bet that a lukewarm consumer-led U.S. economic recovery heats up.GE began its investor road show on Friday for the IPO of the unit, to be called Synchrony Financial, as it revealed new details about the business.Set for the end of the month, the IPO of 15 percent of Synchrony is expected to raise around $3.1 billion, surpassing Ally Financial Inc as the biggest U.S. financial services stock flotation this year.While the IPO could enjoy a positive initial reception given the strong demand for offerings this year and investors' eagerness to deploy cash in the market, its longer-term performance will likely be hitched to the strength of the belief in a consumer recovery.""It's a good indicator and good investment based on people who believe the economy is going to continue to improve as it relates to the consumer,"" said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, an IPO and secondary offering research firm.More than two-thirds of Synchrony's $9.4 billion in revenue last year came from its retail card business, which offers private label credit cards carrying brands of corporate partners such as Amazon.com Inc, JC Penney Co, Lowe's Companies Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Some of those retailers including JC Penney and Wal-Mart have struggled to find sales growth this year even as the broader economy has recovered, in part because a broad swath of consumers remains constrained by debt and worried about job prospects.Still, they could eventually benefit from a strengthening recovery. A gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in June, the U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier this week, indicating the economy ended the second quarter on stronger footing.Synchrony's rivals in the private label card business include consumer banks such as Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo. Synchrony's other revenue comes from financing for bigger ticket consumer purchases, such as electronics or jewelry, and for healthcare procedures.""My sense is this is fertile ground for a new offering,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""Holders of this paper, they have to believe in the long-term health of the economy and the consumer.""IPOs have performed well initially this year, with stocks rising 22 percent on average between the final offering price and the first day's close, said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster LLC, which helps create index funds for IPOs. ""Risk appetite is quite high because the market is obviously very strong,"" Schuster said.GE, which revealed details for Synchrony on Friday as it posted a 13 percent rise in second-quarter profit, valued the rest of Synchrony at around $17 billion. GE plans to offer the rest of the business to its shareholders through an exchange late next year.""It is the most shareholder-friendly execution,"" GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview. ""It's much more tax-efficient than selling the company outright for cash.""The separation is critical to GE's plan to slim down its GE Capital finance business and boost its industrial operations to 75 percent of company earnings by 2016, up from 55 percent last year.""For GE, it's more about de-risking the company and focusing on the areas in industrial where they want to focus their growth,"" said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.

With the minutes out, investors have turned their attention to the annual meeting of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which will take place from Thursday through Saturday.

33,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 02 (Fitch) Amid slumping retail sales overall, Lowe's  Companies Inc. is emerging as a bright spot as evidenced by its tightening  credit default swap (CDS) spreads, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest  CDS Case Study Snapshot. Five-year CDS on Lowe's tightened 28% over the past month to price at the  tightest levels in seven years. After pricing at 'AA+' levels for much of the  past year, credit protection on Lowe's debt is now pricing in 'AAA' space. 'Improved investor confidence for Lowe's can likely be attributed to strong  fiscal third quarter results and slightly higher full-year guidance thanks to  more home improvement spending overall,' said Director Diana Allmendinger.  Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

36,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO, March 30  CHICAGO, March 30 Amazon.com Inc is launching a home services marketplace that will connect customers with electricians, plumbers and painters in a move to have its services tied to every product sold on its website.Amazon Home Services, which will launch on Monday, will allow customers to buy 700 services such as car maintenance, TV wall-mounting and house cleaning at upfront prices. The quality of the service will be backed with an Amazon guarantee, which the retailer uses to vouch for products sold by third-party sellers on its website.A home services marketplace will extend Amazon's role as a middleman for third-party vendors, which account for about 40 percent of its sales. It would also help Amazon gain an edge in the fast-growing services industry in the U.S. which the retailer estimates to be around $630 billion. ""Third party estimates show that customers spend four times more on services each year than they do on physical products,"" Peter Faricy, vice-president, Amazon Marketplace told Reuters.""So for us the opportunity is very big,"" he said. Around 85 million Amazon shoppers buy products that require servicing or installation, the company said. Amazon will roll out the service nationwide with ""high coverage"" in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.Services marks a new frontier for Amazon, which has focused on selling products as it expanded from books into consumer goods, groceries and media. Local services have been tough for marketplace companies to turn a profit, since offerings must be tailored to each city or region. Amazon will be in direct competition with Angie's List Inc , Craigslist Inc, and Yelp Inc as well as U.S. home improvement chains like Home Depot Inc and Lowe's Companies Inc, which have invested in ways to link customers with local plumbers, painters and other service providers.Amazon will hand pick service professionals after running background checks and offer to match prices if customers get a lower price for the same service and professional on another site, store or directly from the professional within 30 days of a purchase, Faricy said.Amazon Home Services will have a revenue share model with the service providers. The retailer will charge a 5 percent transaction fee, along with platform fees ranging from 10 percent for custom services and 15 percent for standardized services.

""Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year and recovery in the housing market continues,"" Lowe's Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday.U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose in August to its highest level in almost a decade, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. Lowe's sells items such as refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines in its kitchens and appliances category, its biggest by sales. Its outdoor power equipment category includes chainsaws, branch trimmers and generators.The company offered more promotions on appliances to beat fierce competition. This hurt its gross margins to some extent, Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron said. Demand was low for exterior improvement items such as paint due to heavy rain in parts of the United States, Lowe's said. Lowe's net sales rose 4.5 percent to $17.35 billion in the quarter ended July 31, beating the average analyst estimate of $17.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Net income rose 8.7 percent to $1.13 billion, or $1.20 per share, but missed analysts' expectation of $1.24 per share, mainly due to a higher tax rate and a rise in selling and general expenses. Unlike Home Depot, which raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts, Lowe's maintained its forecast of a profit of about $3.29 per share, sales growth of 4.5-5.0 percent and same-store sales growth of 4.0-4.5 percent for the year ending January.Lowe's shares were up slightly at $73.16 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Larger rival Home Depot Inc also reported a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly same-store sales on Tuesday, helped by increased home remodeling activity and a recovery in the housing market.""Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year and recovery in the housing market continues,"" Lowe's Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday.U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose in August to its highest level in almost a decade, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. Lowe's sells items such as refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines in its kitchens and appliances category, its biggest by sales. Its outdoor power equipment category includes chainsaws, branch trimmers and generators.The company offered more promotions on appliances to beat fierce competition. This hurt its gross margins to some extent, Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron said. Demand was low for exterior improvement items such as paint due to heavy rain in parts of the United States, Lowe's said.Lowe's net sales rose 4.5 percent to $17.35 billion in the quarter ended July 31, beating the average analyst estimate of $17.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income rose 8.7 percent to $1.13 billion, or $1.20 per share, but missed analysts' expectation of $1.24 per share, mainly due to a higher tax rate and a rise in selling and general expenses.Unlike Home Depot, which raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts, Lowe's maintained its forecast of a profit of about $3.29 per share, sales growth of 4.5-5.0 percent and same-store sales growth of 4.0-4.5 percent for the year ending January.Lowe's shares were up slightly at $73.16 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

54,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  U.S. home improvement retailer Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) agreed to buy Canada's Rona Inc RON.TO for C$3.2 billion ($2.28 billion), winning over Rona's board with a far higher offer than an unsolicited bid more than three years ago that was opposed by the company and Quebec politicians.The deal will put Lowe's in a stronger position to compete with Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in Canada's more-than $30 billion home improvement market.Lowe's, which withdrew a C$1.8 billion offer for Rona in September 2012, said on Wednesday it had made key commitments, including moving the headquarters of its Canadian business from Toronto to Rona's home base in the Montreal suburb of Boucherville, Quebec.It also said it would retain the vast majority of Rona's employees, keep the brand and ramp up distribution to independent dealers, many of whom had opposed the previous deal.Lowe's previous attempt to take over Rona became a hot-button issue in Quebec.Quebec's economic development minister said it would not be in the interest of the Liberal government to block the new deal, despite a call from the opposition Parti Québécois to reject it.Asked on a call with analysts why Lowe's had made a new offer, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said Rona was ""a much better business today."" After years of disappointing sales, Rona has been closing unprofitable stores and generally streamlining operations under Chief Executive Robert Sawyer. Sales at established stores have risen five quarters in a row.Lowe's push into Canada comes a year after Target Corp (TGT.N) exited the country after less than two years due to supply chain and other issues.The big difference is that Lowe's is buying an established business, while Target was largely starting from scratch. CAISSE ACCEPTS Lowe's, the world's No. 2 home improvement chain, had only 40 of its 1,850 North America stores in Canada as of March. Rona has about 700 stores.Home Depot has 182 Canadian stores, its website shows. Lowe's will pay C$24 per share for Rona's common shares - more than double the stock's close on Tuesday.Rona's largest shareholder, Quebec public pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, said it would accept the offer. The Caisse holds about 17 percent of Rona, Thomson Reuters data shows.BMO Capital Markets analyst Peter Sklar said the deal would likely win regulatory approval.Rona's shares were trading as high as $C23.57 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, their highest since July 2007. Lowe's shares were down nearly 8 percent at $66.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
