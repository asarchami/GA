0,"   By Deena Beasley  Medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson & Co (BDX.N) has agreed to buy CareFusion Corp CFN.N, a maker of infusion pumps and other medical devices, for $12.2 billion in cash and stock, marking the latest multibillion-dollar healthcare sector deal.Becton said on Sunday it would pay a total of $58.00 a share - $49.00 in cash and 0.0777 of a share of Becton Dickinson - for each share of CareFusion, representing a premium of 26 percent to the closing price on Oct. 3.The acquisition, recommended by the boards of both companies, is aimed at combining the two U.S.-based companies' complementary products for preparing, administering and monitoring patient medications while also extending their geographical reach.BD makes products to deliver and administer drugs, like disposable needles, syringes and IV (intravenous) catheters, while CareFusion makes products to store the drugs and to deliver them, such as infusion pumps.A combined company ""could improve patient safety plus reduce costs at the same time,"" said Vincent Forlenza, Becton Dickinson's chairman, chief executive officer and president in a telephone interview. Cost-related healthcare reforms, including those mandated under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, have spurred consolidation for U.S. health systems and hospitals, the main customer for both Becton Dickinson and CareFusion.""This is an industry that from a customer perspective is consolidating,"" said Kieran Gallahue, CareFusion's chairman and CEO. ""Healthcare systems around the globe are looking for companies that can bring greater scale to them - it is a way to drive down costs while improving safety at the same time.""Forlenza said Becton's geographic reach - around 60 percent of its sales are outside of the United States and 25 percent of sales are in emerging markets - offers a strong platform for products from CareFusion, which currently relies on the domestic market for 75 percent of its revenue. Becton said the transaction is expected to provide double-digit earnings growth, on an adjusted basis, in the first full year, and will be accretive to net earnings in fiscal year 2018.The deal, subject to regulatory and CareFusion shareholder approvals and customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first half of next year.  At closing, the companies said Becton Dickinson shareholders will own around 92 percent of the combined company and CareFusion shareholders will own around 8 percent.Healthcare companies have been merging at a record pace, with year-to-date activity topping $346 billion, compared to $212 billion in the year-ago period, Thomson Reuters data  showed as of September.Recent large deals have included AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) planned $54 billion acquisition of Shire Plc (SHP.L) and Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) planned acquisition of Covidien Plc COV.N for $43 billion.

Goldman Sachs is lead arranger and bookrunner on the 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan. Goldman Sachs will provide $2.75 billion of the bridge loan, with $6.35 billion coming from a wider syndication, according to an SEC filing.The bridge loan will be refinanced by up to $9.1 billion of senior unsecured bonds, the filing said.The two companies announced the acquisition on Sunday. Becton Dickinson will acquire CareFusion for $12.2 billion or $58 per share in cash and stock. The acquisition has been approved by the boards of both companies.The loan pays a margin ranging from 100bp to 250bp over Libor depending on rating and date after signing, while there are commitment fees ranging from 10bp to 25bp, depending on rating. There are also duration fees rising from 50bp 90 days after closing, to 75bp 180 days after closing and 100bp 270 days after closing.Although several US acquisitions earlier this year chose to forgo the loan market and finance acquisitions directly with cash or bonds, companies returned to the loan market for bridge loans in the third quarter after an upturn in M&A activity. Recent bridge loans include a $10.7 billion bridge loan backing GTech Corp’s $4.7 billion cash and stock acquisition of U.S. based International Game Technology (IGT); a $16.3 billion, 364-day bridge loan to back U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N; and a 13.5 billion pounds ($23.03 billion) loan backing U.S. drugmaker AbbVie's (ABBV.N) 32 billion pounds acquisition of Dublin-based Shire Plc (SHP.L).

8,"   By Sophie Sassard and Anjuli Davies | LONDON  LONDON Oct 15 ConvaTec's owners have appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to explore a sale of the medical device maker which could be worth up to $10 billion, sources familiar with the matter said.Private equity firms Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital are preparing the groundwork for a possible sale or initial public offering (IPO) in 2015 for the Luxembourg-based company, said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private.Mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare space have hit a record pace so far this year, in part driven by U.S. companies seeking to redomicile in countries that have a lower corporate tax rate, in a practice known as inversion.Kimberley-Clark and 3M are considered likely bidders for ConvaTec, said the sources, adding that the U.S. firms' interest was not motivated by tax inversion issues. ConvaTec, Nordic Capital, 3M, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Kimberley Clark and Avista Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reuters reported in August that some U.S. companies including diversified manufacturer 3M and medical equipment makers CareFusion Corp and C.R. Bard Inc were potentially exploring a deal, but that ConvaTec wanted to boost its value further before launching an auction or IPO. CareFusion has since been swallowed by medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson & Co for $12.2 billion, taking them out of the field. Also, in recent weeks equity markets have stumbled and the market for IPOs has stalled.Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital acquired ConvaTec from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co in 2011 for $4.1 billion. 3M and Kimberley-Clark were among the contenders for ConvaTec at the time, according to people familiar with the matter.ConvaTec reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $502.5 million in 2013, up 15 percent year-on-year. It is hoping to exceed $600 million in EBITDA this year, sources have said.The company makes wound care and ostomy care products at 11 manufacturing sites in eight countries, and sells them in more than 100 countries.

12,"   By Brendan Pierson  A U.S. federal court has ordered medical device maker Becton Dickinson and Co to notify customers that it falsely claimed its safety syringes were sharper and wasted less medicine than those of rival Retractable Technologies Inc.The order, handed down Monday by Judge Leonard Davis in the Eastern District of Texas, follows an award of $340 million in damages to Retractable in September 2013 after a jury trial.Besides notifying customers directly, Becton must post a notice on its website and provide comprehensive training for its employees and distributors to avoid any future false claims.Retractable, which is located in Little Elm, Texas, sued Becton in June 2007, accusing the Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company of trying to monopolize the market for safety syringes through false advertising. Davis on Monday also rejected Retractable's bid to recover an additional $260 million in profits it said Becton Dickinson earned from false advertisements, saying they were already included in the $340 million award.The judge also ruled that Retractable Technologies' request for $36.5 million in legal fees was too high and ordered the company to recalculate the amount. Retractable Chief Financial Officer Douglas Cowan declined to comment.Becton Dickinson spokeswoman Erica Ellenberg did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

14,"  * Innovative Medicines and MedTech Review to report in 2015* Follows criticism that Britain is too slow to adopt new drugs* Britain eager to promote itself as life-science hub* Merck, Becton Dickinson plan 63 mln stg investmentLONDON, Nov 20 The British government has launched a review to speed the path to market for new drugs and medical devices in an attempt to improve patient care and make the country a more attractive place for investment in life sciences. British manufacturing relies heavily on the pharmaceuticals sector, including domestic giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, but companies complain that the state-run National Health Service (NHS) is too slow to adopt new treatments.The review, announced at a meeting between industry leaders and ministers at Prime Minister David Cameron's Downing Street office on Thursday, aims to tackle the issue by studying innovative models for drug development.This will include an examination of the scope for more collaborative work between companies and regulators to ensure that new medicines and devices are assessed more quickly, with greater input from patient groups and charities such as Cancer Research UK. An independent organisation will be appointed to carry out the Innovative Medicines and MedTech Review, starting work early next year and reporting later in 2015.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the initiative is ""a big step in the right direction"" but that it needs to dovetail with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which assesses whether treatments are sufficiently cost-effective for the NHS. NICE has frequently clashed with industry over its rejection of some expensive new medicines, notably cancer treatments.Cameron first announced a drive to make Britain a leading hub for life sciences in 2011, welcomed at the time by industry.In the latest boost to the sector, United States-based Merck & Co plans to invest at least 42 million pounds ($66 million) in Britain over the next three years, while Becton Dickinson is investing 21 million pounds, the government said.Merck plans a new licensing hub in London and will expand drug research facilities, while Becton Dickinson is to build a plant in southwest England to produce blood separation tubes.

15,"  (Headline should say December)By Danielle RobinsonNEW YORK, Dec 5 (IFR) - Medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson pushed the first week of December into record territory on Thursday, with a US$6.2bn five-part transaction to help pay for its US$12.2bn acquisition of CareFusion.The deal was the third jumbo offering to come to market in four days, following on from Medtronic's US$17bn acquisition financing - the biggest deal this year - and a US$6bn trade by Amazon.""It's quite remarkable that we have had almost US$50bn this week, and the fact that it's coming in December is shocking,"" said one senior syndicate manager.At US$49.55bn, the week's new-issue tally is the second biggest this year and the third largest ever.Traditionally, the bond market slows down in December. But the torrid pace of mega deal issuance this week is just a taste of what's to come in 2015, as debt financed M&A needs and share buybacks continue to rise.""One of the big drivers [of debt issuance] for next year will be M&A,"" said Jonny Fine, head of debt syndicate at Goldman Sachs. ""There are about US$94bn of visible bridges of M&A debt financing already in the pipeline.""""The majority of transactions we've seen that were US$5bn or more were either M&A-related or funded share repurchase programmes,"" said Peter Aherne, head of North America capital markets, syndicate and new products at Citigroup. ""These two themes will definitely continue into 2015.""Becton's trade was the 20th deal of US$5bn or more in 2014 - with the number of such transactions up 25% on last year and by far the highest since the financial crisis. ""It's quite remarkable that we have had almost US$50bn this week, and the fact that it's coming in December is shocking.""Market participants are now waiting to see if Southwestern Energy brings the last expected mega deal on the list for this year, to take out the US$5bn bridge for its acquisition of oil and gas assets from Chesapeake Energy. It might leave it until next year, however, given the plunge in oil prices.CASH PUT TO WORK  The need for large financings has happily coincided with a preference for large bond deals, not just because of an unrelenting US$83bn inflow into high-grade funds by the end of November, but also because of the sea-change in the way investors now have to source funds in a chronically illiquid market.""At the moment, there's a confluence of events that lends support for continued demand for mega M&A debt financings,"" said Leo Civitillio, global co-head of fixed income capital markets at Morgan Stanley.""Investors have more cash to put to work than there is available supply and structural challenges in sourcing bonds in the secondary market have increased the number of accounts looking to source bonds in the new issue market.""Line items in deals have increased as a result - by about a third, according to syndicate heads. Amazon attracted about 1,000 line items, while Alibaba's US$8bn debut in late November saw as many as 3,000 and Medtronic saw north of 1,500. TELEGRAPHED These successes also have a lot to do with borrowers being more willing to swallow higher new-issue concessions in a still low rate environment, and the fact that the timing of M&A take-outs are well telegraphed to investors ahead of time.Becton, Medtronic and Amazon attracted almost US$88bn of demand between them, even though ratings agencies have frowned upon each credit for their dramatic increase in debt.Medtronic initially was only going to issue US$2.8bn to pay for its US$43bn acquisition of Covidien, but moves by the US Administration to stop the flow of so-called tax-inversion M&A trades forced it to increase the cash portion of the financing to US$16bn.Amazon's US$6bn deal, the proceeds of which are expected to be spent partly on share buybacks, triples its outstanding debt, and Becton Dickinson decided to raise US$9bn of cash in bonds and loans to pay for the bulk of its CareFusion acquisition.New-issue concessions surprisingly tightened as the week went on, in part because investors suddenly realised that the pipeline for December was emptying and they still had cash to put to work.Amazon attracted US$14.9bn of demand after agreeing to pay 20bp-25bp of new-issue premium across its five, seven, 10, 20 and 30-year tranches, because of the ambiguity around the use of proceeds. Medtronic attracted US$45bn of orders and paid 15bp of premium.But by the time Becton Dickinson came on Thursday, average new-issue concessions had dropped from 14bp on Monday, to around 10bp on Wednesday and to as low as 3.75bp for non-financials on Thursday. Becton only paid 5bp of new-issue concession across its threes, fives, 10s and 30s.

38,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal appeals court on Friday threw out an antitrust verdict that ordered medical device maker Becton Dickinson and Co (BDX.N) to pay rival Retractable Technologies Inc (RVP.A) $340 million in damages over its marketing of safety syringes.Shares of Retractable tumbled more than 50 percent and hit their lowest level in roughly 3-1/2 years.The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans called Retractable's claim that Becton violated the Sherman Act by trying to monopolize the U.S. safety syringe market ""infirm as a matter of law.""Writing for a 3-0 panel, Judge Edith Jones also called ""unsupported and incoherent"" the allegation that Becton ""tainted"" the market for retractable syringes while secretly plotting to offer its own once Retractable's patents expired.""RTI has not demonstrated that BD engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct,"" Jones wrote.But the appeals court agreed that Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based Becton could be held liable for falsely advertising that its needles were sharper and wasted less medicine. It ordered a lower court judge to decide how much profit Becton should give up as a result.Safety syringes are designed to protect patients from needlestick injuries and contamination.Both Retractable and Becton, and their law firms, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Retractable were down $1.26, or 51.4 percent, at $1.19 in afternoon trading, after earlier falling as low as $1.15. Becton shares were up 0.4 percent at $165.36.Retractable, based in Little Elm, Texas, accused Becton of trying to thwart competition by offering loyalty discounts and rebates, or requiring that customers not buy syringes elsewhere.In September 2013, a federal jury in Texas awarded Retractable roughly $113.5 million in damages, which was later tripled. That verdict later became the basis for an injunction requiring Becton to tell customers about its false claims.Jones voided that injunction, but said a substitute based on the false advertising violations was ""theoretically possible.""The case is Retractable Technologies Inc et al v. Becton Dickinson & Co, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-41384.
