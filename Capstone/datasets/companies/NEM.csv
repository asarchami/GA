Mining contributes about 12 percent of gross domestic product to Southeast Asia's largest economy.Singapore's Ibris Nickel Pte Ltd is the first miner to announce it has put operations on hold ahead of the ban. Ibris Chief Operating Officer Agus Suhartono told Reuters it halted operations at the start of the month and may be forced to lay off some of its 1,400 workers at its mine in Southeast Sulawesi. Ibris does not have a refinery and exports all of its nickel ore production.""Workers have already stopped working because there is nothing they can do,"" Suhartono said.The miner, which is part of the Ibris Group, announced plans in June to build a $1.8 billion nickel pig iron plant. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration is working on a special regulation that will likely ease the export restrictions on companies already processing some ore domestically, although moves to water down the ban have been opposed by the country's parliament.The Indonesian Mining Association said it was told by the government the new regulation would exempt Freeport and Newmont from the ban, but maintain the restrictions on hundreds of other miners that do not process any of their ore domestically.Freeport and Newmont, which refine only about a third of their copper output in Indonesia, account for 97 percent of the country's copper production. Officials with the energy and mining ministry declined to comment on the pending regulation, which is expected to be announced before Sunday's ban.The ore export ban has come at an unwelcome time for the government, as Indonesia scrambles to cut a large account deficit that has been undermining confidence in its currency, which was Asia's weakest last year after falling more than 20 percent to the dollar.Any cut in exports will only mean a bigger deficit. Indonesia's central bank said on Friday the current account deficit could exceed 3 percent of GDP due to the risks from lower commodity prices and the mineral export ban.Southeast Asia's largest economy reported a current account deficit of 3.8 percent in the third quarter of 2013, easing from a record high of 4.4 percent the previous quarter.The mineral export ban is part of a 2009 mining law that aimed to increase the export value of Indonesia's commodities.Under the ban, the government estimates processed minerals will boost foreign revenue from metals to $25 billion in 2016 from $11 billion last year, said Sukhyra, director general of coal and minerals.

1,"  * Freeport, Newmont may emerge unscathed from Jan. 12 export ban* Worsening economic climate forces government's hand* Policymakers wary of job losses, civil unrest ahead of electionsBy Michael Taylor and Kanupriya KapoorJAKARTA, Jan 10 Indonesia's mineral ore export ban, an ambitious policy aimed at getting more money for its resources, will hit domestic miners who have already begun shedding jobs and leave foreign firms unscathed.The mineral ban is an attempt to transform Southeast Asia's biggest economy from being simply a supplier of raw materials into a producer of finished goods, boosting government coffers.The new rules, one of the biggest policy moves by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in nearly a decade in office, force firms to commit to invest millions on processing minerals if they want to ship their goods out.""The problem with this policy is that the smaller miners have no capacity or money to invest in smelters,"" said Sofjan Wanandi, head of the Indonesian Employers Association (APINDO).""We gave input to the government that those that haven't been able to give that (smelter) guarantee will have a hard time if there is a total ban but ... we can't protect the small miners for too long.""The damage is already being felt. Almost 30,000 mine workers have been laid off as more than 100 junior miners halt operations, according to the Indonesian Mineral Entrepreneurs Association. The government has been scrambling in recent months to water down the law, initially introduced in 2009, on fears it will widen a large current account deficit and add to the falling  rupiah's woes. Some miners, betting on a backdown on the policy, have done little to boost their infrastructure ahead of the ban, raising the spectre of a big decline in export revenues.Indonesia is the world's top exporter of nickel ore, refined tin and thermal coal, and a major producer of copper, iron ore and bauxite. Its mineral wealth accounts for about 5 percent of total exports. Mining contributes around 12 percent to its GDP.Yudhoyono's administration has backed several policies aimed at generating greater profits and creating more jobs from natural resources with some success in tin, cocoa and palm oil.After weeks of wrangling between officials, legislators and mining companies, last-minute government proposals will allow U.S. giants Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining Corp to continue shipping copper concentrate.Nickel ore and bauxite remain banned, hurting shipments from smaller miners like state-owned PT Aneka Tambang, unlisted PT Harita Prima Abadi Mineral and Singapore's Ibris Nickel Pte Ltd. The government argues that copper undergoes at least some processing into copper concentrate before it is exported, while nickel and bauxite ores are completely unprocessed, shipped out as earth dug up and dumped into barges.But it is these smaller, low-cost operations that are locally run and employ thousands of workers.The planned revised ban will cut government revenue by as much as $820 million this year, the finance minister said on Friday.Mining industry figures in Indonesia have long criticised the time given to develop downstream industries and build smelters, citing the lack of power and infrastructure in remote areas where mines are often located.Ample global smelting capacity, coupled with weak metal prices, have also been given as reasons why new smelters would not be economically viable. ""NATIONALIST FERVOUR"" For the government to force miners to stop work would also  result in large job losses - both at mines and their supporting industries - stoking political and civil tensions in some of the more volatile provinces.""This policy will result in mass layoffs for workers in the mining sector,"" said Subiyanto, general secretary for All-Indonesia Workers Union, speaking at a 1,000-strong protest outside the mines ministry on Thursday. ""We asked that it be revised.""We agree in principle but ... the government has done nothing to prepare the infrastructure (for smelters) since the law was proposed.""Seen as an example of a creeping resource nationalism in Indonesia, the government's last-minute scrambling highlights a perceived dithering by Yudhoyono, who will step down after elections later this year.Parliamentarians blocked an attempt by the government in December to amend the law, prompting the president to pursue the last-minute regulation. Lawmakers argued that, in the long run, the completion of new smelter projects would create jobs.""Everybody is expecting that nationalistic fervour will reach a fever pitch with the elections so nobody will pull back on this until the elections are over - if ever,"" said Hans Lukiman, a commissioner at privately-held Indonesian nickel, iron ore and coal miner Ascend.",2014-01-10,NEM,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 4:36am EST",Indonesia's export ban bullet to miss foreign miners as local players hit,http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-mining-ban-idUSL3N0KI2LZ20140110?type=companyNews
2,"   By Kanupriya Kapoor and Yayat Supriatna | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Jan 12 Indonesia banned all mineral ore exports, as expected, on Sunday, but will likely allow U.S. mining giants Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold and Newmont Mining Corp to continue to ship billions of dollars worth of copper overseas.The Southeast Asian nation is the world's biggest exporter of nickel ore, refined tin and thermal coal and home to the fifth largest copper mine and top gold mine.The ban aims to boost Indonesia's long-term return from its mineral wealth by forcing miners to process their ores domestically. But officials fear a short-term cut in foreign revenue could widen the current account deficit, which has undermined investor confidence and battered the rupiah.""Starting at midnight on Jan. 12, 2014, raw ore definitely cannot be exported,"" Energy and Mines Minister Jero Wacik told reporters shortly after a marathon meeting with the president and cabinet ministers.However, in one of his biggest economic policy decisions since taking office nearly 10 years ago, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono passed a last-minute regulation that will likely ease the ban's impact for major mining companies like Freeport and Newmont. Details of the regulations were to be released later.""Not only Freeport and Newmont, but we have 66 companies that have said they will build smelters ... these (firms) will get a chance to export processed minerals,"" Wacik said.""The energy ministry will later give more details on the levels of concentrate allowed.""Most of the companies expected to feel the impact of the ban are small domestic miners, numbering in the the hundreds, that cannot afford to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to build a smelter.Mineral shipments totalled $10.4 billion in 2012, or around 5 percent of Indonesia's total exports, according to the World Bank. HALTING SHIPMENTS The uncertainty over the ban has forced Indonesia's top copper producer, Freeport, to halt exports until the government provides clarity on which minerals can be shipped, a union official told Reuters.""There will be no concentrate exports from Freeport Indonesia in Papua as long as there is no government policy providing certainty on concentrate exports,"" said union official Virgo Solossa, adding that the firm has not made a shipment from its port since Dec. 15.Company spokeswoman Daisy Primayanti said Freeport continued to provide copper to its local smelter for use domestically. Freeport, the country's dominant copper produce with 73 percent market share, last month warned an unrevised ban would cut output at its Grasberg mine by 60 percent and lead to layoffs of half of its 15,000 Indonesian employees.Under the proposed regulation that was being reviewed by the president in the run-up to the deadline, Freeport, Newmont Mining Corp and other miners would still be allowed to export copper, manganese, lead, zinc and iron ore concentrate until 2017.But nickel ore and bauxite exports worth more than $2 billion annually would still be banned, while coal and tin shipments would not be affected.However, it was not clear whether the final regulation had been revised. ""In our discussion (about the ban), our considerations were first about the workforce, which shouldn't face mass layoffs,"" Energy and Mines Minister Wacik said.""Second was about the local economy, so it doesn't face any burden from the new regulations. Then, domestic companies should be allowed to continue operating.""More than 100 mining companies have been forced to reduce or shutdown operations due to the uncertainty surrounding the mineral export ban.Along with Freeport, Indonesian miner Perusahaan Perseroan Aneka Tambang (Antam) also stopped nickel ore exports a few days ago, the firm's corporate secretary Tri Hartono said.A major economic impact could make the ban a hot political issue in this year's legislative and presidential elections, especially if it sparks a wave of layoffs in the world's fourth most populous country.Thousands of mine workers have already been laid off ahead of the ban, sparking protests in Jakarta.""We call on all mining workers to prepare to go on the streets and swarm the presidential palace if the government goes ahead with the implementation of the ban,"" said Juan Forti Silalahi of the National Mine Workers Union in a statement earlier on Saturday.Police have been stationed at ports and around mines to secure those places in case of public disturbances, said national police spokesman, Boy Rafli Amar.",2014-01-11,NEM,"Sat Jan 11, 2014 | 1:29pm EST","Indonesia bans mineral ore exports, but may allow Freeport shipments",http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-minerals-idUSL3N0KL06L20140111?type=companyNews

12,"  * Indosmelt says smelter margins are very small, calls for govt help* Says its copper smelter due to start construction next month* Indosmelt has conditional purchase agreements with Freeport, NewmontBy Michael Taylor and Wilda AsmariniJAKARTA, Feb 4 Indonesia's government must provide tax holidays and other financial incentives to convince companies to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to build copper smelters amid weak global prices, said the head of smelting firm PT Indosmelt.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono last month imposed new mining policies, including a controversial mineral ore export ban and progressive export taxes, aimed at forcing miners to build smelters and process their raw materials in Indonesia. The policies have forced U.S. miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining Corp, which together produce 97 percent of Indonesia's copper, to halt all exports. The two firms have yet to commit to building smelters, saying it was not economically viable to make such large investments.""The margins for smelters are small, very small,"" Natsir Mansyur, president director of privately owned and unlisted PT Indosmelt told Reuters. ""There must be incentives from the government. To build (a smelter), this business should be protected by the government.""In mid-2012, government officials said they planned to offer financial incentives to help firms build smelters to comply with the new mining regulations, although the details have yet to be announced and talks are still ongoing. Indosmelt is planning to start next month construction of a 700,000-tonnes capacity copper smelter, with production due to start in 2017 or 2018. Mansyur did not say whether PT Indosmelt was receiving any government incentives.A consortium of local and foreign banks would finance 70 percent of the $1.5 billion needed for PT Indosmelt's South Sulawesi copper smelter, said Mansyur, who is also an official at the influential Indonesia Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Copper smelters process copper concentrates to make blister or anode, which is then refined into cathode. Besides PT Indosmelt, other firms due to start construction of copper smelters include PT Nusantara Smelting and PT Global Investindo.Southeast Asia's largest economy currently has only one copper smelter, PT Smelting in Gresik, East Java, and receives its concentrate supplies from both Freeport and Newmont.Indosmelt has reached ""conditional sale and purchase agreements"" to also receive copper concentrate supplies from the U.S.-based miners, the miners' representatives said.To make a copper smelter economically viable in Indonesia, benchmark copper prices must trade above $6,000 a tonne, said Mansyur. ""With current LME copper price at about $6,000-$7,000, we can get a profit,"" he said. ""At least a minimum price of $6,200 to break even.""Goldman Sachs last month forecast global copper prices would rebound from a four-year slump by 2016 and average around $7,500 a tonne in 2017, a year before Indosmelt's project begins operation.

As well as a ban on unprocessed ore shipments, a last-minute export tax on concentrates was also brought in.The tax ratchets up sharply before an outright export ban from 2017 and Freeport and Newmont Mining Corp, which produce 97 percent of Indonesia's copper, have halted all exports and are locked in talks with the government because they say the tax breaches their contracts.This has deepened uncertainty on plans to construct three copper smelters, since the firms building them say they need firm supply guarantees from Freeport and Newmont to put in place financing so they can proceed. Miners may have to slash output if there is not enough refining capacity once the export ban takes effect in 2017.The impasse shows how a policy aimed at supporting higher value economic activity has not only stopped mineral exports but risks undermining the type of investment it was supposed to promote.""There is going to be another train wreck because there isn't enough time to get approvals and build smelters before the new 2017 deadline,"" said Julian Hill, a Jakarta-based mining advisor at Deloitte Konsultan Indonesia. ""The mining ministry is beginning to realize that they have created one hell of a mess and are looking for ways out of it.""Before the ban, Indonesia was the world's biggest exporter of nickel ore.

A senior government official said Freeport would resume exports of copper concentrate in the ""near future"".Around $500 million a month in ore and concentrate exports have stopped since President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in January imposed mining rules, which included the progressive tax and a mineral ore export ban, to force companies to build smelters and process raw materials in Indonesia.""The export tax can be changed. For those who have seriously committed to building smelters, we will ease it,"" said Sukhyar, director general of coal and minerals for the mines ministry.""The export tax can be lowered or maybe eliminated to zero percent."" By contrast, Indonesian government officials have said over the last few weeks that Jakarta would not back down from the export tax or any of the mining regulations passed last month.Before the ban, Indonesia was the world's biggest exporter of nickel ore. It is also a major supplier of refined tin, thermal coal and copper.Freeport and Newmont have refused to pay the progressive export tax, which rises from 25 percent this year to up to 60 percent by the second half of 2016, saying it breaches their contracts.High-level executives from the two companies, which together produce virtually all of Indonesia's copper, have been involved in talks with the government for weeks over the tax and the building of smelters.

21,"  (Corrects fifth paragraph to clarify that deaths came after construction was suspended, not before.)By Allison MartellTORONTO, March 1 Tensions at Newmont Mining Corp's Conga project have been reduced, Peruvian Vice President Marisol Espinoza told Reuters on Saturday, but local communities still have doubts about the stalled copper gold mine.Peru has a significant mining industry, but in recent years violent protests have derailed some major projects, including Conga. Last September, Peru's then-mining minister was quoted in the Los Angeles Times saying work on Conga would soon resume, but Newmont said nothing was imminent.""Communities are still fighting for their demands. There are some reservations,"" said Espinoza, through an interpreter. ""In that regard the government is working really hard to provide basic services, infrastructure services such and water and sanitation."" Many peasants who live near Conga, in the northern region of Cajamarca, fear it would pollute or deplete their water, so improving infrastructure could be key to resolving the conflict.Denver-based Newmont suspended mine construction in 2011 after violent protests. It said it would focus on building water reservoirs and winning over local people. The next year, five people were killed in clashes over the project. President Ollanta Humala has broadly backed Conga, but the dispute rattled his government, sparking cabinet shuffles. The situation has been closely watched by investors, along with progress on Southern Copper's Tia Maria project, also the target of protests.Espinoza was in Toronto for the world's largest mining industry gathering, the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention, which opens on Sunday. She said Peru's government will continue to support projects that benefit not just investors, but also local communities.Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara confirmed in an email on Friday that Newmont has not yet decided whether to resume mine construction at Conga. He said the Chailhuagon reservoir, completed last May, is now full ahead of the dry season, which usually starts in April.""We expect the on-going water releases will continue to benefit the downstream communities until and throughout the entire dry season,"" he said.Peruvian miner Buenaventura has a minority stake in the Newmont-controlled joint venture that owns Conga, as well as the nearby Yanacocha gold mine.

22,"  SYDNEY, March 2 Output of gold in Australia, the world's No. 2 producer, rose to its highest in a decade in 2013 as richer ores were mined to combat weak bullion prices, a survey released on Sunday showed.The practice, known as high-grading, caused output to jump by 7 percent, or 18 tonnes, to 273 tonnes (8.8 million ounces) last year, worth about $9 billion and the highest since mid-2003, according to a tally by Melbourne-based consultant Surbition Associates.""The 2013 total gold output of 273 tonnes is the highest annual figure since 2003,"" said Dr. Sandra Close, a Surbiton director. ""Producers are responding to lower gold prices by treating less low grade material and this results in higher output and reduced costs.""The downside in processing higher-grade ore is that some lower grade ore that was economic to treat at higher prices is no longer profitable, Close said, suggesting output could go down once the richer material is mined out.Rising bullion prices in 12 of the past 13 years made lower-grade ore profitable to extract, allowing miners to expand their reserves. But a 28 percent decline in the price of gold in 2013 to just above $1,200 at year-end means that mining some of those reserves would no longer pay off. Gold was quoted at $1,327 an ounce on Sunday. In Australian dollars, bullion fell only 16 percent to around  A$1,345 per ounce, owing to a decline in the Australian dollar.Since January 2014, Australian dollar gold prices have increased by 11 percent to around A$1,485 per ounce.Higher output from mines operated by AngloGold Ashanti Ltd  and Newcrest Mining Ltd in 2013 more than offset declines from ones owned by Barrick Gold Corp  and Newmont Mining Corp, including the 50-50 Super Pit joint venture, once Australia's biggest mine. Newmont's wholly owned Boddington mine, some 700 km (400 miles) away, is currently Australia's biggest gold mine.Despite the increase in 2013, Australia remains a distant second to China, which produced around 430 tonnes in 2013, based on industry estimates.

23,"  * Rusal, Norilsk push Jakarta to stick to ore export ban* Russian giants aided by support for nickel prices* Ban alarms Japan and China, big buyers of nickel, bauxite* U.S. firms Newmont and Freeport hurt by new rules* Russia considers Indonesia smelter, rail investmentBy Randy Fabi and Fergus JensenJAKARTA, March 24 Russia's two metal giants have emerged as big winners from Indonesia's new mining law, after leading a drive to get Jakarta to stick to its controversial mineral ore export ban in the face of opposition from miners and Asian buyers.In its six-month lobbying campaign last year, United Company Rusal and Norilsk Nickel delivered a blunt message to Indonesian officials: We will only invest billions of dollars in smelters if you ban bauxite and nickel ore exports.The effort seemed to have paid off, despite a denial by Indonesia that it was influenced. When the law came into effect this year, Indonesia enforced a water-tight export ban for only two major minerals - nickel ore and bauxite.The halting of $3 billion of annual nickel ore and bauxite exports has already lifted the price of nickel and helped support aluminium, boosting the fortunes of Rusal and Norilsk, the world's top aluminium and nickel producers, respectively.At the same time, it has strengthened the case for the pair to invest billions of dollars in Indonesia to build smelters to replace costly capacity in Russia, a key part of a recovery plan for struggling Rusal and in line with Indonesia's own aims to earn more from its minerals resources.The mineral ore export ban is aimed at forcing miners to move up the value chain by processing the minerals they dig up.Rusal CEO Oleg Deripaska traveled repeatedly to Jakarta last year as signs emerged that the government might water down the ban under pressure from miners, and concerns over its impact on Southeast Asia's largest economy.""They made the export ban policy the main requirement for them to invest here,"" Industry Minister Mohamad Hidayat told Reuters. Just before the ban took effect on Jan. 12, Indonesia conceded to pressure from miners and made last-minute changes to the policy to allow shipments of most metals to go on, but it did not relax the policy for nickel ore and bauxite.The supply cuts have already been a game changer for nickel, with benchmark nickel prices soaring 17 percent to an 11-month high after the ban, while starving global markets of bauxite that should help curb China's huge aluminium expansion and support global prices.This has benefited Rusal and Norilsk, whose shares have risen more than 11 percent since the ban, though it has been at the expense of big buyers such as China and Japan. It has also come at a price for Indonesia which, despite gaining a pledge for a smelter, has suffered mine closures and layoffs.""Behind all of this is Rusal,"" said Tjandra Irawan, director of Indonesia's Mineral Entrepreneurs Association. ""What Rusal always wanted was a total ban ... only then would they invest.""Indonesia's industry minister denied overseas firms played a role in how the ban was implemented. Foreign influence on such a big economic policy is sensitive in Indonesia, particularly with elections looming in a few months.Russian firms were, however, involved like no other foreign companies in pushing their case - repeatedly sending executives to Jakarta, organising a conference to lobby officials, and teaming up with influential industry players to push their case.When asked about its lobbying strategy, Rusal said it was ""closely following the developments"" in the months leading up to the ban because of the uncertainty over how the government would implement the law. Norilsk declined to comment. SECOND THOUGHTS Before the ban, Indonesia was the world's top nickel ore exporter and the largest bauxite supplier to China, accounting for around 12 percent of the global market in both cases.In February, Maxim Sokov, first deputy CEO of En+, the parent of Rusal, said the ban was helping market prices of aluminium and nickel turn upwards. Sokov is also a board member of Norilsk.Around the middle of last year, Indonesia began wavering on the proposal due to fears a complete ore export ban would hurt the economy and lead to widespread unemployment.Government officials sought to reassure the mining sector that the law would be diluted. This worried Rusal, which has been struggling with weak aluminium prices and mounting debt and saw the export ban as key to its turnaround strategy, which included making Indonesia a regional hub for its alumina production.""Rusal and Norilsk were the only foreigners that seemed to be really concerned about how the ban would be implemented,"" said a government official close to the matter, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.China and Japan, both big buyers of Indonesian nickel ore, have been concerned by the ban. Beijing is organising a delegation of Chinese firms to visit Jakarta to discuss the new rules, while Japan is considering taking Indonesia to the World Trade Organisation over the ban.RUSSIAN INVESTMENT From June last year, Rusal's CEO went to Indonesia at least three times in six months to push the government over the issue.The Russian firms also teamed up with UBS and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to hold a seminar in Jakarta in October attended by top government officials.The firms were especially worried about a proposal from the mines ministry that could allow exports of unprocessed mineral ore to continue for companies planning to build smelters.The ministry dropped the proposal a month later after it was rejected by parliament, though sought industry input on how to implement the mining law without damaging the entire sector.The export ban has also hurt U.S. miners in Indonesia.Despite being allowed to continue exporting copper, Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc and Newmont Mining Corp have halted shipments and cut output due to a dispute over an escalating export tax under the new rules.While U.S., Japanese, and Chinese firms have long been big investors in resource-rich Indonesia, Russian firms are now pledging to significantly lift their investment.Rusal's Deripaska came with a big Russian business delegation to Jakarta in February to sign a memorandum of understanding to build an alumina smelter in West Kalimantan for an estimated $3 billion. Russian Railways is also planning to invest $2 billion in a line to East Kalimantan coal rail line.

However, the new rules have left the mining sector in turmoil.Newmont and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, who account for 97 percent of Indonesia's total copper output, have both halted copper concentrate exports while talks with the government over the export tax rumble on. ""The information is incorrect,"" Rubi Purnomo, head of corporate communications for Newmont in Indonesia said in an emailed response to Reuters. ""PTNNT (PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara) is producing normally at the moment but able to supply to PT Smelting in Gresik only.""Earlier, the government's mineral enterprise director Dede Suhendra told reporters that production at Newmont's Batu Hijau mine had been cut by 70 percent as the dispute over a new export tax dragged on for more than two months.The new rules hike to 25 percent a tax for copper concentrate exports, from 20 percent, and levy the tax on Freeport and Newmont for the first time. The tax will rise to 60 percent by the end of 2016, before exports of concentrate are banned from 2017. ""Newmont's production until today is only 30 percent,"" Suhendra told reporters earlier on Wednesday. He added that Newmont had not resumed exports since January, and was now only sending concentrates to Indonesia's sole copper smelter at Gresik in East Java.Before the new export rules, Freeport estimated that total copper in concentrate output from its Indonesian mine would be 500,000 tonnes this year, while Newmont forecast output at 110,000-125,000 tonnes.Freeport ships about 40 percent of its total copper concentrates production to PT Smelting, which has a concentrate capacity of about 660,000 tonnes, while Newmont supplies around 30 percent of its Indonesian output to the same smelter. ""As we meet with government officials in the coming days and weeks to find a solution as soon as possible in regard to export issues, PTNNT also has an operational contingency plan in place,"" Newmont's Purnomo added.Suhendra could not immediately be contacted on phone after Newmont's denial.Newmont said last month that it expects normal mining operations to continue at the mine in Indonesia for at least the next two months.Freeport has previously said that its Grasberg mine in Papua is now producing at half of its capacity, but had not cut any jobs so far.Freeport in 2012 paid the government around $1 billion in taxes and fees, while Newmont has paid more than $3 billion since 2000.

Both companies gained certification as registered exporters this week, bringing them closer to this goal.

37,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO Talks between Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO) and Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) about a potential merger have hit a snag, but sources close to the situation say the companies remain keen to reach a deal and discussions are likely to resume.The talks had been on for a few weeks, and the two sides had broadly agreed to a transaction under which Toronto-based Barrick would acquire Denver-based Newmont in an all-stock deal, said one source close to the matter.That source said the deal would offer Newmont shareholders a slight premium to its current share price. Newmont shares rose 6.4 percent to close at $25.05 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Barrick's shares edged down 78 cents Canadian to C$19.03.The sources, who asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said the talks have stalled over the issue of the spin-out of some assets from the combined entity, which is among the hurdles to a deal.After the close of a tentative deal, shareholders in the combined entity would also get shares in a new company that is likely to include assets in Australia and New Zealand. But the two companies have not yet agreed on a final mix of assets in the spun-out entity, said one source, adding that the new entity could include some assets from outside that region.The companies are also contemplating selling some non-core assets not included in the spun-out new entity, said one source. Barrick and Newmont declined to comment on the matter.Sources said the two companies had hoped to complete a deal this month ahead of the annual shareholder meetings of both companies, but that timetable was now looking unlikely.Newmont's annual general meeting is set for April 23, while Barrick's is being held on April 30. The latest round of merger talks between the two companies, initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, mark the third time that the two miners with large overlapping operations in Nevada have contemplated a merger within the last seven years.Sources familiar with the discussions said talks between the two sides had fallen apart in the past, largely due to personality issues.Analysts and some investors have long thought a deal, particularly involving their big operations in Nevada, was logical from a cost-cutting perspective. The sources said combining the mining giants' operations could lead to nearly $1 billion in annual cost savings with nearly half of those savings coming from reducing overlap in Nevada.""To the extent that a combination improved free cashflows and the ability to service combined debt, we suspect investors would welcome the deal,"" JPMorgan analyst John Bridges said in a note to clients. ""Especially, if the new company was able to use the opportunity to do serious surgery to non-contributing assets.""Under the most recent deal being considered, the combined company would be headquartered in Toronto. But the new combined entity would still retain a big operational presence in Denver, said one source.As earlier reported by Bloomberg News, the sources said Gary Goldberg, Newmont's chief executive, would become CEO of the new combined entity with Barrick's CEO Jamie Sokalsky bowing out. Sokalsky has worked for Barrick for over two decades. He served as its longtime chief financial officer before being named CEO in 2012.John Thornton, the ordained successor to Barrick's founder and outgoing chairman, Peter Munk, would become chairman of the new combined entity and head a board comprised of a mix of directors from both companies and possibly some outsiders.(Additional reporting by Allison Martell ; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson, Frank McGurty, Paul Simao and Richard Chang)",2014-04-21,NEM,"Mon Apr 21, 2014 | 6:10pm EDT",Barrick proposal to acquire Newmont hits roadblock: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-newmont-mining-offer-barrick-gold-idUSBREA3K04320140421?type=companyNews

39,"  * TSX closes down 6.71 points, or 0.05 percent, at 14,493.68     * TransCanada off 3.7 percent on Keystone XL pipeline delay     * Gold miners drop as Barrick-Newmont merger talks hit snag      By Solarina Ho     TORONTO, April 21 Canada's main stock index was little changed in thin Easter holiday trading on Monday with drops in Barrick Gold Corp and TransCanada Corp , which was hit by another delay for its Keystone XL pipeline project, offsetting gains in other groups.     Markets in Europe, Hong Kong and Australia were closed for Easter Monday.     TransCanada was the biggest drag on the index, closing down 3.7 percent at C$49.38 after the Obama administration again delayed a decision on whether to approve the Keystone project. Several analysts downgraded the stock.      The TSX index's energy group, of which TransCanada is a part, was off 0.05 percent.     The heavily weighted materials group, home to gold miners, was down 0.4 percent, hurt by Barrick, which fell 3.9 percent to C$19.03.     Merger talks between Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp  hit a snag, but sources close to the situation say the companies remain keen to reach a deal and discussions are likely to resume.      ""There was some expectation built into Barrick stock. To see that come under question has obviously impacted that stock today,"" said Craig Fehr, Canadian market strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri.      Overall, Fehr said the TSX index was not driven by any broad themes at the industry or market level, and that the market would be focused on quarterly earnings results in the coming days and weeks.     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  finished the session down 6.71 points, or 0.05 percent, at 14,493.68. Six of the index's 10 main sectors edged lower.        ""Keep in mind half the world's away on holiday, Easter Monday ... A lot of the players are not around,"" said Irwin Michael, portfolio manager at ABC Funds.     Osisko Mining Corp shares slid 3.4 percent to C$7.73 after Goldcorp Inc announced it was dropping its hostile bid to buy the smaller miner. Goldcorp rose 2 percent to C$26.53.      The move clears the way for Yamana Gold Inc and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd to take control of Osisko's flagship Canadian Malartic gold mine. Agnico was off 3.9 percent at C$30.05 and Yamana was down 2.5 percent at C$8.54.      Gold miners in general shadowed bullion prices, which slipped to a nearly three-week low on sharp outflows from the world's biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, a stronger U.S. dollar, and technical selling.      Among gainers, fertilizer producer Potash Corp  gained 1.5 percent to C$39.02, offsetting some of the losses in the materials group.     Valeant Pharmaceuticals International was up 3.2 percent at C$138.76, helping to lift the healthcare group 0.9 percent.     Canadian National Railway, Canada's biggest rail company, was also a heavyweight gainer, adding 0.9 percent to finish at C$62.98 ahead of its first-quarter results, due on Tuesday. The overall industrials group was up 0.4 percent.

40,"   By Euan Rocha, Allison Martell and Nicole Mordant | TORONTO/VANCOUVER  TORONTO/VANCOUVER Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.N) has tried and failed to buy Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) twice in the past decade, but the rationale is now more compelling than ever for a merger between two of the world's largest gold miners.The two companies have been weakened by massive asset write-downs and the derailment of two vital growth projects in Latin America in the last two years, as the price of gold has slid 33 percent since peaking in 2011. These issues have led to credit rating downgrades and forced both miners to sell some assets.But the slide in gold also means that the value of goodwill attached to Newmont's portfolio has tumbled, lowering the cost of a deal and reducing the risk of more major write-downs at Barrick should gold prices fall further.Investors, long skeptical of big, unwieldy mining entities, seem more open now to the view that a combined Barrick-Newmont can generate more cash and better service its debt than the companies can on their own.""We suspect investors would welcome the deal, especially, if the new company was able to use the opportunity to do serious surgery to non-contributing assets,"" said JPMorgan analyst John Bridges in a note to clients.Barrick and Newmont had reached the broad outlines of a deal that they had hoped to complete this month before talks hit a snag and broke down, according to sources familiar with the matter. Even so, the companies remain keen on reaching an agreement and merger discussions are likely to resume, the sources said.IDEAL TIMING It has long made sense for Barrick, the world's largest gold miner, to try to buy Newmont given the potential for cost savings from overlapping operations. Sources familiar with the proposed deal say it could bring nearly $1 billion in annual cost savings, with roughly half of that coming from reducing overlap in their vast Nevada operations. Some argue a combined entity would also have tax advantages as Barrick enjoys a more favorable tax treatment on foreign earnings under Canadian law than Newmont gets under U.S. law.The two companies first looked at the possibility of a tie-up in the 1990s, sources say. They came close in 2008 and 2010, but ultimately disagreed about issues such as who would serve as chairman of the combined entity.Sources familiar with the discussions say merger talks fell apart in the past largely due to personality conflicts. With Barrick's co-founder, Peter Munk, about to bow out as chairman, and new leadership in place at Newmont, the time may now finally be right for the two miners to put aside their differences.Munk, Barrick's incoming Chairman John Thornton and Newmont's current Chief Executive Gary Goldberg - a former Rio Tinto hand - all share a common vision of diversifying their companies and building up their copper assets. A deal could pave the way for Jamie Sokalsky, Barrick's current chief executive, to bow out of the company gracefully. Sokalsky has worked with Barrick for more than two decades, serving as its chief financial officer before being named CEO just as the company's problems began to spiral two years ago.Sokalsky has moved quickly to cut costs, mothball over-budget projects and bolster the miner's balance sheet via asset sales and a huge $3 billion equity issue.

It would have to sell or spin off some high-cost assets and lower Newmont's cost base. It is by no means a done deal that shareholders of both companies will agree to a merger. Long-term investors have been burned during the last two years as major write-downs, cost overruns and other issues have sent their shares tumbling.Barrick, with a market capitalization of $21 billion, is in no position to do a cash deal for Newmont, whose market value is just shy of $12 billion.

42,"   By Nicole Mordant  A takeover battle for Canada's Osisko Mining Corp (OSK.TO), involving three of the world's top gold producers, is more than just a testament to the quality of the company's low-cost mine, it also spotlights a shortage of top-class gold assets in politically stable areas of the world.The struggle between Goldcorp Inc (G.TO) and deal partners Yamana Gold Inc (YRI.TO) and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd (AEM.TO) underlines the appeal of buying a mine, in this case Osisko's Canadian Malartic gold mine in Quebec, rather than building one.A report on Friday that there have been recent merger talks between the world's two top gold producers, Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO) and Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) further illustrates a buy rather than build mentality that has overtaken the industry - cost cutting would likely be a key part of any such deal. The talks have broken down, according to the report from the Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed sources.There have been numerous development cost overruns on major mining projects around the world in recent years and the time it takes to get permission to develop sites has been getting longer amid tighter regulation and opposition to mining from environmentalists and local communities.For example, it usually takes between seven and ten years to get permits for a mine in the United States, according to a 2013 survey by mineral industry advisory firm Behre Dolbear Group Inc. In 2009, it took between five and seven years.Strengthening the buy-versus-build case is price: the market prices for gold companies have plunged by an average 60 percent since September 2011 as the gold price tumbled from a record high of $1,920 an ounce to below $1,300 now, a drop of about a third.Toronto-based miners Yamana and Agnico are now offering $3.6 billion for Osisko, 50 percent higher than Vancouver-based Goldcorp's first offer in January and 11 percent above its last, sweetened offer.The bidding war may be the clearest sign yet that the slump in asset values is coming to an end.Industry insiders don't expect a flurry of such deals due to the scarcity of attractive assets and as miners try to rein in costs after a spate of expensive acquisitions made in 2010 and 2011 as bullion soared to its peak.""The truth is, there just aren't that many good mines around,"" said Adrian Day, chief executive of Maryland-based Adrian Day Asset Management.He said that the more aggressive major companies ""are going to take a look at good assets ... however you define good - low cost, long life, good jurisdiction.""Canadian Malartic, which produced its first ounce of gold in April 2011, checks these boxes. Along with a 14-year mine life, Osisko forecasts the mine's cash costs, a measure of mine site expenses such as ore extraction and processing, will fall to between $527 and $577 an ounce this year from $679 in the fourth quarter of 2013. That is well below the global industry average of $767 an ounce in 2013, according to metals consultancy Thomson ReutersGFMS. Located in Quebec's prolific Abitibi mining district, the Canadian Malartic open-pit mine contains nearly 9.4 million ounces of gold reserves and is expected to produce some 600,000 ounces of gold a year over its life. It is Osisko's only operating mine, another attractive feature for would-be purchasers.""When looking at a transaction you have to consider its level of complexity and what other baggage comes with it,"" said Shea Small, a partner at law firm McCarthy Tetrault's Toronto office.INDUSTRY EVOLUTION Rising gold prices unleashed a decade of mine building from 2000 as the value of in-the-ground resources climbed. But with bullion's slump over the past 2-1/2 years, mine projects have been halted as spiraling development costs made them uneconomic. A high-profile example is Barrick's (ABX.TO) Pascua-Lama project on the Chile-Argentina border, which the company shelved last October after development costs soared to $8.5 billion from about $5 billion two years earlier.In this lower gold price environment, miners' appetite for risk has shrunk.""Development assets are more attractive than exploration assets and production assets are more attractive than development assets,"" said Mike Elliott, global and Asia-Pacific mining and metals leader at consultants EY, based in Sydney.As well as the regular costs in time and money of getting the permits needed for development, corruption in some parts of the world is also making projects unattractively expensive.Many mining companies have to be wary of global anti-bribery laws in countries such as the United States, and in coming years, in Canada. They can be in breach of these laws if they bribe foreign officials anywhere in the world.Miners are moving away from higher political risk countries in Africa, Central Asia and even South America and moving back to established mining markets such as Canada. The experience of miners such as Canada's Centerra Gold Inc (CG.TO) in Kyrgyzstan, where riots have broken out in support of calls by opposition politicians to nationalize the company's Kumtor mine, have been instructive to others.Several analysts have said Yamana's pursuit of Canadian Malartic will help the company, whose mines are in South America and Mexico, reduce its geopolitical risks.""I think the industry is clearly in a phase of evolution,"" said Sean Boyd, Agnico-Eagle's Chief Executive Officer.""Companies are trying to restructure their portfolios and move out of assets that are difficult to run and complex and go toward assets in a smaller portfolio that are easier to manage and that can generate those solid returns,"" he said.REPEATING THE PAST? Over the past two years, the gold industry under pressure from disgruntled shareholders, has put itself on a strict diet, slashing operating and exploration costs. Acquisitions have also dried up.The Yamana and Agnico-Eagle offer for Osisko is the gold sector's biggest in more than a year.Shareholder disapproval of aggressive dealmaking, and the lack of candidates, will likely limit the number of further big deals.The name most frequently mentioned as another appealing target is Detour Gold Corp (DGC.TO), which like Osisko has a single, producing mine in Canada. But the Detour Lake mine, which poured its first gold a year ago, is a higher-cost operation: it forecasts total cash costs at between $800 and $900 an ounce this year.Where the bidding stops for Osisko will reveal whether miners have learnt lessons from the sector's recent penchant for overpaying for assets.""We think the war is entering a dangerous phase, as buyers are threatening to erode potential returns with higher and higher bids,"" said Kristoffer Inton, an analyst at Morningstar in a note to clients about the takeover battle.(Reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Additional reporting by Allison Martell and Euan Rocha in Toronto; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson, Martin Howell)",2014-04-21,NEM,"Mon Apr 21, 2014 | 11:34am EDT",Canadian gold mining's bidding war shows appeal of buy over build,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-gold-industry-idUSBREA3K0O720140421?type=companyNews

44,"  (Repeating to additional subscribers)By Nicole MordantApril 21 A takeover battle for Canada's Osisko Mining Corp, involving three of the world's top gold producers, is more than just a testament to the quality of the company's low-cost mine, it also spotlights a shortage of top-class gold assets in politically stable areas of the world.The struggle between Goldcorp Inc and deal partners Yamana Gold Inc and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd  underlines the appeal of buying a mine, in this case Osisko's Canadian Malartic gold mine in Quebec, rather than building one.A report on Friday that there have been recent merger talks between the world's two top gold producers, Barrick Gold Corp  and Newmont Mining Corp further illustrates a buy rather than build mentality that has overtaken the industry - cost cutting would likely be a key part of any such deal. The talks have broken down, according to the report from the Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed sources.There have been numerous development cost overruns on major mining projects around the world in recent years and the time it takes to get permission to develop sites has been getting longer amid tighter regulation and opposition to mining from environmentalists and local communities.For example, it usually takes between seven and ten years to get permits for a mine in the United States, according to a 2013 survey by mineral industry advisory firm Behre Dolbear Group Inc. In 2009, it took between five and seven years.Strengthening the buy-versus-build case is price: the market prices for gold companies have plunged by an average 60 percent since September 2011 as the gold price tumbled from a record high of $1,920 an ounce to below $1,300 now, a drop of about a third.Toronto-based miners Yamana and Agnico are now offering $3.6 billion for Osisko, 50 percent higher than Vancouver-based Goldcorp's first offer in January and 11 percent above its last, sweetened offer. [ID: nL2N0N80QB]The bidding war may be the clearest sign yet that the slump in asset values is coming to an end.Industry insiders don't expect a flurry of such deals due to the scarcity of attractive assets and as miners try to rein in costs after a spate of expensive acquisitions made in 2010 and 2011 as bullion soared to its peak.""The truth is, there just aren't that many good mines around,"" said Adrian Day, chief executive of Maryland-based Adrian Day Asset Management.He said that the more aggressive major companies ""are going to take a look at good assets ... however you define good - low cost, long life, good jurisdiction."" Canadian Malartic, which produced its first ounce of gold in April 2011, checks these boxes. Along with a 14-year mine life, Osisko forecasts the mine's cash costs, a measure of mine site expenses such as ore extraction and processing, will fall to between $527 and $577 an ounce this year from $679 in the fourth quarter of 2013.That is well below the global industry average of $767 an ounce in 2013, according to metals consultancy Thomson Reuters GFMS.Located in Quebec's prolific Abitibi mining district, the Canadian Malartic open-pit mine contains nearly 9.4 million ounces of gold reserves and is expected to produce some 600,000 ounces of gold a year over its life. It is Osisko's only operating mine, another attractive feature for would-be purchasers.""When looking at a transaction you have to consider its level of complexity and what other baggage comes with it,"" said Shea Small, a partner at law firm McCarthy Tetrault's Toronto office.INDUSTRY EVOLUTION Rising gold prices unleashed a decade of mine building from 2000 as the value of in-the-ground resources climbed. But with bullion's slump over the past 2-1/2 years, mine projects have been halted as spiraling development costs made them uneconomic. A high-profile example is Barrick's Pascua-Lama project on the Chile-Argentina border, which the company shelved last October after development costs soared to $8.5 billion from about $5 billion two years earlier.In this lower gold price environment, miners' appetite for risk has shrunk.""Development assets are more attractive than exploration assets and production assets are more attractive than development assets,"" said Mike Elliott, global and Asia-Pacific mining and metals leader at consultants EY, based in Sydney.As well as the regular costs in time and money of getting the permits needed for development, corruption in some parts of the world is also making projects unattractively expensive.Many mining companies have to be wary of global anti-bribery laws in countries such as the United States, and in coming years, in Canada. They can be in breach of these laws if they bribe foreign officials anywhere in the world.Miners are moving away from higher political risk countries in Africa, Central Asia and even South America and moving back to established mining markets such as Canada. The experience of miners such as Canada's Centerra Gold Inc  in Kyrgyzstan, where riots have broken out in support of calls by opposition politicians to nationalize the company's Kumtor mine, have been instructive to others.Several analysts have said Yamana's pursuit of Canadian Malartic will help the company, whose mines are in South America and Mexico, reduce its geopolitical risks.""I think the industry is clearly in a phase of evolution,"" said Sean Boyd, Agnico-Eagle's Chief Executive Officer.""Companies are trying to restructure their portfolios and move out of assets that are difficult to run and complex and go toward assets in a smaller portfolio that are easier to manage and that can generate those solid returns,"" he said.REPEATING THE PAST?

45,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Nicole MordantApril 21 A takeover battle for Canada's Osisko Mining Corp, involving three of the world's top gold producers, is more than just a testament to the quality of the company's low-cost mine, it also spotlights a shortage of top-class gold assets in politically stable areas of the world.The struggle between Goldcorp Inc and deal partners Yamana Gold Inc and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd  underlines the appeal of buying a mine, in this case Osisko's Canadian Malartic gold mine in Quebec, rather than building one.A report on Friday that there have been recent merger talks between the world's two top gold producers, Barrick Gold Corp  and Newmont Mining Corp further illustrates a buy rather than build mentality that has overtaken the industry - cost cutting would likely be a key part of any such deal. The talks have broken down, according to the report from the Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed sources.There have been numerous development cost overruns on major mining projects around the world in recent years and the time it takes to get permission to develop sites has been getting longer amid tighter regulation and opposition to mining from environmentalists and local communities.For example, it usually takes between seven and ten years to get permits for a mine in the United States, according to a 2013 survey by mineral industry advisory firm Behre Dolbear Group Inc. In 2009, it took between five and seven years.Strengthening the buy-versus-build case is price: the market prices for gold companies have plunged by an average 60 percent since September 2011 as the gold price tumbled from a record high of $1,920 an ounce to below $1,300 now, a drop of about a third.Toronto-based miners Yamana and Agnico are now offering $3.6 billion for Osisko, 50 percent higher than Vancouver-based Goldcorp's first offer in January and 11 percent above its last, sweetened offer. [ID: nL2N0N80QB]The bidding war may be the clearest sign yet that the slump in asset values is coming to an end.Industry insiders don't expect a flurry of such deals due to the scarcity of attractive assets and as miners try to rein in costs after a spate of expensive acquisitions made in 2010 and 2011 as bullion soared to its peak.""The truth is, there just aren't that many good mines around,"" said Adrian Day, chief executive of Maryland-based Adrian Day Asset Management.He said that the more aggressive major companies ""are going to take a look at good assets ... however you define good - low cost, long life, good jurisdiction."" Canadian Malartic, which produced its first ounce of gold in April 2011, checks these boxes. Along with a 14-year mine life, Osisko forecasts the mine's cash costs, a measure of mine site expenses such as ore extraction and processing, will fall to between $527 and $577 an ounce this year from $679 in the fourth quarter of 2013.That is well below the global industry average of $767 an ounce in 2013, according to metals consultancy Thomson Reuters GFMS.Located in Quebec's prolific Abitibi mining district, the Canadian Malartic open-pit mine contains nearly 9.4 million ounces of gold reserves and is expected to produce some 600,000 ounces of gold a year over its life.

46,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO, April 21  TORONTO, April 21 The talks between Barrick Gold Corp and Newmont Mining Corp over a combination that would create a gold mining behemoth have hit a snag, but two sources close to the situation say the companies remain keen on a deal and discussions are likely to resume.The talks had been on for a few weeks and the two sides had broadly agreed to a transaction that would see Barrick acquire Denver-based Newmont in an all-stock deal, said one source close to the matter, adding that the deal would offer Newmont shareholders a slight premium to its current share price.The sources, who asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said the talks have hit a snag around the spin-out of certain assets from the combined entity, among other issues.Following the close of the tentative deal, shareholders in the combined entity would also get shares in a new company that is likely to include assets in Australia and in New Zealand. But the final mix of assets in the spun out entity has not yet been agreed upon said one source, adding that new entity could include some assets from outside that region.The companies are also contemplating selling certain non-core assets that are not included in the spun out new entity, said one source. Barrick and Newmont declined to comment on the matter.Sources said the two companies had been hoping to get a deal done this month ahead of the annual shareholder meetings at both companies, but that is now looking unlikely. Newmont's AGM is set for April 23, while Barrick's is being held on April 30. The latest round of merger talks between the two companies, initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, mark the third time that the two miners with large overlapping operations in Nevada, have contemplated a merger within the last seven years.Sources familiar with the discussions said talks between the two sides had fallen apart in the past, largely due to personality issues.Analysts and some investors have long mulled that a deal between the two miners, particularly around their big operations in Nevada, was logical from a cost-cutting perspective. The sources said a combination of the mining giants could lead to nearly $1 billion in annual cost savings with nearly half of those savings coming from reducing overlap in Nevada.Under the most recent deal being considered, the combined company would be headquartered in Toronto - Barrick's home base, but the new combined entity would still retain a big operational presence in Newmont's home town of Denver, said one source.As earlier reported by Bloomberg News, the sources said Gary Goldberg, Newmont's chief executive, would become CEO of the new combined entity with Barrick's CEO Jamie Sokalsky bowing out. Sokalsky has been with Barrick for over two decades and he served as its longtime CFO, before being named CEO in 2012.John Thornton, the ordained successor to Barrick's outgoing chairman Peter Munk, would become chairman of the new combined entity and head a board that would be comprised of a mix of directors from both companies and possibly some new faces.

48,"  * Newcrest could face top-tier local rival if Barrick, Newmont unite* Speculation merged company will spin off Asia-Pacific assets* Newcrest March qtr gold output drops 11 pct vs previous qtrBy James ReganSYDNEY, April 23 Australia could spawn a new mega gold producer if Barrick Gold Corp and Newmont Mining Corp spin off their Asia-Pacific assets, heating up competition with the country's underperforming market leader Newcrest Mining Ltd.Barrick and Newmont have been holding friendly merger talks, but remain at odds over how to group mines each company owns in Australia, New Zealand and possibly Papua New Guinea and Indonesia into a separate company, sources close to the talks have said.If the two companies' Asia-Pacific mines were grouped together, annual output could exceed 2.3 million ounces, challenging Newcrest as Australia's biggest gold producer and the world's fifth largest.The new entity could also potentially gain a higher rating among investors than it would receive within a combined Barrick-Newmont.""There's huge investor appetite for an alternative to Newcrest,"" said Eagle Mining Research gold analyst Keith Goode. ""The next stages of growth for Newcrest are seen as either risky, as in the case for their assets in Ivory Coast, or too long term. What the Barrick-Newmont assets in Asia-Pacific offer is immediate production and cash flow, with growth through exploration potential.""Anglogold Ashanti has also considered spinning off its Tropicana and Sunrise Dam mines in Australia into a separate entity to benefit from investor interest in an alternative to Newcrest, but has yet to act.Newcrest has held the No. 1 spot on the Australian Stock Exchange since 2010, with total production this year seen at about 2.3 million ounces. Number two is Evolution Mining , a distant second at less than a half-million ounces.However, the miner's stock has lost three-quarters of its value over the past three years as it has struggled with high costs, disappointing output at its Lihir mine in Papua New Guinea and a 28 percent fall in the gold price in 2013. A sharp drop in half-year profit and a jump in debt also fuelled concerns it may need to tap the market for capital, while it reported an 11 percent fall in March quarter gold output from the previous quarter on Wednesday, well above the 7 percent drop forecast by UBS.Newcrest also said it had cut 208 jobs over the last quarter at its Lihir mine.ARRAY OF MINES  Australia was the world's second-biggest gold producer behind China in 2013, with output of 10.5 million ounces, according to ThomsonReuters data, but many of its biggest mines are in the hands of foreign-owned miners.Newmont owns Australia's biggest gold mine, Boddington, and is a 50-50 partner with Barrick in the 800,000-ounces-per-year Super Pit lode 700 km (440 miles) away. Other assets include the Jundee and Tanami gold mines in Australia and Waihi in New Zealand. Newmont's other main asset in the Asia-Pacific region is the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine in Indonesia.Besides its half-stake in the Super Pit, Barrick could roll its Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea into the fold, bringing with it close to 500,000 ounces.""If you have an Asia-Pacific-listed demerged asset, you would get strong Asia-Pacific interest and be more competitive for those investment dollars than otherwise in North America,"" said Morgans mining analyst James Wilson.Still, there's no guarantee a sizeable number of investors would drop Newcrest for a new Barrick-Newmont combination.""If it was to be listed here (Australia) and it was materially cheaper than Newcrest, then maybe you'd consider it, but I would say from what I've seen,  Newcrest has the better asset mix than the proposed spin co,"" said Darko Kuzmanovic, a portfolio manager at Caledonia Investments. Caledonia does not own Barrick or Newmont shares.Barrick gained 1.8 percent to C$19.37 ($17.55)in heavy trade on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to a ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and investors placed bets on whether it can pull off a bid for Newmont.($1 = 1.0703 Australian Dollars)   (Additional reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourne; Editing by Richard Pullin)",2014-04-23,NEM,"Wed Apr 23, 2014 | 4:12am EDT",Barrick-Newmont tie-up could create new top flight Australia gold producer,http://www.reuters.com//article/newmont-mining-offer-newcrest-idUSL3N0NE1M320140423?type=companyNews
49,"  (Adds CEO comment, details on African, Indonesian operations)April 24 Newmont Mining Corp, which sources have said is in talks with Barrick Gold Corp on a merger, reported a steep drop in first-quarter earnings on Thursday as a result of lower gold and copper prices.Newmont, the world's second-biggest gold producer after Barrick, managed to lower its gold production costs and slightly lift its gold output in the quarter, including a 40 percent increase in production at its Tanami mine in Australia.""We are confident we can maintain this trajectory as the year progresses, as evidenced by our updated outlook for lower costs and higher production for Africa,"" Gary Goldberg, Newmont's president and chief executive said in a statement.Newmont raised its production forecast for its African operations to between 790,000 and 870,000 ounces from 785,000 to 850,000 ounces as a result of ""mine plan optimization"" at its Ahafo operation in Ghana. It also lowered it cost outlook for its African operations. The company, which also has mines in North and South America, and Asia, produced 1.21 million ounces of gold in the first quarter, up slightly from 1.17 million ounces in the same period in 2013. It produced 24,000 tonnes of copper against 20,000 tonnes a year ago.All-in sustaining costs for gold were $1,034 an ounce in the quarter, down from $1,121 per ounce in the same quarter a year ago. Realized gold prices fell to $1,293 an ounce in the quarter from $1,631 per ounce in the first quarter of 2013.Newmont maintained its production forecast for the year of between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces of gold. It also expects to produce between 160,000 and 175,000 tonnes of copper in 2014. The company warned that continued delays in getting approvals for exports in Indonesia will force it to scale back production there and could mean it will not achieve its forecast output for 2014.Exports from Newmont's Batu Hijua copper-gold mine in Indonesia have been halted since January when the Asian country slapped a new tax on exports in an attempt to force miners to process their raw minerals domestically. Newmont said net income from continuing operations fell to $117 million, or 23 cents per basic share, in the quarter, from $314 million, or 63 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.On an adjusted basis, Newmont reported a profit of 22 cents per share. Analysts expected Newmont to reported adjusted earnings of 19 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Denver, Colorado-based Newmont and Toronto-based Barrick recently broadly agreed to a transaction under which Barrick would acquire Newmont in an all-stock deal.Talks between the two sides, however, hit a snag and broke down last week, sources close to the situation have said. Some talks between representatives of both companies have taken place since but high-level talks between executives from both sides have yet to resume.

53,"   By Euan Rocha, Nicole Mordant and Soyoung Kim  The disagreements around the spin-out of certain assets that had snagged merger talks between Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO) and its rival, Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N), have been resolved but talks are at a standstill for now, said three sources familiar with the matter on Wednesday.There have been some talks between representatives of both companies since discussions broke down last Thursday, but high-level talks between executives from both sides have yet to resume, said the sources, who asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of the discussions.The merger talks between the two gold mining giants around a deal hit a snag last week, but sources had told Reuters at the time that the two sides remained keen to reach a deal and that talks were likely to resume.Barrick and Newmont declined to comment on the talks. Two sources said on Wednesday that some of the disagreement now lies around the power-sharing structure at the board level within a new combined entity.One of those sources said the two companies have agreed to a 14-member board for the new entity, with seven nominees from the Barrick's board, five from Newmont's side and two new nominees.However, certain specifics around the new board members and disagreements around who gains control of the key corporate governance committee are a potential sticking point at this stage, said the two sources. The corporate governance committee on a board plays a vital role as it reviews the size of the board, its other committees and it also nominates new members to join a board. Hence the committee can in time reshape the face of a company's board.The two sources said Barrick is still keen to get a deal done before its annual general meeting (AGM) on April 30, but one added that may well depend entirely on how soon Newmont opts to re-engage in discussions. Newmont held its own AGM earlier on Wednesday in Delaware. The latest round of merger talks marks the third time the two miners with large overlapping operations in Nevada have contemplated a merger within the last seven years. Sources familiar with the discussions said talks between the two sides had fallen apart in the past, largely due to personality issues.Analysts and others have long thought a tie-up, particularly given the vast overlap in their combined operations in Nevada, was logical from a cost-cutting perspective.Sources familiar with the matter have previously said that combining the mining giants' operations could lead to nearly $1 billion in annual cost savings with nearly half of those savings coming from reducing overlap in Nevada.(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies in London and Mike Stone in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and Sandra Maler)",2014-04-24,NEM,"Wed Apr 23, 2014 | 9:27pm EDT",Barrick-Newmont make merger headway but divide remains: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-newmont-offer-barrick-idUSBREA3N04I20140424?type=companyNews

Before the new export rules, Newmont forecast copper concentrate output for 2014 at 110,000-125,000 tonnes.Newmont, which is the world's third largest gold producer by market value, usually supplies around 30 percent of its Indonesian output to the country's only copper smelter, PT Smelting at Gresik.While talks with the government continue, Newmont said it will continue to ship and sell copper concentrate to PT Smelting throughout 2014. However, it is currently unable to export the rest of the concentrate, which the government says is liable to a 25 percent export tax, rising to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban takes effect in 2017.The government has demanded Newmont and Freeport commit to building or supplying smelter projects in Indonesia before they can resume concentrate shipments, and has hinted this may give them leeway with the export tax.Newmont said it had obtained registered exporter status from Indonesia's ministry of trade in April, which was ""a necessary milestone prior to receiving the export permit"". But once storage capacity is full, the miner will scale back contracted services and capital expenditure, reduce overtime and place most employees on leave at reduced pay from early June.""We have taken numerous steps to support the government's desire to increase in-country smelting,"" PTNNT President Director Martiono Hadianto said in the statement.""This is a very unfortunate and difficult situation for all of us, as it will disrupt the lives of our 8,000 employees and contractors and impact thousands of more people in the Sumbawa Barat area who derive their incomes from our operation.""The copper market currently has ample global concentrate supplies and given that exports from both Newmont and Freeport have already been largely halted this year, the impact on copper and gold prices of any stoppage in production by Newmont would be muted, said a mining source.London copper prices recovered to near two-month highs around $6,800 late last month but have struggled to build on the momentum.

65,"  (Adds quotes, recasts)JAKARTA, June 3 Newmont Mining Corp said it has halted copper concentrate production at its Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia as a deadlock continues over controversial mining rules that have halted concentrate exports since mid-January.Newmont, which said its storage facilities at the mine were full after the near five-month export halt, said it had delayed standing down its 8,000 employees and contractors ahead of a government meeting this week.The prospect of widespread job layoffs could add to pressure on the Indonesian government to find a solution to the stand-off, after weaker exports contributed to slower first-quarter economic growth and a swelling trade deficit in April.Newmont and fellow U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper output. The two firms are still shipping out some refined copper, but have halted exports of copper concentrate after objecting to the imposition of a new escalating tax.Both firms are expected to hold talks with senior government officials this week in the hope of breaking the hiatus to copper shipments. Newly appointed chief economics minister, billionaire businessman Chairul Tanjung, has said he will review the mining export rules and hopes exports can resume.""Newmont Nusa Tenggara (PTNNT) today said that its concentrate storage facilities at Batu Hijau are now full, forcing the operation to halt processing activities and cease production of copper concentrate,"" Newmont said in a statement.It was ""waiting for results of a ministerial meeting this week that is intended to clarify the conditions under which copper concentrate exports will be permitted"" before sending home employees and contractors. A mining union official told Reuters production had stopped ""since two days ago"" and the company had not declared force majeure.Freeport said earlier this year it had cut production at its Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia, the world's fifth-largest copper mine, by around 60 percent and that a force majeure could be announced if the dispute dragged on. While Freeport's CEO is expected to come to Jakarta this week to discuss the deadlock, Newmont's chief executive had no plans to come to Jakarta at present, PTNNT spokesman Rubi Purnomo said.No further details were available from Freeport or Newmont about their planned meetings.Government officials were working to issue a new regulation to resolve the dispute but needed presidential approval, Finance Ministry fiscal policy chief Andin Hadianto told Reuters.The government has targeted copper concentrate exports of 800,000 tonnes this year, provided the deadlock is resolved this week, a mining ministry official said last week. Of this amount, Newmont is expected to contribute 250,000 tonnes.Before the new export rules, Newmont forecast copper concentrate output for 2014 at 110,000-125,000 tonnes.

68,"  * No deal expected this week -deputy finance minister* Tax rate to be linked to progress on smelters   (Adds Newmont's response)By Wilda Asmarini and Adriana Nina KusumaJAKARTA, June 4 Foreign copper miners in Indonesia have agreed in principle to pay a controversial export tax, the country's deputy finance minister said, following a series of talks aimed at restarting concentrate exports after a near-five-month halt.The move would signal progress in reaching a deal over the tax, which was introduced on Jan. 12, along with a ban on mineral ore shipments, as part of moves to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Southeast Asia's largest economy.The new export tax halted about $500 million worth of monthly mineral ore and concentrate exports and led Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc and Newmont Mining , which account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper output, to slash production, arguing it conflicts with their contracts.""What has been agreed on is the principle of the export tax,"" Deputy Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro told reporters following government talks involving Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson. ""They agreed to an export tax."" Brodjonegoro said he did not expect the government and miners to reach a deal on the tax this week.Freeport and Newmont have previously argued that they should be exempt from the tax, which kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017. They said their current contracts prohibit any extra taxes.Under the new proposal, officials would draft a tax regulation that would set a lower rate for miners that were progressing with plans to build smelters. Freeport's chief financial officer, Kathleen Quirk, said at an investor conference in Chicago on Wednesday that the company expects to resume exports very soon. The company's production forecasts for the year had assumed exports would resume in May.""The deal is not done yet, we're not in a position today to announce it, but I can report that we are making progress,"" Quirk said. Freeport expects the export tax would be ""significantly reduced,"" she said.Newmont is waiting to see the terms and conditions of the updated regulations before deciding if it is ""feasible and appropriate"" to pay an export duty on top of the taxes it pays already, company spokesman Omar Jabara said in an emailed response. Both U.S. miners have questioned the economic viability of building new copper smelters in Indonesia, but have agreed to study the possibility of building a copper smelter with state-owned miner Aneka Tambang.Separately, Indonesia's industry minister, M.S. Hidayat, said the export tax would be reduced. He was unable to give details but said the government and mining companies were close to an agreement.The push to settle the dispute follows the appointment of billionaire businessman Chairul Tanjung as chief economics minister last month. Tanjung made restarting copper exports a top priority, amid a widening trade deficit, a slowdown in first-quarter economic growth and the prospect of job layoffs at mines.Newmont said on Tuesday it had halted copper concentrate production at its Batu Hijau mine as its storage facilities were full, but had delayed standing down its 8,000 employees and contractors ahead of this week's meetings.Tanjung led a series of high-level government and industry meetings on Wednesday, aimed at brokering a deal on the tax, and resolving contract renegotiations for major miners.

Omar Jabara said the subsidiary made a formal request to participate, and did not receive any response.Newmont and fellow miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc - which account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper output - are in dispute with the government over an export tax imposed in January that has halted copper concentrate exports.""Newmont is not coming. Are (they) not serious in wanting to collaborate with the Indonesian government?"" Tanjung told Reuters on the sidelines of a presidential visit to Batam island. ""There needs to be willingness from both sides.""Later on Thursday, Newmont announced it would place 80 percent of the employees at its Batu Hijau mine on leave with reduced pay with immediate effect and declared force majeure. It halted copper concentrate production earlier this week after running out of space to store the material.Spokesman Jabara said Newmont ""wants nothing more than to quickly resolve this issue in a way that will allow Batu Hijau to resume normal operations in an economically sustainable manner.""""Our hope is that the government will resolve this quickly, and we can recall our employees and contractors back to work,"" he said in an emailed statement. Tanjung said he hoped as soon as possible to resolve the dispute, which has contributed to slower economic growth, but did not give a time frame for when it might be settled.At Wednesday's meeting, the government said copper miners agreed in principle to pay the export tax with the understanding that the rate would be reduced as miners progress with plans to build smelters, in line with Indonesia's push to boost onshore mineral processing.Speaking at a conference in Chicago on Wednesday, Freeport's chief financial officer confirmed that a reduced export tax was being discussed, and said exports could resume very soon.Newmont said in statement on Wednesday it was waiting to see the terms and conditions of the updated regulations before deciding if it was ""feasible and appropriate"" to pay an export duty on top of the taxes it pays already. Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson and the head of Vale Indonesia attended Wednesday's meetings, but Newmont executives did not. Tanjung said Freeport had showed its commitment to Indonesia by sending its CEO from the United States for the meetings.Asked if Newmont was playing games on the possible stand-down of workers, Tanjung said: ""I think so.""He added: ""They try to push the government too hard. I'm a businessman, I know about the games companies play."" Newmont workers are due to hold a protest in Jakarta on Friday. Freeport and Newmont have previously argued that they should be exempt from the export tax, which kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017. They said their current contracts prohibit any extra taxes.The tax was introduced on Jan. 12, along with a ban on mineral ore shipments, to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Southeast Asia's largest economy.""Freeport has already agreed to build a smelter ... and put a deposit as a guarantee to the government on how serious they are,"" said Tanjung, who said he has no ambitions to stay in government after the next administration takes office in October.""We want them to continue exporting as soon as possible to make our (trade) deficit to turn into a surplus.""

""We are left with no option but to declare force majeure.""A declaration of force majeure, which literally means ""higher power"", allows certain terms of an otherwise legally binding contractual agreement to be ignored.Newmont's move came after the Indonesian government launched a drive this week to force a breakthrough in the dispute, which has contributed to slower economic growth. Both Freeport and Newmont have previously argued that they should be exempt from the tax, which kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017. They said their current contracts prohibit any extra taxes.""The new export conditions, duty and January 2017 ban, fundamentally impact Batu Hijau's economics and conflict with our Contract of Work,"" Hadianto added.Before the new export rules, Colorado-based Newmont forecast copper concentrate output for 2014 at 110,000-125,000 tonnes at its Indonesian mine, but halted production earlier this week after it was unable to break the deadlock over the new export rules. The Indonesian mine will be placed under care and maintenance, although Newmont said it will continue shipping concentrate from storage to Indonesia's only copper smelter, PT Smelting at Gresik, through 2014, said the statement.This would allow for copper concentrate shipments of 81,000 tonnes between now and the end of the year, the statement added.Dede Suhendra, Mineral Enterprise Director at the mining ministry, told reporters the government would try to help Newmont overcome any obstacles relating to exports in response to the force majeure. An official at a trade union representing workers at Newmont's Indonesian mine said it may take legal action against both the company and the government over the mine closure and layoffs, and planned to organise demonstrations.""We will sue both Newmont and the government because they have been so arrogant, and caused the workers to be the victims of their arrogance,"" Yoesrawan Galang, chairman of the Newmont Nusa Tenggara unit of an Indonesian mine workers' union, told Reuters. ""This is why we will also stage demonstrations against them.""Newmont, the world's third-largest gold producer by market value, had said its storage facilities at the Indonesian mine were full after the near five-month export halt, but that it had delayed standing down its employees and contractors ahead of government meetings this week.About 80 percent of Batu Hijau's 4,000 employees will be placed on leave at reduced pay from Friday, the statement added, as export talks with the government continued.Freeport said earlier this year it had cut production at its Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia, the world's fifth-largest copper mine, by around 60 percent and that a force majeure could be announced if the export dispute dragged on.London copper prices fell to the lowest in three weeks this week amid worries about a widening probe on copper financing in China's third largest port.

""Yesterday I had discussions with the finance ministry and they said the draft is already finalized,"" Sukhyar told reporters, adding that it been agreed by the mining, industry and finance ministries.Finance Minister Chatib Basri said on Friday the draft tax regulation still needed to be approved by chief economics minister Chairul Tanjung and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.The CEOs of both the companies have been in Jakarta in recent days to meet with Tanjung in a renewed government push to find a solution.It is not known whether the CEOs are still in Jakarta. Sukhyar said both the U.S. miners had agreed to pay the new export tax rate. However, neither firm would confirm whether a reduced rate would be acceptable.""We have not received it yet,"" Newmont spokesman Rubi Purnomo said in an email about the new draft export regulation and rate.""We are very hopeful that the government will give us certainty very soon and a resolution that will allow PTNNT (Newmont) to resume operations in economically sustainable manner.""Freeport declined to comment on Friday. The current copper export tax kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017.Yudhoyono's outgoing administration has been trying to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Indonesia, but a lack of progress in ending the dispute has led Newmont to declare force majeure and Freeport to slash output.Even if the export tax rate is reduced in the new government draft regulation and then accepted by the companies, large hurdles remain before exports can be resumed.If the new tax rate is tied to smelter construction progress, although Freeport and Newmont have agreed to conduct a feasibility study into building a copper smelter, both have questioned whether it would be economically viable.Freeport also says it needs the certainty of a contract extension beyond 2021, before agreeing to invest more than $17 billion needed for a copper smelter and to turn its Grasberg complex into an underground mine after 2016.Discussions with Freeport over a contract extension were continuing, Sukhyar added.An extension to Newmont's deal, which ends in 2030, is not under discussion in the contract talks, according to government officials, with the main issue of concern being a proposed increase in royalty percentages paid to the government.

75,"  LIMA, June 25 A federal judge in Lima has ordered a regional president  detained for 14 months while prosecutors prepare corruption charges against the official, who is the main opponent of Newmont Mining's $5 billion stalled Conga gold project.Judge Mercedes Caballero ruled at a hearing on Wednesday that Gregorio Santos, president of the mineral-rich Cajamarca region in northern Peru, must be held before being tried because he might flee the country or disrupt the corruption inquiry now under way.Santos' arrest comes just months before he planned to seek a second four-year term as regional president, effectively clearing the electoral path for candidates who might favor the project.Judge Caballero said Santos would have to remain in custody for 14 months while the prosecution prepares its case, less than the 18 months requested. If Santos is tried and found innocent before then, he could be released.Santos, a member of the communist party Patria Roja and a former peasant patrol leader, led dozens of protests against Conga that forced U.S.-based Newmont to suspend construction on its Conga gold project in 2011. Prosecutor Walter Delgado said Santos received bribes from companies in exchange for awarding 11 local public work contracts.Santos has denied wrongdoing and said his appearance at the public hearing was an indication he had no intention of fleeing.""I am not running away,"" Santos told the judge. ""I'm here at your disposal and the disposal of justice."" Santos has called the current inquiry and others before it political persecution aimed at removing him from power so the Conga project can go forward.Santos' lawyer will file an appeal, said Olmedo Auris, a political leader close to Santos. After Santos was escorted away by police, a small group of supporters protested the judge's decision outside the courthouse.Santos is the third regional president in Peru to be detained in recent months as the attorney general's office aims to crack down on corruption of provincial officials.The Conga project would offset dwindling gold deposits at Newmont's nearby Yanacocha mine, which is nearing the end of its life. Opponents say Conga would pollute or deplete water sources used by Andean peasants and have rejected the company's plans to build reservoirs for community use.Newmont controls 51.35 percent of Conga, and Peruvian mining company Buenaventura holds 43.65 percent.

76,"  LIMA, June 30 The jailed governor of a mineral-rich region in Peru who helped derail Newmont's $5 billion Conga gold project will run for re-election on an anti-mining ticket this year from prison, his party said on Monday.A federal judge in Lima last week ordered Gregorio Santos imprisoned for 14 months, saying he might flee the country while public prosecutors prepare corruption charges against him.Peruvian law does not prohibit detained citizens from running for office unless sentenced with a crime, the electoral authority said.Santos will continue to appeal to detractors of the Conga project in Peru's northern region of Cajamarca by going forward with his campaign, said Olmedo Auris, vice president of Santos's party, Movimiento de Afirmacion Social, or MAS.Porfirio Medina will campaign for Santos on the ground in Cajamarca as his deputy governor and run his office if they win, Auris said. Regional elections are in October.Santos's bid clouds expectations that Newmont and junior partner Buenaventura will get Conga off the ground now that its most powerful opponent is behind bars. The companies stopped construction on the massive gold project in 2011 after protests led by Santos, a fiery former peasant patrol leader, ended in clashes with police.Buenaventura's share price jumped 6.94 percent after Santos was imprisoned last Wednesday. Conga would offset dwindling gold deposits at the companies' nearby Yanacocha mine. Opponents say Conga would pollute or deplete water sources used by Andean peasants, and they have rejected the companies' plans to build reservoirs for community use.It is unclear how much support Santos still has with voters in Cajamarca, which ranked as the country's poorest region last year with more than half of its population living in poverty, according to state statistics agency Inei.Auris said Santos's campaign will emphasize Conga and his imprisonment, which he described as politically motivated and intended to pave the way for the project. The public prosecutor investigating Santos said last week that Santos got kickbacks on 11 local public works projects.Santos has denied the accusations. He is the third governor  put in preventive prison in recent months as the attorney general's office cracks down on corruption of local officials.Newmont controls 51.35 percent of Conga, Buenaventura 43.65 percent, and the International Finance Corporation 5 percent.(Reporting by Mitra Taj; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-06-30,NEM,"Mon Jun 30, 2014 | 3:58pm EDT","Peru governor to seek re-election, fight gold project from prison",http://www.reuters.com//article/peru-newmont-santos-idUSL2N0PB1J520140630?type=companyNews

The firm, together with fellow miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc, is in dispute with the government over an escalating export tax imposed in January that they say conflict with their mining contracts. Global copper prices, currently near a four-month high of $7,028.50 per tonne, continue to be underpinned by the disruption to supplies from Indonesia, home to the world's No.5 copper mine that is owned by Freeport.""PTNNT (PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara) and its shareholders are left with no option but to seek relief through international arbitration to ensure our stakeholders' jobs, rights and interests are protected,"" Martiono Hadianto, president director of PTNNT, Newmont's Indonesian operations, said in a statement.""We want continued dialogue with the government to lead to a resolution outside of arbitration,"" he added. ""In the meantime, we have an obligation to protect the value of Batu Hijau and the thousands of jobs it provides, as we are still unable to export copper concentrate due to the regulations."" Newmont intends to request interim, injunctive relief to allow it to resume copper concentrate exports so that Batu Hijau operations can be restarted, according to the statement.Indonesia's coal and minerals director general, Sukhyar, said while he had not yet read Newmont's letter notifying the government on its decision to seek arbitration, he regretted the miner had taken this action and that the government would seek to resolve it. ""It's not the end of the world ... automatically our renegotiation of CoW talks will temporarily be stopped,"" the official told reporters, referring to the long-running contract renegotiations between the government and Newmont.Newmont's decision to pursue international arbitration, despite a recent move by Indonesia to draw up a new mining export tax that will more than halve the base rate to be paid by miners, casts doubt on whether the export spat will be resolved before presidential elections on July 9.Both Freeport and Newmont, which account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper output, have previously argued they should be exempt from the tax, which kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017.The tax on concentrate exports is part of the outgoing government's drive to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Southeast Asia's largest economy.An attempt to broker a deal with foreign miners and restart copper concentrate exports was spearheaded by Indonesia's chief economics minister Chairul Tanjung last month and as a part of this, Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg and Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson visited Jakarta.

Asked about talks with the government, he said: ""Still ongoing.""Global copper prices, currently not far off four-month highs, have been underpinned by the disruption to supplies from Indonesia. Freeport and Newmont, which account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper production, halted concentrate exports in January when the government introduced new mining rules, including an export tax, in an effort to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Indonesia.The miners argue that their current contracts mean they should be exempt from the tax.An attempt to solve the issue and restart copper concentrate exports was spearheaded by Indonesia's new chief economics minister and billionaire businessma Chairul Tanjung last month. Tanjung said on Wednesday he was disappointed by Newmont's arbitration action.""This makes us wonder whether Newmont has a good will to deal with Indonesian government,"" he said. ""We expect Newmont to sit back down with us so we can finish negotiations together."" Swelling mine supply had been expected to tip the copper market into a surplus this year for the first time in several years, keeping a lid on prices and boosting the processing fees that miners pay smelters to refine metal.But the protracted standoff over exports has wiped out the expected surplus and supported prices. Copper prices  traded near around $6,987 per tonne on Wednesday.""We'll see around 400,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate removed from the market this year. We are now expecting a relatively balanced market,"" said analyst Matt Fusarelli at AME Group in Sydney.""Any further reductions would probably tip the market into deficit this year.""At least one large Chinese copper smelter had agreed to pay lower processing fees with global miner BHP Billiton <BHP.AX BLT> for term concentrate shipments in the second half of 2014, from January to June shipments, two sources said last month.

88,"  (Adds Newmont comment, background)July 23 Freeport-McMoRan Inc said on Wednesday it expects to ""imminently"" sign an agreement with Indonesia that would enable it to immediately resume copper concentrate exports which have been halted for more than six months.In a sign that the deadlock could be nearing an end, Newmont Mining Corp also said it was negotiating a memorandum of understanding that could restart stalled shipments.Arizona-based Freeport said on July 8 it had agreed on a draft memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government but had not signed it. At the time, it gave no time frame on when it would resume exports. Indonesia introduced a mineral ore export ban and a steep export tax in January.""It is a compromise to create a bridge for us so that we can return to normal operations,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said of the MoU on a call with analysts and investors after the miner reported second-quarter results that were little changed from a year-ago.Under the agreement, Freeport would pay a ""significantly reduced"" export duty in 2014, 2015 and 2016 but higher royalties on copper and gold sales. It would also pay a $115 million ""assurance bond"" against development of a smelter, Adkerson said.Freeport, which owns and operates the massive Grasberg mine, wants financial incentives from the government to build a new smelter. Indonesia imposed the new rules partly to spur construction of smelters in the country, but miners have said building new capacity does not make economic sense. Adkerson said the negotiations also involve agreeing on terms to extend Freeport's operations beyond 2021, when its current contract with the government expires.NEWMONT BACK IN TALKS  The two U.S. mining giants account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper production. While Freeport had engaged in behind-the-scenes talks, Newmont suspended operation at its Batu Hijau mine and filed for international arbitration, drawing a rebuke from the Indonesian government.""We hope to reach an agreement with the government of Indonesia on an MoU or memorandum of understanding, which we would expect would lead to issuance of an export permit,"" Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said on Wednesday.He did not give details on terms or when exports could resume. Officials from Newmont's Indonesian unit have been in ongoing meetings with the government, he added. Indonesia's new president said on Tuesday he planned to sit down with Freeport and other miners to resolve the row, which has halted $500 million of metal exports a month in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.Freeport has cut production in Indonesia, which weighed on results in the quarter ended June 30, but company-wide, copper, gold and molybdenum production rose.The year-earlier figures included only one month of results from Freeport's recently acquired oil and gas businesses, so that segment's revenue jumped to $1.24 billion from $372 million.Net income was $482 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $482 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier.Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 51 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Freeport said it would continue to look for ways to reduce its debt, which could include asset sales or reducing or deferring capital spending. It ended the quarter with $20.3 billion of debt.

90,"  * Miners must pay bond or build smelter to get lower tax* Concentrate export tax cut to below 10 pct from 20-25 pct* Freeport set to strike deal* Newmont still in dispute   (Recasts, updates details on export tax revision)By Fergus JensenJAKARTA, July 24 Indonesia has offered mining companies a tax concession to end a six-month dispute that has reduced mineral exports by half a billion dollars a month, pushed up the global price of some metals and led to thousands of layoffs.The company with the biggest mining operations in the archipelago, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc, is set to become the first to take the deal and restart concentrate shipments from Grasberg, one of the world's largest copper mines. Freeport said on Wednesday that the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to resume exports was imminent.After a cabinet meeting on mining policy on Thursday, Indonesia's chief economics minister Chairul Tanjung told reporters that Freeport was close to receiving an export permit.If other miners follow suit, the deal will take some of the pressure off president elect Joko Widodo. Widodo was declared the winner of Indonesia's presidential elections this week and has said solving the dispute - which has sapped government mining revenues - would be one of his top priorities when he takes power in October.It was unclear if the decision to revise the export tax rules was deliberately timed to coincide with the result of Indonesia's most tightly-contested election.The second-largest copper miner in the country, Newmont Mining Corp, said on Wednesday that it, too, was negotiating an agreement to restart exports, but an Indonesian official denied any talks had taken place""There have been no MOU discussions with Newmont. None at all,"" Coal and Minerals director general Sukhyar said on Thursday. ""The government's position is we will face them in court.""The company has more work to do to rebuild its relationship with the government after angering authorities by suspending operation at its biggest Indonesian mine and filing for international arbitration in response to the move in January by Indonesia to raise export taxes on metal concentrates. ""The government will take stern action towards Newmont,"" Tanjung quoted President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as saying on Thursday.He said also that Yudhoyono referred to the firm as ""not valuing working on Indonesian soil, the birthplace of Indonesia's ancestors.""Newmont officials were not immediately available to respond to the comments.Freeport and Newmont are Indonesia's top copper miners, and account for 97 percent of the nation's copper output.TAX BREAK FOR SMELTER BOND  Indonesia will cut the tax levied on mineral concentrate exports to less than 10 percent for miners that pay a bond as a guarantee they will build a smelter later, Fiscal Policy chief Andin Hadiyanto told Reuters on Thursday, adding that the new regulation was due to be issued in August.As construction of the smelter progresses, the export tax on concentrates would fall to zero, he added.The government will also charge extra royalties on mineral sales to at least partly offset any loss in revenue, officials said.In January, Indonesia imposed an escalating tax policy, which penalised any company which had not made progress on building a smelter by slapping them with a 25 percent tax on copper concentrate exports or a 20 percent tax on lead, zinc, iron and manganese shipments. The tax was due to increase annually to 60 percent in 2017.The tax was intended to force miners to develop smelters and mineral processing facilities and part of a government push to derive bigger returns from Indonesia's mineral resources. But rather than pay it, most miners stopped exporting from Southeast Asia's biggest economy and one of the world's top mineral producers.The government also banned the export of unprocessed ore, and that ban will remain in place, FREEPORT'S AGREEMENT As part of its deal, Freeport has agreed to pay more royalties, Hadiyanto said. Its royalties will rise to 4 percent on copper sales, Sukhyar said. It previously paid between 1.5 and 3.5 percent under an old deal, and the higher rate will bring it into line with royalties paid by other companies.The government is expected to grant Freeport an export permit within two weeks, Sukhyar said. The company is Indonesia's biggest taxpayer, and earlier said its contributions  would drop by $1.6 billion in 2014 as a result of declining output from the rule change in January.Under the agreement, Freeport said it would pay a ""significantly reduced"" export duty in 2014, 2015 and 2016 but higher royalties on copper and gold sales. It would also pay a $115 million ""assurance bond"" against development of a smelter.""It is a compromise to create a bridge for us so that we can return to normal operations,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said of the MOU in an earnings call with analysts and investors.Freeport and Newmont need the MOU to secure billion-dollar expansion plans, but at this stage no other companies that have contracts to operate in Indonesia were being asked to sign such documents before being eligible for export permits, Indonesian Mining Association (IMA) Executive Director Syahrir Abubakar told Reuters.The older mining contracts that have their own tax rates are slowly being phased-out through renegotiation processes and are being replaced with special mining licenses that are subject to different rules and prevailing tax rates.""There are no other cases like Freeport,"" Abubakar said, adding that other miners were waiting for the government to revise its tax regulation.

The Merian gold mine is expected to start production late in 2016, pending government approvals.Newmont, the biggest U.S. gold miner, said the project contains gold reserves of 4.2 million ounces and is expected to produce an average of 300,000 ounces to 400,000 ounces of gold a year over a mine life of 11 years. The mine is expected to have all-in sustaining costs of between $750 an ounce and $850 an ounce in the first five years - low by gold industry standards.""This decision marks an important milestone in our portfolio optimization process. We have divested nearly $800 million in non-core assets to help fund the next generation of lower cost projects in our portfolio,"" Newmont Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg said in a statement. Announcements to build large new gold mines have slowed to a trickle in the past two years as miners, burnt by soaring costs and weaker gold prices, have slashed capital expenditure and turned shy of big capital projects.

Otherwise, we wouldn't have filed it,"" Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg said, speaking on a conference call to discuss the gold and copper producer's results and plans to develop a new gold mine. ""But we are really interested in finding a negotiated solution with the government and want to continue down this parallel path to resolve it as soon as possible,"" he said.Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the biggest copper miner in Indonesia, clinched a deal with the government last Friday allowing it to resume copper concentrate exports from the Southeast Asian country.Newmont last week said it is negotiating an agreement to restart exports, but an Indonesian official denied any talks had taken place. The international arbitration filing by the Denver, Colorado-based miner has angered the Indonesian government.Exports of concentrate were halted in January when the government announced a sharp rise in export taxes, part of its drive to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Southeast Asia's largest economy. Newmont halted production on June 5, saying its concentrate storage facilities were full. Goldberg said Newmont hopes to restart talks next week after a break due to religious holidays this week in Indonesia.Newmont is seeking interim relief from arbitrators so it can resume production, but estimates such a ruling could take several months, Goldberg said. Once received, a ramp up to full production would take several weeks.Newmont raised its gold production forecast for this year by 2 percent to between 4.7 million and 5 million ounces and trimmed its costs applicable to sales forecast by 3 percent to a range of $720 per ounce to $760 an ounce.The miner also said late on Tuesday it plans to invest around $1 billion in building a gold mine in Suriname.

98,"  (Corrects second last paragraph to make clear Newmont, Churchill legal challenges are international arbitration cases)By Kanupriya KapoorJAKARTA Aug 4 Indonesia's president-elect Joko Widodo on Monday announced a high-powered advisory team to handle his transition to power as he prepares to take over the top job in the world's third-largest democracy later this year.The five-member ""transition office"" will lead a team of several advisers who will be responsible for drawing up a policy roadmap to fulfil major campaign promises and address pressing issues facing Southeast Asia's biggest economy.""This transition office is needed to prepare the implementation of our vision and programmes,"" Widodo and vice president-elect Jusuf Kalla said in a statement, adding the team would prioritise universal access to healthcare and education.Widodo, commonly known by his nickname Jokowi, beat rival Prabowo Subianto in last month's presidential election, the closest in the history of the world's most populous Muslim nation.Prabowo, an ex-general, has challenged the election result in the Constitutional Court, which will start hearing the case this week and is expected to deliver a verdict by Aug. 21. Its decision will be final with no right of appeal. Widodo has promised to form a cabinet that is dominated by technocrats in order to overhaul a sleepy bureaucracy and introduce much-needed economic reform to address big fuel subsidies, cooling investment and creaky infrastructure.But concern persists that the former small-city mayor, who is relatively inexperienced on the national stage, may be beholden to his political party and its chief, former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, for key appointments and policy advice. TAKING OFFICE ON OCT. 20 The transition team will be headed by Rini Soemarno, a close aide of Megawati. Soemarno, an influential, U.S.-educated businesswoman, served during Megawati's presidency as trade and industry minister and is a former head of PT Astra International , Indonesia's biggest automobile distributor.Another member of the team of advisers, Hasto Kristiyanto, is vice secretary general of Widodo's Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P). Other figures include Anies Baswedan, a respected academic and education specialist, a military expert and a senior member of a coalition partner.Widodo, a former furniture businessman, last month invited the public to participate in an online poll to choose cabinet ministers, but it was unclear how the survey would affect the final line-up.The new cabinet will be announced after Widodo takes office on Oct 20.The team will also draw up a list of potential cabinet ministers and review strategies to handle ""major legal liabilities"" facing the incoming administration like international arbitration cases involving mining giants Newmont Mining Corp and Churchill Mining, two of Widodo's aides told Reuters.Newmont last month filed for international arbitration over Indonesia's mineral export tax, while Churchill has been battling the government for years over lost rights to a coal project.

On Thursday a source familiar with the company said Barrick's view had not changed since then. This year's talks were the third time in a seven-year period that Barrick and Newmont seriously contemplated a merger. The companies have large and overlapping operations in Nevada. Cowen and Co analyst Adam Graf said there could be some cost savings if Barrick and Newmont combine, but a big, flashy deal could leave investors worse off.""I believe there are some synergies to be harvested in Nevada, but I think a mega-merger is not the best way to go about it,"" he said. Graf said the companies could form a joint venture, or Barrick could sell its Goldstrike complex to Newmont.

106,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, August 12 (Fitch) Newmont Mining Corporation's development of the Merian  gold mine could be positive for Suriname's sovereign credit profile over the  medium term by supporting growth, employment, fiscal revenue and foreign  exchange receipts, Fitch Ratings says. External borrowing to finance the  government's participation in the mining project was already factored into our  debt projections when we affirmed Suriname's 'BB-'/Stable ratings in May, but  could expose economic performance and public finances to gold price volatility.  Bauxite, gold and oil are the main contributors to Suriname's economy. The  mining sector accounted for 28% of fiscal revenue and 88% of exports in 2013.  The Merian mine could involve USD1bn (18% of GDP) in investment and double  industrial gold output by end-2016, at a time when production is expected to  tail off as mature mines become less sustainable. Fitch forecasts that real GDP  growth could rise to 4.2% in 2015 from our forecast 3.7% in 2014, driven by new  mining investment.  A sustained decline in commodity prices and implementation  delays are the main risks to these projections.  The project will see Suriname undertake its first commercial sovereign  borrowing, although the state-owned oil company Staatsolie borrowed in the  syndicated loan market in 2011 and 2014. The government has the option to take a  25% equity stake, which it will finance through an estimated USD200m (3.6% of  GDP) of commercial loans backed with the revenue stream of the project. It plans  to raise a similar amount for a new partnership with IAMGOLD Corporation,  although this project has been postponed until 2015-2016.  A new agency will be created to administer the government's stake in the Merian  project, and loan terms will be tailored to match the expected cash flows of the  mine. Suriname is a first-time user of non-official lending with recent episodes  of arrears to official lenders. As such establishing a track record of using  debt proceeds prudently and building provisions to service the loans,  particularly in light of the high volatility of gold prices, would be positive.   Fitch's sustainability analysis suggests that Suriname's debt burden will likely  stay below the 'BB' median of 36% of GDP even with this external borrowing in  2015-2016. With tax collection significantly driven by mining royalties, the  broader impact on the fiscal accounts should be positive, but may be volatile.  As an equity investor, the government may also receive dividends. Newmont's  investment and public sector external borrowing will support the balance of  payments. The current account deficit could widen to an average 5.3% in  2014-2015, but is expected to be fully financed by foreign direct investment.  The political commitment to the project is strong, and significant preparatory  work for the Merian project, for example upgrading the surrounding transport  infrastructure, has been undertaken. The authorities' capacity and willingness  to manage any fiscal windfall will also help determine the full impact on the  sovereign credit profile. A sovereign wealth fund has been proposed but is not  yet in place.  With presidential elections due in May 2015, fiscal expansion, which has been  contained by domestic financing constraints, spending rationalisation and  revenue measures, may accelerate in the meantime, potentially putting pressure  on reserves and the exchange rate. Our public debt projections are highly  sensitive to a failure to undertake sustained fiscal adjustment following the  elections.

The government has yet to receive an official letter from Newmont, said Sukhyar, director-general of coal and minerals at the mining ministry, adding that Newmont still needed to negotiate a MoU before exports could be resumed.Sukhyar said Newmont had agreed to pay an export tax but that further negotiations were needed over royalties.Chief Economics Minister Chairul Tanjung is expected to make an announcement on Newmont's arbitration on Wednesday, said Susyanto, the director of the law bureau for the mines ministry. Mining industry executives in Indonesia have balked at the idea of developing downstream industries and building smelters, citing a lack of power and infrastructure in remote areas where mines are often located.RELATIONS TESTED The relationship between Newmont and the Indonesian government has been severely tested during the dispute, with outgoing president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono criticising the company's methods. In contrast, President-elect Joko Widodo, who will replace Yudhoyono in October, said he wanted to sit down with mining companies in a bid to resolve the row over policies. It is not known whether Widodo was involved in the talks that led to Newmont's withdrawal of its arbitration case.Before the new export rules, Newmont forecast total output of copper in concentrate would amount to 110,000 to 125,000 tonnes from its Indonesian mine this year.Shares of the Denver, Colorado-based gold and copper miner were up just over 1 percent at 1540 GMT.Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Indonesian unit resumed exports earlier this month after clinching a deal and signing an MoU with the government in July.Both Freeport and Newmont, which account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper output, had previously argued they should be exempt from the tax, which kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017.Freeport agreed to a much reduced export tax rate of 7.5 percent, which will fall further depending on its progress in the construction of a domestic copper smelter.

111,"   By Clyde Russell | LAUNCESTON, Australia  LAUNCESTON, Australia Aug 27 China has in recent years been viewed as the main driver of the global copper market, and while its influence remains strong, it's possible that the rest of the world will take over in the short term.Copper is currently one of the more divisive commodities among analysts, with opinions split over whether the industrial metal will continue its recent rally or lose ground over the rest of 2014.The point is that considerable uncertainty exists over copper's direction and much of that comes down to whatever view is held about the economic outlook for China, which consumes roughly 45 percent of the world's copper.While this is obviously a huge chunk of the market, it still means that the other 55 percent could exert a bigger influence, especially if its demand trend is changing.London copper prices gained 3.4 percent between Aug. 14 and Tuesday's close of $7,054 a tonne (1.0123 ton), although they are still down 4.2 percent since the start of the year.The recent gains have largely been attributed to an improving outlook for growth in the United States and hopes that Europe may take steps to stimulate its struggling economies.However, Chinese copper prices have also been rising, with the most traded Shanghai contract gaining 4.5 percent since Aug. 15 to close at 50,620 yuan ($8,230) a tonne on Tuesday.Both London and Shanghai copper have posted strong gains since their 2014 lows of mid-March, jumping 10 percent and 16.7 percent respectively.Part of this is due to the improving global economic backdrop plus expectations of a Chinese industrial recovery in the second half, but it may also be related to a sharp fall in reported inventories, both in London Metal Exchange (LME) and Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) warehouses.LME inventories dropped to a seven-year low of 141,275 tonnes in the week to Aug. 15, while SHFE stocks dropped to 75,529 tonnes in the week to June 20, the lowest since December 2011.While inventories at both exchanges have recovered slightly from those lows, they remain well below recent peaks.The International Copper Study Group, in its latest report on Aug. 20, estimated a global deficit of refined copper of 466,000 tonnes in the first five months of this year, compared to a surplus of 251,000 tonnes in the same period in 2013. It said global copper consumption was up 15.5 percent in the period, led by a 29 percent jump in apparent demand in China.THINGS TO HATE ABOUT COPPER Copper bears, however, point to a range of factors that they expect to act as a drag on demand for the red metal over the short to medium term.In Macquarie Bank's Aug. 4 report ""10 things we hate about copper in 2H14"", five were related to China, with top billing going to the slowdown in housing construction.An increase in Chinese smelter output was another reason cited by both Macquarie and an Aug. 14 report from Goldman Sachs.This is likely to cut Chinese import demand for refined copper for the rest of the year, lowering the 28 percent growth seen in the seven months to July over the same period in 2013. However, it should mean that imports of copper ores and scrap increase to feed the increased smelting capacity. In other words, increased Chinese output of refined copper is only bearish for prices if it isn't matched by decreased output elsewhere.Rising production of refined copper in China may actually result in higher prices for ores and concentrates, and may help to soak up expected higher mine output in the second half as Indonesian exports resume following a deal between the government and major producer Freeport-McMoRan. Newmont Mining Corp may also be edging towards a deal with Indonesia so that it can start exporting again. It is likely that slower housing construction will be a drag on Chinese copper demand, but this may be a temporary situation as signs emerge that many Chinese cities are starting to ease property curbs in a bid to stimulate the sector. Whether it's a good idea to re-inflate the Chinese property market is questionable, but it appears likely that copper demand from housing won't be as dire as many fear.There also remains a question mark over the so-called dark inventories of copper in China, those that sit outside the SHFE system and are largely tied to commodity financing deals. The multi-pledging of metals at Qingdao port has led to fears of a crackdown on commodity financing and several Western banks have expressed caution. But so far there appears little real evidence of these unmonitored inventories hitting the market in greater than usual quantities, so this remains a risk, not a reality.The base case for Chinese copper demand remains one of modest growth, but with slower growth in refined imports as the country ramps up smelting capacity.That should result in more metal flowing into LME warehouses.The question then becomes whether that flow will outweigh rising demand in the rest of the world, in which case prices will struggle to rally.Or it could be that global demand ex-China improves enough to absorb the refined copper that may not be imported by China in the second half of the year.It seems that monitoring demand in the rest of the world may be more important than looking at China's copper consumption in the short to medium term.

116,"  * Philippine senator urges unprocessed ore export ban* Nickel options expiry helps boost prices-analyst* Tin falls to lowest level since January   (Updates with closing prices)By Maytaal Angel and Eric OnstadLONDON, Sept 3 Nickel prices jumped to a four-week high on Wednesday on news that a Philippine senator had urged a ban on unprocessed mineral ore exports and also following an options expiry in London.Copper fell on higher exchange stocks and as investors downplayed signs of progress towards peace in eastern Ukraine while tin slid to a eight-month low on worries about oversupply.Three month nickel on the London Metal Exchange raced 2.8 percent higher to close at $19,075 a tonne, the highest since Aug. 7.Prices, which are up by around one-third in the year to date, were bolstered by news that a Philippine senator had filed a bill urging a halt to exports of unprocessed mineral ores.The proposed halt is similar to a ban introduced by Indonesia from January that led to a sharp spike in nickel prices and cut other ore exports.Most analysts expect a deficit in nickel next year, and so the Philippines news worried investors, but some analysts were wary of the gains since.""This is one senator introducing what we would call a private members bill. It's far too early to say whether it will gain traction,"" BNP Paribas analyst Stephen Briggs said.Analyst Edward Meir at broker INTL FCStone was also sceptical. ""Instituting a ban will result in foregoing massive amounts of revenue, not to mention the fact that buyers may very well have found other suppliers in the interim,"" he said in a note. ""We would therefore not be jumping on this particular rally in nickel.""Many investors have been exposed to nickel through the options market, and the expiry of September options was also a factor in the surge in prices, analyst Leon Westgate at Standard Bank said.""With options declaration rolling off, some of the recent gravitational pull of the $18,500 level has vanished,"" he said in a note.Open interest in September call options was concentrated at the $18,500 strike. <0#MNIU4+> OTHER METALS SLIDE In other metals, copper slid 1 percent to finish at$6,904 a tonne, its lowest level in two weeks. Prices have struggled to gain headway in recent weeks as expectations of fresh supply have dampened investor interest.Daily LME data showed stocks rose by 7,000 tonnes to 154,825 tonnes, their highest since July 22 after two weeks of near straight increases.

It's too early to say,"" Briggs said.Markets were wary of news about the Ukraine conflict.Russian President Vladimir Putin said a deal to end fighting in eastern Ukraine could be reached this week, but hopes of peace were clouded by Western concerns that the announcement was timed by the Kremlin to wrong-foot NATO on the eve of a summit. ""This news about Russia and Ukraine, the immediate impact you're more likely to see through oil and precious metals for one, and secondly, it's not clear what it means,"" Briggs said.Some investors hoped for further policy action at the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday after data showed euro zone retail sales slowed in July, while business activity grew at the slowest rate this year in August.Looser policy in Europe would cheapen liquidity for industry and investors, who may raise their holdings of hard assets, which tend to hold their value when paper currency depreciates.Aluminium shed 1.3 percent to end at $2,079 a tonne, moving away from last week's high above $2,100, which was the most expensive since February 2013.A partial closure of capacity at an aluminium smelter in China helped drive up domestic prices of the metal by as much as 4 percent this week as investors scramble to compensate for an expected shortfall in supply.Caroline Bain, senior commodities economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said its forecasts for aluminium had recently been revised.""We are anticipating a small deficit of just over 100,000 tonnes this year, but we have the market back in surplus next year as we expect China's production to keep growing,"" she told the Reuters Global Base Metals Forum.

120,"  * Post-acquisition expects annual output of 750k oz by 2018* Technical issues to shave gold output target for 2014* Fresnillo says it may hedge some gold output   (Adds details, quotes from analyst and chief executive)By Esha Vaish and Silvia AntonioliBANGALORE/LONDON Sept 12 Silver miner Fresnillo Plc has agreed buy Newmont Mining Corp's 44 percent stake in Penmont, their Mexican gold mining joint venture for $450 million in cash.As well as three mines, the deal gives the London-listed miner complete control of exploration projects and other prospects in and around the Herradura corridor in northern Mexico.Fresnillo, which currently makes the bulk of its profits from silver mining, expects gold will represent about half of its earnings by 2018 as a result of the Newmont deal.""The acquisition ... would significantly enhance our gold production and be central to our growth,"" Chief Executive Octavio Alvídrez said.""In line with our disciplined growth strategy, the acquisition is earnings accretive, and provides Fresnillo with significant exploration and development potential in a region where we are experienced operators."" However, the company said that some technical issues at a processing plant at Penmont's Herradura mine are currently reducing its gold production a little. This will likely result in a 4-8 percent reduction in its gold production target of 450,000 ounces for 2014 but Fresnillo expects it can make up for this next year.""Assuming that it goes through the approval process, they'll have a 100 percent of their assets in the joint venture, so their capital expenditure and their production will go up a bit,"" said analyst Sheldon Modeland at VSA Capital.""At the end of the day it probably doesn't change a whole lot, but it's a good idea.""Once its gets full control of the joint venture Fresnillo will have an annualised production capacity of around 600,000-620,000 ounces of gold before ramping up to 750,000 ounces by 2018. The latter target could be raised further once the board approves development of the Mega Centauro and Centauro Deep projects, a spokesman said. Prior to the Newmont deal Fresnillo's gold output target was already 500,000 ounces for 2018. A spokesman said the new targets were being more conservative in not yet including the Centauro projects, which go to the board for approval next year.Fresnillo operates three other mines in Mexico and expects to produce 43 million ounces of silver this year.HEDGING GOLD  Fresnillo is considering hedging part of the extra gold production it will get through the acquisition.An increasing numbers of precious metals miners, battered by last year's drop in prices, are selling planned output forward to better control their cash flow.""When we did the IPO there was a clear message from most major shareholders: there was no desire for the company to do any hedging since they wanted full exposure to the price of gold and silver,"" he said.""However in this particular case, given the size of the investment we definitely would consider doing it and we'll go back to shareholders to check what the appetite is.""Shares in Fresnillo rose as much as 1.5 percent in early trading on Friday, before falling back to trade at 820 pence by 1023 GMT, a rise of 0.12 percent.The Newmont deal, expected to close by early October, will add to earnings immediately, Fresnillo said. The pretax profit attributable to Newmont's stake in the project was $33.4 million in 2013.Newmont, the biggest U.S. gold miner, is selling some assets to help fund other operations such as a new gold mine in Suriname, raising $1.3 billion so far from such sales.

Last month, Goldberg told reporters in Melbourne that he was open to resuming discussions about a potential merger with Barrick.""We are always open to consider opportunities for value, but there is nothing in that area going on,"" Goldberg said on Tuesday. In July, Barrick Chairman John Thornton said the miner remained open to a tie-up with Newmont, but made it clear that a deal was not his current focus. This year's talks were the third time in a seven-year period that Barrick and Newmont seriously contemplated a merger.Analysts say merging the two miner's large, overlapping operations in Nevada could result in cost savings of between $500 million and $1 billion.

130,"  * FTSE 100 down 0.2 pct; fell some 2 pct at start of week* Fresnillo gains on bullish UBS comment* Vodafone buoyed by more takeover talk* RBS falls after Citizens IPO priced below expectationsBy Tricia WrightLONDON, Sept 24 Britain's top share index steadied on Wednesday after recent hefty falls, underpinned by supportive comments from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and solid gains from index heavyweight Vodafone.Helping stabilise the market, Draghi said euro zone monetary policy would remain accommodative for a long period and that the goal was to push up inflation from near zero towards the ECB's target of just below 2 percent. Data showing German business sentiment dropped for a fifth straight month in September dragged on sentiment, but after a difficult start to the week which saw the FTSE 100 fall more than 2 percent, traders reckoned the worst was over.""I think the downside will be fairly limited. Most of the selling pressure's probably out of the way now,"" said TJM Partners' head of trading, Manoj Ladwa.Vodafone was among notable risers, ahead 1.5 percent, with traders citing more takeover speculation around the mobile operator. Trading volume in the stock was solid, at almost a third of the 90-day daily average, against a fifth for the broader FTSE 100. Silver and gold miner Fresnillo topped the blue-chip leader board, up 2.7 percent, after UBS added it to its 'most preferred' list. It cited the recent acquisition of Newmont Mining Corp's 44 percent stake in Mexican gold mining joint venture Penmont as a small medium-term positive.""After recent share price weakness we see attractive long term value in Fresnillo and are attracted to its low cost assets, production growth, high return projects, exploration upside and conservative management,"" UBS analysts said.Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, meanwhile, shed 1.4 percent. The initial public offering of its U.S. retail business Citizens was priced at $21.50 per share, below the $23-$25 range. The FTSE 100 was down 12.64 points, or 0.2 percent, at 6,663.44 points by 0835 GMT. It is now more than 3 percent below this month's 14 1/2-year high of 6,904.86.Profit warnings and share-price slides at retailer Tesco  and sweetener maker Tate & Lyle this week, and more poor economic data from the euro zone, Britain's biggest trading partner, have put investors on edge.That has left the UK benchmark looking ""oversold"" on its 14-day Relative Strength Index, a technical momentum indicator. Some traders were looking to buy back into the market around these levels.""We are actually buyers of UK equity at these levels. The FTSE has fallen slightly more than we expected so will be looking to pick up some bargains,"" said Mark Ward, head of trading at Sanlam Securities.Among the top fallers were stocks trading without the attraction of their latest dividend, namely Old Mutual  and Centrica.

Santos has denied wrongdoing and said his imprisonment was designed to ease the way for Newmont's gold and copper project. Peruvian law allows detained citizens to be elected to office, but not if they have been convicted and sentenced to prison.""To be honest, we expected him to win ... but not with this proportion of the vote,"" said Olmedo Auris, vice president of Santos' party. ""It is a clear message from the people of Cajamarca that they do not want Conga."" Santos spearheaded protests in 2011 that turned violent and forced Newmont to shelve the project.

It said its quick count has a margin of error of three percentage points. Santos' candidate for regional vice president, Hilario Porfirio Medina, who will govern Cajamarca while Santos is behind bars, has pledged to maintain efforts to block the Conga project.Newmont said last year it would re-evaluate the future of the proposed mine in 2015 after Peru's nationwide local and regional elections, held on Sunday.Peru's electoral body is expected to announce final results later on Monday.Conga was expected to help offset dwindling gold output from Newmont's aging Yanacocha gold mine, also in Cajamarca. Denver-based Newmont holds a 51.35 percent in the Conga project, Buenaventura has 43.65 percent and the International Finance Corp [IFK.UL] holds 5 percent. The project's opponents, especially peasants who farm in Cajamarca's highlands, worry the mine will pollute and drain local water supplies.Newmont has said it would not work on the mine until water reservoirs for community use are built first.Anglo American Plc, Rio Tinto and Lumina Copper all operate exploration projects in Cajamarca, but have not been targeted by Santos or anti-Conga protesters.Financial markets appeared unphased by the partial vote count, with Newmont's share price up 1 percent at midday.

135,"   By Mitra Taj | LIMA  LIMA Oct 10 Newmont Mining Corp's  Peruvian unit said on Friday that it will keep pushing for local support for its stalled gold mine in the highland region of Cajamarca after a jailed opponent of the project was easily re-elected to lead the region.Newmont shelved the $5 billion proposed Conga mine in 2011 after a wave of protests spearheaded by Cajamarca's president, Gregorio Santos, who won a second four-year term in Sunday's regional election.The latest results of the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE) handed Santos with 44.21 percent of the vote with 98 percent of ballots counted, more than 20 points ahead of his nearest rival. An ONPE official said the remaining votes would be counted next week.""We express our interest in continuing to invest in Peru and especially the Cajamarca region,"" the company said in an open letter addressed to the people of Cajamarca.The Colorado-based miner said last year it would reevaluate its proposed $5 billion Conga mine after the election. Its local unit, Yanacocha, said it would work with all elected officials in Cajamarca. ""We renew our commitment to continue working to achieve social acceptance for the projects we maintain in the region,"" it said.Peruvian miner Buenaventura , as Newmont's junior partner in Yanacocha, owns 43.65 percent in Conga.Conga was initially expected to offset dwindling reserves from a nearby gold mine that the two companies have operated for more than two decades. Santos and his followers have resisted several efforts to secure local backing for Conga.""Yanacocha is running out"" of gold, said analyst Hector Collantes with Credicorp. ""And it has become increasingly difficult to see Conga replacing it.""Santos has spent the past three months in prison pending a corruption investigation. He has denied all wrongdoing. His political party depicted his imprisonment as a ruse to remove him from power in order to push Conga - a campaign strategy that several analysts said was successful.Hilario Porfirio Medina, Santos' incoming vice president, will likely govern for him while he remains behind bars.""It would be outrageous if the project was carried out,"" Medina told Reuters.

136,"  (Corrects paragraph 4 to show the company received shareholder approval for acquiring Newmont's stake, not for hedging output)Oct 15 Mexican miner Fresnillo Plc  reported a small drop in quarterly silver production and said it could hedge a part of its gold output to protect its recent investment in the Herradura corridor in northern Mexico.Shares in the miner fell as much as 3.4 percent on Wednesday morning, making the stock one of the top percentage losers on the FTSE 100 index.An increasing numbers of precious metals miners, battered by last year's steep drop in prices, are selling planned output forward to better control their cash flow.Fresnillo, which bought out its joint venture partner Newmont Mining Corp in their gold mining joint venture Penmont last month, said following shareholder approval for the deal, it planned to hedge up to 44 percent of the output from the project. ""This is going to be discretionary to the management ... This is going to be done very slowly. So we are not going to immediately hedge all the production,"" Gabriela Mayor, head of investor relations, said on a media call.The company would inform the market about the quantum and the price at which the production is sold forward as and when the contracts are made, she said.Gold fell 28 percent and silver plunged 36 percent in 2013. Fresnillo, which currently makes the bulk of its profits from silver mining, expects gold will represent about half of its earnings by 2018 as a result of the Newmont deal.Attributable silver production for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to 11.08 million ounces from 11.11 million ounces a year earlier. The miner also reiterated its full-year forecast of 43 million silver ounces and said it was on track to start production from the Saucito II mine by the end of this year.The company warned at the time of the deal that its 2014 gold production would be lower by about 4-8 percent due to technical issues at a processing plant at Penmont's Herradura mine.Fresnillo said on Wednesday that it expected consolidated attributable gold production of 590,000 ounces in 2014.Shares in the company were down 3 percent at 766.5 pence at 0814 GMT.

137,"  Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) reported lower third-quarter earnings on Thursday but the largest U.S.-based gold miner beat market expectations and also reduced its forecast for gold production costs this year.Newmont said it now expected 2014 all-in sustaining costs for producing an ounce of gold to be $1,020 to $1,080. In late September, Newmont forecast its all-in sustaining costs, the gold industry cost benchmark, for this year at $1,050 to $1,120 an ounce.""For 2014, we expect costs at the low end of our cost guidance and we remain on track to meet our production outlook,""  Gary Goldberg, Newmont's President and Chief Executive Officer said in a statement.Its Sept. 23 outlook forecast 2014 production of 4.7 million to 5 million ounces of gold and 80,000 to 90,000 tonnes of copper.With the gold price down a third in three years, Newmont and other miners have been cutting costs to boost profitability. Production at some big gold miners is falling as they sell off high-cost operations.  Newmont, which has mines in North and South America, Africa, and Asia, said attributable net income from continuing operations was $210 million, or 42 cents a share, in the three months ended in September, down from $419 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.Net income, adjusted for items including asset sales and staff reductions, was $249 million, or 50 cents per basic share. That was higher than the $217 million, or 44 cents per basic share, a year earlier and well ahead of the 16 cents a share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.In the third quarter, Newmont produced 1.15 million ounces of gold, down from 1.28 million ounces in the same period of 2013. It produced 13,700 tonnes of copper versus 19,200 tonnes in the year-prior period. The company said its all-sustaining costs for producing an ounce of gold were $995 an ounce in the quarter, down from $1,018 per ounce in the same quarter of 2013. But copper costs jumped to $6.61 a pound from $3.24 a year earlier due to costs associated with the ramp down and ramp up of operations in Indonesia. Newmont resumed copper concentrate shipments from Indonesia in late September, ending a nine-month suspension from its Batu Hijau mine after the government imposed hefty export taxes that the company said violated its mining contract. Production was halted in June but has since restarted. The price Newmont received for its gold dropped to $1,270 an ounce from $1,322 an ounce in the third quarter last year.

It is also trying to sell the Porgera gold mine in neighbouring Papua New Guinea.Barrick had about $13 billion in debt at the end of 2014.Barrick and Denver-based Newmont have long been 50-50 partners in the Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines (KCGM), which operates the Super Pit, at one stage Australia's biggest gold mine.The companies had agreed that due to Barrick's reduced presence in Australia, Newmont would ""provide greater direction and support to operation of the mine"", KCGM acting general manager Ian Butler said in comments emailed to Reuters. The ownership structure of the operation would not change, Butler said.Australian gold mines are changing hands at a fast clip at a turning point in the gold cycle, according to analysts and mining executives. After years of losing money or just breaking even, many are back in the black thanks in part to a weakening Australian dollar.Evolution Mining is looking to buy more gold mines after reaching a $230 million deal to acquire two locally producing mines from Luxembourg-based La Mancha Group International BV.

165,"   By James Regan | SYDNEY  SYDNEY May 26 Gold miners are spearheading a wave of merger and acquisition activity in Australia, riding a rebound in local gold prices to pounce on projects promising quick growth.In the first signs of life since the country's mining boom went bust three years ago, companies are buying assets from international rivals tightening their belts, and partnering with fellow Australian miners.""Everyone is looking for assets that enable them to grow. We've seen more M&A in Australia in 2015 than in the past five years,"" Ian Murray, chairman of Perth-based Gold Road Resources Ltd told Reuters, referring broadly to the level of interest in the sector.Progressive central bank interest rate cuts aimed at knocking down the Australian dollar and falling labour and mining costs are adding fuel to the frenzy.Gold output in the world's second-biggest producing country after China reached a decade high last year and is tipped to rise further in 2015.Evolution Mining, snapped up Barrick Gold's  Cowal mine on Monday for $550 million, giving it a large low-cost mine and putting it ahead of Northern Star Resources to be the no. 2 Australia-listed gold miner.A bidding war for the mine attracted 17 different parties, two sources familiar with the process said.U.S-dollar gold prices are down 37 percent since a late 2011 peak, but Australian dollar gold hit a two-year high in February and is still up 10 percent since early October. ""The confluence of big overseas miners looking to repatriate to their home bases and strong indicators such as a weaker Aussie dollar is driving the market further into M&A activity,"" said Gavin Wendt, an analyst with MineLife consultants.""Add in cheap labor post the boom and a vibrant mid-tier gold sector and it's not hard to see why things are accelerating.""Northern Star remains in a position to make ""value accretive acquisitions"" after buying four mines from Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp, according to Chief Executive Bill Beament. DEALS PICK UP Over the lean years, when a strong local currency and high costs trimmed margins, miners skimped on exploration, leaving sparse opportunity to grow organically.So far this year there have been some 26 announced deals in gold mining worth more than $1.7 billion, compared with about $2.2 billion over the previous two years, according to Reuters data.Newcrest Mining Ltd's half-million-ounces-per-year Telfer mine could also go on the block this year, after managing director Sandeep Biswas said in February it was time to time to consider ""alternative ownership options"". Evolution tipped it was looking for more mines after paying $230 million in April to acquire two lodes from Luxembourg-based La Mancha Group International BV, which will contribute A$112 million  ($88 million) to the Cowal deal.""The lens we are looking through at every opportunity that comes across our desk is whether it will improve the quality of our portfolio,"" Evolution Executive Chairman Jake Klein told Reuters.Evolution will also pay A$9 million for 19.9 percent of Phoenix Gold, which is accelerating exploration in the Western Australia Goldfields district, where the majority of Australia's 284 tonnes of gold was mined last year.""Assets are being sold at a low point in the cycle and if you position yourself to accumulate them, you are going to do very well,"" Klein said.Still, warns Northern Star's Beament, as more more buyers show their hands, M&A costs can only go up.""We are in the business of generating superior shareholder returns. Paying some of the premiums being asked for gold assets in today's market is not consistent with that objective,"" he said.($1 = 1.2789 Australian dollars)   (Editing by Richard Pullin)",2015-05-26,NEM,"Mon May 25, 2015 | 10:08pm EDT",Australia's gold miners drive M&A revival,http://www.reuters.com//article/gold-australia-ma-idUSL3N0Y63UV20150526?type=companyNews

168,"   By Susan Taylor | TORONTO  TORONTO Bigger isn't better for the world's gold miners, who are increasingly making ""bite-sized"" developments that carry less risk of budget disasters and fewer of the political and environmental disputes that have derailed mega-mines in recent years.Newmont Mining (NEM.N) is a prime example of how companies are responding to bleak industry conditions by building mines on a smaller scale than in the past, with the price of gold down almost 40 percent from its peak in 2011 and banks avoiding the sector.The cautious approach will likely persist even if conditions improve, with miners increasingly teaming up on big, complex projects to share costs, expertise and risk, senior mining executives and industry watchers said.""If there's going to be something go wrong, you'd rather it go wrong after you've spent $1 billion than $3 billion or $4 billion,"" said Goldcorp Inc (G.TO) Chief Executive Chuck Jeannes. Goldcorp, the world's most valuable gold miner by market capitalization, owns stakes in a number of joint-ventured assets such as the Alumbrera gold mine in Argentina and the Pueblo Viejo gold mine in the Dominican Republic.The price of gold has fallen as concerns about inflation receded and the U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies. Gold is often used as a hedge against inflation, as prices typically rise when the dollar weakens. Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), the world's largest bullion producer, could be the poster child for problem-plagued mega-mines.Its Pascua Lama project in the Andes was mothballed in 2013, bogged down by environmental issues, labor unrest, political opposition and development costs that ballooned to $8.5 billion.""A phased approach to developing large, complex capital projects makes a lot of sense,"" said Barrick spokesman Andy Lloyd. “There is potential to mitigate development risks, reduce upfront capital requirements and expedite initial cash flows from the project, which could be used to fund future expansions.""  Barrick has no new mine plans currently, as it sells assets to trim a $13 billion debt.Last week, it announced a strategic tie-up with Zijin Mining (601899.SS), selling a stake in its Papua New Guinea mine as a first collaborative step with the Chinese miner. Newmont Mining, the world's No. 2 gold producer, decided to start small with its recently-announced Long Canyon project in Nevada. The first phase is a $250 million to $350 million development funded with cash flows and available cash, using existing staff. Payback is projected in just over four years.Rather than building all the infrastructure for future phases up front, this approach makes each successive phase carry and provide its own return-on-investment, said Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg.""From an investor standpoint, it's a good thing because it minimizes the risk involved,"" he said.SWEET SPOT  Yamana Gold (YRI.TO) is building Cerro Moro in Argentina for $265 million over two and a half years. It will be Yamana's smallest operation on a throughput basis, or the volume of ore processed each day. ""It's a sweet spot in terms of manageable capital expenditures over an extended period of time,"" said CEO Peter Marrone.Last year, the average annual projected gold output from projects that just went into construction and entered production was 15 percent lower than five years earlier, according to SNL Financial data.Last year there were also more small mining debt and equity issues, correlating to the size of mines being built.The average issue in 2014 was $128.1 million, Thomson Reuters data shows, while the average for the preceding seven years only fell below $160 million one other time. The ""easy stuff"" has already been discovered, said Sterne Agee analyst Michael Dudas, so some of the most interesting prospects are in areas with different rules and regulations.""That makes it a lot more difficult to get the confidence level from the board and investors to take big swings,"" he said. ""I do think the industry will be a lot more collaborative as we move forward, because investors want risk-adjusted returns that require some thought and some rigor.""To be sure, not all mines can be built in phases and bigger projects will find fresh appeal when gold rebounds from the current $1,175 an ounce.""The market is short-term focused,"" said Jeannes at Goldcorp. ""If the gold price were $1,800 an ounce and the equity markets were wide open . . . our investors would be questioning us if we weren't going for the full, large, build-out.""But miners have learned from the past five years, said Joseph Foster, portfolio manager at Van Eck, Barrick's biggest shareholder.""I don't think we'll see the capital cost blowouts and the margin squeezes going forward that we have in the past,"" Foster said. ""They've learned a very hard lesson and I don't think they'll forget it.""

169,"   By Nicole Mordant  Newmont Mining Corp has agreed to buy the Cripple Creek & Victor gold mine in Colorado from AngloGold Ashanti Ltd for $820 million, giving the world's No. 2 gold producer an expanding asset in a mining-friendly jurisdiction.The acquisition is an opportunity for Colorado-based Newmont to improve its mine life and costs at a time when the mining industry has been in a slump for nearly four years. For South African-based AngloGold, the world's third-biggest gold producer, the cash from the sale will help reduce its $3.1 billion debt pile and lower financing costs.""This deal significantly de-risks the balance sheet without diluting our shareholders, and places us in a much stronger position,"" Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, AngloGold's Chief Executive said in a statement.In addition to the cash payment, AngloGold will also receive a net smelter royalty on future underground production at the mine. Newmont will issue 29 million shares in a public offering to help fund the purchase.Reuters reported last week that Newmont was in exclusive talks with AngloGold on the acquisition, citing two sources familiar with the matter.""Consistent with what we've achieved elsewhere, we believe we can lower direct mining costs by up to 10 percent through improved productivity and optimization,"" Gary Goldberg, Newmont's CEO said in a statement. An expansion of Cripple Creek is around two-thirds complete with the mine expected to produce between 350,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold a year in 2016 and 2017 at all-in sustaining costs of between $825 and $875 an ounce, Newmont said.The sale means AngloGold will no longer have to fund the remaining capital of about $200 million required to finish Cripple Creek's expansion. Newmont said it planned to keep Cripple Creek's workforce. Large gold producers globally, including world No. 1 Barrick Gold Corp, are selling non-core assets as they try to reduce debt and slim down operations amid weaker gold prices.Other players that had been vying for the Cripple Creek asset were Canadian gold miners IAMGOLD Corp, Kinross Gold Corp, Goldcorp Inc and Yamana Gold Inc.Citi was lead financial adviser to Newmont on the transaction.

Newmont, which mines about 5 million ounces of gold a year compared with about 300,000 ounces for Regis, said in a statement it has sold nearly $1.9 billion in non-core assets since mid-2013. ""This sale further strengthens Newmont's balance sheet and enhances our focus on our core business,"" said Randy Engel, Newmont Executive Vice President for Strategic Development. Local media reported Credit Suisse was handling the deal, struck at a A$2.51, a 4.2 percent discount to Regis' closing price on Thursday.

The deal will be announced this week, he said.He added that Indonesian President Joko Widodo approves of the deal to buy the stake in the local Newmont unit, Newmont Nusa Tenggara, as it is ""in (the) national interest"". The purchase follows a pattern of Indonesia asserting more domestic control over existing and planned projects in its resource sector. Indonesia has decreed that foreign-owned mining companies should halt mineral exports in favour of building sites to produce and export higher-value refined metals.Panigoro did not mention if the purchase will be through Medco, but the company's shares surged as much as 17 percent on Tuesday to the highest since August last year.More than 27 million Medco shares were traded, 4.7 times the average full-day volume over the past 30 days.

Panigoro declined on Tuesday to disclose the size of the deal, but said it is aimed at business diversification.However, a source with knowledge of the matter said the deal is valued around $2 billion. The transaction will involve debt and equity, said the source who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.Newmont Nusa Tenggara operates the open pit Batu Hijau mine, the second-biggest copper mine in Indonesia. Its stakeholders include New York-listed Newmont Mining, Japan's Sumitomo Corp and Jakarta-listed Bumi Resources Minerals, controlled by the family-owned conglomerate Bakrie Group.There has been some nationalist sentiment behind the government's orders to foreign mining companies to divest some shares, said Paul Rowland, a Jakarta-based political analyst at Reformasi Weekly. Newmont had clashed with the Indonesian government in 2014 over implementation of its rules on mineral processing. Newmont also has an obligation to divest a 7 percent stake to the government.However, the purchase could also make economic sense as copper prices may have hit their low point.""I think the timing of the deal is right because valuations are more attractive. If Panigoro buys the asset when copper prices are bottoming out, then he can enjoy the upside, said Isnaputra Iskandar, Indonesia research head at broker Maybank Kim Eng Securities.When asked to respond to Panigoro's comments, Newmont's Indonesia unit referred to an emailed statement that it issued on Friday, saying Newmont and Sumitomo were in discussions with ""certain interested parties"", but ""none has secured fully committed financing or final deal terms"" at this time.A spokesman for Sumitomo Corp declined to comment, while Bumi Resources Minerals did not give an immediate comment.

NVL (USA) Limited, a unit of Newmont, filed an ""intervention lawsuit"" with the South Jakarta District Court, according to court documents dated May 2 seen by Reuters.The suit asks the court to deny Indonesian businessman Gustaaf Merukh's request, made earlier this year, to freeze the 17.8 percent stake that local company PT Pukuafu Indah holds in Newmont's PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (NNT), which operates the country's second-biggest copper and gold mine.Merukh, who owns a 6 percent stake in Pukuafu, is suing the other Pukuafu shareholders, including his own relatives, as he claimed that these shareholders had faked his consent to use the NNT stake as collateral to get a $600 million loan from Newmont in 2012. Two independent lawyers told Reuters said that the legal battle surrounding Pukuafu could hamper the effort of another Indonesian group, which includes Panigoro, to buy control of NNT.Merukh told Reuters by phone last month that he had been excluded from talks between Panigoro's group and Pukuafu's shareholders over its Newmont stake.

It will buy the remaining 26.2 percent from local companies.Newmont will get $920 million when the deal closes and $403 million triggered by higher copper prices and mine developments. Sumitomo will receive 36 billion yen ($350 million) at closing and an additional 21 billion yen if conditions are met.The deal is expected to be finalised in the third quarter.Newmont, the world's second-biggest gold miner by market value, said the transaction will help it reduce risk and debt, while funding projects that it forecasts will add up to 1 million ounces of gold production in the next two years. ""After deal close, about three-quarters of our production and reserves will be located in the United States and Australia,"" CEO Gary Goldberg said on a conference call.RBC analyst Stephen Walker said the sale is positive for Newmont partly due to its future capital commitments.Multi Daerah Bersaing, owned by Indonesia's Bumi Resources Minerals and local governments, holds 24 percent of NNT. Pukuafu Indah holds 17.8 percent and Indonesia Masbaga Investama owns 2.2 percent.Multi Daerah Bersaing has signed a conditional agreement to sell its entire stake. Panigoro, who founded oil and gas firm Medco Energi, has said his group has President Joko Widodo's blessing to buy NNT as it is in the ""national interest"".Energy Minister Sudirman Said told reporters on Friday that the NNT deal is a business-to-business transaction, but it is ""a good development especially because the one taking over is a national company.""The NNT acquisition is supported by state-controlled lenders Bank Mandiri, Bank Negara Indonesia and Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Medco said. However, the Indonesian group's ambition to fully own NNT may be hampered by a lawsuit surrounding Pukuafu. Earlier this year, Indonesian businessman Gustaaf Merukh asked a Jakarta court to freeze Pukuafu's 17.8 percent stake.Newmont shares rose 3.8 percent after the deal was announced. In early Friday trade, Medco surged 20 percent, Bumi Resources Minerals jumped 8 percent and Sumitomo gained 0.7 percent.($1 = 102.88 yen) (Reporting by Eveline Danubrata in JAKARTA and Susan Taylor in TORONTO; Additional reporting by Wilda Asmarini, Fransiska Nangoy and Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Jane Merriman and Bill Trott)",2016-07-01,NEM,"Fri Jul 1, 2016 | 4:59am EDT",UPDATE 5-Indonesian group to buy 82.2 pct of copper-gold miner for $2.6 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/medco-energi-newmont-mining-deals-idUSL4N19M48A?type=companyNews

Newmont, which also mines copper, said adjusted income rose to $231 million, or 44 cents a share, in the quarter ended June as gold output rose and costs fell. That compared with $131 million, or 26 cents a share, in the same period a year ago and was well ahead of analysts' expectations, on average, of 29 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Newmont's stock rose to $40.20 after hours from a $39.29 close. The miner's stock has risen 130 percent since January helped by a 24 percent gold price jump. ""It looks like solid results from the company. It's a deep beat relative to our numbers and the street,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Kaip said. Newmont, which has mines in the Americas, Africa, Australia and Asia lowered its forecast for gold all-in sustaining costs - the industry benchmark - to between $870 and $930 an ounce in 2016. Its previous range was $880 to $940 an ounce. It left unchanged its 2017 forecast at between $850 and $950 an ounce. The company also gave new forecasts for gold and copper production excluding its 48.5 percent stake in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia, which it is selling for up to $1.32 billion. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter.Newmont expects attributable gold production of between 4.7 million and 5.0 million ounces in 2016 and rising to between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces in 2017. Production is expected to remain stable at 4.5 million to 5.0 million ounces through 2020.  However, it slashed its copper production forecast to between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes in 2016 from 120,000-160,000 tonnes due to the exclusion of Batu Hijau. Copper costs will also rise for the same reason.In the second quarter, attributable gold production rose to 1.3 million ounces from 1.2 million a year ago while all-in sustaining costs improved to $876 an ounce from $909. Copper output, however, dropped to 38,000 tonnes from 42,000 tonnes.Newmont kept its quarterly dividend unchanged at 2.5 cents.

233,"   By Wilda Asmarini and Eveline Danubrata | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Indonesian oil and gas producer PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk plans to invest $500 million to build a copper smelter following its deal to buy control of Newmont Nusa Tenggara (NNT), its president commissioner told Reuters. The purchase of a majority stake in NNT, which runs Indonesia's second-biggest copper and gold mine, will help Medco to offset the volatility of oil and gas prices, Muhammad Lutfi said in an interview on Friday. Oil prices have tumbled by more than half since mid-2014 due to oversupply, although they have now nearly doubled from lows hit in January to trade around $51 a barrel. And while copper prices have also fallen around 30 percent over the last two years because of slowing demand from top consumer China, Lutfi said Medco is mainly targeting Indonesia's domestic automotive, electronics and cable industries with the NNT and smelter output. ""This asset can be a game-changer for us,"" said Lutfi, a former Indonesian trade minister. ""For us, it's about diversification,"" he said, adding that copper and gold may contribute 30-50 percent to Medco's revenue in future.Automobile sales in Southeast Asia's largest car market rose 12.5 percent in July from a year earlier, according to industry data released this week, amid a broad-based consumer demand recovery.     ""Many car factories in Indonesia have been increasing their production capacity,"" Lutfi said, and in the long run he sees Indonesia growing as an exporter of both auto components and fully-built vehicles. Part of the funds to build the NNT-fed copper smelter - which would turn out refined metal that could eventually be used for car parts and cables - with an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes will come from bank loans, with Medco aiming to start operations in 2021, Lutfi said.A consortium consisting of oil and gas tycoon Arifin Panigoro, who founded Medco, and banker Agus Projosasmito announced in late June that it will spend $2.6 billion to buy 82.2 percent of NNT.  The Indonesian group is buying 56 percent of NNT from U.S. miner Newmont Mining Corp and Japan's Sumitomo Corp and its partners. It will buy the remaining 26.2 percent from local companies. Jakarta-listed Medco will own at least 50 percent of NNT, while Projosasmito's vehicle, AP Investment, will hold the remaining stake, Lutfi said. Medco shares have doubled so far this year, driven by market speculation about the acquisition.Three state-controlled banks will lend $750 million to the group for the purchase and the remaining funds will come from equity and loans from other financial institutions.     Medco is targeting a 25 percent increase in copper concentrate production at the Newmont mine to 500,000 tonnes by 2019, Lutfi said. Oil and gas will nevertheless remain a core business for Medco, which is currently exploring the acquisition of offshore oil and gas blocks in Indonesia, he said. ""Newmont will be part of Medco Energi, but we are still an oil and gas company,"" Lutfi said.

236,"   By Nicole Mordant | COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. Newmont Mining Corp's sale of its stake in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia may not close until the fourth quarter of the year, Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said on Monday, adding that the approvals process was complex.Newmont agreed on June 30 to sell its 48.5 percent economic interest in its Indonesia operations to a local investor group for up to $1.3 billion. The Denver-based miner said at the time it expected the deal to close in the third quarter. The possible delay comes after some analysts raised concerns after the deal was announced that closing conditions, including requirements for a valid export license for the mine, posed risks to the transaction.""It could be into the early part of the fourth quarter. It is just complex going through all the different elements of approvals,"" Goldberg said in an interview on the sidelines of the Denver Gold Forum in Colorado Springs.""There can always be things that come up because we don't control it all. But right now I see a higher likelihood of success... as we work through those things,"" he said.  The buyer, PT Amman Mineral Internasional, is still motivated to purchase the asset, the Indonesian government is supportive and Newmont has worked through terms of the transition with its employees at the mine, said Goldberg, who was in Indonesia a week ago.  He did not detail what approvals were still required. STILL KEEN ON KALGOORLIE  Turning to acquisitions, Goldberg said Newmont was still keen to acquire the 50 percent of the Kalgoorlie gold mine in Australia that it did not already own. Newmont said a year ago it was interested in owning all of the mine.Barrick Gold, which owns the other 50 percent, said on July 27 that the time was right to sell its half of the  mine, a stake analysts estimate is worth around $1 billion. ""We respect Barrick wants to go through a process. We will work through that process with them and see if we can be successful,"" Goldberg said. The sale should attract a string of suitors but Newmont, which manages the mine, may have an advantage over other bidders in the sale process, analysts have said.""We understand the asset well. We certainly are in a good position to be able to determine what at least we believe it is worth,"" Goldberg said.Since Newmont took over managing the mine a little over a year ago, production had increased by about 20 percent and costs declined by about 30 percent, he said. Previously, mine management needed approvals for decisions from both Barrick and Newmont.

240,"   By John Tilak and Nicole Mordant | TORONTO/VANCOUVER  TORONTO/VANCOUVER China's Zijin Mining Group Co Ltd and Shandong Gold Mining Co Ltd have held separate talks with Barrick Gold Corp to buy a 50 percent stake in its Veladero gold mine in Argentina, according to four sources with knowledge of the process.Veladero is one of Barrick's five core mines, which are all in the Americas. It is expected to produce between 580,000 and 640,000 ounces of gold this year. The high quality of the mine, production capacity and the prospect for geographical diversification have appealed to the state-owned Chinese suitors, said three of the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is private. All of the persons spoke over the past week.Barrick, the world's biggest gold miner, has not launched a formal sales process for Veladero, and there is no certainty that the talks will result in a transaction, the sources said. A potential sale of a 50 percent stake could fetch Barrick   more than $1 billion, two of the sources said. Barrick, Shandong and Zijin declined to comment. Barrick's shares, up about 2.6 percent on higher gold prices, extended their gains after the Reuters report. They climbed as much as 6.7 percent, hitting their highest level in more than 3 weeks. The stock traded 3.3 percent higher, at C$22.82, on Tuesday afternoon in Toronto.  Last month, operations at Veladero were shut down for more than two weeks after a cyanide spill at the high-altitude mine. This was the second cyanide spill at the mine in a year.The deal would be the latest instance of Chinese companies investing in Latin America's resource-rich commodities sector, partly to help feed domestic demand. Chinese investors have poured billions into Latin American acquisitions in recent years, buying into copper and iron ore miners, oil and gas concessions and power grids. Barrick would like the buyer of the Veladero stake also to make an investment in its Pascua-Lama project in South America, two of the sources said. The gold and silver project, which straddles the border of Argentina and Chile in the Andes Mountains, was put on hold in 2013 due to environmental issues, political opposition, labor unrest and development costs that ballooned to $8.5 billion.    The Canadian company wants help developing the mineral-rich area it controls, known as the El Indio belt, a 140-kilometer stretch of land home to Veladero and Pascua-Lama. Alturas, another large discovery owned by Barrick, is also on the El Indio belt. Barrick and Zijin, one of China's biggest gold producers, have been at the table before.Last year, the two formed a strategic partnership, with Barrick selling a stake in its Papua New Guinean mine to the Chinese company. Zijin officials have visited Pascua-Lama several times, according to local media reports in 2014.    Barrick is in the midst of trimming noncore assets to reduce debt. It has a public process under way in Australia to sell its stake in Kalgoorlie, an Australian gold mining joint venture with Newmont Mining Corp.Last December, Barrick completed the sale of a 50 percent stake in another South American operation, the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile, to copper miner Antofagasta Plc for $1 billion.

247,"   By Susan Taylor | TORONTO  TORONTO Oct 27 Barrick Gold Corp will consider offers to buy all or some of its five major mines, including Veladero in Argentina, a top executive said on Thursday, after Reuters reported the company held talks with Chinese miners.China's Zijin Mining Group and Shandong Gold Mining have had separate discussions with Barrick about buying a 50 percent stake in Veladero, according to four sources with knowledge of the process.""We've never said that we would not sell a core mine or part of a core mine,"" Barrick President Kelvin Dushnisky said on a conference call.The entire El Indio belt, which includes Veladero, is ""a great opportunity for us to look at potential partnerships for future development,"" he said.
