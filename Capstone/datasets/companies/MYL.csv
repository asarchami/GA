0,"   By Nadia Damouni, Jessica Toonkel and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Drugmakers Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Actavis Plc ACT.N and Mylan Inc (MYL.O) have all expressed interest in buying Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) branded generics business, but no active discussions are going on at this time, according to three people close to the matter.The ""established products"" unit, which makes off-patent drugs, had global sales of $7 billion in the first nine months of 2013, accounting for 18 percent of Pfizer's revenue. Pfizer said in July it planned to separate its commercial operations into three units -- two mainly for patent-protected brands and the third for generics.According to the people close to the matter, Pfizer is aware of each of the companies' interest but is not yet ready to entertain a deal as it prepares the groundwork for a potential separation of the generics business. It has said the review could take three years.Pfizer, Valeant, Actavis and Mylan all declined to comment. All the sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media.A deal for the business -- which houses medicines that have lost market exclusivity, as well as mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 -- could catapult a buyer like Valeant into the ranks of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, but several hurdles remain.The Pfizer generics business is far bigger than the three pharmaceutical companies. Valeant had $3.7 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2013, while Mylan and Actavis posted revenues of $5.10 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively.Structuring a deal would also be a challenge because a sale could incur heavy taxes for Pfizer. One way to reduce the tax bill would be to use a structure known as a Reverse Morris Trust, according to the people close to the matter.In that structure, a company spins off a unit that it wants to divest and that unit merges with a smaller company, with the smaller company running the combined entity. Overall, the transaction allows a parent company to sell a subsidiary in a tax-free manner. It is not clear whether Pfizer would entertain such a deal structure.Another challenge for potential buyers is the lack of historical financial information for the generics business, as Pfizer's efforts to split its commercial operations is a work in progress.Still, such a deal could be attractive, as it could immediately boost the buyer's earnings and increase its presence outside of North America, most importantly in emerging markets where many companies need to expand. Valeant has kept no secret of its desire to grow through acquisitions. Its chief executive officer, Michael Pearson, said this month that the company wants to become one of the world's top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions.Pearson also said that Valeant, which bought contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings Inc for $8.7 billion in August, is looking at a merger of equals as well as smaller deals. He said it will look this year to pull off one acquisition of a similar size as its Bausch purchase.Valeant also held talks with Actavis about a potential combination last year, although those discussions did not lead to a deal, according to media reports at the time.Meanwhile, Actavis completed a $8.5 billion deal to buy Warner Chilcott Plc in October, months after rejecting a takeover offer from Mylan.(Reporting by Nadia Damouni, Jessica Toonkel and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-14,MYL,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 6:23am EST","Exclusive: Valeant, Actavis, Mylan eye Pfizer's generics unit",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-pfizer-valeant-idUSBREA0D0CZ20140114?type=companyNews

5,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Mylan Inc on Thursday sued Celgene Corp to stop the latter's effort to keep generic versions of two drugs that generate $4.5 billion of annual sales off the market.The lawsuit accuses Celgene of maintaining unlawful monopolies over Revlimid, which treats disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells; and Thalomid, which treats lesions associated with a variation of Hansen's Disease, or leprosy.Revlimid is a branded version of lenalidomide, and is a derivative of thalidomide, a drug introduced in the 1950s for which Thalomid is a branded version. Mylan said both drugs can cost more than $100,000 for a year's supply.In its lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, Mylan accused Celgene of using federal limits on the distribution of Revlimid and Thalomid, which were designed to promote the drugs' safety, as a pretext to keep generic drug makers from obtaining their own samples. Mylan said this prevents generic drug makers from conducting ""bioequivalence"" tests required by U.S. regulators before generic drugs can be launched.""The effect of Celgene's conduct is that no generic manufacturer, including Mylan, has been able to bring generic versions of Thalomid and/or Revlimid to market,"" Mylan said.

Celgene is based in Summit, New Jersey, and Mylan is based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.The lawsuit seeks to force Celgene to sell Mylan enough Revlimid and Thalomid at market prices to allow for bioequivalence testing. It also seeks compensation for Mylan's inability to sell generic versions of both, and triple damages. In a February 13 regulatory filing, Celgene said it sold $4.28 billion of Revlimid and $244.5 million of Thalomid in 2013, together accounting for nearly 70 percent of all revenue.Celgene also said its exclusive U.S. rights, whether through patents or primary regulatory approvals, to Revlimid and Thalomid expire in 2027 and 2023, respectively.The case is Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc v.

9,"   By Sven Nordenstam and Mia Shanley | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Swedish generic drugmaker Meda AB rejected a takeover approach by U.S. rival Mylan Inc to create a combined company worth around $24 billion.The generic drugs sector has seen a wave of mergers recently as companies selling popular copycat versions of blockbuster medicines have been hit by a dwindling number of patent expirations and are looking to cut costs.Meda said on Friday it had been contacted about an indicative proposal to combine the two businesses but its board had decided to reject the proposal.""All continued discussions between Meda and Mylan have been terminated without further actions,"" it said in a statement.Shares in Meda closed up 14 percent at 110.6 Swedish crowns valuing the company at 33.4 billion Swedish crowns ($5.1 billion) while Mylan stock rose 4.2 percent to $51.94 by 1627 GMT valuing that firm at $19.3 billion.Media reports said Mylan was exploring a bid at a significant premium.""Given that this deal makes too much financial sense for both parties, we believe that there is an exceedingly high likelihood that it still will occur,"" analysts at Cowen said in a research note.Mylan, which had already said it wanted to make a big acquisition this year, said it was ""considering a wide range of possible opportunities"", but would not comment further.Meda, which makes specialty products, over-the-counter drugs and branded generics, has long been viewed as a takeover target in a rapidly consolidating generics drug sector where economies of scale are important. If any deal was pitched at a level similar to Actavis's bid for Forest Labs in February, it would imply a 25 percent premium to Meda's share price before the news, giving a $7.9 billion deal value, including Meda's $2.3 billion in debt.Buying Meda would boost Mylan's presence outside the United States and give it access to Meda's distribution channels in Europe and some emerging markets, where Meda has grown quickly in recent years.An acquisition would also boost Mylan's position in specialty pharmaceuticals where it focuses on respiratory and allergy medicines, which is a key area for Meda as well.Of Meda's $2 billion 2013 sales, more than 80 percent were outside the United States.Among potential buyers, Mylan was well placed to make a move, bankers and analysts said. It could also take advantage of lower corporate tax rates as the company's purchase would increase the percentage of revenues coming from overseas, allowing it to move its tax domicile outside of the U.S. Rivals Actavis and Valeant already lowered their tax rates with moves to Ireland. Moreover, bankers noted, Valeant recently bought Bausch & Lomb which it is busy integrating, whereas Actavis' $25 billion acquisition of Forest has not yet closed.A year ago India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd held talks to buy Meda for between $5 billion and $6 billion in a bid to boost its generics business in developed markets, sources with knowledge of the matter said at the time.Analysts in Mumbai said they doubted Sun would be interested in buying Meda now, since the talks last year foundered mainly on valuation and Meda's stock price has risen sharply since its $4 billion market valuation at the time.Both Meda and Mylan are valued at around 10 times 2014 forecast earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), including debt, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""Sun has not done any expensive acquisitions.

Meda, which makes specialty products, over-the-counter drugs and branded generics, has long been viewed as a takeover target in a rapidly consolidating generics drug sector where economies of scale are important.If any deal was pitched at a level similar to Actavis's  bid for Forest Labs in February, it would imply a 25 percent premium to Meda's share price before the news, giving a $7.9 billion deal value, including Meda's $2.3 billion in debt.Buying Meda would boost Mylan's presence outside the United States and give it access to Meda's distribution channels in Europe and some emerging markets, where Meda has grown quickly in recent years.An acquisition would also boost Mylan's position in specialty pharmaceuticals where it focuses on respiratory and allergy medicines, which is a key area for Meda as well.Of Meda's $2 billion 2013 sales, more than 80 percent were outside the United States. Among potential buyers, Mylan was well placed to make a move, bankers and analysts said. It could also take advantage of lower corporate tax rates as the company's purchase would increase the percentage of revenues coming from overseas, allowing it to move its tax domicile outside of the U.S.Rivals Actavis and Valeant already lowered their tax rates with moves to Ireland. Moreover, bankers noted, Valeant recently bought Bausch & Lomb which it is busy integrating, whereas Actavis' $25 billion acquisition of Forest has not yet closed.A year ago India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  held talks to buy Meda for between $5 billion and $6 billion in a bid to boost its generics business in developed markets, sources with knowledge of the matter said at the time.Analysts in Mumbai said they doubted Sun would be interested in buying Meda now, since the talks last year foundered mainly on valuation and Meda's stock price has risen sharply since its $4 billion market valuation at the time. Both Meda and Mylan are valued at around 10 times 2014 forecast earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), including debt, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Sun has not done any expensive acquisitions. It doesn't look like a valuation number that Sun Pharma is generally comfortable with,"" said Aditya Khemka of Ambit Capital.A Sun Pharma spokesman declined to comment.Meda's biggest owner is Stena Sessan Rederi AB, controlled by the Olsson business family, which owns 22.7 percent of shares meaning it could block any takeover attempt.The generic drugs sector has had a good run in the past decade by selling copycat versions of medicines but as times have got harder, growth and profit margins have come under pressure, with mergers seen as one way to improve efficiencies.Recent deals in the sector have led to savings of about 8 percent of sales, analysts estimate, and Mylan said in February it was open to looking at makers of branded drugs and deals outside of the United States to add to future earnings.The Pennsylvania-based firm, which last year bought Agila, a unit of India's Strides Arcolab Ltd for $1.6 billion, had appointed advisers to help it put together a deal for Meda, people familiar with the matter said.Chief Executive Heather Bresch told analysts in February the company planned a major transaction this year that would add to future earnings.($1 = 6.5481 Swedish crowns)   (Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler and Sophie Sassard in London, Zeba Siddiqui in Mumbai, and Caroline Humer and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by David Holmes and Elaine Hardcastle)",2014-04-04,MYL,"Fri Apr 4, 2014 | 1:18pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Swedish drugmaker Meda spurns Mylan takeover approach,http://www.reuters.com//article/meda-mylan-idUSL5N0MW15G20140404?type=companyNews

20,"   By Olivia Oran, Soyoung Kim and Nadia Damouni | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Allergan Inc approached Shire Plc in recent months about a possible takeover but was rebuffed, according to people familiar with the matter, in the latest example of a U.S. drugmaker seeking to buy an overseas rival to lower its tax rate.The preliminary approach for Shire, which is based in Ireland and has a market value of $33 billion, did not progress to serious discussions between the two companies, the sources said.Since then Allergan has received an unsolicited $47 billion takeover offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management.Analysts have suggested one way for the Botox maker to defend against the unsolicited bid would be to acquire foreign drugmakers such as Shire, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc or Alkermes Plc.One of the sources said it was unclear if Allergan would try to revive talks with Shire, or pursue another target as a means to remain independent. Representatives for Allergan and Shire declined to comment.In a process known as inversion, U.S. drugmakers are looking to relocate their headquarters to other countries with lower tax rates. These companies are eying potential targets that are based in Ireland in particular because of a low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, compared to 35 percent in the United States.Recent deals that have been driven by tax advantages include generic drugmaker Actavis Plc's $8.5 billion acquisition of Dublin-based Warner Chilcott and Perrigo Company Plc's $8.6 billion acquisition of Elan. Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc is also looking at acquisition targets that are based outside of the United States because of competitive pressures from rivals with a less burdensome tax structure, people familiar with the matter said.Valeant's offer for Allergan comes amid a flurry of healthcare deals this week including medical device company Zimmer Holdings Inc's $13.4 billion acquisition of rival Biomet; a $20 billion asset swap between Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals PLC; and Eli Lilly and Co's acquisition of Novartis' animal health business for $5.4 billion. Those deals have driven healthcare M&A volumes to $153.3 billion so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters has started tracking data. Pharmaceutical deals have accounted for 71 percent of overall healthcare deals.Valeant has been on a buying spree since 2010 and last year acquired contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings. Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in January the drugmaker wants to become one of the world's top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions.Pearson said on Tuesday Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott and the company's board had been unwilling to discuss a merger with Valeant. In a letter to Allergan, Valeant said it would have preferred to negotiate a deal in private.Allergan said in a statement on Tuesday that it has received the offer, and will carefully consider the proposal and ""pursue the course of action that it believes is in the best interests of the company's stockholders.""(Reporting by Olivia Oran, Soyoung Kim and Nadia Damouni in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-25,MYL,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 8:18pm EDT",Exclusive: Allergan approached Shire about takeover but rebuffed -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-shire-allergan-idUSBREA3N2JI20140425?type=companyNews
21,"  * Meda board says deal lacks support of biggest shareholder* Meda shares drop 7.9 pct after rising 10 pct on Friday* Approach comes against backdrop of healthcare M&A flurry   (Adds detail, background, shares, quotes)By Sven NordenstamSTOCKHOLM, April 28 Swedish drugmaker Meda  rejected an improved takeover offer from U.S. generics firm Mylan which one person familiar with the matter said valued Meda at around $9 billion including debt, driving its shares sharply back down.The new offer comes amid a flurry of deals in the industry as it restructures in the face of health spending cuts and cheap generic competition. U.S. firm Pfizer confirmed its interest in Britain's AstraZeneca on Monday in what would be one of the biggest pharma deals ever.American drugmakers are also eyeing potential takeover targets abroad as they look to relocate their headquarters to other countries with lower tax rates.Mylan's sweetened all-stock offer was worth 145 crowns per share, a person familiar with the matter said - which would represent a premium of about 50 percent over Meda's share price before news of the U.S. firm's original approach emerged earlier this month.However the Meda board said the firm's biggest shareholder did not back a deal. Its biggest investor by far is Stena Sessan Rederi AB - controlled by the Olsson business family - which owns a 22.7 stake and can block any takeover attempt.The board also said it was confident in Meda's future as an independent firm. Meda, which makes speciality products, over-the-counter drugs and branded generics, has long been viewed as a takeover target in the sector. It has returned to growth due to new allergy medicine Dymista and a strong contribution from emerging markets where it has invested to drive sales in recent years.Its sales grew by 4 percent last year on a like-for-like basis and adjusted for currency swings, up from zero growth the previous year. The company has forecast similar growth this year with improved profit margins.Meda shares were down 7.9 percent at 1324 GMT, giving up most of the gains they made on Friday when they rose 10 percent on news of the improved offer.The new offer followed a rejection by Meda's board earlier this month of a 130 crowns per share offer from Mylan, according to the source familiar with the matter.The latest approach would value Meda's outstanding shares at $6.7 billion. The drugmaker also had net debt of $2.3 billion at the end of last year. This would mean a multiple of about 14 times analysts' forecast for Meda's 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) on an enterprise value basis. Mylan trades at about 10 times forecast earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.THIRD TIME? The share price premium is also higher than the 30 percent Pfizer said it had proposed for AstraZeneca in January, and higher the roughly 25 percent premium generic drug maker Actavis  offered for Forest Labs in February. ""We believe Mylan may come back a third time,"" Pareto Securities said in a research note, adding that a bid between 135 and 145 crowns would have implied ""very decent pricing"".Pareto said the board's faith in Meda's growth prospects meant a buyer may have to look at 2015 projections to buy the firm now. ""We believe this would imply a share price of SEK 160,"" Pareto said.""We do also believe that the board has concluded that Mylan is the distressed entity and not Meda, as Meda is a potential target for many companies.""Meda reported sales of 13.1 billion crowns ($2.0 billion) last year and EBITDA of 3.7 billion crowns. Analysts on average expect earnings to grow by 10 percent in 2014, and by 14 percent in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.Apart from tax savings, Meda would boost Mylan's presence outside the United States and give it access to Meda's distribution channels in Europe and some emerging markets, where Meda has grown quickly in recent years.Rejecting Mylan's latest approach, the Meda board said in its statement: ""The board's decision is based on a strong belief in the continued potential of Meda as a stand-alone company and the assumption that a transaction cannot be completed as it lacks sufficient support from Meda's largest shareholder.""Meda's chairman Bert-Ake Eriksson, who is also the chief executive of Stena Sessan Rederi, declined to comment further as the letter Meda's board had received from Mylan was confidential. Mylan was not immediately available for comment.The second and third-biggest shareholders in Meda are Swedish pension funds groups Swedbank Robur and AMF Pension with 4.86 percent and 2.7 percent stakes respectively as of the end of December, according to Thomson Reuters data.Swedbank Robur did not immediately reply to a request for comment, while AMF Pension declined to comment.

27,"   By Anjuli Davies, Sophie Sassard and Olivia Oran | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK Allergan Inc (AGN.N), facing an unsolicited bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRTX.O), is preparing to approach Shire Plc (SHP.L) about a potential takeover, even though the Irish drugmaker rebuffed a previous overture, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.A bid by Allergan for Shire, which has a market value of $32 billion, would underscore how keen the U.S. dermatology drugmaker is to stay independent.Valeant teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman earlier this month to make an unsolicited $47 billion offer for Allergan. Valeant has expanded through a series of acquisitions over the past few years. But Allergan has been reluctant to sell to it in part because of Valeant's reputation for cutting costs and spending little on research and development.Allergan had held talks in recent months with Shire about a potential takeover, but those did not pan out, Reuters reported last week.  The sources said Allergan is still interested in a deal with Shire and is planning a fresh approach, with the Valeant bid now also in the background.Allergan could come back for a bid as soon as the next few days, one person added. The plan has yet to be finalized and could change, cautioned the sources, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. It is not clear if Shire would be open to entering into merger discussions.A representative of Allergan declined to comment, while Shire could not be immediately reached for comment. Valeant and Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square declined to comment.Allergan's shares closed down 1.3 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Shire's shares closed up 2.4 percent in London before the news of Allergan's renewed interest. A combination of Allergan and Shire would create a pharmaceutical giant with a combined market value of nearly $72 billion and annual sales of more than $11 billion.Analysts have suggested one way for the Botox maker to defend against the unsolicited bid would be to acquire foreign drugmakers such as Shire, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ.O) or Alkermes Plc (ALKS.O).A combination with Shire would help Allergan gain its top selling ADHD drug Vyvanse. It would also gain drugs for rare diseases like Elaprase for Hunter syndrome and Replagal for Fabry disease. Pharmaceutical companies are interested in developing or buying orphan drugs which affect a small patient population because there are fewer hurdles to regulatory approval, have lower marketing costs and can command high prices.Still, the Valeant bid could also complicate attempts by Allergan to find a white knight or buy someone else. As part of their strategy, Ackman bought a 9.7 percent stake in Allergan, becoming its largest shareholder.A transaction would add to a frenzy of deal-making currently going on in the healthcare sector, as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics.Deals totaling more than $153 billion have been struck so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters began tracking data. Pharmaceutical deals have accounted for 71 percent of overall healthcare deals. Buying Shire, which is based in Dublin, would also play to an increasingly popular trend that is driving M&A in healthcare and some other sectors these days: It could help lower Allergan's tax rate.In a process known as inversion, U.S. drugmakers seek to relocate their headquarters to other countries with lower tax rates. These companies are eying potential targets that are based in Ireland in particular because of a low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, compared to 35 percent in the United States.Bankers say the tax benefits of inversion are driving several other deals in healthcare and beyond. On Monday, for example, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said it had approached Britain's AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) (AZN.N) to reignite a potential $100 billion takeover, in what would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals. <ID: nL6N0NK194>That deal, if it were to happen, would also come with tax advantages. Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates, thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country.Generic drugmaker Mylan Inc (MYL.O) is also looking at acquisition targets that are based outside of the United States because of competitive pressures from rivals with a less burdensome tax structure, and it has made an unsuccessful bid for Swedish drugmaker Meda MEDAa.ST.(Reporting by Anjuli Davies and Sophie Sassard in London, Additional reporting by Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-04-29,MYL,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 8:19pm EDT",Exclusive: Allergan eyes new takeover bid for Shire - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-shire-allergan-exclusive-idUSBREA3R16Y20140429?type=companyNews

Its CEO David Pyott has said that he would be uncomfortable doing a deal where the tax benefit, and not strategy, was the principal driver. Mylan could not be immediately reached for comment.Now that Pfizer's plans are out in the open, pitching by bankers on inversion targets has reached a fever pitch. While tax arbitrage deals have so far largely been in the pharmaceutical sector, bankers and lawyers said U.S. technology, consumer and industrial companies are also now looking into the possibility of doing a tax inversion deal.One banker, who declined to be identified because he is actively advising companies on such deals, said the Pfizer plan ""will get people to try to move a lot quicker"" so that they can get a deal ""grandfathered in"" before any possible law change. WASHINGTON WORRIES Tax inversions allow U.S. companies, which face one of the highest tax rates in the world - a federal tax rate of 35 percent, and an overall rate that can be close to 40 percent including state and local taxes - to move to a lower-tax country by buying or creating a new holding company.Since 2008, about two dozen U.S. companies have used the strategy, versus about the same number over the previous 25 years, according to a Reuters review of transactions.Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and Britain lately have been the most common destinations of U.S. companies seeking new tax domiciles.

40,"  (Adds details of drugs to be divested, share price, other pharma deals)WASHINGTON, June 30 Generic drugmaker Actavis Plc has won U.S. approval to buy specialty pharmaceuticals company Forest Laboratories on condition it sell or relinquish the rights to four generic medicines, the Federal Trade Commission said on Monday.The deal was valued at about $25 billion when it was announced in February.The companies have agreed to relinquish their right to diltiazem hydrochloride extended release capsules, which are used to treat hypertension and some anginas. They also agreed to sell three medicines - ursodiol tablets used to treat cirrhosis of the liver, propranolol hydrochloride extended release capsules used to treat hypertension, and lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets used to prevent seizures. Shareholders of both companies have already approved the proposed transaction.Dublin-based Actavis, whose biggest competitors include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Mylan, has recently been acquiring specialty branded drug makers to boost profit margins and sales. Forest, which acquired privately held drugmaker Aptalis in January for $2.9 billion, faces a patent cliff on several of its biggest drugs, including Alzheimer's treatment Namenda. It recently won antitrust approval to buy Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc in a transaction worth about $1.46 billion.Actavis shares closed at $194.88, down 22 cents, and Forest Labs closed at $88.57, down 77 cents, in U.S. trading.

41,"   By Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan Inc is in advanced talks to acquire a multibillion-dollar portfolio of established products from Abbott Laboratories, people familiar with the matter said.The proposed transaction, which is in late-stage discussions, would see Mylan acquire a big chunk of Abbott's Europe-based mature drugs for several billion dollars, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public.The acquisition of the foreign assets, according to some of the people, could also allow the U.S. company to change its tax address to overseas, a practice known as inversion that has become popular among healthcare companies seeking to cut their tax bills and gain access to cash held offshore.The exact value of Mylan's bid could not be learned, but people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that Abbott was looking to sell a portfolio of mature drugs that could fetch more than $5 billion.    A deal could come as soon as next week, but the discussions are continuing and could still fall apart, the people cautioned.Abbott’s established pharmaceuticals division is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland and had 2013 sales of roughly $5 billion. About half of the sales come from emerging markets, and the remainder from other international markets.    Representatives for Mylan declined to comment, while Abbott did not respond to requests for comment. A potential deal with Abbott would come after Mylan's failed attempt to buy Swedish drugmaker Meda AB earlier this year. Meda in April rejected Mylan's revised $6.7 billion takeover bid, saying its biggest shareholder did not back a deal.Mylan was looking to do an inversion deal partly because it was at a disadvantage compared with foreign rivals as well as other U.S. generic drugmakers that have redomiciled to a low-tax country.Major competitors include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, which is based in Israel, and Actavis Plc, which re-domiciled to Ireland through a 2013 acquisition of Warner Chilcott. Both face lower tax rates. Tax inversions allow U.S. companies, which face one of the highest tax rates in the world - a federal tax rate of 35 percent, and an overall rate that can be close to 40 percent, including state and local taxes - to move to a lower-tax country by buying or creating a new holding company.The deal would add to a flurry of dealmaking in the healthcare sector, which more than tripled to $317.4 billion in the first half of 2014 from the same period last year. Reuters first reported in May that Abbott has tapped Morgan Stanley to find a buyer for the off-patent drugs so that it can free up resources to invest in high-growth areas.Other large pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Sanofi SA and Merck & Co Inc are also looking to shed older drugs, many of which have lost patent protection and face shrinking sales.Faced with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a major restructuring, with companies playing to their strengths by building up certain businesses and divesting others.

""We see Mylan creating a platform for potential future acquisitions with this deal,"" thanks to revenue from the Abbott products and a lowered tax rate of 20 to 21 percent in the first full year and high-teens later on, said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott.Mylan shares were up 2.7 percent at $51.55 on the Nasdaq in early afternoon, while Abbott shares were up almost 1 percent at $41.66 on the New York Stock Exchange. Abbott will transfer assets - now sold in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to a new publicly traded company in the Netherlands that will also include Mylan's existing businesses.Abbott will receive 105 million shares of the combined company, giving it an ownership stake of about 21 percent that is worth $5.3 billion based on Mylan's closing stock price on Friday.  Abbott will continue to sell its branded generics, however, in emerging markets, where strong sales growth is expected because of rising numbers of middle-class patients. By contrast, its sales of generics in developed markets have been steadily declining in recent years due to price pressures in Europe.Although the deal would hurt Abbott's 2015 earnings, the suburban Chicago company said it plans relatively quickly to sell its stake in the new company and use the proceeds to boost Abbott's earnings, such as by acquiring more medical devices or buying back its shares.""While we have a very positive view toward Mylan stock, we do not expect to be a long-term shareholder in Mylan,"" Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told investors in a conference call on Monday.

It comes less than seven weeks after the collapse of Pfizer Inc's $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc, also motivated in part by tax factors.Chicago-based AbbVie, which also wants to diversify its product lineup, increased the offer to 53.20 pounds per share on Sunday, following a request from Shire after it had rejected four previous bids.Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters had reported on Saturday that Shire had asked AbbVie to sweeten its offer to near 53 pounds per share in order for it to recommend the deal. Shire said the new bid comprised 24.44 pounds in cash and 0.8960 new AbbVie share for each Shire share, giving Shire investors about 25 percent ownership of the combined entity.""This deal makes a lot of sense for AbbVie as it would lower its tax rate from 22 percent to 13 percent, reduce dependence on Humira, broaden the (drug) pipeline, and provide some opportunities for operational synergies,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note.AbbVie gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016.BMO is estimating the combination would increase AbbVie's earnings per share by 9 percent in 2015 and 17 percent in 2016. AbbVie shares were down 1.4 percent at $54.19 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Shire was up 1.6 percent in London after earlier hitting an all-time high of 50.45 pounds.AbbVie would lower its corporate tax rate by moving its tax base to Britain, a tactic known as inversion. Analysts at Barclays estimated the move would provide an estimated $1.3 billion in tax savings by 2020.""Strategically, AbbVie acquires Shire's quality growth assets in platforms including rare diseases, neuroscience and ophthalmology, easing investor concerns about overreliance on Humira and offering future growth opportunities,"" Barclays said. FEW INVERSION TARGETS Analyst Alistair Campbell at banking group Berenberg said there were few other British drugmakers that would suit a tax inversion takeover because about 20 percent of shareholders post-deal must be shareholders in the target company.""You can't go for small companies,"" he said. ""Glaxo  is too big, Astra has had an approach from Pfizer and Shire has now gone.""Smith & Nephew Plc, Europe's largest maker of artificial joints, has been seen as a possible target. U.S.-based Stryker Corp has said it would not bid for the company after reports linking it with a deal circulated in May.Sweden's Meda AB rejected an improved takeover offer from U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan Inc in April, which could have helped reduce taxes.The approach for Shire has been far less controversial than the move for AstraZeneca. While headquartered in Dublin, Shire  is managed from Boston and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a relatively small business footprint in Britain.Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov had said he was happy for the company to be sold at the right price.

""Materials and studies on different topics are regularly presented to the investment committee, and it doesn't always take action or render decisions based on presented materials,"" he said in an emailed statement.    Reuters had reported in April that Sanofi was looking to sell a multi-billion portfolio of mature products, as drugmakers worldwide seek to shed non-core assets and focus on high-growth areas. The Phoenix project aims to minimize exposure to price cuts, reduce Sanofi's manufacturing in Europe and free up cash, according to the document. It would concern six manufacturing and distribution sites and some 2,600 staff in Europe, mainly in France, Spain, Italy and Germany.     The document shows that as of May, Sanofi had begun talks with Abbott, Mylan and private equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus as potential buyers or venture partners.    It adds that Pfizer (PFE.N), Otsuka (4768.T) and Teva (TEVA.TA) were not interested in the portfolio, while talks with AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and GSK (GSK.L) were still pending.     The CGT union said in a statement it planned to bring the document to the attention of the French government to denounce what it called Sanofi's ""capitalist Monopoly game"" and to protect local jobs.     ""It shows that management's strategy is to withdraw from Europe and particularly from France,"" the union said.    Drug companies are increasingly looking to shed smaller divisions they view as non-core so they can better focus on their mainstay products. They have also shown willingness to consider large asset swaps with rivals to exit weaker businesses and reinforce core areas where they are already top players.

47,"  (Adds CEO comments, details on formula sales, updates shares)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 16 Abbott Laboratories Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as demand for its recently-recalled infant formulas began to recover and profit margins improved for other business segments.Sales of nutritional products, the company's biggest product line which includes Similac infant formula and Ensure beverages for adults, rose 1.6 percent to $1.73 billion, following declines in previous quarters.""The business seems to be stabilizing,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. ""Customers are getting more comfortable now with the quality of Abbott's formulas, so we expect better growth in the second half of the year.""A recall of pediatric milk formula brands in China and Vietnam last August, due to fears an ingredient provided by an outside supplier might be contaminated, crimped sales of the products by $40 million in the second quarter. But that was less than the $75 million hit seen in the prior quarter. Abbott said it is quickly recapturing share in the affected markets, having just introduced several new products and by opening a new Similac manufacturing plant in China.""We're recovering as well as we could in that one-year time frame,"" Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told analysts on a conference call. ""We're getting back to the track we want to be on.""Abbott said it earned $466 million, or 30 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $476 million, or 30 cents, in the year-earlier period, when Abbott took charges for cost-saving initiatives and other expenses. Excluding special items, Abbott earned 54 cents per share, topping Wall Street expectations of 51 cents. The company said the outperformance was due to improved profit margins for its diagnostics and vascular products.Global company sales rose 1.9 percent to $5.55 billion, a bit above Wall Street estimates of $5.52 billion.Diagnostics posted the best showing in the quarter, growing 4.8 percent to $1.19 billion, with double digit sales growth in the United States. Sales of medical devices rose 1.2 percent to $1.37 billion. Abbott early last year spun off its branded patent-protected prescription drugs into a new publicly traded company, Abbvie Inc, but continued to sell generic medicines.Abbott generics have suffered declining sales over the past year and hurt overall company results. But the flat sales in the second quarter, of $1.22 billion, were a welcome contrast to the 6.6 percent slump seen in the prior quarter.In a move cheered by investors, Abbott on Monday said it would sell its generics business in developed markets outside the United States to Mylan Inc in a deal valued at $5.3 billion. But Abbott will continue to sell its generic brands in fast-growing emerging markets.The suburban Chicago-based company raised its full-year profit forecast to between $2.19 and $2.29 per share, from  $2.16 to $2.26 per share.Company shares slipped 0.3 percent at $41.04 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid modest declines for the drug sector.

U.S. District Judge Jarrod Hazel said in his order on Tuesday that Hospira was likely to win its suit because the FDA's decision was ""at odds with relevant authority"" and ""tantamount to a change of the rules.""The judge said that allowing such a change could cause people to lose faith in the process for approving drugs.

55,"  * Sells U.S. rights for blood clot drug to Mylan* Diluted headline EPS up 29 pct* Sales up 51 percent   (Adds drug rights sale)By Tiisetso MotsoenengJOHANNESBURG, Sept 10 Aspen Pharmacare  is to sell the rights to market a blood clot drug in the United States to rival Mylan Inc for up to $300 million, it said on Wednesday, a move that would help Africa's top generic drugmaker pay down debt.Mylan will pay an initial $225 million and the rest would be held by a third party until payment is due on meeting certain conditions. Aspen would retain all the rights to sell the thrombosis drug elsewhere in the world.The sale, prompted by Aspen's lack of sales representation in the United States, forms part of wider review of its portfolio to improve returns, Deputy Chief Executive Gus Attridge said. Shares in Aspen were up 4.3 percent at 336.92 rand by 1344 GMT, outpacing an almost 1 percent fall in the blue-chip JSE Top-40 index.Aspen, which also on Wednesday reported a rise in full-year profits which missed growth forecasts, acquired the drugs from GlaxoSmithKline last year as part of an aggressive push into overseas markets.Last year it spent around 20 billion rand on acquisitions including buying a Merck & Co. Inc plant in the Netherlands and a Nestle drugs and infant nutrition plant in Mexico. But the spending has increased its borrowings to around nearly 30 billion rand,  putting its net debt to EBITDA ratio at around 3.3 times -- above the company's stated target of less than three times.Attridge said the company's strong cash flow, as well as the sale of underperforming assets and marketing rights, would help push the debt-to-EBITDA multiple back down.Aspen reported an almost one-third rise to 10.16 rand in headline earnings per share in the year to end June, missing a consensus estimate of 10.71 rand in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts, as a weak home market weighed. Headline EPS, the most widely watched profit measure in South Africa, strips out certain one-off items.Sales jumped 51 percent to 31.4 billion rand ($2.87 billion) with sales from its South Africa business flat while acquisitions resulted in revenue more than tripling in Europe and Latin America.Domestic rival Adcock Ingram posted a hefty nine-month loss of 179.5 cents a share last month, compared with a profit of 271.7 cents a year earlier due to restructuring  writedowns and as a weaker rand currency pushed up imported raw materials costs that regulated price increases are often not sufficient to fully recover.Adcock makes virtually all of its profits in a heavily regulated home market where a weak economy and high personal debt has stunted consumer spending.(1 US dollar = 10.9535 South African rand)   (REditing by Stella Mapenzauswa and Greg Mahlich)",2014-09-10,MYL,"Wed Sep 10, 2014 | 11:18am EDT",UPDATE 2-S.Africa's Aspen to sell U.S. drug rights to Mylan for up to $300 mln,http://www.reuters.com//article/aspen-results-idUSL5N0RB2U820140910?type=companyNews
56,"   By Natalie Grover and Zeba Siddiqui | Sept 15  Sept 15 Epirus Biopharmaceuticals Inc  said India's drug regulator has approved its copy of a top-selling arthritis treatment, paving the way for its launch in the country early next year.The company's Indian partner, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd , will sell a copycat version of Johnson & Johnson's  and Merck & Co Inc's infliximab, an anti-inflammatory drug with annual sales of about $6 billion.The market for copycat biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, is becoming more lucrative as patents expire on older, high-priced antibody drugs that rank among the pharmaceutical industry's biggest sellers.With changing regulations and a looming biotech patent cliff, the global market for biosimilars is forecast to rise to $24 billion in 2019 from about $1.2 billion last year, according to market research firm Frost & Sullivan. (bit.ly/1oR6jQf)Infliximab, sold under the brand name Remicade, is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease, psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. In India, it sells at about 70,000 rupees ($1,150) per month. Like its main rivals, Amgen Inc's Enbrel and AbbVie Inc's Humira, the drug works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.Epirus, a Boston-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing biosimilar drugs for sale, said it would launch the Remicade biosimilar in India under the name Infimab by the first quarter of 2015. Chief Executive Amit Munshi, citing various estimates, said the Indian market for Remicade was worth $8 million to $10 million a year. He declined to say how much Infimab would cost or to estimate how many patients might use the drug.The drug will be made in Mumbai by India's Reliance Life Sciences, part of billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Group Holdings.Remicade copycats are already being sold elsewhere. South Korean drugmaker Celltrion Inc won approval in July for its version in Japan and is hoping for U.S. approval in 2015. Epirus is also in talks with Ranbaxy, as well as other Indian and international companies, about expanding sales of its biosimilar drugs in other regions, Munshi told Reuters.""Ranbaxy has, under their license, quite a few markets in southeast Asia and North Africa,"" he said. ""We're also working with other partners in places like Latin America.""Ranbaxy is not the only Indian drugmaker to explore production of biosimilar drugs. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd , for example, is developing biosimilars with Germany's Merck KGaA.Biocon Ltd has a tie-up with Mylan Inc, while Lupin Ltd has entered a deal to sell a biosimilar version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster insulin, Lantus, in India.

57,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Mylan Inc (MYL.O) saw unusual options activity on Thursday and the stock rallied sharply after rumors of the company being approached for a possible deal, a day before it issued a positive earnings outlook.Mylan's shares were up 8 percent at $50.28 on Friday in heavy trading. The company raised its third-quarter adjusted profit forecast, citing stronger-than-expected operational performance. At one point on Thursday, shares were up 13 percent, with market sources citing merger rumors involving the company and Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) (TEVA.N). A spokeswoman for Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker and Israel's biggest company, said the company does not comment on market rumors. Mylan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

More than 25,000 Mylan calls traded on Thursday, outnumbering puts by a ratio of 6.8 to 1, according to Trade Alert data.  Bets on Mylan shares touching $50 and others on the shares hitting $47 by Oct. 18 were among the most popular options on the company and traded 5,799 and 3,116 times, respectively, on Thursday, according to Livevol Inc data.While Mylan is an attractive asset in a consolidating specialty pharmaceutical market, JP Morgan sees the company remaining focused on staying independent, the brokerage said in a note to clients on Friday.

58,"  (Adds details, share movements)Oct 6 Generic drugmaker Actavis Plc said it would acquire Durata Therapeutics Inc in a deal valued at about $675 million to bolster its infectious disease portfolio.Durata's shares were trading up 77 percent at $24.55 premarket, above Actavis' offer of $23 per share in cash.Actavis will pay up to an additional $5 per share if Durata's lead drug, dalvance, achieves certain milestones, the companies said. Dalvance is designed to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, which affect the deep tissue or are associated with an underlying disease such as diabetes.The European Medicines Agency is expected to announce its decision on a marketing authorization application for dalvance, known generically as dalbavancin, in the first half of 2015. Actavis, which anticipates closing the deal in late 2014 or early 2015, expects the deal to add to earnings by the end of the first year.Dublin-based Actavis, whose biggest competitors include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Mylan, has been acquiring specialty branded drug makers to boost profit margins and sales. Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd had reportedly been in contact with Actavis about a potential sale.Salix's shares were down 1 percent at $150.90 premarket on Monday. Actavis stock was inactive premarket.BofA Merrill Lynch is Durata's financial adviser and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP is its legal adviser.

59,"  (Corrects paragraph 5 to say the EpiPen is produced my Mylan Inc, not Pfizer Inc)Oct 9 Impax Laboratories Inc said it gained access to an emergency anti-allergen injection, epinephrine, by acquiring two privately held Pennsylvania drugmakers for $700 million.Epinephrine is used to fight sudden allergic reactions such as severe rashes and swelling of the windpipe.Impax said it bought Lineage Therapeutics Inc, which sells a generic epinephrine drug administered through its USP auto-injector system, and Tower Holdings Inc.Tower, which like Lineage is based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, makes Adrenaclick, the branded version of the Lineage drug.Both products compete with Mylan Inc's EpiPen, far and away the leader in the nearly $1 billion market. Impax's shares rose 11.2 percent to $26.52 in premarket trading on Thursday.Four out of every 100 children in the United States have a food allergy, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most allergic reactions are caused by food, insect stings, medications and materials such as latex.Impax's deal comes nearly two months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raised concerns about the company's factory in Taiwan, casting doubt on the future of its experimental Parkinson's drug, Rytary. Impax moved its manufacturing operations to Taiwan in June last year after the FDA cited problems in it manufacturing plant in California.Rytary is the only drug the company is developing on its own. Nearly 94 percent of Impax's second-quarter revenue of $188 million came from the sale of generic products. Hayward, California-based Impax said the deal would add about 90 cents per share to 2015 earnings.Analysts currently expect the company to report earnings of 75 cents per share in 2015.Thursday's deal includes seven generic products and a drug to treat parasitic worm infections, Albenza.Tower Holdings and Lineage Therapeutics are expected to generate revenue of $215 million-$225 million in 2014, Impax said.Up to Wednesday's close, Impax's stock had dropped 5.2 percent this year.

60,"   By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson  Drugmakers Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Mylan Inc (MYL.O) on Wednesday declined to explain in detail why they changed the terms of a $5.3 billion deal in which Mylan will buy part of Abbott's overseas generics business and reincorporate for tax purposes in the Netherlands.Analysts and banking experts said the changes were almost certainly aimed at protecting tax gains from the so-called ""inversion"" deal, one of several to surface in recent months in which U.S. companies seek to shift their tax domiciles abroad.The altered contract for the deal came a month after the Treasury Department made changes to U.S. tax rules aimed at discouraging inversion deals, which the Obama administration sees as a threat to the U.S. corporate tax base.""The (tax law) changes from Treasury are making people re-look at deal terms, and deals are not as favorable now,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. ""That's what happened here, there had to be some tweaks"" in the Abbott/Mylan contract.Windau said many investors had feared the new Treasury rules might derail the deal, and they took comfort in statements by both Abbott and Pittsburgh-based Mylan on Wednesday that the transaction would go through in the first quarter of 2015. ""People assume this has to do with proposed regulatory  actions by Treasury,"" said Josh Jennings, an analyst with Cowen and Co. ""I don't know what their advisors told them to do. I would have appreciated more information.""Concern about the Treasury rule changes prompted AbbVie (ABBV.N), an Abbott spinoff, earlier this week to walk away from its planned $55 billion purchase of Ireland-based drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP.L).Provisions of the Abbott/Mylan deal have been changed, Mylan said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. One change is that Mylan will get better pricing terms at Abbott facilities that will make and supply products for Mylan. Another change, Mylan said, is that it will issue 110 million shares in the newly formed company to Abbott, 5 million more than the original terms dictated. Abbott plans to transfer generic drugs that it sells in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to a new company in the Netherlands that would also include Mylan's existing businesses. Mylan shareholders will now own 78 percent of the company and Abbott will own 22 percent. The original terms called for a 79 percent/21 percent split.Under long-standing Treasury rules, a company that wants to take up tax citizenship in a new country must be less than 80-percent owned by its original U.S. investors. That rule was tightened last month to make it harder for companies to evade the 80-20 rule by slimming down on the U.S. side, or bulking up on the non-U.S. side, through financial maneuvers.Christopher Geier, partner in charge of the investment banking practice at Sikich, a professional services firm in Naperville, Illinois, said the contract changes apparently were made to help ensure that old Mylan shareholders own less than 80 percent of the new company. As for why the companies have not more fully explained the tweaks to their deal, Geier said, “To the extent they can do these things and not violate any sort of disclosure things they will, and you almost can’t blame them for that.”Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel and Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said they could not comment about the contract changes, beyond the limited details included in their separate regulatory filings and on an Abbott conference call.Abbott earlier on Wednesday said its third-quarter sales, including generics to be sold to Mylan which are now considered discontinued products, rose 4.7 percent to $5.6 billion, which was in line with Wall Street expectations.

The new rules raise the bar for this tax treatment and also make it harder to reap other tax benefits of an inversion.About ten U.S. companies had deals in the works when the Treasury changed the rules. Some, including Salix Pharmaceuticals and former Abbott business Abbvie, pulled out of their own inversion-based deals, while others decided to go forward with their deals.Investors and analysts were not certain where Abbott and Mylan would fall. ""The positive takeaway is that Abbott still plans to close its deal with Mylan in the first quarter of 2015, despite the pressure on inversions from the U.S. Treasury, and some walking away by other companies from inversions,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones.

She did not offer details.The company forecast 2015 revenue of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion and adjusted earnings of $4 to $4.30 per share. Analysts on average expect revenue of $9.8 billion and a profit of $4.16 per share for the year.In February, Mylan, which also sells specialty products, said it would buy privately held Indian drugmaker Famy Care Ltd's female health businesses. The company said it still expects to launch a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd's  top-selling multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, in the second half of the year, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Teva in January.Net profit attributable to the company's common shareholders rose to $189.2 million, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $180.2 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned $1.05 per share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 15 percent to $2.08 billion, edging past the Wall Street estimate of about $2.06 billion. The Abbott deal, unveiled in July, allowed Mylan to purchase Abbott's specialty and generics business in developed markets outside the United States, as well as move its tax address to the Netherlands.Mylan's stock was marginally down at $56.80 on the Nasdaq in extended trade.(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Jennings and Steve Orlofdky)",2015-03-03,MYL,"Mon Mar 2, 2015 | 7:23pm EST","UPDATE 1-Mylan still on the prowl for deals, perhaps one by end 2015",http://www.reuters.com//article/mylan-results-idUSL4N0W46E720150303?type=companyNews
76,"   By Bill Berkrot  Generic drugmaker Mylan NV has offered to buy Perrigo Co Plc for about $29 billion in cash and stock, a deal that would make Mylan a major player in over-the-counter consumer products and extend its geographic reach.Mylan's disclosure on Wednesday set off fresh speculation in an already hot market for healthcare deals. Some industry watchers questioned whether Mylan sought to fend off unwanted takeover advances from larger rival Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Others said the offer could spur competing bids for Perrigo.   Mylan offered to buy the Ireland-based company for $205 per share. That represents more than a 25 percent premium over Perrigo's April 3 closing price, the last trading day before Mylan made its offer in an April 6 letter to Perrigo Chief Executive Joseph Papa.Perrigo shares initially jumped well above the offer price to $215.72, but closed up 18.4 percent at $195, indicating some investor skepticism that the deal will happen. Mylan shares rose 15 percent to $68.36, while Teva's U.S.-listed shares gained 3.5 percent.""People think that this is going to flush out a Teva bid for Mylan,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Annabel Samimy. ""If that's the case, then this bid for Perrigo is not going to go through."" She noted that Mylan provided very few details of the offer, including how much would be cash and how much in stock.Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said the two companies have held several discussions about a proposed merger. Perrigo confirmed that it had received an unsolicited offer from Mylan and said its board would meet to discuss the proposal.Perrigo, with a large and attractive portfolio of OTC consumer products, infant formulas and a line of generic topical pharmaceutical medicines, has long been seen as a takeover target. Combined, Perrigo and Mylan had sales of about $15.3 billion in 2014. ""What will be interesting to see is if we end up in a bidding war,"" said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse. He suggested Teva, the world's largest maker of generic drugs, and serial acquirer Valeant Pharmaceuticals International as potential rival bidders for Perrigo.Samimy mentioned Novartis's Sandoz generic unit as a possible Perrigo bidder. ""They've said in the past that they need to get bigger or get out.""Teva, Novartis and Valeant all declined to comment on the speculation. BIGGEST DEAL OF THE YEAR? The proposed $29 billion deal would the largest in the healthcare sector announced this year, ahead of AbbVie Inc's nearly $21 billion deal for Pharmacyclics Inc and Pfizer Inc's planned $16.7 billion purchase of Hospira Inc, according to Thomson Reuters data. (For a graphic, see: link.reuters.com/waf54w)It is further evidence that the appetite for healthcare acquisitions continues unabated. Generic drugmakers are looking to get bigger and gain access to product lines with higher profit margins and pharmaceutical companies seek to bolster their development pipelines by acquiring potentially lucrative specialty medicines, such as for cancer and rare diseases. Medical device makers have also sought to expand product portfolios through acquisitions.  Several potential deals in which U.S. healthcare companies sought to buy overseas assets to benefit from lower tax rates were shelved in 2014 after the U.S. Treasury issued tougher rules on such purchases.         AbbVie, for example, scuttled a $55 billion purchase of Ireland's Shire Plc. But both companies have since pursued new deals. AbbVie won a three-way bidding war for Pharmacyclics and Shire bought NPS Pharmaceuticals for more than $5 billion.Mylan has been at the center of deal speculation as  Actavis, one of its main rivals, swallows up companies to expand beyond generic medicines, including a $67 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan last year. Just last month, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch raised the prospect of another ""material transaction"" by the end of 2015.""Assuming Mylan can get to the finish line with this, they'd be a heck of a lot bigger in Europe,"" said CRT Capital Group analyst Timothy Chiang.

Some Fed participants went on record saying they expected upcoming economic data would warrant an initial rate increase in June, while others anticipated a hike later in 2015 due to recent strength in the U.S. dollar. Market participants had been expecting the first rate hike to come in September or later, with last week's much weaker-than-expected March payroll report pointing to slowing growth. The central bank has said it would only raise rates when data suggests the economy is strong enough to withstand it.""June would come as a surprise,"" said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist and director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. ""If the Fed moves monetary policy in an arbitrarily fast manner, that would be a detriment for stocks.""Fed officials acknowledged risks from overseas and a weak start to the year at their March meeting but remained confident in the strength of the recovery, the minutes showed.

Mylan shares rose as much as 16 percent to a high of $69.45. Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options trading. On March 24, the volume in Perrigo's options, which on average trade less than 600 contracts a day, jumped to more than 4,700 contracts, driven by a large options bet on Perrigo shares rising sharply before mid-May. ""They were positioning for an upside move and they had their eye on a catalyst.

Calls convey the right to buy the stock at a certain price in the future and puts impart the right to sell the stock at a fixed price at a future date.    The options were set to expire in May 15 and would capture Perrigo's third-quarter results on May 4. On Wednesday, the value of these calls jumped, at one point to as much as $6.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Brent slid 3.3 percent and U.S. crude lost more than 4 percent after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed the largest weekly build in oil inventories since March 2001.Energy stocks, which had been supported by Royal Dutch Shell's $70 billion bid for rival BG Group, fell sharply after the EIA data.""It's a huge build so how are we looking at it - is it a slowdown in the economy?

New York Fed President William Dudley said Wednesday a June rate hike remains on the table, reiterating the Fed mantra that any tightening is data dependent.As the reporting season gains momentum, first-quarter S&P 500 earnings are projected to show a decline of 2.8 percent from a year earlier, which would be the worst comparatives since the third quarter of 2009.""We are waiting on earnings and all signs are that it is not going to be a great quarter,"" Saluzzi said.

84,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, April 10 (IFR) - Drugmaker Mylan is at risk of dropping back into junk territory if it doesn't strike a perfect balance between bond and equity to finance its proposed US$30bn acquisition of healthcare supplier Perrigo, analysts warned.The Baa3/BBB- pharma has offered to buy Perrigo for US$205 a share in transaction valued at US$30bn, including assumed debt, and it may need to raise up to US$9bn to complete the acquisition.Analysts and rating agencies have been spooked by Mylan's decision not to divulge exactly how much debt and equity it plans to issue for the acquisition and warn that, at best, the deal will leave it teetering on the edge of junk.Late this week S&P put Mylan's BBB- rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, threatening its investment grade rating amid concerns that the merger ""could significantly increase debt leverage"".Moody's also rates Mylan at its lowest investment-grade rating of Baa3, which the pharma company achieved in late 2012 after years of struggling with high leverage due to acquisitions. KEEPING THE GRADE Mylan won its investment-grade status back then by publicly articulating a 3.0-times debt/EBITDA target.Even if the Perrigo acquisition financing has a 70-75% equity component, the combined company's total debt to EBITDA would soar to around 4.5-times, according to analysts. ""The company has repeatedly stated its commitment to investment grade, but...the cash/stock consideration will have a material impact on the degree of credit deterioration and potential agency actions,"" said CreditSight pharma credit analyst, Eric Axon.Axon believes Mylan could use a 25% debt, 75% equity financing split to pay for the acquisition and keep its investment grade rating, but only if it aggressively delevers over an 18-month period.That would imply taking on an additional US$7.2bn in debt, bringing total debt to US$19.897bn or 4.5-times EBITDA for the combined company and net leverage to US$16.05bn or 3.6-times. Shubhomoy Mukherjee, credit strategist at Barclays, also believes that Mylan could issue between US$7.5bn-US$9bn and still maintain its BBB- rating, as long as it achieves about US$500m of synergies from the acquisition and rapidly delevers over 18-24 months.Under Mukherjee's calculations, that would imply a 70% equity mix in the financings. Despite the significant dilution implications of such a high equity component, Mukherjee believes Mylan can pull it off.""We think it could reduce the resulting equity dilution by financing a portion of the consideration with mandatorily convertible preferreds, which could get 100% equity credit from the rating agencies,"" said Mukherjee.For the time being, bond investors are sitting tight. Mylan's bonds have already been trading at a 7-12% discount to other low BBB healthcare credits like Actavis and Perrigo, in expectation that it would seek a major acquisition this year.""Given the possibility of Mylan's issuing US$7.5bn-US$9bn to fund this transaction and meaningfully increasing leverage, we expect Mylan bonds to re-price another 10bp wider,"" said Mukherjee.

91,"   By Olivia Oran and Nadia Damouni  Some of the top investors at Mylan NV, including Paulson & Co, are encouraging its board of directors to consider a takeover proposal from rival Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.A handful of these investors have expressed their support in recent weeks for the creation of the world's largest generic drug maker by sales, these people said, declining to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Teva unveiled an unsolicited $40 billion takeover proposal on Tuesday for the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based company. Paulson, a New York-based hedge fund that owned roughly 14.9 million shares or 3 percent of Mylan as of Dec. 31, declined to comment. A representative for Mylan also declined to comment.Pressure has been growing on Jerusalem-based Teva for new revenue sources. Its biggest selling drug, multiple sclerosis injectable treatment Copaxone, faces competition from oral treatments and cheaper generics in the coming years.        Mylan, which makes the EpiPen product for severe allergies, is incorporated in the Netherlands and can take advantage of Dutch provisions that would make a hostile takeover difficult. In response to media speculation about a potential deal, Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said last week that the company had studied a transaction with Teva and concluded that such a combination ""is without sound industrial logic or cultural fit,"" and would attract antitrust scrutiny.Mylan is pursuing its own $29 billion unsolicited bid for over-the-counter medicines maker Perrigo Co PLC. Perrigo's board rejected that offer earlier on Tuesday.  Teva said acquisition of Mylan would create an entity with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, add to earnings in the first year and eventually generate $2 billion in annual savings.The purchase of Mylan would also help Teva expand its offering of harder-to-produce medical products, such as soft-gel caps, topical and inhalant technologies and injectables, and increase its portfolio of specialty pharmaceuticals.    In March, Teva said it would acquire neurology company Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc for $3.5 billion to boost its portfolio of treatments for the central nervous system. A Teva-Mylan deal would be the second-largest healthcare transaction in the last 12 months, following generic drugmaker Actavis Plc's $66 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan. The wave of consolidation has also included AbbVie Inc's proposed $21 billion purchase of Pharmacyclics and Valeant Pharmaceuticals' $11 billion deal for Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd.Mylan shares rose 8.9 percent to $74.04 in Nasdaq trading on Tuesday, while Teva gained 1.4 percent to $64.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. Perrigo fell 2.66 percent to $192.82.

92,"   By Tova Cohen and Caroline Humer | TEL AVIV/NEW YORK  TEL AVIV/NEW YORK Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Tuesday made an unsolicited $40 billion offer for smaller rival Mylan NV, a bold bid for growth as its lucrative Copaxone drug faces generic competition. The offer followed weeks of speculation that Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, would soon target Mylan. Shares of Mylan traded below the offer price of $82 in cash and stock, evidence of investor skepticism that Teva can win over the company, which has set up a defense that includes a poison pill.Analysts agreed that Teva would need to sweeten its bid to the $90-per-share range. S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo said a viable offer would be $92, about 22 times Mylan's 2015 expected earnings.""If they raise their bid, they will have more Mylan shareholders pressuring management to come to the table,"" Loo said. He suggested Teva would need to increase the cash component of the offer, which is now at 50 percent.Mylan has yet to respond publicly. The company is pursuing an unsolicited, $29 billion bid for Perrigo Co Plc, a major producer of over-the-counter medicines, in an apparent attempt to stave off interest from Teva. Perrigo has not yet responded to that offer, saying it would consult its board, but a source familiar with the matter said the company was set to reject Mylan's bid as soon as this week.Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said last week that the company had studied the potential for a deal with Teva and concluded that such a combination ""is without sound industrial logic or cultural fit,"" and would attract antitrust scrutiny.Teva said its offer should be more attractive to Mylan shareholders than the proposed purchase of Perrigo, representing a 48 percent premium to the company's share price before speculation of a deal surfaced on March 10.  Pressure has been growing on Teva for new revenue sources as multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone starts to face generic competition this year. Teva said the purchase would help it to expand its offering of harder-to-produce medical products, such as soft-gel caps, topical and inhalant technologies and injectables, and increase its portfolio of specialty pharmaceuticals.The acquisition would create an entity with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, add to earnings in the first year and eventually generate $2 billion in annual savings, Teva said. It expects that a transaction could close by the end of 2015 and pledged a quick response, including selling assets if necessary, to ease any regulatory concerns.Mylan shares were up 8.9 percent at $74.12 in afternoon Nasdaq trading, while Teva rose 2.0 percent to $64.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Perrigo fell 2.2 percent to $193.79. HEALTHCARE DEAL FRENZY A Teva-Mylan deal would be the second-largest healthcare transaction in the last 12 months, following generic drugmaker Actavis Plc's $66 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan. The wave of consolidation has also included AbbVie Inc's proposed purchase of Pharmacyclics and Valeant Pharmaceuticals' deal for Salix.Generic drugmakers are looking to get bigger and gain access to product lines with higher profit margins, while traditional pharmaceutical companies have tried to add novel treatments for cancer and rare diseases.         Teva Chief Executive Officer Erez Vigodman said the companies should meet to address Mylan's concerns. In a letter to Coury, he said a deal would create ""an organization with the scale and reach to excel in the current environment, which I know you appreciate."" A turnaround specialist, Vigodman joined Teva last year, tasked with cutting costs and improving profits under pressure from rising competition. In February, he said the company was ready to return to making acquisitions. A Mylan purchase would be the largest deal in Israeli history.Mylan recently moved its headquarters from the United States to the Netherlands, where corporate taxes are lower and where it could take advantage of Dutch anti-takeover provisions that can dilute shares by granting a call option to a foundation set up for this purpose.   In early April, Mylan said it had entered into such a call option agreement.Sanford Bernstein analyst Aaron Gal said in a research note that Perrigo was likely to reject Mylan but might then start negotiating with the company. That would push Mylan to campaign to win shareholder support for its purchase.At the same time, Teva will start its own campaign to publicly convince Mylan shareholders of the merits of its offer. Mylan is likely to demand a higher price, shared management and maybe some employee job protection, he said.    Barclays and Greenhill & Co Inc are advising Teva, whose lawyers are Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Tulchinsky Stern Marciano Cohen Levitski & Co, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V. and Loyens & Loeff N.V.

Teva said its offer should be more attractive to Mylan shareholders than the proposed purchase of Perrigo, representing a 48 percent premium to the company's share price before speculation of a deal surfaced on March 10.Pressure has been growing on Teva for new revenue sources as multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone starts to face generic competition this year.Teva said the purchase would help it to expand its offering of harder-to-produce medical products, such as soft-gel caps, topical and inhalant technologies and injectables, and increase its portfolio of specialty pharmaceuticals.The acquisition would create an entity with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, add to earnings in the first year and eventually generate $2 billion in annual savings, Teva said. It expects that a transaction could close by the end of 2015 and pledged a quick response, including selling assets if necessary, to ease any regulatory concerns. Mylan shares were up 8.9 percent at $74.12 in afternoon Nasdaq trading, while Teva rose 2.0 percent to $64.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Perrigo fell 2.2 percent to $193.79.HEALTHCARE DEAL FRENZY A Teva-Mylan deal would be the second-largest healthcare transaction in the last 12 months, following generic drugmaker Actavis Plc's $66 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan. The wave of consolidation has also included AbbVie Inc's proposed purchase of Pharmacyclics and Valeant Pharmaceuticals' deal for Salix. Generic drugmakers are looking to get bigger and gain access to product lines with higher profit margins, while traditional pharmaceutical companies have tried to add novel treatments for cancer and rare diseases.Teva Chief Executive Officer Erez Vigodman said the companies should meet to address Mylan's concerns. In a letter to Coury, he said a deal would create ""an organization with the scale and reach to excel in the current environment, which I know you appreciate.""A turnaround specialist, Vigodman joined Teva last year, tasked with cutting costs and improving profits under pressure from rising competition. In February, he said the company was ready to return to making acquisitions. A Mylan purchase would be the largest deal in Israeli history.Mylan recently moved its headquarters from the United States to the Netherlands, where corporate taxes are lower and where it could take advantage of Dutch anti-takeover provisions that can dilute shares by granting a call option to a foundation set up for this purpose.In early April, Mylan said it had entered into such a call option agreement.Sanford Bernstein analyst Aaron Gal said in a research note that Perrigo was likely to reject Mylan but might then start negotiating with the company. That would push Mylan to campaign to win shareholder support for its purchase.At the same time, Teva will start its own campaign to publicly convince Mylan shareholders of the merits of its offer. Mylan is likely to demand a higher price, shared management and maybe some employee job protection, he said.Barclays and Greenhill & Co Inc are advising Teva, whose lawyers are Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Tulchinsky Stern Marciano Cohen Levitski & Co, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V. and Loyens & Loeff N.V.

109,"  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.N) has offered to buy rival generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL.O) for $40 billion in what would be the largest acquisition in Israel's history, equivalent to nearly 15 percent of GDP.Below are major deals by Teva, Israel's largest company and the world's biggest maker of generic drugs. The company, which employs around 45,000 people, was founded in Jerusalem in 1901 as a wholesale drugs distributor:* In March 2015 it said it would buy U.S. neurology drug company Auspex Pharmaceuticals ASPX.O for an equity value of $3.5 billion, a move to boost its portfolio of treatments for the central nervous system.* In 2011, Teva bought U.S. specialty drugmaker Cephalon for $6.8 billion, acquiring pain, sleep and cancer drugs as well as 57 percent of Japan's Taiyo Pharmaceutical for $460 million. * In 2010, Teva acquired Germany's Ratiopharm for $5 billion, including debt, to become the largest generics drugmaker in Germany.* In 2008, Teva bought Barr Pharmaceuticals in the United States and its European subsidiary Pliva for $7.5 billion. The deal significantly enhanced Teva's leadership position in the U.S. generic drugs market and strengthened its position in key European markets. * Teva acquired U.S.-based IVAX Corp in 2006 for $7.4 billion, giving it a strong presence in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe and complementary operations in North America and Europe. IVAX also had a significant respiratory business and a pipeline of generic and proprietary products in the areas of respiratory ailments and oncology.* Sicor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva in 2004. Teva paid $3.4 billion for Sicor, which had a leading generic injectable business as well as biogeneric capabilities. * In 2000, Teva bought privately held Novopharm, Canada's second-largest generic company, making Teva the largest generic drug company in North America.* In 1999, Teva bought Massachusetts-based Copley Pharmaceutical Inc, a maker of generic and branded drugs, for $220 million (Compiled by Steven Scheer; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",2015-04-22,MYL,"Wed Apr 22, 2015 | 9:10am EDT",Factbox: Teva Pharmaceutical's history of key acquisitions,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-teva-pharm-ind-acquisitions-idUSKBN0ND1JC20150422?type=companyNews
110,"   By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' bid for Mylan NV would create a company controlling nearly 25 percent of the U.S. generics market, including drugs in short supply, according to industry experts and a Reuters review of regulatory filings.Both issues will factor into any antitrust review, they said.Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, made its $40 billion offer public on Tuesday and quickly signaled it was ready to sell some overlapping assets to win antitrust approval for a deal. Mylan has not responded to the unsolicited bid but has said it wants to remain independent and that the overlap with Teva's products could scuttle a combination. It is also pursuing a hostile takeover of drugmaker Perrigo Co Plc.Most treatments used by the U.S. public are cheaper generic copies of brand-name medications. The percentage has grown as leading drugs lost patent protection in the last decade and health insurers sought ways to rein in costs. But manufacturing generics is a low-margin business, prompting companies to reduce production of some drugs over time.Previous industry mergers have also reduced capacity, and manufacturing lapses at some plants have delayed or shuttered production, leading to temporary shortages of cancer drugs, anesthesia and other medicines.Teva has already looked at the competitive overlap between its portfolio and Mylan’s, and started discussions with the Federal Trade Commission about the possible merger, sources familiar with the situation said. Mylan makes 360 generic products for the U.S. market, while Teva manufactures 375.The FTC has studied the potential impact of a pharmaceutical deal on drug shortages. In reviewing the 2012 merger of generics makers Actavis and Watson Pharmaceuticals, the agency said it ""evaluated whether the proposed transaction would exacerbate any of those (drug) shortages."" Typically, the FTC wants to be sure there are several competitors making a particular medicine so that production would continue even if one manufacturing source shuts down, sources familiar with the situation said. ""The FTC should be thinking about and not wanting to approve mergers that would worsen the conditions that would cause shortages,"" said an antitrust expert who requested anonymity because he wished to protect his business relationships. ""The fewer production facilities that there are, the greater susceptibility to price fluctuations.""Prices for generic drugs sometimes spike when supplies dry up. Last fall, Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings opened an investigation into 14 drug companies about generic price increases. The office of the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services is also planning to a review.""All the manufacturing consolidation makes us nervous,"" said Dr. Beverly Philip, a professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School. With some shortages, doctors have had to shift patients to medicines that may not work as well. If Teva buys Mylan and phases out some of its less-profitable sterile injectable drugs, both for anesthesia and other uses, she said, it would tighten the screw another notch. LOOKING AT COMPETITION Globally, Teva holds 12 percent of the global generic market, while Novartis AG, Actavis and Mylan each account for about 9 percent, according to UK market intelligence firm Evaluate Ltd. Their U.S. market shares are less clear because generic drug company reporting on product sales varies. Wells Fargo analyst Michael Faerm estimates a combined Teva-Mylan would account for 22 percent of U.S. prescriptions. Morningstar Research analyst Michael Waterhouse put the U.S. combined share at about 25 percent of the retail generic market, which is about $31 billion.But those numbers do not reflect the overlap between their businesses. Teva sells more than 50 percent of the U.S. generic products also sold by Mylan, said Louise Pearson, an analyst with Germany’s Berenberg Bank, citing data from IMS Health. IMS Health was not immediately available to verify the figures.  In the case of overlapping products, antitrust regulators will want to see that they have at least three or four competitors. If not, the companies considering a merger may need to sell the product line to another party, the antitrust experts and two of the sources said.

111,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, click on )By Caroline Humer and Ransdell PiersonNEW YORK, April 24 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' bid for Mylan NV would create a company controlling nearly 25 percent of the U.S. generics market, including drugs in short supply, according to industry experts and a Reuters review of regulatory filings.Both issues will factor into any antitrust review, they said.Teva , the world's largest generic drugmaker, made its $40 billion offer public on Tuesday and quickly signaled it was ready to sell some overlapping assets to win antitrust approval for a deal.Mylan has not responded to the unsolicited bid but has said it wants to remain independent and that the overlap with Teva's products could scuttle a combination. It is also pursuing a hostile takeover of drugmaker Perrigo Co Plc .Most treatments used by the U.S. public are cheaper generic copies of brand-name medications. The percentage has grown as leading drugs lost patent protection in the last decade and health insurers sought ways to rein in costs. But manufacturing generics is a low-margin business, prompting companies to reduce production of some drugs over time.Previous industry mergers have also reduced capacity, and manufacturing lapses at some plants have delayed or shuttered production, leading to temporary shortages of cancer drugs, anesthesia and other medicines.Teva has already looked at the competitive overlap between its portfolio and Mylan's, and started discussions with the Federal Trade Commission about the possible merger, sources familiar with the situation said. Mylan makes 360 generic products for the U.S. market, while Teva manufactures 375. The FTC has studied the potential impact of a pharmaceutical deal on drug shortages. In reviewing the 2012 merger of generics makers Actavis and Watson Pharmaceuticals, the agency said it ""evaluated whether the proposed transaction would exacerbate any of those (drug) shortages.""Typically, the FTC wants to be sure there are several competitors making a particular medicine so that production would continue even if one manufacturing source shuts down, sources familiar with the situation said.""The FTC should be thinking about and not wanting to approve mergers that would worsen the conditions that would cause shortages,"" said an antitrust expert who requested anonymity because he wished to protect his business relationships. ""The fewer production facilities that there are, the greater susceptibility to price fluctuations.""Prices for generic drugs sometimes spike when supplies dry up. Last fall, Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings opened an investigation into 14 drug companies about generic price increases. The office of the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services is also planning to a review.""All the manufacturing consolidation makes us nervous,"" said Dr. Beverly Philip, a professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School. With some shortages, doctors have had to shift patients to medicines that may not work as well. If Teva buys Mylan and phases out some of its less-profitable sterile injectable drugs, both for anesthesia and other uses, she said, it would tighten the screw another notch.LOOKING AT COMPETITION Globally, Teva holds 12 percent of the global generic market, while Novartis AG, Actavis and Mylan each account for about 9 percent, according to UK market intelligence firm Evaluate Ltd. Their U.S. market shares are less clear because generic drug company reporting on product sales varies.Wells Fargo analyst Michael Faerm estimates a combined Teva-Mylan would account for 22 percent of U.S. prescriptions. Morningstar Research analyst Michael Waterhouse put the U.S. combined share at about 25 percent of the retail generic market, which is about $31 billion. But those numbers do not reflect the overlap between their businesses. Teva sells more than 50 percent of the U.S. generic products also sold by Mylan, said Louise Pearson, an analyst with Germany's Berenberg Bank, citing data from IMS Health. IMS Health was not immediately available to verify the figures.In the case of overlapping products, antitrust regulators will want to see that they have at least three or four competitors.

Mylan's rejection was widely expected and sets up a three-way battle as it pursues its own hostile takeover of over-the-counter drugmaker Perrigo Co Plc.Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said Teva is not likely to walk away while its is meeting with Mylan investors to ask them to advocate the merits of a deal to the Mylan board.""If they (Teva) feel the shareholders are willing sellers..., then they will probably push it,"" Gal said. ""If they feel there is no interest among shareholders in doing the deal at a price it can afford, then they will probably walk away."" Mylan shares fell 5.7 percent to $71.71 on Nasdaq, and Teva fell 3.8 percent to $61.93 on the New York Stock Exchange.'High-Risk Currency' Mylan Executive Chairman Rob Coury said in a lengthy, critical letter to Teva released on Monday that Mylan's $82 per share offer was too low. Coury said the board of directors would not consider any discussions unless ""the starting point"" was ""significantly in excess of $100 per share.""Wall Street analysts had said Mylan might be looking for $90 to $95 per share and an increased cash component.Coury said in the letter, which described Teva's culture as  ""dysfunctional,"" that Teva's stock had underperformed its peers, including Mylan, over the last three years and was ""unacceptable.""""The Mylan board has no interest in considering an expression of interest that... requires Mylan shareholders to accept what we believe is low-quality and high-risk currency in the form of Teva shares,"" it said.In addition, it said its customers and partners did not support the possible combination.

The previous offer was about $220 per share.

Coury said Mylan did not want to be paid with Teva's ""high-risk"" stock and he raised antitrust issues. Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman responded on Wednesday in a letter to Coury that took exception to the tone of Coury's response and attempted to rebut Mylan's lengthy list of objections to a deal.Vigodman said Coury painted ""a fundamentally distorted picture of Teva"" and that stakeholders of the two companies do not ""benefit from mudslinging, mischaracterization, rehashing of history or selective presentation of facts.""Teva said its $82-per-share cash and stock offer was now worth $43 billion and was ""more attractive"" for Mylan shareholders than any alternative. It also said it did not see significant antitrust hurdles, adding that any potential divestitures would be manageable.

As proposed, the deal would give current Perrigo shareholders 39 percent of the combined company.Mylan also reported slightly higher-than-expected first-quarter profit.""We remain steadfast in our legally binding commitment to acquire Perrigo and have taken numerous concrete steps to lay out a clear and certain path towards completion,"" Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch said in a statement.In making its case for a combination with Perrigo, Mylan said the merger would give it massive global manufacturing and supply chain presence, add to earnings, and make it a ""stronger, larger and more diverse business"" with ""significant free cash flow.""Mylan also said it would expect to realize at least $800 million in cost savings by the end of year four after completion of the deal. ""I don't think we will disappoint on what we deliver on a short-term, mid-term and long-term basis,"" Bresch said.Perrigo, which would give Mylan over-the-counter consumer and nutritional products and a line of generic topical medicines, last week rejected a sweetened $34 billion offer from Mylan.At the same time, Mylan is attempting to fend off a takeover by Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA), the world's largest generic drugmaker, which earlier on Tuesday said it was moving ahead with plans to acquire Mylan contingent on the Perrigo deal not being completed. Teva proposed to acquire Mylan for $82 per share, or about $43 billion, in cash and stock. Mylan, in rejecting the offer, said it ""grossly undervalued"" the company. Mylan, on its call, said it would not discuss board matters or the Teva approach or answer questions related to Teva.Excluding items, such as acquisition costs for a deal with Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) that enabled it to redomicile in Europe, Mylan earned 70 cents per share, topping analysts' average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Mylan maintained its full-year forecast of adjusted earnings of $4 to $4.30 per share and revenue of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion. It forecast second-quarter adjusted earnings of 86 cents to 90 cents per share. Revenue of $1.87 billion for the quarter fell short of Wall Street estimates of $2.06 billion. The company said foreign exchange rates resulting from the impact of a strong dollar on overseas sales clipped revenue by $93 million. The former Pittsburgh-based company, now headquartered in the Netherlands, posted a net profit of $56.6 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with $115.9 million, or 29 cents a share, a year ago.Mylan shares slipped to $72.60 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $72.89.

U.S antitrust laws bar companies from acquiring stakes worth more than $76.3 million in rivals without first obtaining regulatory approval. Teva's stake in Mylan far exceeds that threshold.The dispute boils down to where Mylan, which is incorporated in the Netherlands, has its ""principal"" offices. Mylan argues these are located within the United States for the purposes of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, thereby affording it antitrust protection, even as it lists its principal executives offices in Britain in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Such a stake would allow Teva to have standing in Dutch court to potentially challenge Mylan, which has so far refused to engage with its Israeli rival, the people added.   Teva may seek to reach this ownership threshold ahead of Mylan's record date, or the date in which a shareholder must officially own shares to be entitled to vote on the tender offer for Perrigo, they said. This would raise pressure on Mylan's management ahead of the vote, the people added.  A tender offer for Mylan is likely to come after Teva raises its stake, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because Teva's deliberations are not public. Representatives for Teva and Mylan declined to comment.

166,"   By Tova Cohen | TEL AVIV  TEL AVIV As Israel's biggest company Teva strives to get even bigger by swallowing up rival Mylan for more than $40 billion, further down the food chain a raft of upstart life science firms are struggling to climb onto the global ladder.Now the government is starting to take notice, urged on by influential advocates, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' own boss, who says the country's economic future depends on replicating his company's success.Israel has a burgeoning life science industry comprising around 1,380 mostly very small companies. Some 51 biotech, biopharma and medical devices firm are listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, making it the largest single sector. But few of them go on to build up their businesses, with most promising ideas snapped up by foreign heavyweights. Novartis, Johnson & Johnson and Merck Serono have all opened research centers in Israel, usually by acquiring small companies. Merck Serono's best-selling drug, Rebif, which treats multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed in Israel.That frustrates many in the Israeli industry, who believe the country is letting wealth and expertise drain overseas.  ""Start-up nation is not a sustainable model for Israel. What Israel needs is more large companies,"" Teva CEO Erez Vigodman said at the launch of a joint venture with Philips to invest in Israeli medical device and digital health start-ups.Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker with annual sales of $20 billion, used its fortune from copycat drugs to move into the costlier innovative sector. Today, around half its profit is from one branded drug, MS treatment Copaxone.That is not an easy model to replicate.The biggest problem for Israeli firms, according to Claudio Yarza, head of life sciences at consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Israel, is a lack of funding -- from university level to capital markets, There are some signs, however, that is starting to change.  Israeli life science firms raised more than $2 billion from various resources in 2014, a record year, according to the Israel Advanced Technology Industries (IATI) association.What's more, start-ups raised $801 million, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center, up 55 percent on 2013.That's almost twice the rate of growth in the United States, although start-ups there raised a much larger $8.6 billion, according to PwC and the National Venture Capital Association. Also, of 73 biotech companies that went public on Nasdaq last year, seven were Israeli. ""Maybe now that some companies have raised nice sums on Nasdaq they will be able to take their drugs all the way,"" said  PwC Israel's Yarza.GOVERNMENT ACTION Israeli firms also complain about red tape, and the lack of manufacturing in Israel which means they have to turn to foreign companies for help developing drugs. ""We don't have enough drug development and manufacturing experience and infrastructure in Israel,"" Compugen CEO Anat Cohen-Dayag told Reuters. Compugen, which discovers drugs mainly in cancer immunotherapy using computational technology, has partnerships with Merck Serono and Bayer.  However, the Israeli government is now helping firms set up their own plants by offering funds for equipment, according to Ora Dar, head of life sciences in the chief scientist's office. In addition, ""we are talking to CMOs (contract manufacturing organizations) to see what it will take to convince them to build facilities in Israel,"" she said.Dar said the government was tackling another common complaint among life science executives -- a lack of experience in taking drugs through the regulatory process to market.The government is increasing funding for the health regulator to help speed approval for clinical trials in Israel, she said.There's a long way to go.While individual Israeli companies such as Protalix, whose plant-based enzyme was approved to treat Gaucher disease, may succeed, ""most will either license their products to larger corporations or be acquired,"" said IATI co-chairman Benny Zeevi.But Compugen's Cohen-Dayag was cautiously optimistic.""A small company that would like to take drugs to the market cannot establish the infrastructure in Israel on its own,"" she said. ""I think the government recognises this now and is trying to build bridges to address these gaps, but it will take time.""

172,"   By Tova Cohen and Ari Rabinovitch | TEL AVIV, July 26  TEL AVIV, July 26 After months of sparring in a hostile takeover bid for rival Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceutical's move to buy Allergan Plc's  generic drug business instead could be a smoother ride that will bring bigger returns, faster.Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, is in advanced talks to buy Allergan's generic drugs unit for between $40-45 billion dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.News of the deal broke on Saturday after Teva's $40 billion bid for Mylan hit a snag when a Dutch foundation linked to Mylan bought temporary control of half the company in an attempt to block the takeover.A Teva spokesman declined to comment on possible talks with Allergan.Though the Teva-Mylan feud has hogged the industry spotlight since April, Allergan' generics business may actually have been Teva's first choice. Teva CEO Erez Vigodman is believed to have approached Allergan last year, which was called Actavis prior to a March merger.In June 2014, just a few months after joining the company himself, Vigodman hired the former head of Actavis' generic drug business, Sigurdur Olafsson, to fill a similar role at Teva. ""There was previously a preference for Actavis over Mylan but for some reason it didn't materialise,"" said Bank of Jerusalem analyst Jonathan Kreizman.Should the deal with Dublin-based Allergan now go through, there will be two big upsides for Teva, he said.First, there is less overlap than with Mylan. Teva has been planning a generic version of Mylan's EpiPen, a billion-dollar product, while Mylan has been working on a generic version of Teva's best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. In the short term, Teva would benefit from removing the uncertainty over the outcome of the Mylan deal that has weighed on its stock.Since hitting a year high of $68.74 in New York on April 9, just before speculation on a possible Mylan bid had surfaced, Teva shares are down more than 10 percent, closing on Friday at $61.85.Kreizman said he assumes the size of the deal would be similar in scope to Mylan, noting Allergan has about 8 percent of the U.S. drugs market, compared with 9 percent for Mylan and 14 percent for Teva. ""Assuming the entity is more or less the same size, valuation is less of an issue,"" he said.The Mylan deal is hard for the market to digest, he said, while ""any friendly transaction ... would have better impact.""Allergan's generics operations has about $7 billion in sales, said Umer Raffat, an analyst with investment research firm ISI Group.""Theoretically, a Teva/Allergan generics business combo offers Teva the opportunity to get what it was looking for without having to go through Dutch courts,"" he said.This includes boosting its scale and getting access to complex generics like injectables as well as biosimilar drugs through Allergan's partnership with Amgen on oncology biologic drugs, he said.

173,"  (Updates sourcing, adds details)By Greg RoumeliotisJuly 25 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  is in advanced talks to buy Allergan Plc's  generic drug business following a thus far unsuccessful effort to acquire peer Mylan NV, according to a person familiar with the matter.Jerusalem-based Teva, which has offered to buy Mylan for $40 billion, is now close to an agreement to acquire Dublin-based Allergan's generic drugs unit for between $40 billion and $45 billion, the person said on Saturday.A deal could be announced as early as next week, the person said, cautioning that negotiations had not yet been completed and asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. Teva and Allergan representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Large drug makers are trying to realign their operations to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers are seeking larger scale. Allergan's branded drugs business makes products such as Botox and Alzheimer's drug Namenda. Its generics business makes up about a third of the company's total revenue.A successful deal with Allergan would give Teva, which has a market capitalization of $60 billion, a much bigger footprint in the generic drugs sector. It would also offer opportunities for significant cost synergies and tax savings. Last year, Actavis Plc outbid Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and activist investor William Ackman to merge with Allergan and adopt its name. Allergan now has a market capitalization of $121 billion.Teva's bid for Mylan took a hit earlier this week when the latter's independent Dutch foundation exercised a call option allowing it to buy 50 percent of Mylan's total issued and outstanding capital, giving it temporary control of half the company. The foundation, known as Stichting, opposes Teva's bid, arguing that a Teva takeover would likely lead to job losses at Mylan and reduce access to cheap generic medicines in emerging markets.Mylan for its part is pressing on with a $34 billion hostile bid for Perrigo Co Plc. Were Teva to clinch a deal with Allergan for its generic drug business and drop its bid for Mylan, this would likely strengthen the hand of Mylan's management in its campaign to buy Perrigo.The Wall Street Journal first reported that Teva was in advanced talks to acquire Allergan's generic drug unit.

174,"   By Tova Cohen and Steven Scheer | TEL AVIV  TEL AVIV Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries will pay $40.5 billion in cash and stock for Allergan's generic drugs business, solidifying Teva's position as the world's No. 1 maker of generics while freeing Allergan to focus on branded drugs, paying down debt and potential ""transformational"" acquisitions.The deal, the largest in Israel's corporate history, allows Teva stronger economies of scale, crucial in the low-margin generic drugs business. Teva , which dropped its hostile pursuit of Mylan, will likely have to sell off some drugs to allay antitrust concerns.""Allergan's business is more high-end (than Mylan). It's a more interesting business ... a profitable business and it's well managed,"" said Gilad Alper, an analyst at brokerage Excellence Nessuah.Allergan, known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, became the third-largest generic drugmaker in the United States after combining with Actavis in March. It is seen as a better fit than Mylan because it will improve Teva's distribution channels and access to profitable injectable drugs.Pressure has been growing on Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman to find new revenue sources to combat generic competition for its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. Copaxone accounts for about half of Teva's profit.Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, who led Actavis' purchase of Forest Laboratories and then Allergan, said the company will use the $36 billion in net proceeds from the generics sale to help fund further large acquisitions.""We can accelerate our timing on transformational M&A,"" Saunders said during a conference call. He cited aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal therapies as areas for potential future deals. Wall Street analysts speculated that possible targets include Biogen Inc , Amgen Inc and AbbVie Inc.The healthcare sector has seen an unprecedented wave of deals since early 2014, from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals, to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers.Global healthcare M&A reached $398.5 billion as of July 23, up 80 percent on a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. HIGHLY COMPETITIVE Teva shares, which had been weighed down by the Mylan uncertainty, rose 16.4 percent in New York on Monday. Allergan shares gained about 6.1 percent and Mylan shares slid 14.5 percent.Mylan had used a poison pill-style defence to fight a $40 billion takeover by Teva, arguing that a deal was ""without sound industrial logic or cultural fit"" and would face regulatory hurdles. The company said on Monday it would continue efforts to buy Perrigo Company PLC, whose shares were up 3.8 percent.Teva may need to sell a large number of assets to satisfy antitrust authorities about the Allergan transaction, according to two antitrust attorneys who handle pharmaceutical deals. ""But if you look at the total size of the deal, that's going to be a tiny fraction,"" one of the lawyers said.It may also be harder to find buyers for those drugs given the consolidation already seen in the generics sector, they said. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission requires buyers for proposed divestitures before it will approve a deal.Teva said it has identified asset sales needed for the deal to pass muster with U.S. and UK antitrust regulators, and that the number was less than what had been anticipated in a combination with Mylan.CULTURAL FIT  Teva said it had approached Allergan a year ago but did not generate interest. It then went after Mylan, which repeatedly rebuffed its offers, and only turned its attention back to Allergan earlier this month. In June 2014, Vigodman hired Sigurdur Olafsson, former head of Actavis's generic drug business, to fill a similar role at Teva.""My sense always was that Mylan was Teva's Plan B,"" said Benny Landa, an industrialist who led an investor bid last year to shake up Teva's board, calling the deal ""brilliant.""Teva will pay $33.75 billion in cash and $6.75 billion in shares, representing a 10 percent stake in the Israel-based company, Teva said. It expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2016.Vigodman said the combined company will have proforma revenue of $26 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $9.5 billion in 2016.""This acquisition reinforces our strategy, accelerates growth and diversifies revenues both by product and geographically, supporting our new business model,"" he said.Teva, which will gain a portfolio of more than 1,000 products, forecast a double-digit boost to adjusted earnings per share in 2016 and a more than 20 percent benefit in years two and three after closing the deal.It expects cost synergies and tax savings of $1.4 billion annually by the third anniversary from efficiencies in operations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.It also expects the acquisition to generate free cash flow of $6.5 billion in 2016 and increased free cash flow in subsequent years.

Paulson said that Perrigo would add to Mylan earnings based on cost savings alone and that combining generic drugs and over-the-counter medicines would create growth.In its client note, ISS criticized the combination as dilutive and said it would likely take years for these benefits to materialize. Paulson also disclosed on Friday that the firm had purchased about 2.1 million Perrigo shares in a range of $188.24 to $192.08 on Thursday.Two other proxy advisory firms earlier this week advised Mylan shareholders to vote for the deal, which is up for approval at Mylan's Aug. 28 shareholder meeting. Institutional shareholders typically follow proxy firm recommendations. Mylan's biggest shareholder, Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), said in June it would vote with Mylan. Mylan made a cash and stock offer now worth about $200 per share in April, saying the Dublin-based generic and over-the-counter drugmaker would be a strategic fit. Perrigo has repeatedly rejected the offer, saying it can do better on its own.Mylan has stuck to its pursuit and on Thursday lowered the bar to move forward on a takeover to receiving just over 50 percent of Perrigo shares in the tender offer. That size stake would allow control of Perrigo's board, and after that Mylan would need to increase its stake to more than 80 percent in order to consolidate operations.ISS said in the note that the offer was ""not a compelling acquisition strategy."" In order to approve the proposal, shareholders must believe that the deal has synergies beyond what Mylan has revealed and that the acquisition will occur at the current price despite lack of support among Perrigo shareholders, it said. ISS said that since the acquisition would dilute shares, that the deal is not expected to add to earnings until 2019 and that Mylan does not have the leverage it needs to increase its stake above 80 percent, the proposal is not warranted. Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said the ISS report misunderstands or underestimates key aspects of the transaction such as the opportunity for value creation and synergies.

In order to approve the proposal, shareholders must believe that the deal has synergies beyond what Mylan has revealed and that the acquisition will occur at the current price despite lack of support among Perrigo shareholders, it said.ISS said that since the acquisition would dilute shares, that the deal is not expected to add to earnings until 2019 and that Mylan does not have the leverage it needs to increase its stake above 80 percent, the proposal is not warranted.Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said the ISS report misunderstands or underestimates key aspects of the transaction such as the opportunity for value creation and synergies.Mylan shares were up slightly at $54.28 on Friday afternoon while Perrigo shares were up 1.1 percent at $194.70.(Additional reporting by Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",2015-08-14,MYL,"Fri Aug 14, 2015 | 2:30pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Proxy firm urges Mylan investors vote 'no'; Paulson backs deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/perrigo-company-ma-mylan-nl-idUSL1N10P0XE20150814?type=companyNews
189,"  NEW YORK Aug 14 ISS Proxy Advisory Services on Friday recommended that its institutional investor clients vote against Mylan NV's $34 billion hostile takeover offer of Perrigo Co saying that it would result in significant dilution.ISS's recommendation veered in the opposite direction from two other proxy advisory firms which earlier this week advised clients to vote for the deal.Mylan shareholders will vote at an Aug. 28 meeting on whether to pursue a tender offer for Perrigo shares. Mylan said on Thursday that it would go forward with the deal if it received more than 50 percent of shares through the tender offer. That would give the company control of Perrigo's board, and after that it would need to increase its stake to more than 80 percent in order to consolidate the company. Given that the acquisition would dilute shares, that the deal is not expected to add to earnings until 2019 and that Mylan does not have the leverage it needs to increase its stake above 80 percent, ISS said the proposal is not warranted.

191,"   By Bill Berkrot and Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Perrigo Co Plc's (PRGO.N) chief executive expressed confidence on Tuesday that his company's shareholders will reject rival generic drugmaker Mylan NV's hostile takeover attempt, and said the offer is not close to what it would take to get a deal done.Mylan (MYL.O) shareholders are set to vote on Friday on whether the company should move forward with the Perrigo bid, whose value has declined with the recent market sell-off. If more than half vote ""yes,"" Mylan plans to take its cash and stock offer directly to Perrigo shareholders. Mylan has said that if just over 50 percent of Perrigo shareholders tender their shares, it will take control of the Dublin-based company. It had aimed for 80 percent of shareholders but lowered that to the bare minimum of just over 50 percent to gain control, an option under Irish takeover laws.""Based on what I've heard from shareholders they are not going to get 80 percent of Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares and they are not going to get 50 percent of Perrigo shareholders tendering their shares. I do not believe they are going to get to either threshold,"" Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa said in a telephone interview.He shrugged off the Aug. 28 vote by Mylan shareholders. ""If they get their vote, they get their vote.""  It is unclear if more than 50 percent of Mylan shareholders will back the deal. Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Mylan's largest shareholder with a stake of more than 14 percent, and hedge fund Paulson & Co, which owns just under 5 percent, have said they back the deal. Influential proxy advisory firm ISS weighed in against it.Mylan, whose shares closed at $49.11 on Tuesday, said in a press release on Tuesday that it believes its deal will gain   approval from both its shareholders and Perrigo shareholders.  With the recent plunge in world markets, shares of both Perrigo and Netherlands-based Mylan have suffered, lowering the overall value of the offer for Perrigo to about $192 per share from about $205. ""That's not even close,"" Papa said, referring to what it would take for the Perrigo board to recommend the deal it has unanimously rejected. ""I have no problem to use words substantially undervaluing us as a company,” said Papa, whose company's shares closed at $178 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. ""There's no logical reason to go forward here. It will reduce the price to earnings multiple of Perrigo. Our PE multiple is substantially higher than the PE multiple of the Mylan company.""Earlier this month, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch called its offer ""fair and compelling"" and said it was not looking to alter the terms. Papa said he does not believe the recent sell-off in the Chinese and other markets will hurt Perrigo's business. The company sells over-the-counter (OTC) consumer products, generic topical medicines, and animal health products.""OTC drugs, where we have about 75 percent of our sales, are going to do extraordinarily well despite what happens with economies of China or Asia or anywhere else in the world,"" Papa said.Asked if the market correction might make small acquisitions more attractive, Papa said, ""I do think there will be more opportunities.""

Perrigo shareholders have until Nov. 13 to accept. Under Irish takeover rules, Mylan needs 80 percent of shareholders' votes to take control of Perrigo.Chairman Robert Coury said Mylan should receive at least 50 percent and Mylan will run Perrigo as a separate entity if it receives more than 50 percent but less than 80 percent.""As long as Mylan's share price is going up the opportunity becomes larger and larger and larger,"" Coury told reporters in Israel, where Mylan's shares began trading on Wednesday.""People don't tender until the last 24 hours so we have quite a very very strong chance for a lot of activity in the last week.""

248,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Generic drug maker Mylan NV's (MYL.O) $26 billion hostile bid for peer Perrigo Company Plc (PRGO.N) looked unlikely to succeed late on Thursday, a few hours before it was set to expire, according to people familiar with the matter.If confirmed, the outcome would represent a major victory for Perrigo's defiant Chief Executive Joseph Papa, and a bitter blow to Mylan's Executive Chairman Robert Coury, who snubbed an acquisition offer from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) to pursue Perrigo. Around 40 percent of Perrigo's ordinary shares had been tendered ten hours before the tender offer was due to expire on Friday, significantly short of Mylan's acceptance threshold of more than 50 percent, the people said.While more shares could still be tendered, many large institutional investors would have tendered their shares at this stage if they were going to accept the offer, the people added.  The sources declined to be identified because the tally is not yet official. Perrigo declined to comment, while representatives for Mylan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mylan, which first made a bid for Perrigo in April, went hostile in September, offering $75 in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share. The deal's rejection will now focus investors' attention on Perrigo's standalone strategy. Papa has said he is open to dealmaking, and sources familiar with the matter said earlier on Thursday Perrigo had held merger talks with Endo International Plc (ENDP.O) earlier in the fall.Perrigo reported a better-than-expected profit for the third quarter last month, and said it would lay off 6 percent of its global workforce and buy back shares worth $2 billion. Mylan had used a Dutch poison pill-style defense to fight a $40 billion takeover by Teva, arguing that a deal was ""without sound industrial logic or cultural fit"" and that it would face regulatory hurdles.Coury said last week that, while the purchase of Perrigo was good for both companies, Mylan could survive without it. He pointed to the very strong market position of EpiPen, Mylan's biggest-selling branded product, which treats emergency anaphylactic reactions to allergens.

Perrigo's announcement in May that it was cutting its forecast unleashed skepticism about Papa's tenure at Perrigo.

291,"   By Brendan Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Mylan NV faced new scrutiny over price hikes for its anti-allergy EpiPen on Tuesday, with U.S. lawmakers calling for a probe of oversight of the company's rebates to government healthcare plans, while West Virginia said it was investigating whether Mylan defrauded its Medicaid department.Mylan is grappling with a growing backlash from U.S. consumers, lawmakers and prosecutors over EpiPen prices, which have risen from about $100 in 2007 to more than $600 for a pair of the devices. The EpiPen delivers a dose of epinephrine, an antidote to a severe and potentially deadly allergic reaction to anything from nuts to bee stings.The rising cost has made it difficult for many families to afford, prompting a public outcry that has resonated with  legislators.Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch is to testify about EpiPen price hikes on Wednesday before an oversight committee of the House of Representatives. Bresch is the daughter of Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia.In her written prepared testimony, released on Tuesday, Bresch said Mylan was already moving to address concerns about price by expanding discount programs and launching a $300 generic version. She also said that, after rebates, fees and costs, the company makes only about $100 per EpiPen pack, and that a majority of consumers pay less than $50 out of pocket for a pack.Ahead of the hearing, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee said they were concerned that Mylan was allowed to inappropriately classify EpiPen as a generic drug, reducing the potential discounts to the government's Medicaid health program for the poor.""We are concerned that the controls in place, if any, are inadequate to ensure that Medicaid is receiving the full amount of rebates afforded to it by law,"" the Senate Republicans, led by Orrin Hatch of Utah, said in a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General. Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are subject to a rebate of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price for Medicaid. Non-innovator drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate.The Finance Committee Republicans are asking Inspector General Daniel Levinson to examine the federal health agency's oversight of the rebate program. Mylan has said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding rebates.Also on Tuesday, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said he was investigating the rebates and the possibility that Mylan violated the state's antitrust law when it sued and settled with a would-be generic competitor.Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said the company was cooperating with the investigation.EpiPen has also posed a cost burden to the federal Medicare health program for the elderly, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group.

Mylan is grappling with a growing backlash from U.S. consumers, lawmakers and prosecutors over EpiPen prices, which have risen from about $100 in 2007 to more than $600 for a pair of the devices. The EpiPen delivers a dose of epinephrine, an antidote to a severe and potentially deadly allergic reaction to anything from nuts to bee stings.The rising cost has made it difficult for many families to afford EpiPens, prompting a public outcry that has resonated with legislators.    Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch is to testify about the price hikes on Wednesday before an oversight committee of the House of Representatives. Bresch is the daughter of Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia.In her prepared testimony, released on Tuesday, Bresch said Mylan was already moving to address concerns about price by expanding discount programs and launching a $300 generic version.She said that, after rebates, fees and costs, the company makes only about $100 per EpiPen pack, and that a majority of consumers pay less than $50 out of pocket for a pack.     Ahead of the hearing, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee said they were concerned that Mylan was allowed to inappropriately classify EpiPen as a generic drug, reducing the potential discounts to the government’s Medicaid health program for the poor.    “We are concerned that the controls in place, if any, are inadequate to ensure that Medicaid is receiving the full amount of rebates afforded to it by law,” the Senate Republicans, led by Orrin Hatch of Utah, said in a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General.    Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are subject to a rebate of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price for Medicaid. Non-innovator drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate. The Finance Committee Republicans are asking Inspector General Daniel Levinson to examine the federal health agency's oversight of the rebate program.    Mylan has said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding rebates.    Also on Tuesday, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said he was investigating the rebates and the possibility that Mylan violated the state's antitrust law when it sued and settled with a would-be generic competitor.    Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said the company was cooperating with the investigation.     EpiPen has also posed a cost burden to the federal Medicare health program for the elderly, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group. Before rebates, EpiPen costs for Medicare Part D shot up more than 1,000 percent between 2007 and 2014, from $7 million to $87.9 million, the report said. Devlin, in an emailed statement, said that from 2010 to 2015, rebates to Medicare Part D plans were up 440 percent, which would reduce the increase stated by the Kaiser Family report. She said that any analysis that does not take those specific rebates into account is fundamentally flawed.While rebates to Medicare, which are not disclosed by the program, would have offset the cost to a degree, it was still far higher than a 164 percent increase in EpiPen prescriptions to Medicare patients, the Kaiser Family report said.

303,"   By Brendan Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Mylan NV (MYL.O) faced new scrutiny over price hikes for its anti-allergy EpiPen on Tuesday, with U.S. lawmakers calling for a probe of oversight of the company’s rebates to government healthcare plans, while West Virginia said it was investigating whether Mylan defrauded its Medicaid department.    Mylan is grappling with a growing backlash from U.S. consumers, lawmakers and prosecutors over EpiPen prices, which have risen from about $100 in 2007 to more than $600 for a pair of the devices. The EpiPen delivers a dose of epinephrine, an antidote to a severe and potentially deadly allergic reaction to anything from nuts to bee stings.The rising cost has made it difficult for many families to afford EpiPens, prompting a public outcry that has resonated with legislators.    Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch is to testify about the price hikes on Wednesday before an oversight committee of the House of Representatives. Bresch is the daughter of Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia.In her prepared testimony, released on Tuesday, Bresch said Mylan was already moving to address concerns about price by expanding discount programs and launching a $300 generic version.She said that, after rebates, fees and costs, the company makes only about $100 per EpiPen pack, and that a majority of consumers pay less than $50 out of pocket for a pack.     Ahead of the hearing, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee said they were concerned that Mylan was allowed to inappropriately classify EpiPen as a generic drug, reducing the potential discounts to the government’s Medicaid health program for the poor.    “We are concerned that the controls in place, if any, are inadequate to ensure that Medicaid is receiving the full amount of rebates afforded to it by law,” the Senate Republicans, led by Orrin Hatch of Utah, said in a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General.    Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are subject to a rebate of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price for Medicaid. Non-innovator drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate. The Finance Committee Republicans are asking Inspector General Daniel Levinson to examine the federal health agency's oversight of the rebate program.    Mylan has said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding rebates.    Also on Tuesday, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said he was investigating the rebates and the possibility that Mylan violated the state's antitrust law when it sued and settled with a would-be generic competitor.    Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said the company was cooperating with the investigation.     EpiPen has also posed a cost burden to the federal Medicare health program for the elderly, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group. Before rebates, EpiPen costs for Medicare Part D shot up more than 1,000 percent between 2007 and 2014, from $7 million to $87.9 million, the report said. Devlin, in an emailed statement, said that from 2010 to 2015, rebates to Medicare Part D plans were up 440 percent, which would reduce the increase stated by the Kaiser Family report. She said that any analysis that does not take those specific rebates into account is fundamentally flawed.While rebates to Medicare, which are not disclosed by the program, would have offset the cost to a degree, it was still far higher than a 164 percent increase in EpiPen prescriptions to Medicare patients, the Kaiser Family report said.

Mylan, which acquired the product in 2007, has raised the list price for a pair of EpiPens to $600 from about $100 in 2008.Lawmakers are trying to determine whether Mylan made more money on EpiPen than warranted from state Medicaid programs by having it classified as a generic product, resulting in much smaller rebates to the government health plans.Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch testified last week under oath that Mylan pockets roughly $100 for a two-pen pack. She did not state that the figure included taxes, which the company acknowledged on Monday.The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Mylan had significantly reduced its calculation of EpiPen profits by applying the statutory U.S. tax rate of 37.5 percent. Mylan's overall effective tax rate was 7.4 percent in 2015 and 4.2 percent in 2014, according to annual regulatory filings.Lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last week excoriated Bresch for raising the price of EpiPen sixfold since 2008 and were skeptical of her profit analysis.""We didn't believe Mylan's numbers last week during their CEO's testimony, and we don't believe them this week either,"" Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Monday. Mylan said on Monday it was standard practice to include taxes in a profitability analysis and to use the U.S. statutory rate when analyzing income in that country. It filed a copy of the analysis with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.""Just as we did not use a blended global tax rate, we also did not allocate corporate expenses associated with running the business, which would have further reduced its profitability,"" Nina Devlin, a Mylan spokeswoman, said in an email. Mylan has tried to stem criticism by offering more discounts to consumers. An increasing number of families have said that the treatment has become unaffordable.

317,"   By Deena Beasley  Mylan NV (MYL.O) on Friday said it will pay $465 million to settle questions of whether it underpaid U.S. government healthcare programs by misclassifying its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, which has come under intense scrutiny after a series of drastic price increases.Mylan has been lambasted by consumers and lawmakers for raising prices on the lifesaving EpiPen sixfold to over $600 for a package of two in less than a decade, making the devices unaffordable for a growing number of families.Lawmakers were trying to determine whether Mylan made more money on EpiPen than warranted from state Medicaid programs by having it classified as a generic product, resulting in much smaller rebates to the government health plans.Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch was grilled by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for the price increase and they were skeptical of her profit analysis of the product.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in response to a request from U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said this week that the Medicaid plan for the poor spent $797 million on EpiPen between 2011 and 2015, including rebates provided by Mylan, or $960 million before rebates.Lawmakers have contended that Mylan underpaid Medicaid rebates by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic instead of a branded drug. The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum 23.1 percent for a branded drug. ""I am glad the Department of Justice pursued this so quickly,"" Klobuchar said in a statement. ""If other drugs are misclassified, and surely EpiPen isn't the only one ... the taxpayers need to get their money back.""Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut blasted the settlement as too small and said Congress should investigate whether Mylan violated the law. ""This settlement is a shadow of what it should be - lacking real accountability for Mylan’s apparent lawbreaking,"" he said in a statement.Mylan said in a regulatory filing on Friday that EpiPen will be classified as a branded drug as of April 1, 2017. Bresch told lawmakers this week that Mylan plans to launch a $300 generic version of EpiPen as soon as possible this year.Mylan also lowered its 2016 earnings outlook, but the drugmaker affirmed its 2018 forecast and its shares rose 11 percent to $39.90 after hours.""Kudos to management for fast action,"" AB Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a video message to investors. ""This was one of the major risks everyone was focusing on ... now it is essentially off the table."" Mylan said it will record a pretax charge of about $465 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The company, which will make the payment to the Department of Justice and other government agencies, said the settlement does not include any finding of wrongdoing.Mylan, citing changes to the EpiPen consumer discount program and upcoming launch of a generic version, said it now expects full-year 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $4.70 to $4.90, down from $4.85 to $5.15.Mylan said it ""remains committed"" to its target of at least $6.00 in adjusted earnings per share in 2018.

320,"   By Deena Beasley  Privately held drugmaker Kaleo Inc announced on Wednesday plans for a U.S. relaunch of its Auvi-Q injector for life-threatening allergic reactions in the first half of next year.Auvi-Q, designed to deliver the same epinephrine drug as Mylan NV's EpiPen, was recalled from the market last year amid concerns about accuracy of the dosage delivered.French pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA had licensed and made Auvi-Q, but it returned rights to the product to Kaleo in February after the recall.Mylan has come under fire from lawmakers and consumer groups for raising the list price for a pair of EpiPens to more than $600 this year from $100 in 2007 when Mylan acquired the product.Mylan said last month it plans to launch, at a list price of $300, its own generic EpiPen by the end of this year. Officials at Kaleo declined to comment on a planned list price for the relaunched Auvi-Q.""We are working on what is the right price to assure that the ultimate patient co-pay is low,"" Kaleo Chief Executive Officer Spencer Williamson told Reuters in a telephone interview. Unlike the pen-shaped EpiPen, Auvi-Q, which includes a voice prompt system to guide users, is the length and width of a credit card with the thickness of a small cellphone. The Kaleo device also has a needle that automatically retracts after the device has been used.Williamson said Auvi-Q will be manufactured at an automated robotic production line located in the Midwestern United States. Kaleo also sells Evzio, a hand-held device designed to automatically deliver a set dose of naloxone, a drug approved to treat an overdose of opioid painkillers.Evzio has a current list price of $3,750 for two active devices and one training device.

321,"   By Caroline Humer and Ruthy Munoz | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Mylan NV's price hikes on EpiPens have added millions to U.S. Department of Defense spending since 2008 as the agency covered more prescriptions for the lifesaving allergy shot at near retail prices, government data provided to Reuters shows.Pentagon spending rose to $57 million over the past year from $9 million in 2008 - an increase driven both by volume and by price hikes that had a bigger bite on prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies, according to the previously unreported data.The Pentagon gets a government discount on EpiPens dispensed at military treatment facilities and by mail order. But nearly half of its spending was at retail pharmacies where it most recently paid an average of $509 for EpiPen and $528 for EpiPen Jr two-packs - three times higher than its discounted rate, the data shows.That may change. Both the Pentagon and Mylan told Reuters that discussions are underway that could extend the military discount to EpiPens filled at retail pharmacies through the use of rebates.Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment on the specific Department of Defense spending. She said in an emailed statement that talks were underway to address ""any questions or concerns from the agency.""She declined to say if any repayment was on the table.A Reuters analysis of the data estimated a difference of about $54 million between what the agency paid for EpiPens at retail pharmacies from 2009 through 2016 and what it would have paid at military clinics.Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch has drawn public scrutiny for raising the U.S. list price on a pack of two injectors nearly six-fold to $600 since 2008.Affordability has become a bigger issue with the increased diagnosis and awareness of food allergies. Families who rely on EpiPens to safeguard their children against possibly fatal allergic reactions often purchase several to carry with them, keep at school and with caregivers.In response to the criticism, Mylan is providing more families with coupons to pay for EpiPens and plans to market a half-price version. The drugmaker also agreed to pay $465 million to settle questions over whether the Medicaid program for the poor overpaid because EpiPens were classified as a generic treatment, a category that allows manufacturers to give smaller rebates to government agencies.While Medicaid providers don't take issue with the increased use of EpiPens, they have bristled over the price hikes.""The rate of increases in their cost is not justifiable,""  said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, which runs Medicaid plans in California and 11 other states. (For graphic of Pentagon spending on EpiPen, click tmsnrt.rs/2eg5Qi2)  THE FULL PICTURE The impact of Mylan's price hikes on government health programs, such as Medicaid, has been obscured by highly complex pharmaceutical pricing and opaque negotiations.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as several large state Medicaid programs, have released partial details on their spending, saying full information on rebates is confidential under U.S. law. Without such details, it is impossible to discern what price an agency is paying for EpiPen. At Reuters' request, the Defense Department provided the most comprehensive picture of EpiPen spending by a government agency, including fiscal year expenditures since 2008, average price per pack and the number of prescriptions filled by type of dispensing location for all EpiPens obtained by military service members, their families and retirees.The department's spending on EpiPens has increased fivefold since 2008, far outpacing the 130 percent growth in prescriptions, the data shows.Defense spending on the injectors at retail pharmacies - which accounted for 53,500 of 226,000 EpiPen prescriptions for the last fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 - has grown more than tenfold, to $28 million from $2.4 million in 2008.While EpiPen spending represents a fraction of a percent of the Defense Department's $49 billion annual healthcare budget, the data illustrates the premium it was paying for EpiPens at retail outlets.""Lawmakers would not be terribly happy to hear that DoD is paying more at retail,"" said Brian Bruen, a drug economics researcher at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health.  DISCOUNT BY DEFINITION The Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs, typically pay among the lowest drug prices in the country because of discounts mandated by law, as well as rebates negotiated with drugmakers, Bruen said.Indeed, the Pentagon has paid $173 for an EpiPen two-pack filled through mail order and $169 at military facilities in  fiscal year 2016.A key factor for government discounts is whether a drug is patent protected and has market exclusivity, or it is a generic, made cheaper by competition.The EpiPen, which packages a generic allergy antidote in a patented, easy-to-use injector, is somewhat of a hybrid. For the Defense Department, pharmaceutical companies pay rebates on brand name drugs dispensed by retail pharmacies, reducing the final cost to the agency's discounted rate.EpiPen's classification as a generic drug prevents it from receiving mandated rebates. Mylan provided documentation it said showed the military had accepted the generic classification for EpiPen in 2008.Under Mylan's settlement with the federal government, Medicaid will classify EpiPen as a branded drug, Devlin said. That will qualify Medicaid for a 23 percent rebate, up from the 13 percent it gets on generics. Any price hikes will be capped at the inflation rate, a protection not afforded generic drug purchases.""It was always our intention that the reclassification would benefit all government agencies impacted by the classification, including the VA and Tricare (Defense) programs,"" Devlin said.

Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The internal watchdog at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned the office tasked with administering federal health insurance programs that Mylan NV's EpiPen was improperly classified as a generic drug in 2009, Senator Charles Grassley said on Tuesday.In a press release, Grassley's office said the HHS Inspector General confirmed in discussions with Senate aides that the watchdog office notified the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about the problematic classification, which was highlighted in a report. Mylan said last month it intends to pay $465 million to settle with the U.S. Justice Department over charges it misclassified the EpiPen as a generic instead of a branded drug, thereby underpaying rebates owed to state and federal Medicaid programs.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment to Reuters on the purported settlement, though a Senate aide said Grassley's office was previously told by the department that no deal with Mylan had been finalized.A settlement will be the subject of a Nov. 30 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Grassley chairs. HHS Inspector General Daniel Levinson, as well as officials from the Justice Department, the Centers and Mylan have all been invited to testify.

However the U.S. Justice Department and other agencies have yet to confirm any such agreement.The dispute involves the classification of EpiPen as a generic rather than a branded product, which led to significantly smaller rebates to state Medicaid programs.Mylan has been under investigation and faced harsh criticism over steep price increases for its life-saving auto-injector used for severe allergic reactions.Chief Executive Heather Bresch, on a conference call with analysts, said high deductible health plans and pricing pressure had created U.S. headwinds for its business.""We wish we had better anticipated the acceleration of rising out-of-pocket costs"" for our customers, she said.With the distraction of the U.S. presidential election over, Bresch said she hoped to be part of a discussion aimed at finding solutions to better transparency around the complexities of drug pricing. Mylan's announcement earlier this year of a near doubling of the price for a pair of EpiPen injectors to $600 set off a firestorm of criticism from parents, politicians and patient advocates.  The company said it expects EpiPen to account for 6 percent of total sales in 2017.Mylan has virtually had the market for emergency allergy auto-injectors to itself. However, competition is coming.      Last month, privately held Kaleo Inc announced plans for a U.S. relaunch of its Auvi-Q injector in the first half of next year following a product recall. While Mylan works to integrate recent acquisitions, Bresch said business development plans will focus on smaller bolt-on acquisitions, perhaps to enhance a particular therapeutic area.""It's buyer's market. I think there's great assets out there,"" Bresch said. ""We don't need to do any big acquisitions.""Mylan posted a net loss of $119.8 million for the third quarter, or 23 cents per share, compared with a profit of $428.6 million, or 83 cents per share, a year ago.Excluding items, such as the settlement expense, Mylan said it had adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share. Analysts on average expected $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mylan stuck with its recently lowered full-year forecast for adjusted earnings of $4.70 to $4.90 per share, and maintained its 2018 earnings projection of $6 per share.It said it expects to see generic drugs price erosion in the mid-single digits range for the rest of the year.Revenue for the quarter of $3.06 billion was just short of Wall Street estimates of $3.12 billion.

348,"   By Lewis Krauskopf and Ben Hirschler | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON Pharmaceutical and biotechnology shares soared on Wednesday as Republican Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election calmed investor fears of tough action on drug pricing that has pressured the sector for more than a year.Hospital shares tumbled as a Republican sweep of Congress raised prospects for a rollback of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded the number of patients in government health plans.Fears of a win by Hillary Clinton and Democrats gaining power in Congress had clouded the outlook for biotech and pharma shares and contributed to general underperformance for the U.S. healthcare sector this year.On Wednesday, the stocks also were fueled by the defeat of a Californian ballot proposal aimed at reining in rising prices for prescription drugs.Clinton ""not being in the White House removes the notion of some sort of price controls off the table,"" said Tony Butler, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities in New York. ""From the perspective of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, generic (drug) stocks, (the election) went about as well as could be expected.""Shares of drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) rose 8.5 percent and biotech Celgene (CELG.O) jumped 10.4 percent, while specialty drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK.N) surged 10 percent.  European drug stocks also gained, with Switzerland's Roche (ROG.S) and France's Sanofi (SASY.PA) both rising more than 5 percent.The Nasdaq Biotechnology index .NBI advanced 9 percent and was on track for its biggest single-day gain in more than eight years.Biotech sentiment was also lifted by the prospect of Republican-led legislation to free up cash currently held overseas for tax reasons by large U.S. pharmaceutical companies. Analysts said that could pave the way for acquisitions in the sector.  Biotech and pharmaceutical investors have been on edge since September 2015, when Clinton tweeted about specialty drug ""price gouging."" Over that time, Nasdaq-listed biotech shares had lost more than one-fourth of their value through Tuesday.Trump has said less on the topic. But he has suggested support for importation of cheaper drugs and advocated increased scrutiny over drug price increases and a bigger role for negotiating down the cost of medicines.Some Republican lawmakers have also seized on high drug prices in the past year, including for Mylan's (MYL.O) EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, suggesting the issue may not go away.  Even with a Trump administration, ""we do believe there is an overall shift toward greater pricing scrutiny that will continue to reduce potential revenue growth purely from price increases,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note.Shares of hospital chains Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) and HCA Holdings (HCA.N) tumbled 25 percent and 12 percent, respectively, while health insurer Centene (CNC.N), which specializes in the government's Medicaid health program that was expanded under the healthcare law, dropped 17.3 percent. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal/replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick said in a research note.

349,"  Perrigo Co Plc reported a higher-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and said it would review strategic options for royalty rights from sales of multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri.Shares of the Dublin-based company, which specializes in generic and over-the-counter drugs, were up about 4 percent at $86.75 in premarket trading on Thursday.Perrigo has been under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP to make changes - including exploring options for Tysabri - that will boost its stock price.Starboard disclosed a 4.6 percent stake in Perrigo in September. The company's stock had lost about 42 percent of its value through Wednesday's close of $83.51 and the company has cut its earnings forecast twice.Perrigo has blamed much of its troubles on former Chief Executive Joseph Papa who convinced investors to reject a $205 per share cash-and-stock bid from Mylan NV, worth about $26 billion when it was rejected last November. Papa, now CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, said Perrigo would be better off on its own.Perrigo recognized $93 million of royalty revenue in the third quarter related to global net sales of Tysabri. The drug is marketed through a partnership with Biogen Inc, which paid more than $300 million in royalties to Perrigo.Perrigo, run by CEO John Hendrickson, has hired Morgan Stanley as financial adviser to lead the review process for Tysabri. Royalty Pharma, a privately held company that specializes in acquiring drug royalties, is among potential buyers, Reuters reported in September, citing people familiar with the matter.Perrigo reported a net loss of $1.26 billion, or $8.76 per share, for the third quarter ended Oct. 1, compared with a profit of $113 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. The net loss includes a goodwill impairment charge of $804 million and a brand intangible assets impairment charge of $866 million related to its $3 billion acquisition of Belgian over-the-counter drugmaker Omega Pharma.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.80 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.58, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 1 percent to $1.35 billion, including sales of $22 million from held-for-sale businesses. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $1.28 billion.The company said it expected to report a net loss of $9.04 to $9.34 per share for all of 2016.

351,"   By Laura Benitez  LONDON, Nov 14 (IFR) - US pharmaceuticals AbbVie and Mylan have set their sights on Europe's bond market to sell debut euro bonds, taking advantage of positive sentiment for the sector after last week's unexpected Donald Trump victory in the US election.Bonds in that space were among the biggest gainers last Wednesday as investors looked to pick potential beneficiaries of the policies of a Trump presidency and his more lenient views on drugs pricing.However, the two issuers will have to contend with a volatile market backdrop, where government bonds have brutally sold off as investors fear that monetary easing may come to an end.After meeting investors last week, AbbVie is selling a triple-tranche euro deal today, expected to total around 3bn in size, while Mylan is planning its return to the market after withdrawing its potential debut euro in September.TRICKY TIMING These trades - and euro-denominated bond issuance in general - are expected to come at a price this week, due to increased European rates volatility. The 10-year German Bund yield rose to its highest level since January. It has jumped from 0.15% to 0.37% in the last week alone.""It's a very tough market and the AbbVie deal is looking very cheap for investors right now,"" one banker said. ""The huge moves in rates are worrying investors and making them defensive,"" one banker said.AbbVie started marketing a three-year tranche at 70bp area, a long seven-year at 110bp area and a 12-year at 135bp area, all over mid-swaps. This was revised to 55bp-70bp, 100bp area and 125bp-130bp,  respectively.Higher Bund yields and the approaching year-end are also forcing investors to reduce risk at the long end of the curve.""We like the credit but the volatility in rates leaves us on the sidelines in the near term,"" said one UK based portfolio manager.""There is a rush to get many of these deals done by year-end, and ahead of Thanksgiving, but [I'm] not sure there will be huge appetite from investors until the Bund curve stabilises."" Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan are bookrunners on the deal, with Morgan Stanley also acting as global coordinator.The deal follows European fixed income investor meetings that were held from November 9.SECOND TIME LUCKY?  Mylan is also trying to cash in on the post-election pharmaceutical rally to return to the European market for a debut euro.The US company met investors from September 7-9 for a potential benchmark multi-tranche debut offering, rumoured to be around 3bn in size.It decided not to proceed with its euro bond plans after it came under intense scrutiny for sharply raising the price of its EpiPen allergy auto-injector.The company has continued to court controversy with the US Senate Judiciary Committee urging federal antitrust regulators to launch a probe into whether it broke the law by preventing schools from purchasing competing allergy treatments .""This could be a tough one, given DoJ investigation headlines regarding potential collusion in generic drug pricing,"" another investor said.""It's very difficult to prejudge the outcome but our concern is this has the potential to threaten its investment-grade ratings.""The borrower has indicated its intention to sell a multi-tranche benchmark transaction, comprising a two-year FRN and four, eight and/or 12-year fixed-rate notes.Rated Baa3/BBB-/BBB-, Mylan has mandated Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, ING and JP Morgan for the upcoming deal.

355,"   By Laura Benitez and Hillary Flynn  LONDON, Nov 21 (IFR) - Corporate borrowers on both sides of the Atlantic shrugged off concerns about global volatility last week with pharmaceutical companies leading the charge, although they had to pay significantly higher premiums.Bond markets have been badly shaken since the US election, with Donald Trump's victory accelerating a sell-off in rates sparked by fears that his expansionary fiscal policies will weaken US government finances.But some investment-grade corporates in both the US and Europe have launched deals partly because things may get even worse, and partly because they are more sensitive to spreads than rates - with cash spreads proving more resilient than yields.""It's a day-by-day market and funding opportunities remain, but with only limited chances for borrowers to comfortably issue before the break, the question is how many 2016 corporate funding exercises will now get pushed back into next year,"" said Mark Lynagh, head of European corporate DCM at BNP Paribas.However, pharmaceutical companies spotted an opportunity, with the industry relieved that Hillary Clinton, who campaigned to bring down drug prices, lost the election. Companies such as Teva, Allergan and Mylan had seen their spreads tighten following the election.Mylan (Baa3/BBB-/BBB-) was one of two US pharmaceuticals issuing reverse Yankees last week, selling a 3bn four-tranche trade. It followed a 3.6bn triple-tranche deal from Abbvie (Baa2/A-) last Monday.Mylan hit the market after withdrawing a potential euro deal in September, when it came under intense scrutiny for sharply raising the price of its EpiPen allergy auto-injector. Abbvie's deal paved the way for its return.""The market needed a pragmatic US borrower like Abbvie selling a well-sized bond to give  some confidence during the unstable backdrop,"" another banker said. Both companies, though, had to offer generous concessions to lure investors with their debut euro offerings. The deals came about 25bp back of their US dollar curves, taking into account the cross-currency swap.Bankers thought both companies' decision to issue 12-year notes as part of their transactions was misguided given the back-up in rates, with lower-rated Mylan, in particular, coming in for stick.While Abbvie and Mylan turned to euros, other healthcare issuers went to the dollar market instead.Pfizer sold a US$6bn bond on a difficult day when the sell-off in Treasuries finally began to impact on the primary market. The deal last Monday was slow to price as 10-year Treasuries reached 2.30% and the 30-year yield nudged over 3% for the first time since the beginning of the year.But the bond - Pfizer's largest since 2009 - got done on the back of a US$14bn book.""People are seeing this sector rally and wondering how far it will go now that Trump is President-elect,"" one investor told IFR. ""Now is the time to get in.""Pfizer's strong book and subsequent performance in secondary - the bonds tightened on the break - gave other healthcare names the confidence to come to market. Abbott Laboratories, for example, finally decided to sell bonds to finance its US$25bn acquisition of St Jude on Thursday. The deal had been in the pipeline for months.The medical device maker issued US$15.1bn through six tranches. Leads were able to tighten pricing across the curve after amassing a US$34.6bn order book.This came despite investor concerns about higher leverage for a company that could soon drop sharply from its Single A ratings after targeting both St Jude and Alere for purchase.  Pricing, however, reflected that falling ratings trajectory, with leads offering investors a new issue concession of 15bp. The bonds are expected to be rated Baa3/BBB-.""That's a good sign of the health of the market that a low Triple B got US$15.1bn done. There were some reservations about how the market would react to the rates move but getting this deal through shows it's strong,"" a lead banker said.  COUGHING UP Issuance wasn't just restricted to pharmaceutical companies. Eastman Chemical became the third US company to issue in euros last week, with a 500m 10-year and 200m tap of its 550m 1.5% May 2023s.Like others during week, the borrower had to cough up, paying a hefty 30bp premium, but was still unable to tighten guidance from initial price thoughts. The order book size was undisclosed, which leads said was due to SEC regulations.A lead bank was bidding the 10-year at 130bp over swaps by Friday, after pricing it at 125bp on Wednesday.More deals are in the pipeline, though many in euros, at least, may get pushed into 2017. ""This year could set a record for the number of deals that have to get booted into the following year,"" said one banker.Corporate treasurers will be cognisant of commodity trader Louis Dreyfus, which pulled a five-year euro deal on Thursday, blaming a sharp increase in funding costs on volatile market conditions.

358,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Natalie Grover  Generic drugmaker Mylan NV (MYL.O), which has been under fire for price hikes on the life-saving EpiPen allergy treatment, said on Wednesday that it expected to cut less than 10 percent of its workforce in a restructuring to integrate acquisitions.Mylan, whose shares were down more than 3 percent in mid-afternoon trading, has been under investigation by the U.S. government, and its chief executive officer was called before Congress to testify on raising the price of a pair of EpiPens to more than $600 from $100 in 2008.The company said in a regulatory filing that it would implement restructuring programs in certain locations. At Tuesday's market close, its shares had fallen 25 percent since August, when it first came under public scrutiny by former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Mylan, which has about 35,000 employees, said in the filing that it would take cost-cutting measures, including job cuts, after a significant number of acquisitions. It bought Sweden's Meda earlier this year and Abbott Laboratories' (ABT.N) branded specialty and generics business in non-U.S. developed markets in 2015.The company said it would disclose costs and other details of the restructuring as it finalizes the plans. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment further.Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said that the move could have other motivations beyond integrating recent acquisitions.""Pricing pressure in the generic drug industry combined with generic threats on EpiPen in 2017 are also likely leading management to find more areas to cut costs and preserve profitability,” Waterhouse said. Mylan has been criticized for classifying EpiPen as a generic product, which led to its paying significantly smaller rebates to state Medicaid programs for the poor than if the drug were classified as branded. The company said in October that it would pay $465 million to settle questions on the impact of the classification on U.S. government healthcare costs.  Mylan, one of the largest U.S. generic-drug makers, last month reported a third-quarter loss. The Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based company said it expected EpiPen to account for 6 percent of total sales in 2017. It plans to introduce a generic version that will sell for $300 for a two-pack.Drug price increases were a hot political topic among U.S. presidential candidates during the past two years. President-elect Donald Trump in a Time magazine article published early on Wednesday said that he will ""bring down drug prices.""
