1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Comerica Incorporated's  (CMA) ratings at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation  reflects its prudent capital management, conservative risk appetite, and  consistency in financial performance.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch has affirmed current ratings and the Outlook remains Stable supported by  the company's above-peer tangible capital base, solid asset quality performance  and consistent performance. Capitalization levels are considered a rating  strength as well as consistent credit performance through various economic  cycles. Further, Fitch considers CMA's capital management to be conservative  given that the company has historically managed with higher capital levels than  peers. CMA's 10yr average TCE/TA ratio is 8.99% versus the peer group average of  6.84%. Similar to the industry, CMA has faced credit quality challenges, but  performance has been relatively good to date, reflecting the predominately  commercial composition of the loan book. Fitch notes the credit downturn was  tied more to real-estate assets. Nonetheless, the company's large C&I book,  which are typically more susceptible to economic downturns, has performed very  well despite exposure to Michigan's local economy and the auto industry. C&I  loans are roughly 57% of total loans. It is the highest share by a wide margin  relative to large regional peers, among which, on average, C&I accounted for 28%  of total loans.  Incorporated in Fitch's ratings is the view that CMA will continue to operate  with a higher level of capital versus its peers. As of June 30, 2014, CMA's  capital position is one of the highest of the peer group. Fitch believes CMA's  capital level is prudent given the relatively higher risk earning-asset base.  Fitch notes that prior to the credit downturn and historically, CMA tangible  common equity measures have much higher than other regional banks. CMA's 10-year  average TCE/TA ratio is 8.99% versus the peer group average of 6.84%. CMA's earnings continue to lag regional peers given the prolonged low rate  environment and slow recovery in the economy. Although CMA's earnings  performance is consistent and reflects a slight improved year-over-year, its  earnings profile remains in the lower end compared to most peers.  In Fitch's opinion, given the prolonged rate environment, CMA's future results  will likely remain in in-line with current performance reflecting CMA's asset  sensitive balance sheet. Offsetting, when rates do rise, CMA earnings should  benefit more than other peers boosting its current ROA and NIM. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT CMA's ratings are at the high-end of its rating potential given that financial  performance is marginally in-line with similarly rated financial institutions.  Although not anticipated, the ratings could be negatively affected if CMA were  to reduce capital below peer averages while maintaining similar loan mix within  a relatively short-time frame. Further, a payout ratio (including repurchase  activity) exceeding 100% would also put pressure on current ratings.  Additionally, a change to a more aggressive business strategy would also be  viewed negatively. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   CMA's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. The ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should CMA's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for CMA given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that CMA may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  CMA has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, CMA is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  CMA's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by CMA and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from CMA or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by CMA and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in CMA' VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of CMA's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Comerica  Bank are equalized the holding company.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of CMA to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in CMA's IDRs.  To the extent that CMA's subsidiary is not considered to be a core business,  Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating from CMA's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS CMA's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by CMA and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in CMA's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Comerica Incorporated --Long-term IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable;  --Senior debt at 'A'; --Subordinated debt at 'A-'; --Viability at 'a';     --Short-term IDR at 'F1';   --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Support at '5';     --Support floor at 'NF'.

Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch has affirmed CMA's ratings supported by the company's above-peer tangible  capital base, sound asset quality measures and consistent performance.  Capitalization levels are considered a rating strength as well as consistent  credit performance through various economic cycles. Further, Fitch considers  CMA's capital management to be conservative given that the company has  historically managed with higher capital levels than its peers. CMA's 10-year  average TCE/TA ratio is 8.99% versus the peer group average of 6.84%. CMA's Rating Outlook remains Stable. Although CMA has a relatively larger  exposure to energy (8% of total loans) versus its peers, Fitch believes the  company's long history in energy lending, proven track record through various  economic downturns and oil price dips, should translate into a manageable level  problem loans which are expected to be in-line with long-term nonperforming and  net charge-off (NCO) averages for its energy-related lending. CMA's NCOs for its  energy loan book peaked at 69bps in 2009. Fitch anticipates CMA may experience some negative credit migration due to its  energy exposure. CMA's provisions would likely continue to rise as a result of  increased classified and/or criticized loans.  Its credit measures are at  historical lows, and some reversion to normalized ranges should be expected. Similar to the industry, during the credit crisis CMA faced credit quality  challenges, but performance remained relatively stable, reflecting the  predominately commercial composition of the loan book. CMA's C&I loans are  roughly 57% of total loans, which is the highest share by a wide margin relative  to large regional peers (on average C&I accounted for 28% of peers' total  loans).

However, when rates do rise CMA's earnings should  benefit more than other peers thereby boosting its current ROA and NIM. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  CMA has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, CMA is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. The IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any potential support.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES CMA's subordinated debt is one notch below its VR of 'A-'. The company's trust  preferred securities are four notches below the VR reflecting two notches down  for loss severity and two notches down for non-performance. CMA's preferred  securities are rated five notches below its VR with two notches for loss  severity and three for non-performance. CMA's subordinated debt and other hybrid securities ratings are in accordance  with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments' non-performance and  loss severity risk profiles. Thus, these ratings have been affirmed due to the  affirmation of the VR. HOLDING COMPANY  CMA's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. The ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of CMA's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Comerica  Bank are equalized across the group.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS CMA's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt, because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR, VR, AND SENIOR DEBT CMA's ratings are at the high end of its rating potential given that financial  performance is marginally in-line with similarly rated financial institutions.  In Fitch's view, CMA's ratings are likely more sensitive to a sustained decline  in oil prices given its relatively larger than peer energy exposures. The  ratings and Outlook are Stable for now, but negative rating momentum could occur  should credit trends in the energy loan books, such as nonperforming loans and  NCOs, approach levels above long-term averages for energy-related lending.  Incorporated in Fitch's expectations is the view that provisions and classified  and/or criticized inflows will likely increase  Although not anticipated, the ratings could be negatively affected if CMA were  to reduce capital below peer averages without a corresponding increase in core  earnings. Further, a payout ratio (including repurchase activity) exceeding 100%  would also put pressure on current ratings. Additionally, a change to a more  aggressive business strategy would also be viewed negatively. Should capital levels be managed well below current levels without a  corresponding increase in core earnings, negative ratings action may ensue. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR CMA's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to the bank's  capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Comerica Incorporated's  (CMA) ratings at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Negative. The affirmation  reflects the bank's solid capital position, conservative risk culture, and  consistent financial performance. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes Comerica Incorporated (CMA), BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One  Finance Corporation (COF), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Fitch has affirmed CMA's ratings supported by the company's solid tangible  capital base, strong funding profile, proven credit performance through various  credit cycles and consistent performance. That said, CMA's ratings are sensitive  to a prolonged period of low oil prices given that it has a relatively larger  energy exposure when compared to large regional peers. Further, in Fitch's view,  CMA's earnings profile continues to lag peers. The company's balance sheet mix  is much more sensitive to the prolonged low rate environment, which has produced  weaker financial measures versus the large regional peer group.  CMA's ratings also reflect the company solid franchise and conservative approach  to underwriting which has been demonstrated through various credit cycles.  Similarly to its large regional peer group, CMA experienced credit challenges  however its asset quality performance was better than peers. Further, CMA has a  solid funding profile with a good amount of non-interest bearing deposits, which  are currently undervalued given the low rate environment. The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's view that CMA's financial performance will  face greater pressure than other large regional peers given continued low rate  environment as well as its relatively higher exposure to energy lending. More  recently, capital measures are falling in-line with large regional peer group,  which were viewed as an offset to its relatively weaker earnings profile.  Further, the company has experienced credit pressures stemming from its sizeable  energy portfolio, which has led to a jump in provisioning needs. CMA's earnings continue to lag regional peers given the prolonged low rate  environment and slow recovery in the economy. Although Fitch recognizes that  CMA's earnings performance is consistent, its earnings profile remains on the  lower end compared to most peers. CMA's return on assets (ROA) has averaged  0.80% over the last five years versus the large regional peer average of 1.06%.  CMA's pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)/average assets was 1.27% for 2015  compared to 1.44% for 'A' rated banks and 1.71% for the large regional peer  group. Further, financial performance has been pressured during the last five  sequential quarters as CMA's provisions rose significantly to address credit  issues within its sizeable energy portfolio.  CMA recognizes its earnings growth challenge and has recently announced cost  save initiatives, which are expected to improve earnings into 2017 and 2018.   Management has identified $230 million in annual pre-tax income for fiscal 2018,  which should bring efficiency ratio down below 60%. These revenue and expense  initiatives are expected to contribute 200 basis points (bps) to return on  equity (ROE). Fitch would view positively the successful execution of these  strategies and achieving the noted targets.    The Negative Outlook also reflects higher than expected asset quality  deterioration and we expect CMA's financial performance will face greater  pressure than other large regional peers given its relatively higher exposure to  energy lending. CMA's funded energy loans as a percent of tangible common equity  (TCE) is roughly 39% at second quarter 2016 (2Q16), compared to the 13% average  for the large regional peer group. CMA's energy and indirect energy loans  totaled 5.4% of total loans at 2Q16. Positively, CMA has continued to reduce its  energy exposure.  More recently, energy prices have stabilized and appear to be  at an equilibrium point. This should help reduce CMAs inflows of criticized/classified credits. Nonetheless, energy prices are expected to remain  well below peak levels for some time. Uncertainties remain as to the ability of  energy borrowers to navigate through the new price point, particularly as  hedging protection starts to roll-off. Moreover, any further and sustained  declines in oil prices will likely lead to more deficiencies in E&P borrowing  bases. This could create further challenges for these energy borrowers which  ultimately lead to higher loss content than initial estimates. Fitch also notes that credit deterioration in the energy book is trending higher  than historical experience relative to previous energy cycles, which was a key  rating sensitivity highlighted in Fitch's rating affirmation in October 2015.  CMA disclosed that net charge-off (NCO) averages for its energy book peaked at  69bps in 2009. For the year-end 2015 (4Q15), based on the company's public  information, annualized NCOs in the energy book were roughly 1.2%. Further, the company's capital position, while still solid given its risk  profile has started to trend in line with the large regional peer group. For  2Q16, CMA's CET1 ratio was 10.40%, which slightly lags the large regional peer  group average by about 40bps. Given expectations for credit and modest earnings  for CMA, Fitch believes capital levels may trend down closer to peer averages  also pressuring the rating. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES CMA's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR for loss severity.  CMA's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times for loss  severity and three times for non-performance, while CMA's trust preferred  securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two times for  non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Comerica Bank are rated one notch higher than  CMA's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt because U.S.  uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference  gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  CMA's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR CMA has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, CMA is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT CMA's ratings are at the high end of its rating potential and therefore further  upside is unlikely.  Fitch considers CMA's ratings to be sensitive to its ability to control losses  in its energy book and improve its long-run profitability. In assessing this,  Fitch will focus on the impact, if any, of higher credit costs on profitability,  trends in credit performance, and its capital position, including CET1 ratio,  relative to its large regional peer group. The revision to a Negative Outlook  also reflects our view that over the Outlook horizon, typically between 12-18  months, CMA's credit performance will likely deteriorate more than its peers  given the company's relatively larger exposure to energy. Although Fitch  believes the company has a long history in energy lending and a proven track  record through various economic downturns, the significant decline in oil prices  and slow recovery may lead to a sharper rise in NPAs and NCOs than initially  expected.  Should credit costs increase significantly and rise above normalized ranges and  continue to pressure earnings measures, ratings could be downgraded by one  notch. CMA's 10-year-average NCO ratio is 62bps. We note that solid asset  quality and capital were considered offsets to the company's modest earnings  profile.  Although not anticipated, the ratings could be negatively affected if CMA's CET1  capital position were to fall below peer averages without a corresponding  increase in core earnings. Further, a payout ratio (including repurchase  activity) exceeding 100% would also put pressure on current ratings. Fitch also notes ratings could be sensitive to strategic options that lead to  changes to the company's overall business model and/or franchise.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for CMA's and its operating companies' subordinated debt and  preferred stock are sensitive to any change to CMA's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to CMA's  long-and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should CMA's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since CMA's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Comerica Incorporated --Long-Term IDR at 'A'; Outlook Negative;  --Senior shelf at 'A'; --Senior debt at 'A'; --Subordinated debt at 'A-'; --Viability at 'a';     --Short-Term IDR at 'F1';  --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'.  Comerica Bank --Long-Term IDR at 'A'; Outlook Negative; --Subordinated debt at 'A-'; --Senior debt at 'A'; --Long-term deposits at 'A+'; --Viability at 'a'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term Deposits at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'.
