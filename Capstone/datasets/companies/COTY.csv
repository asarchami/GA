While revenue in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific rose, revenue from the United States fell 11.3 percent.Net revenue rose 1 percent to $1.01 billion.Sales of fragrances, Coty's largest business, rose 4 percent, helped by strong demand for brands such as Calvin Klein, Davidoff, Marc Jacobs and Playboy.Skin and body care division sales rose 8 percent while those of color cosmetics fell 6 percent hurt by low demand of the nail category in the United States. Coty gets most of its revenue from perfume brands such as Calvin Klein as well as those it sells under the names of celebrities such as Beyonce Knowles, Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez.The company also said it entered into an agreement with Avon Products Inc to market its select fragrances through Avon Brazil's network of 1.5 million independent sales representatives.The company, whose competitors include Estee Lauder Cos Inc , L'Oreal SA and Elizabeth Arden Inc, did not name the fragrances it would market. Brazil, Avon's largest market, is also the largest fragrance market globally, Coty said in a statement.Coty reported a net loss of $253.3 million, or 66 cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with a profit of $20.4 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.The company recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of$316.9 million after its efforts to revamp its TJoy business in China did not produce expected cash flows.Coty acquired TJoy Holdings, which makes ginseng-based skin-whitening and anti-aging creams, in December 2010. The company is based in Suzhou, in East China's Jiangsu province.Excluding a tax benefit of 10 cents per share, Coty earned a profit of 12 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.New York-based Coty's shares were up marginally in premarket trading.

2,"  * 4th-qtr loss $155.9 mln vs $5 mln yr-ago* Sales fall steepest in a decade* Warns of weak sales in first half of fiscal 2015* Rhone Capital to invest in co via preferred stock, warrants* Shares slump 25 pct   (Adds details on celebrity fragrances, analyst comment, updates shares)By Devika  Krishna KumarAug 19 Elizabeth Arden Inc reported its biggest ever quarterly loss due to a steep fall in sales of celebrity perfumes, particularly the Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift brands, sending its shares plunging as much as 25 percent.The company said fourth-quarter sales fell 28.4 percent, the steepest in a decade, and warned that the weakness, which started about a year back, would continue for the next six months.Still, investment firm Rhone Capital LLC agreed to invest nearly $100 million in Elizabeth Arden through preferred stock and warrants. The company's net sales in fiscal 2014 were hit by fewer launches of perfumes, retailers reducing inventory, heavier discounting and a decision to prune the distribution of its key brands, CFO Rod Little said on a conference call.While teens and young adults still like celebrity-branded perfumes, they have less disposable income to spend on such discretionary items given the high unemployment among youth, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.Elizabeth Arden had five of the top 10 celebrity perfumes in the United States last year, but the overall market for these perfumes is shrinking, according to Euromonitor.This has had a bigger impact on Elizabeth Arden, which gets about 75 percent of its sales from perfumes, than on rivals such as Estee Lauder Cos Inc, L'Oreal SA and Coty Inc, who rely more on sales of cosmetics. Elizabeth Arden's total sales fell 13.4 percent in the year ended June 30, with the fall increasing each quarter. About half the 14 percent decline in its North American sales was due to celebrity perfumes.Distributors and retailers were selling the company's products for too little, CEO Scott Beattie said.FRESH FUNDS  The result caps a year in which Elizabeth Arden saw a potential suitor walk away, launched a restructuring program, and started exploring alternatives to prop up its business.The review process ended on Tuesday with Rhone Capital's investment of $50 million in preferred stock and 2.5 million through warrants in exchange for a board seat and a stake of about 7.6 percent in the company.Rhone agreed to cap its stake at 30 percent after the exercise of the warrants, which are worth about $49 million based on the stock's Monday close.""Rhone's investment might support the shares in what would otherwise be a painful day,"" BMO Capital Markets' Patrick Trucchio said in a note.While Elizabeth Arden said it expects sales to increase in the second half of fiscal 2015 as comparisons ease and pricing improves, Trucchio believes it would take years for the company to return to ""historical levels of profitability"".Net loss attributable to Elizabeth Arden widened to $155.9 million in the quarter from $5.0 million a year earlier. Net sales fell to $191.7 million.The stock was trading down 24 percent at $14.93 in afternoon trading, making it the top percentage loser on the Nasdaq.

The deal would mean Chanel, the world's second-biggest luxury brand behind LVMH's (LVMH.PA) Louis Vuitton, would get a stake in Coty of around 4.2 percent, according to Reuters data.The transaction comes just over a week after Coty's chief executive, Michele Scannavini, stepped down for personal reasons, sending the company's shares down as much as 3 percent.Coty is still more than 70-percent owned by Joh. A. Benckiser (JAB), the investment holding company of the Reimanns, the German billionaire family associated with Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L), the cleaning and household products maker.The flotation of Coty netted nearly $800 million for JAB which is hoping next week to sell 25 percent of Jimmy Choo on the London Stock Exchange in a deal that could value the high-end shoemaker at as much as 702 million pounds. Coty, which makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, has been suffering from declining sales growth and profits as consumers cut back on discretionary purchases. Coty's make-up sales fell 7 percent at constant exchange rates to $1.36 billion in the year to June 2014, while its perfume revenues rose only 1 percent to $2.5 billion. The company's competitors include Estee Lauder Cos (EL.N), L'Oreal (OREP.PA) and Elizabeth Arden Inc RDEN.O.Coty's shares, which floated in New York in June 2013 at $17.50, have poorly performed since and were barely moving in early trading in New York, up 1.12 percent at $16.13 by 1454 GMT (1054 EDT).    ""Bourjois' brands are highly complementary to Coty's existing color cosmetics portfolio,"" Bart Becht, chairman and interim chief executive of Coty and one of the three partners running JAB, said in a statement.  Coty and Chanel declined to comment and provide any information beyond the short statement issued by Coty. Bourjois is the third make-up brand in France sold in supermarkets behind L'Oreal's Gemey-Maybelline and L'Oreal Paris, according to cosmetics trade magazine CosmetiqueMag. In France Bourjois is mainly sold in supermarkets such as Monoprix and small perfume shops. ""The complementariness for me is not evident for Coty since it already has (mascara brand) Rimmel and nail polish OPI which are sold through the same distribution channels as Bourjois and therefore are direct competitors,"" said Sabine de Sèze, editor in chief of CosmetiqueMag.  Bourjois, which offers a wide range of make-up products such as mascara, eye shadow and nail polish, was created in 1862 by French actor Joseph-Albert Ponsin as a provider of make-up for stage performers. At the turn of the 20th century, the Wertheimer family, who today own Chanel, took control of the make-up brand.   Chanel, which makes a significant proportion of its revenues from best-selling perfumes such as Coco and No.5, generates nearly 6 billion euros ($8 billion) in annual sales, less than Louis Vuitton at 7.5 billion but more than Ralph Lauren (RL.N) at $7.45 billion (5.8 billion euros).

""We need to increase the amount of innovation in the U.S., to compete in a market where skin care is becoming much more competitive,"" Freda said.The company's net sales fell 1.6 percent to $2.63 billion in the first quarter as some retailers advanced orders in the fourth quarter ahead of a planned technology upgrade.The advanced orders likely led to a shift of $125-$150 million in sales, S&P Capital analyst Joseph Agnese wrote in a note. In the last one year, Estee Lauder has grown sales faster than those of rivals such as Coty Inc and Elizabeth Arden Inc as it has a wider portfolio of skin care and makeup, and caters to higher-income customers.The maker of M.A.C., Bobbi Brown and Estee Lauder cosmetics said sales in the Americas fell 7.3 percent, while those in Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 5.7 percent.The two regions made up for nearly 80 percent of Estee Lauder's total sales in the first quarter. The Americas alone accounted for 42 percent of the sales.Freda said sales in China, its biggest emerging market, were being hurt by increased promotions, competition from Korean brands and lower luxury spending. China accounts for about 6 percent of the company's total sales, according to Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan.The company expects a strong U.S. dollar to hurt full-year sales growth by about 3 percentage points, compared with the 2 percentage points it had forecast.The company cut its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to $3.03-$3.11 per share from $3.10-$3.20.It trimmed its forecast for net sales growth to 2-3 percent in constant currency, from 3-4 percent.Net income attributable to Estee Lauder fell 24 percent to $228.1 million, or 59 cents per share in the first quarter.

A successful sale would allow P&G to focus on more profitable consumer brands such as its Gillette razors, Tide detergent and Pampers disposable diapers.Henkel is interested in buying P&G's haircare business, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands, the sources said, declining to be named because the matter is private. The haircare business is worth about $7 billion based on annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $500 million, the sources said. Revlon, the owner of makeup brands such as Almay, is eyeing P&G's cosmetics business, which includes drugstore brands CoverGirl and Max Factor. That business has annual EBITDA of around $350 million, the people said. Coty, which makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, is likely interested in P&G's fragrance unit, though it could also look at buying P&G's cosmetics business as well, the sources said.  P&G's fragrance unit includes brands such as Hugo Boss and Gucci and has EBITDA of around $250 million, they said. It remains unclear whether P&G will try to sell its brands as part of a package, whose value could range from $10 billion to $12 billion, or piecemeal. P&G could also decide to scrap the sale entirely and instead look to spin off the unit, the sources added.  Representatives for P&G and Revlon declined to comment. Coty and Henkel did not respond to requests for comment. P&G is looking to sell some of its beauty brands as part of a cost-cutting strategy by Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley. Lafley said in August he would reverse the Cincinnati-based company's strategy of aggressive expansion and shed more than half its brands. P&G said it would concentrate on 70 to 80 brands that have accounted for 90 percent of its sales over the past three years. P&G has already divested some of its non-core brands. Last year, the company sold its Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion in stock and also sold some of its soap brands to Unilever PLC.

The world's No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands over the next two years.Last year, it sold its Duracell batteries to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion and sold some of its soap brands to Unilever Plc. Coty was vying with Henkel for P&G's hair care businesses and won an auction over the weekend, the sources said, adding that details of the complex transaction are likely to take at least two weeks to be finalised.For tax purposes, the deal would be completed through a ""Reverse Morris Trust"", which means that P&G would spin off its beauty assets into a separate company that would then absorb Coty in an all-share deal, the sources said.Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings, the billionaire Reimann family's investment firm which controls 75 percent of Coty, would own about a third of the equity in the combined business and about 47-48 percent of voting rights, the sources said.P&G, Coty and JAB Holdings declined to comment. SHARES SURGE In New York trade, Coty shares closed 19.3 percent higher and have gained about 50 percent this year. P&G shares rose 1.3 percent.Wells Fargo analyst Chris Ferrara said a deal would be ""transformational"" for Coty and estimated it would increase its revenue to nearly $11 billion from $4.4 billion. ""A large deal would likely give Coty the opportunity to quickly exit 'tail' (poorly performing) brands and sustainably raise the company's growth profile,"" Ferrara said.In response to lower sales, Coty has been cutting costs and shedding staff. It has also been through much organisational change, merging divisions and replacing chief executives three times in the past three years.Elio Sceti, who ran Europe's largest frozen foods company Iglo Foods Holdings and has no experience in the cosmetics industry, will become Coty's chief executive next month.Coty, which makes Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Chloe as well as celebrity perfumes, would become the world's No.1 perfume maker ahead of L'Oreal if the deal goes through, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.This would also mark its entry into the hair care market with the Wella and Clairol brands.

Lew said failure to reach an agreement would create broad uncertainties for the global economy. ""The market seems to be pricing in a possibility, overpricing, a Greece exit,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.He said he does not expect a surprise to the market from the Fed in terms of a rate hike, or from a Greek default.""Financials have been leading and dividend payers have sold off.

Stocks had opened lower but quickly turned higher and drifted up throughout the day to close near the session's high.Consumer staples lead the way up, with Coty shares at a record, closing up 19.3 percent at $31.08. Coty is on track to buy Procter & Gamble's beauty business in a $12 billion deal. P&G shares closed up 1.3 percent at $79.10.In other merger news, shares of NCR Corp hit a 14-month high of $36.50.

NCR closed up 10.7 percent at $34.73 while Blackstone fell 0.6 percent to $41.98 and Carlyle rose 0.8 percent to $28.41. The chance that the Fed Wednesday will give more clarity on the timing of its expected rate hike was seen as a catalyst for more takeover deals.""Rising rates could be a trigger for even more M&A activity,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.""They are a signal that now's the time to get the deals done if you are going to do them with cheap financing.""Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,946 to 1,104, for a 1.76-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,635 issues rose and 1,158 fell for a 1.41-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 8 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows while on the Nasdaq Composite there were 138 new highs and 37 new lows.About 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 5.98 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac was placed third with $59.5 million although only two of its five current line-up  are women. Nevertheless, the return of 1970s veterans Stevie Nicks and Christine McVeigh was seen as a key to the success of the band's year-long tour ""On With the Show,"" Forbes said.Lady Gaga was ranked fourth with $59 million - a long way behind her 2011 peak of $90 million when she was grabbing headlines with outrageous stunts and costumes. Last year's top earner Beyonce slipped to 5th place with an estimated $54.5 million.

27,"   By Emma Thomasson | BERLIN  BERLIN Adidas (ADSGn.DE) has named Henkel's (HNKG_p.DE) Kasper Rorsted as its new chief executive, boosting its shares as investors expressed hopes that the Dane has the credentials to boost profits at the German sportswear firm.Rorsted, 53, will leave Henkel in April after eight years at the consumer goods firm and take charge of Adidas on Oct. 1, succeeding Herbert Hainer, 61, who has headed the firm for 15 years as the longest-serving boss of a leading German company.Hainer had come under fire as Adidas has lost market share to Nike (NKE.N), particularly in the key U.S. market, and suffered from falling golf sales and its exposure to Russia, prompting the board to launch a search for a successor.Adidas shares were up 5.8 percent by 1400 GMT, while Henkel was down 4.5 percent.""The share price reaction speaks for itself,"" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, which owns a 0.7 percent stake in Adidas.""We welcome the appointment of Mr Rorsted to replace Mr Hainer and hope it means an end to the long dry spell in the profitability of Adidas,"" added Speich, who has long been critical of the Adidas CEO.Adidas sales have more than doubled under Hainer but they have failed to match Nike, which forecasts revenue will rise another 63 percent to $50 billion by 2020, compared to the Adidas target of 22 billion euros ($24 billion).Hainer has also struggled to improve profitability, with the Adidas operating margin of 6.6 percent in 2014 still half that of Nike. In contrast, Henkel's adjusted operating margin rose to almost 16 percent in 2014 from 10 percent in 2008.  SUMMER HANDOVER Hainer had cultivated potential internal successors,   including brand chief Eric Liedtke, but several investors wanted an outsider who might be more likely to take tough decisions and potentially sell more non-core businesses.Hainer has said he is considering selling the struggling Taylor Made golf business, but has repeatedly rejected calls from some investors to sell the Reebok fitness brand he bought in 2006, saying the business was now growing fast. Reuters reported last year that Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris has formed a partnership with U.S. investor Mason Hawkins and his Southeastern Asset Management to drive boardroom change at companies including Adidas. Southeastern declined to comment on Rorsted's appointment. Adidas said Rorsted would join the executive board on Aug. 1 and have a two-month transition period with Hainer during a busy period for the sporting goods industry, just after the European soccer championships and just before the Olympics in Rio.Since Rorsted took over at Henkel in 2008, shares in the maker of Schwarzkopf hair care products and Loctite glue have more than tripled, while its annual sales have grown by more than a third to around 18 billion euros estimated for 2015.Rorsted has a reputation as a dynamic manager with a relentless focus on improving profitability, but, like Hainer at Adidas, faced challenges in the United States, the company's biggest market, where competition from the likes of Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L) is fierce. In response, Rorsted, who says he spends 200 days of the year traveling, has overhauled management in the U.S. market, where Henkel has also launched products popular in Europe - Persil laundry detergent and Schwarzkopf shampoo.Rorsted was widely seen as seeking a new challenge after Henkel last year lost out to to Coty Inc (COTY.N) in a bid to buy hair care firm Wella from Procter & Gamble.Rorsted, who is known as a keen skier and fan of soccer club Bayern Munich, is married with four children and his family already live in Munich, meaning he will have less far to commute to his new job in the northern Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach.He serves on the boards of German media company Bertelsmann, Denmark's Danfoss and brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR)and, before Henkel, he worked for Hewlett Packard, Compaq and Oracle, living in Germany since 1991.Hans Van Bylen, a Belgian who has worked at Henkel since 1984 and who has headed the beauty care business since 2005, will take over as Henkel CEO on May 1, the company said, adding it would name a successor for Van Bylen in due course.($1 = 0.9179 euros) (Additional reporting by Matthias Inverardi in Duesseldorf and Joern Poeltz in Munich; Editing by Keith Weir)",2016-01-18,COTY,"Mon Jan 18, 2016 | 9:56am EST",UPDATE 3-Adidas names Henkel's Rorsted to replace Hainer as CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/adidas-moves-ceo-idUSL8N1521WZ?type=companyNews

36,"  Perfume maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) sharply raised its estimate of costs related to its $12.5 billion acquisition of beauty product brands from Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), sending its shares down sharply on Tuesday.Coty, the U.S. maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfumes, agreed in July to buy more than 40 brands from P&G, including Wella and Clairol hair-care products, as part of a strategy to reduce its dependence on its struggling fragrance business.The company said it now expected one-time costs related to the acquisition to total $1.2 billion over the next four years.In July, Coty had said it expected costs of about $500 million over three years.Coty also said it expected to save $780 million annually in the four years after the deal closes in October. It said earlier it expected to save $550 million over three years.""...The shorter-term accretion is below expectations, although the synergy number did go up and the base is lower,"" JP Morgan analyst John Faucher wrote in a client note.The company's shares were down 8.3 percent at $28.49 in late trading. Up to Monday's close, the stock had risen about 21 percent this year. Coty also swung to a net loss for the third quarter ended March 31 and reported its first profit miss in seven quarters as operational and acquisition-related costs jumped.The company has been spending billions to expand its beauty and skin-care businesses to reduce its reliance on fragrances, whose sales have fallen for the past seven quarters.Most recently, Coty paid about $1 billion to buy the beauty care unit of Brazil's Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3.SA). Fragrance sales fell 4 percent in the quarter.Weak demand for products such as Sally Hansen nail polishes in the United States pushed down sales in the Americas, Coty's second-biggest market, by 7.3 percent. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Coty's biggest market, sales rose 11 percent.Total net revenue rose 1.8 percent to $950.7 million, but it was the first rise in six quarters. Coty reported a net loss of $26.8 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with net income of $75.5 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, Coty earned 9 cents per share.

55,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting and strong demand for its baby, feminine and home care products.P&G's shares were up 4.6 percent at $87.97 on Tuesday morning.The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc (COTY.N) in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month.P&G is also planning to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years, after cutting the same amount in costs over the last five years.The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of savings from the new plan in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call.Organic sales in P&G's fabric and home care business - its largest - rose 4 percent in the first quarter, while those in baby, feminine and family care, the second largest, rose 2 percent. The two businesses, which house brands such as Tide, Febreze, Pampers and Tampex, together accounted for 60 percent of the company's total revenue.P&G's revenue was driven by ""solid"" volume growth of 3 percent in the quarter, in contrast to rivals such as Unilever (ULVR.L), whose sales were mainly propped up by price hikes, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note.Net sales remained largely flat at $16.52 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average estimate of $16.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G's largest European market, fell 2 percent in the quarter, Moeller said.Britain's vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market.Moeller declined to discuss P&G's pricing strategy, but said the UK continued to be a ""very challenging and highly promotional"" market. P&G said net income attributable to the company rose 4.3 percent to $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share.Excluding items, P&G earned $1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents.P&G's quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio.

We think it's a multi-year growth story,"" Schwartz told the Sohn Investment Conference in Tel Aviv. He noted that Coty is the third largest beauty company behind L'Oreal and Estee Lauder but has the ability to change the margin paradigm in the beauty space.  Coty's shares have struggled, Schwartz said, due to technical effects from an exchange offer with Procter and Gamble  in September and providing an opportunity to buy Coty stock at a ""depressed"" price.
