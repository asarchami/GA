0,"  (Adds Fifth Third statement, paragraph 6)WASHINGTON Aug 7 Fifth Third Bancorp Inc's  mortgage unit will pay $1.52 million to settle U.S. government charges that it discriminated against some loan applicants by demanding letters from doctors to document income from Social Security disability insurance.The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday said the accord resolves allegations that the unit violated the federal Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act by discriminating on the basis of disability and receipt of public assistance. Cincinnati-based Fifth Third will pay the money into a fund to compensate eligible victims. It will also improve training of loan officers and underwriters, and monitor loan applications to ensure that disabled applicants are not asked for letters from their doctors. The accord ""protects those with disabilities from having this unnecessary, inappropriate and illegal intrusion into the most private of their affairs,"" U.S. Attorney Michael Moore in Macon, Georgia, said in a statement. Settlement papers were filed with the U.S. District Court in Macon, and Fifth Third cooperated fully with the probe, the Justice Department said.In a statement, Fifth Third said it is pleased to settle, and ""remains committed to making mortgages available on a fair and equitable basis."" The lender has about 1,300 branches and 2,600 automated teller machines in a dozen U.S. states.

2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Fifth Third Bancorp's  (FITB) ratings at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation  reflects the company's good earnings profile, solid capital and liquidity  profiles, and moderating credit trends. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDR, Viability Rating (VR) and Senior Debt Fitch affirmed FITB's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflecting the company's good  earnings profile, solid capital and liquidity profiles, and moderating credit  trends. FITB's earnings historically have outpaced peer averages supported by  strong efficiency levels, and good fee-based revenues sources.  Earnings have  been impacted recently due to litigation reserve builds and a slowdown in  mortgage refinancing revenues, somewhat offset by reserve releases, which are  expected to diminish over time. FITB expects its full-year 2014 core return on  assets ROA to be approximately 1.15%, which appears attainable. Though this is  considerably lower than its pre-crisis average, it is still viewed as good given  the challenging interest rate environment. FITB's management is viewed as in line with other large regional banks, a  management team with a high degree of depth and experience. Strategic objectives  are clearly articulated, and FITB has done a good job in meeting financial  targets.    FITB's capital profile remains solid with an estimated Tier 1 common ratio under  Basel III of 9.3%, well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, though a  tad below large regional peer averages. Historically FITB has managed capital  conservatively with above-average levels of tangible common equity relative to  peers. Fitch expects that FITB, along with its other large regional banking  peers, will manage capital conservatively in the post-financial crisis  environment.   FITB remains predominately core funded, with core deposits (defined as total  deposits less jumbo deposits) representing 82% of total funding as of June 30,  2014. Similar to industry trends, FITB's funding profile is strong, partially  reflective of a weak economic recovery. Further, holding company liquidity  remains robust with considerable cash balances, and no near-term maturities  until 2016.  Although the company's non-performing assets (NPAs) are elevated from historical  levels, actual losses have been manageable as of late, and reserve levels are  still relatively high. Further, a large percentage of the accruing troubled debt  restructurings (included in NPAs) are current on principal and interest  payments. Excluding troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), FITB's level of NPAs to  loans and foreclosed real estate falls slightly below peer averages.    FITB reported higher crisis-era losses than its peers, due to weak economic  conditions in Michigan before the crisis started, and its exposure to Florida.   Fitch notes that FITB did make some needed decisions early on to mitigate risk,  including some early exits of homebuilder or developer lending, and brokered  home equity, as well as suspending non-owner-occupied CRE lending for a time.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDR, VR and Senior Debt Given FITB's ratings at the higher end of the ratings spectrum for the large  regional banks, Fitch does not anticipate any further ratings upward momentum  over the near- to intermediate-term given the high absolute levels. Further  upward ratings movement would be predicated on a material decline in overall  problem asset levels, combined with an above-average earnings profile. Further,  while FITB's capital profile is currently considered adequate in light of its  risk profile, any upgrade in ratings would likely also be dependent on an  above-average capital profile which would provide more than ample loss cushion  for unexpected losses.  Conversely, a reversal in FITB's superior earnings profile and asset quality  trends, combined with a material deterioration in the liquidity and capital  profile could pressure FITB's earnings. FITB has also recently announced  strategic initiatives to increase its capital market offerings, in line with  efforts at a couple of other large regional banks. Although Fitch expects  securities business will remain relatively low relative to overall revenues for  FITB and the other large regional banks, an outsized reliance on this more  volatile income stream could be viewed negatively from a ratings perspective. The substantial unrealized gain in Vantiv is not included in FITB's equity or  capital; however, Fitch currently views the ownership stake in Vantiv favorably.  While Fitch expects FITB to wind down its ownership in the company over time,  Vantiv-related items can impact quarterly earnings. A complete divestiture would  lessen the volatility in earnings; however, Vantiv-related earnings contributed  a healthy 16% of pretax income in 1H'14. Without reinvestment or other organic  opportunities, FITB's earnings profile could be adversely affected following a  complete divestiture and, consequently, its earnings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   FITB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should FITB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely, though, for FITB given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that FITB may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may  not be affected as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  FITB has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, FITB is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  FITB's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption as to capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by FITB and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from FITB or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by FITB and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in FITB's VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS FITB's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by FITB and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in FITB's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Fifth Third Bancorp --Long-term IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable; --Viability Rating at 'a'; --Preferred stock at 'BB+';    --Senior debt at 'A'; --Subordinated debt at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'. Fifth Third Bank  --Long-term IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable; --Viability Rating at 'a'; --Senior debt at 'A'; --Subordinated debt at 'A-'; --Long-term deposits at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term deposits at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Fifth Third Bancorp's  (FITB) ratings at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation  reflects the company's solid liquidity levels, moderating credit trends, and  good capital profile.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's solid liquidity levels, moderating credit  trends, and good capital profile. This is somewhat offset by a weaker relative  earnings profile than historical measures for the company.  FITB's earnings, a key rating driver, have historically outpaced peer averages  supported by strong efficiency levels, and good fee-based revenues sources.  Fitch expects FITB's profitability will improve under a more normalized rate  environment. In the meantime, FITB appears to have lost some earnings momentum,  and the company no longer outperforms peers. During the first half of 2015  (1H15), FITB reported an ROA of 98bps, slightly below the peer median of 106bps.  Current earnings are below Fitch's expectations for FITB. FITB's earnings are  impacted by a slowdown in refinancing activities, changes to the deposit advance  product, and a general tightening in credit spreads over the past several years.  Earnings were also impacted by a $97 million impairment charge related to branch  network changes. FITB will consolidate or sell approximately 100 branches and  approximately 30 other properties that were purchased earlier for future branch  expansion, which represents a relatively large 8% reduction in the branch  network. FITB anticipates cost savings over the long run related to this  initiative, which may aid earnings in the long term.  FITB's capital profile remains good with an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio  under Basel III of approximately 9.4%, approximately 110bps below the large  regional peer median. Although FITB's estimated CET1 is below peer levels, it is  still viewed as acceptable in absolute terms and above the fully phased-in  requirement of 7%. Further, continual enhancements to the risk management  infrastructure may help to mitigate future loan losses. Fitch currently views the ownership stake in Vantiv favorably, which contributed  approximately 11% of FITB's pre-tax earnings in 2014. Vantiv is a payment  processing and technology provider that was spun off from FITB in 2009. The  carrying value of FITB's investment in Vantiv was $415 million at most recent  quarter-end, with a market value of $1.6 billion (based on Vantiv's share price  on June 30, 2015). The significant $1.2 billion pre-tax unrealized gain in  Vantiv is not included in FITB's equity or capital. However, this unrealized  gain could provide for a large buffer against unexpected losses, which is viewed  favorably in the context of the company's capital profile. If monetized, an  additional $1 billion in gains would contribute to an increase of approximately  100bps to the CET1.  FITB maintains a solid core funding base. Core deposits (defined as total  deposits less jumbo CDs) represented a sizable 97% of total deposits and 84% of  total funding at June 30, 2015. Short-term wholesale funding now comprises a  modest 5% of total funding. FITB's estimate of the modified LCR was 108% at June  30, 2015, well ahead of the 90% requirement on Jan. 1, 2016. Many of FITB's  peers have yet to publicly disclose their LCR.  FITB's asset quality continues to improve, with NCOs dropping to 37bps in 2Q15,  its lowest level in years. Fitch views credit losses for the industry as  unsustainably low and likely to deteriorate over the near term, especially under  a higher interest rate environment.  FITB reported higher crisis-era losses than its peers, due to weak economic  conditions in Michigan before the crisis started, and its exposure to Florida.  FITB did make some needed decisions early on to mitigate risk, including some  early exits of homebuilder or developer lending, and brokered home equity, as  well as suspending non-owner-occupied CRE lending for a time. FITB's loan  growth, particularly in C&I and auto, has been modest as compared to its peers,  which is viewed favorably by Fitch given the competitive pricing environment, as  well as industry-wide weakening terms and structures.  FITB disclosed the results of the SNC review were included in 2Q15 asset quality  ratios. The SNC portfolio totals $25 billion or a relatively high 27% of total  loans, though not all banks publicly disclose SNC outstandings. In the past, the  SNC portfolio has performed better than the overall commercial book. Fitch  expects that the industry will begin to build loan loss reserves, after several  years of releasing significant amounts, as loan growth increases and the benign  credit environment shows some deterioration, particularly in sectors such as  energy.  As previously discussed, FITB's earnings should improve under a higher interest  rate environment. That said, its asset sensitivity, as disclosed in its own  internal results, suggest a more modest balance sheet positioning relative to  peers. FITB appears to be one of the more conservative banks in its modelling  assumptions, with very good public disclosures. As a result, FITB's actual  earnings under a higher rate environment may perform better than current  estimates, or conversely, some of its peers may not necessarily be as levered to  higher rates as their disclosures suggest.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES FITB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a' for loss  severity. FITB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while FITB's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Fifth Third Bank are rated one notch higher  than FITB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits  benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit  liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY  FITB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since FITB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Given FITB's ratings are at the higher end of the ratings spectrum for the large  regional banks, Fitch does not anticipate any further ratings upward momentum  given the high absolute levels. Fitch currently views more downside risk in  FITB's ratings than upside.  More broadly, a lack of a sustainable improvement in FITB's earnings profile  could pressure the company's ratings over time as they represented a key rating  strength historically, and its performance has been relatively average over the  past couple years.  Fitch expects FITB to continue to monetize its ownership stake in Vantiv over  the intermediate term. A complete divestiture would lessen some volatility in  earnings; however, without reinvestment or other organic opportunities, FITB's  earnings profile would no longer benefit from Vantiv-related income and gains,  and hence, ratings could be adversely impacted, should it not be able to offset  the associated decline.  In addition, a reversal in FITB's asset quality trends, combined with a material  deterioration in the liquidity and capital profile could pressure FITB's  earnings. FITB has recently announced strategic initiatives to increase its  capital market offerings, in line with efforts at a couple other large regional  banks. Although Fitch expects securities business will remain relatively low  relative to overall revenues for FITB and the other large regional banks, an  outsized reliance on this more volatile income stream could be viewed negatively  from a ratings perspective.  In July 2015, FITB has announced several executive management changes, including  a new CEO and new COO. This follows other key executive management changes over  the past couple years including, but not limited to, a new CRO, CCO, CFO, and  Treasurer. While Fitch does not anticipate a material departure in strategy  related to the most recent management changes, the agency expects a certain  level of management stability going forward given the significant amount of  changes in senior management since 2013. Further key material changes in the  executive management team may have negative ratings implications. While considered less likely, further upward ratings movement would be  predicated on a material decline in overall problem asset levels, combined with  an above earnings profile. Further, while FITB's capital profile is currently  considered adequate in light of its risk profile, any upgrade in ratings would  likely also be dependent on an above average capital profile which would provide  more than ample loss cushion for unexpected losses.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for FITB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and  preferred stock are sensitive to any change to FITB's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to FITB's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should FITB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since FITB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

22,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Fifth Third Bancorp's  (FITB) ratings at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.  The affirmation reflects the company's conservative risk appetite, solid capital  profile, and good liquidity levels.  The Outlook revision reflects a financial  profile, particularly earnings, that is no longer differentiated from its lower  rated peers.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's conservative risk appetite, solid capital  profile, and good liquidity levels. This is primarily offset by an earnings  profile that has lost some momentum, and no longer outperforms peers.  As such,  Fitch has revised the Rating Outlook to Negative. Resolution of the Outlook will  be contingent on an improved core earnings profile that is in line with  similarly rated peers, and successful execution of ongoing strategic  initiatives.  FITB's earnings, a key rating driver, have historically outpaced peer averages  supported by strong efficiency levels, and good fee-based revenues sources.  Fitch expects FITB's profitability may improve under a more normalized rate  environment, along with its peer banks. In the meantime, FITB appears to have  lost its earnings momentum, and is no longer differentiated from its peers. In  second quarter 2016 (2Q16), FITB reported an ROA of 94bps, below the peer median  of 100bps and below Fitch's long-term expectations for the bank. Excluding  Vantiv-related gains, Fitch calculates an ROA of roughly 90bps in 2Q16, well  below our expectations for FITB. The bank's earnings have been impacted by a  slowdown in refinancing activities, changes to the deposit advance product, and  increased regulatory and compliance-related spending over the past several  years.  Fitch currently views the ownership stake in Vantiv (a payment processing and  technology provider that was spun off from FITB in 2009) favorably, as it  provides for revenue diversification and has provided a considerable level of  earnings to the bank. In 2015, Vantiv contributed a significant 34% of pre-tax  earnings in 2015. Excluding these gains, FITB's core earnings profile is  considerably lower.  The carrying value of FITB's investment in Vantiv was just $390 million at most  recent quarter-end, with a market value of $1.9 billion (based on Vantiv's share  price on June 30, 2016). If FITB were to sell these shares in Vantiv, FITB would  recognize a significant gain, and may also realize up to $1.2 billion in cash  flows related to the dissolution of the existing tax receivable agreement (TRA).  These potential gains are not included in FITB's equity or capital, though it  could provide for a large buffer against unexpected losses if monetized, which  is viewed favorably in the context of the company's capital profile. Offsetting  this, FITB would no longer have the related gains and income to recognize  through income, and its reported earnings would be lower, when holding revenues  and expenses constant.  Fitch views FITB as a company in the midst of a transition, as the company  attempts to pivot its culture and risk management appetite to targeting lower  credit losses through a cycle. FITB, along with its other Ohio-based peers,  performed poorly through the financial crisis with loan losses well in excess of  large regional bank peers, primarily due to due to weak economic conditions in  Michigan before the crisis started, and its exposure to Florida. Since that time, FITB has taken numerous steps to improve its risk profile, and  produce more consistent results in the future. As an example, FITB's loan growth  has been well below the peer median, as the bank is targeting appropriate  risk-adjusted returns. Reflecting the company's pricing discipline, FITB expects  to grow loans, excluding held-for-sale, by only 2% for full-year 2016. Given the  competitive lending environment and relatively weak economic growth, this is  viewed as prudent.  Fitch views the company's strategic priorities favorably, which include growing  fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, improving the customer  experience, and investing for the future to deliver strong consistent results  through business cycles. Similar to peers, the bank is redeploying cost savings  and gains into improving its technology as FITB adapts to changing customer  behaviors, and refreshes its internal technological infrastructure. Fitch views  FITB as well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly changing banking  environment given its CEO's prior background in technology.  Underpinning today's rating affirmation, FITB's capital profile remains good  with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III of approximately 9.9%.  Although FITB's CET1 is below the peer median of roughly 10.8%, it is still  viewed as acceptable in absolute terms, and above the fully phased-in  requirement of 7%. Further, unlike some peers, FITB has been building capital,  up 52bps from a year ago, as compared to the peer median of up 3bps. We also  anticipate that FITB's long-term capital targets will be on the higher end as  compared to peers. Fitch expects the large regional bank long-term capital  targets to be generally between 8% and 9.5%, with the exception of WFC.  Fitch also notes that over the past three regulatory stress-testing exercises,  FITB has performed better than the peer median in terms of capital erosion, or  the starting capital ratios less the minimum capital ratios under the severely  adverse scenario.  FITB maintains a solid core funding base. Core deposits (defined as total  deposits less jumbo CDs) represented a sizable 97% of total deposits and 83% of  total funding at June 30, 2016. Short-term wholesale funding now comprises just  3% of total funding. FITB's estimate of the modified LCR was 110% at June 30,  2016, well ahead of the 90% requirement on Jan. 1, 2016. Many of FITB's peers  have yet to publicly disclose their LCR.  At June 30, 2016, FITB reported holding company cash totaled $2.4 billion, more  than enough to cover $750 million of remaining holding company maturities in  2016 and 2017, as well as dividends, interest and other expenses over the next  year. In July 2016, FITB was assigned a 'needs to improve' CRA rating, which means the  bank will be unable to pursue bank acquisitions until the rating is upgraded.  FITB expects its next CRA exam in 4Q16, and is hopeful that the 'needs to  improve' rating will be upgraded. Despite this rating, which prevents bank M&A,  FITB reiterated that bank acquisitions remain a low priority. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES FITB's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a' for loss  severity. FITB's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while FITB's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Fifth Third Bank are rated one notch higher  than FITB's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits  benefit from depositor preference.  U.S. depositor preference gives deposit  liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY  FITB's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since FITB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT A lack of a sustainable improvement in FITB's earnings profile (without Vantiv  ownership) may lead to a downgrade in FITB's ratings as they have represented a  key rating strength historically, and its performance has been relatively  average over the past couple years. Furthermore, a lack of demonstrated  execution on its strategic initiatives will also lead to downward ratings  pressure.  Fitch expects resolution of the Rating Outlook will be at the outer  end of the 12 to 24 month Outlook horizon period.  FITB's longer-term targets remain unchanged with a 12% to 14% ROTCE ratio and a  1.1% to 1.3% ROA. If FITB successfully executes on its current strategic  investments, and produces improved earnings - in line with the bank's internal  ROA target, the Outlook could be revised back to Stable.  Fitch expects FITB to continue to monetize its ownership stake in Vantiv over  the intermediate term. A complete divestiture would lessen some volatility in  earnings; however, without reinvestment or other organic opportunities, FITB's  earnings profile would no longer benefit from Vantiv-related income and gains,  and ratings could be adversely affected should it not be able to offset the  associated decline.   Fitch anticipates that given its M&A related restrictions, there may not be a  way to efficiently use proceeds from any material sale of the Vantiv ownership.  As such, if FITB were to redeploy a majority of related gains into share  repurchases, this would likely impact FITB's ratings.  FITB has recently announced strategic initiatives to increase its capital market  offerings, in line with efforts at a couple of other large regional banks.  Although Fitch expects securities business will remain relatively low relative  to overall revenues for FITB and the other large regional banks, an outsized  reliance on this more volatile income stream could be viewed negatively from a  ratings perspective.  Given FITB's ratings are at the higher end of the ratings spectrum for the large  regional banks, Fitch does not anticipate any further ratings upward momentum  given the high absolute levels. Fitch currently views more downside risk in  FITB's ratings than upside, as reflected in the Negative Outlook.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for FITB and its operating companies' subordinated debt and  preferred stock are sensitive to any change to FITB's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to FITB's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should FITB's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since FITB's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and  distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to  three days earlier than to print subscribers.
