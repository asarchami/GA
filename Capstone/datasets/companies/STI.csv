0,"  Feb 25 SunTrust Banks Inc said it may attract ""substantial penalties"" from on an ongoing mortgage-related probe and also disclosed a new investigation by the Department of Justice, according to a regulatory filing late Monday.U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia and Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program have been investigating SunTrust concerning its participation in a federal mortgage-assistance program.The agencies have indicated the plan to pursue some form of action and may impose substantial penalties on SunTrust, the company said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ()The investigations focused on whether the bank harmed borrowers and violated civil or criminal laws by failing to properly process applications for loan modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP. ""STM continues to cooperate with the investigation and believes that it has substantial defenses to the asserted allegations,"" the bank said in its annual report filed with the regulators.Additionally, SunTrust said the Department of Justice notified it in January that it is investigating the bank's origination and underwriting of mortgages SunTrust sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The DOJ and STM have not yet engaged in any dialogue about how this matter may proceed and no allegations have been raised against STM and the investigation is in its preliminary stages, SunTrust said in the filing. SunTrust also said it is negotiating definitive settlement terms for each of these matters and has certain substantive disagreements with some of the positions being taken by the government.The bank said the government may sue it alleging deficiencies in its FHA loan origination practices in case SunTrust is unable to reach a definitive settlement agreement.Atlanta, Georgia-based SunTrust in October agreed to pay nearly $1.2 billion to resolve investigations from several U.S. authorities into its mortgage practices. The claims relate to certain mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration that the bank made between January 2006 and March 2012, and to problems with its mortgage servicing practices.",2014-02-25,STI,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 2:06am EST","SunTrust says could face ""substantial penalties"" in mortgage probe",http://www.reuters.com//article/suntrustbanks-mortgage-idUSL3N0LU1OM20140225?type=companyNews
1,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 15 A U.S. appeals court on Thursday upheld a decision to prevent a defunct Connecticut-based hedge fund from moving forward with a $13 million arbitration against SunTrust Banks Inc over mortgage-backed securities.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York affirmed a 2013 injunction that prevented Turnberry Capital Management LP from pursuing a securities arbitration before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The ruling came in one of what has become an increasing number of lawsuits filed by banks challenging the ability of investors with big monetary claims to have their cases heard before FINRA, a Wall Street industry-funded group.Some plaintiffs asserting large damage claims have come to prefer FINRA over courts to hear their cases, in part because they view arbitration as quicker. SunTrust brought the lawsuit in February 2013 to enjoin an arbitration Turnberry launched to recover $13 million plus interest it claimed to have lost on a 2007 investment in mortgage-backed securities.The securities were issued by SunTrust. Turnberry, which ceased business in 2008, bought them from broker Raymond James Financial Inc. In May 2013, U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald held that under FINRA rules, Turnberry was not a ""customer"" of SunTrust. The judge said Raymond James rather than SunTrust provided the hedge fund investment services and sold the securities.Turnberry on appeal argued Buchwald had defined a ""customer"" too narrowly by requiring it to directly receive goods or services from SunTrust. The 2nd Circuit on Thursday said it was ""not persuaded by Turnberry's characterization of the district court's decision.""Kevin O'Brien, a lawyer for Turnberry, said he was ""obviously disappointed"" and said the hedge fund would now arbitrate its case against Raymond James.Representatives for SunTrust and Raymond James declined comment.The case is SunTrust Banks Inc, et al, v Turnberry Capital Management LP, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-2075.

4,"   By Jonathan Stempel | July 3  July 3 SunTrust Banks Inc, a large U.S. southeast regional bank, will pay as much as $320 million to resolve a criminal probe into its mortgage unit's mismanagement of a federal program designed to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure during the recession.The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday said SunTrust Mortgage Inc misled homeowners who sought relief through the Home Affordable Modification Program about how long it would take to review their qualifications, and how they would be treated during ""trial periods.""As a result, thousands of homeowners suffered harm including damaged credit scores, excess interest payments, and an inability to pursue other options to ease financial stress, the Justice Department said.The Atlanta-based bank said it ""accepts and acknowledges responsibility"" for ""numerous"" shortfalls in administering HAMP from March 2009 through December 2010.The shortfalls included reporting as many as 75 percent of trial-period customers who were current on their mortgages as being delinquent, and once stacking backlogged, unopened HAMP applications so densely that the floor beneath them buckled. ""SunTrust's mismanagement drove up foreclosures, decimated individual credit and increased costs for hard-working men and women across our nation,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.""This resolution will provide much-needed restitution for victims,"" he continued. ""It will make available substantial funds to help other homeowners avoid foreclosure. And it will result in the kinds of systemic changes needed to ensure that this will not happen again.""SunTrust on June 17 had reached a $968 million settlement with the Justice Department over other questionable mortgage practices. In the latest accord, SunTrust will pay at least $179 million, and as much as $274 million, in restitution to harmed borrowers.It will also pay $10 million to government-controlled mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , $16 million to combat mortgage fraud and $20 million to counsel distressed homeowners. SunTrust will also boost staffing and tighten oversight.In a statement, SunTrust said it will take a $204 million pre-tax charge in the just-completed quarter for the settlement. ""There were deficiencies in our administration of HAMP during the recession,"" SunTrust's mortgage chief executive, Jerome Lienhard, said. ""Through the improvements we have made to our internal processes and this restitution plan, we are demonstrating our commitment to meet the high standards that we set for ourselves and that our customers expect.""HAMP was part of the Obama administration's effort to address the U.S. housing crisis.SunTrust Mortgage originates about $30 billion of mortgage loans a year, and its servicing portfolio totals nearly $140 billion, settlement papers show.The latest SunTrust probe was handled by the office of U.S. Attorney Timothy Heaphy in the Western District of Virginia.SunTrust shares closed up 58 cents at $40.76 on Thursday.

6,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed SunTrust Banks Inc.'s  (STI) ratings at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook remains Positive. The affirmation  and Positive Outlook reflect the company's balanced and diverse business mix,  improving asset quality, and good capital profile. Further, although STI's  earnings still lag peer averages, they reflect a generally improving trend.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDR, VR and Senior Debt STI's ratings were affirmed and the Positive Outlook maintained reflecting the  company's balanced and diverse business mix, improving asset quality, and good  capital profile. Further, although STI's earnings still lag peer averages, they  reflect a generally improving trend. STI also appears to have addressed a great  deal of legacy mortgage-related litigation risk.  STI's balanced risk profile incorporates a diverse business mix, and a good  degree of noninterest income. The risk appetite is a key rating attribute  underlying the company's outlook. The company has a balanced consumer and  commercial banking franchise, as well as a national mortgage banking franchise  and a sizable wealth and investment management business. STI has an attractive  franchise with the number one share of deposits in Georgia, and the number three  share in both Florida and Tennessee. The franchise includes many states with  favorable demographic trends in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.  Credit quality metrics continue to improve from their peak in mid- to late 2009.  Similar to others in the industry, STI has reported improvement in  non-performing assets (NPAs), net charge-offs (NCOs), non-performing loan (NPL)  inflows and delinquencies for quite some time now. Although STI's NPAs remain  elevated from historical levels, Fitch observes that the vast majority of STI's  NPAs are accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) with over 95% current, the  highest level amongst the peer group. A large percentage of these TDRs are  residential mortgage-related loans that will remain as such for the lifetime of  the loan. Lastly, there is very little credit risk in the securities portfolio.  The company's capital ratios are considered appropriate, with an estimated  Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III of 9.7% on a fully phased-in basis at June  30, 2014, just slightly below the large regional bank peer average, although  well above the 7% threshold (absent any D-SIFI buffer). STI is targeting a  capital ratio in the 8% range over the long term, which appears acceptable in  light of its balanced business profile. Other measures of capital, including  Fitch Core Capital and tangible capital, also lag peer averages, though are  still considered acceptable given the diversity in the company's business mix.  STI's earnings performance remains below large regional bank peer averages,  though it does reflect an improving trend over the past several years. The  improvement in reported earnings has come largely from lower provision expenses.  While earnings have benefitted from reserve releases, the level for STI has been  below peer averages. Fitch views STI's modest reserve release favorably given  heightened regulatory scrutiny regarding reserve releases, loan growth and NCOs  that are likely at a cyclical low and will likely increase over the near to  intermediate term.   It would also appear as though STI has now addressed a great deal of  mortgage-related risk with several settlements with the government; however,  though there is little visibility into ultimate legal risk for STI or the  industry, as the government appears to be increasing its vigor with regard to  pursuing crisis-related activities.  STI appears to have addressed repurchase  risk from the GSEs and issues emanating from FHA lending and HAMP modification  programs, though STI could still be exposed to some residual repurchase risk  from private-label securitizations or sales. Fitch has limited visibility into  legal risk for STI or the industry, although with approximately $15 billion in  CET1 under Basel III, Fitch expects any related fine or PLS repurchase risk  would be manageable in the context of capital.  STI's liquidity profile remains stable, despite an increase in the loan to  deposit ratio over the last few years. Compared with large regional peers, STI's  LTD ratio is the highest. Fitch views this somewhat negatively given less  relative reliance on deposits to fund loan growth. As the economy recovers and  loan growth returns to more normalized levels, STI may face higher relative  funding costs with this funding profile. However, Fitch notes that other  liquidity metrics, such as the amount of liquid assets and reliance on wholesale  borrowings, are roughly in line with peer averages.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDR, VR and Senior Debt Continued improvement in STI's earnings profile, combined with the maintenance  of capital at current levels, may support a rating upgrade over the next 12  months.  In addition, additional enhancements to its risk management program  along with continued refinements to the company's risk appetite may support  upward ratings momentum.  Conversely, a meaningful deterioration in asset quality may prompt negative  rating action, though this is viewed as a low likelihood. Fitch notes that loan  growth over the past 12 months has been measured at 6%. However, growth in C&I  and non-owner-occupied CRE has exceeded peer averages. STI has sought to reduce  its concentration to residential mortgage with growth in C&I and CRE. Increased  loan diversification is generally viewed favorably, but Fitch will continue to  monitor the loan growth and performance of newly originated C&I and CRE loans  for any asset deterioration after greater seasoning.  Given 30% of STI's loans are residential mortgages or home equity products,  Fitch notes STI is levered to any meaningful declines or sustained improvements  in the residential housing market. Although home prices are expected to modestly  improve on average across the country, Fitch believes home prices in certain  regions are at risk of potential declines given the recent rate of price  increases is not supported by underlying economic fundamentals in some areas. As  such, this bears monitoring for any credit rating implications if there are  meaningful declines in STI's portfolio. STI's ratings would also be sensitive to any additional charges related to  legacy mortgage lending, given Fitch's view that STI has already addressed a  great deal of legacy mortgage-related risk. An outsized charge that impairs  capital may negatively impact the company's ratings. Though as previously  stated, this is viewed as a low likelihood given the capital base.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   STI's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should STI's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for STI given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that STI may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  STI has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, STI is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  STI's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by STI and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from STI or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by STI and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in STI's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS STI's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by STI and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in STI's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has taken the following rating actions:  The following ratings are affirmed: SunTrust Banks, Inc. Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; Outlook Positive;  Short-term IDR at 'F2'; Viability Rating at 'bbb+'; Preferred stock at 'BB-'; Senior debt at 'BBB+'; Subordinated debt at 'BBB'; Short-term debt at 'F2'; Support at 5; Support Floor at 'NF'.

13,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded SunTrust Banks Inc.'s  (STI) ratings to 'A-' from 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable  from Positive. The upgrade reflects an improved earnings profile that has  converged to peer averages, good asset quality performance, and continual  enhancements to the company's balanced and diverse business mix. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs and Senior Debt SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s (STI) earnings continue to exhibit improvement, and have  since converged to large regional bank averages. STI's earnings benefit from a  solid level of non-interest income, with revenues primarily from deposit service  charges, investment banking, trading income, mortgage revenues, as well as trust  and investment management income.    While deposit costs are roughly in line with its peers, STI's loan yields are  lower than the other large regional banks, contributing to a relatively weaker  net interest margin than its peers. To address its earnings profile, one of  STI's overarching strategic objectives over the near term is to improve its  efficiency.  STI's ratings also reflect the company's balanced consumer and commercial  banking franchise, as well as a national mortgage banking franchise and a  sizable and strong middle-market focused capital markets business. Since the  financial crisis, STI has materially reduced its reliance on residential real  estate, with more diversification between consumer and commercial loans, now  comprising 45% and 55% of total loans, respectively, as of June 30, 2015. STI has an attractive retail franchise with the number one share of deposits in  Georgia, and the number three share in both Florida and Tennessee. The franchise  includes many states with favorable demographic trends in the Southeast and  Mid-Atlantic.  STI reported continued asset quality improvement in 2Q'15, with still very low  balances of net charge-offs (NCOs) and continuing improvement in nonaccrual  balances. STI's view of through-the-cycle loan losses is between 40 basis points  (bps) and 70bps. With NCOs in 2Q'15 at just 26bps, Fitch expects some credit  deterioration for STI, as well as the industry, as credit losses are likely at  unsustainably low levels. STI's level of non-performing assets (NPAs) remains somewhat elevated; however,  this includes a large balance of mortgage-related troubled debt restructurings  (TDRs). However, 97% of these accruing TDRs are current, mitigating the credit  risk in the pool of modified loans. Excluding the accruing TDRs from problem  asset totals, STI's ratio of NPAs to total loans and foreclosed real estate  falls to the second lowest of the large regional banking peer group. STI's securities portfolio continues to present nominal credit risk with  approximately 96% of its holdings related to either agency mortgage-backed  securities or U.S. Treasuries/agency debt, one of the highest levels among the  large regional banks. STI estimates its fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III was  9.8% as of June 30, 2015. This is somewhat below the peer average, though still  high in absolute terms, and well above the requirement of 7%. STI received no  objection to its capital plan this year, and quantitatively, performed well  relative to other large regional peers. Its level of capital erosion under  DFAST, or the starting Tier 1 common ratio less the minimum ratio under the  severely adverse scenario tied for the third best of the large regional peers  group. STI's internal results were very similar to regulatory results as well.  STI did similarly well during last year's CCAR test. STI's liquidity profile remains stable. Compared with large regional peers,  STI's loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio is on the higher end, although other liquidity  metrics, percentage of liquid assets, and wholesale funding, are better. STI  disclosed that its LCR continues to exceed the Jan. 1, 2016 requirement of 90%.  STI has access to diversified sources of funding, including deposits, FHLB  advances, and access to the capital markets. In addition, STI completed its  first indirect automobile securitization in eight years in 2Q15, taking around  $1 billion of relatively low returning assets off the balance sheet. STI has  also sold government guaranteed student loans in the past. Fitch views STI's  funding profile as solid, which is reflected in the company's newly upgraded  credit rating.     SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES STI's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a-' for loss  severity. STI's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while its trust preferred  securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two times for  non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments' non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been upgraded due to the upgrade of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of SunTrust Bank are rated one notch higher than  STI's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  STI's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also equalized reflecting the  very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary failure and  default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR STI has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, STI is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs and Senior Unsecured Debt At STI's new rating level, Fitch envisions little near-term upward ratings  momentum. Fitch's rating action expects further improvement in reported earnings  measures over the medium term. The upgrade also assumes that capital will be  deployed gradually over the near term. If capital is maintained at appropriate  levels, asset quality remains good, and STI's earnings performance consistently  improves to levels above the peer average, there could be further upside to  STI's ratings.  Conversely, a meaningful deterioration in capital or asset quality may prompt  negative rating action, though Fitch expects some level of mean reversion in  loan losses, as well as a reduction in capital ratios over time.  Long-term  capital targets are expected to remain between 8% and 9.5% for the large  regional bank peer group. For those banks whose long-term capital targets fall  to the lower end of that range, Fitch expects they will also have superior  earnings profiles that provide for adequate capital generation capabilities.  Absent that, there could be negative rating actions.  While not anticipated, greater reliance on more volatile capital markets  revenues may be a constraint to further upside in the company's ratings. On  average, investment banking and trading income accounts for around 8% of  revenues. A sustained reliance of greater than 20% to 25% may constrain further  upside ratings momentum.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for STI and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to STI's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to STI's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should STI's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely, though, for STI given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  SUPPORT AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since STI's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS The rating actions are as follows:  SunTrust Banks, Inc. --Long-term IDR upgraded to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable;  --Short-term IDR upgraded to 'F1' from 'F2'; --Viability Rating upgraded to 'a-' from 'bbb+'; --Preferred stock upgraded to 'BB' from 'BB-'; --Senior debt upgraded to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --Subordinated debt upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; --Short-term debt upgraded to 'F1' from 'F2'; --Support affirmed at 5; --Support Floor affirmed at 'NF'.

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed SunTrust Banks Inc.'s.  (STI) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The affirmation reflects  an improved earnings profile, good asset quality performance, and continual  enhancements to the company's balanced and diverse business mix.   The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  VR, IDRs and Senior Unsecured Debt SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s (STI) earnings continue to exhibit improvement, and have  since converged to large regional bank averages. Over the past 12 months, STI  has reported an ROA of 1.02%, in line with peer medians, and an improvement from  the prior 12 months. One of STI's overarching strategic objectives over the  near-term is to improve its efficiency, which has also demonstrated improvement  over the past 12 months. STI's earnings benefit from a solid level of  non-interest income, with revenues from deposit service charges, investment  banking, trading income, mortgage revenues, as well as trust and investment  management income.  STI's ratings also reflect the company's balanced consumer and commercial  banking franchise, as well as a national mortgage banking franchise and a  sizable and strong middle-market-focused capital markets business. Since the  financial crisis, STI has materially reduced its reliance on residential real  estate, with more diversification between consumer and commercial loans, now  comprising 45% and 55% of total loans, respectively, as of June 30, 2016. STI has an attractive retail franchise with the No.1 share of deposits in  Georgia, and the No.3 share in both Florida and Tennessee. The franchise  includes many states with favorable demographic trends in the Southeast and  Mid-Atlantic. STI has the second highest percentage of its deposits in states  where its market share is ranked either first, second or third.  The company's good asset quality performance also supports its ratings. While  STI's level of NPAs remains somewhat elevated, this includes a large balance of  mortgage-related troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), of which, 97% of these  accruing TDRs are current, mitigating the associated credit risk. Excluding the  accruing TDRs from problem asset totals, STI's ratio of adjusted NPAs to total  loans and foreclosed real estate falls to the third lowest of the large regional  peer group. With NCOs in second quarter 2016 (2Q16) at 39bps, Fitch expects some  credit deterioration for STI, as well as the industry, as credit losses are  likely at unsustainably low levels. STI's securities portfolio continues to present nominal credit risk with  approximately 97% of its holdings related to either agency mortgage-backed  securities or U.S. Treasuries/agency debt, one of the highest levels among the  large regional banks. Further, STI's energy book appears to have less risk than  peers given the least exposure to the E&P and oilfield services sectors.  STI's transitional Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III was 9.8% at June  30, 2016. This is around 100bps below the peer median, though well above the  requirement of 7%.  The bank's ratio of Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted  assets is also below peer medians.  Despite this, Fitch views STI's capital  ratios as appropriate for its risk profile. Further, Fitch notes that STI once  again performed well under the regulatory stress tests, and received no  objection to its capital plan this year. Fitch also notes that STI has reported  good capital generation over the past 12 months, and its coverage of capital and  reserves to stress test losses is on the higher end of the peer group.  STI's liquidity profile remains stable. Compared with large regional peers,  STI's loan to deposit LTD) ratio is on the higher end, although other liquidity  metrics, percentage of liquid assets and wholesale funding, are better or at the  peer median. STI disclosed that its LCR continues to exceed the Jan. 1, 2016  requirement of 90%.  STI has access to diversified sources of funding, including deposits, FHLB  advances, and access to the capital markets. In addition, STI completed its  first indirect automobile securitization in eight years in 2Q15, taking around  $1bn of relatively low returning assets off the balance sheet. STI has also sold  government guaranteed student loans in the past.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES STI's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a-' for loss  severity. STI's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while STI's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been upgraded due to the upgrade of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of SunTrust Bank are rated one notch higher than  STI's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  STI's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank, reflecting its role as  the bank holding company which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of  strength for its bank subsidiaries.

SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR STI has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, STI is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch envisions limited near-term upward ratings momentum for STI at current  levels. The company's ratings incorporate expectations of gradual improvement in  earnings over time, especially under a higher rate environment, and that capital  will be deployed over time. If capital is maintained at appropriate levels,  asset quality remains good, and STI's earnings performance consistently improves  to levels above the peer average, there could be further upside to STI's  ratings, though this would likely only occur over the medium- to long-term.  Fitch anticipates that if there were any upwards rating potential, it would  likely be capped to a one-notch upgrade.  Conversely, a material deterioration in capital or asset quality may prompt  negative rating action, though Fitch expects some level of mean reversion in  loan losses, as well as a reduction in capital ratios over time.  Long-term  capital targets are expected to remain between 8% and 9.5% for the large  regional bank peer group. For those banks whose long-term capital targets fall  to the lower end of that range, Fitch expects they will also have a superior  earnings profile that provides for adequate capital generation capabilities.  Absent that, there could be negative rating actions.  While not anticipated, greater reliance on more volatile capital markets  revenues may be a constraint to further upside in the company's ratings. On  average, STI's investment banking and trading income accounts for around 7% of  revenues. A sustained reliance of greater than 20% to 25% or being on a  trajectory to doing so may constrain further upside ratings momentum.  Fitch views STI as one of the few large regional banks that is in the position  to do bank-level M&A.  STI has not completed a significant bank acquisition  since 2004. Fitch would evaluate any transaction on its individual merits. As  such, rating implications are dependent on the financial implication, strategic  rationale, and execution risks inherent in any transaction.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for STI and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to STI's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to STI's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should STI's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely for STI, though, given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  SUPPORT AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since STI's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.
